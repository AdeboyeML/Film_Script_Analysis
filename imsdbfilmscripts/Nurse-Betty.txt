                                                         Shooting Script (FINAL)
                                                         3/9/99








                                                                FADE IN:


      1     INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY                                1

            A tense surgery in progress.  Meters flicker, instruments
            flash in the bright overhead light.  In the midst of it all
            stands DR. DAVID RAVELL, 35.  The master of his domain.
            Ravell leans forward so a NURSE can mop the sweat from his
            brow as he completes a last, delicate procedure.  His co
            workers sigh collectively with relief.

                                DAVID
                          (to Asst. Surgeon)
                      Close her up, will you?



      2     INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY                             2

            Dr. Ravell comes out of surgery, clearly exhausted.  Without
            his surgical mask he is ruggedly handsome.  TWO NURSES
            follow, attending him like a fighter fresh from the ring:
            CHLOE, 25, Raven-haired and striking, and JASMINE, 24, an
            exotic mix of African-American and Asian.

            BLAKE DANIELS, 58, the silver-haired Chief Surgeon, rushes up
            the corridor.  On his heels is DR. LONNIE WALSH, 33. Lonnie
            is also conspicuously handsome, but he'll always be second to
            David.  In everything.
            The look on Blake's face stops David in his tracks.

                                BLAKE
                      There's been a train crash near Santa
                      Barbara. They're flying an aortal trauma
                      here now.  How can I ask you this,
                      David...

            David rubs his eyes.  Thinks about it.

                                DAVID
                      I can do it, Blake.

            His bravery isn't lost on the two nurses, although Chloe
            exchanges a quick, covert glance with Lonnie.

                                CHLOE
                      Is he crazy, Jasmine?   He's been on his
                      feet for fourteen hours.

                                JASMINE
                      Chloe, it's been this way since Leslie
                      died.  Losing himself in his work, poor
                      thing...

                                                                    2.


                                YOUNGER MAN'S
                                VOICE
                          (O.S.)
                      ... I'll give you something to lose
                      yourself in...

                                OLDER MAN'S VOICE
                          (O.S.)
                      Excuse me, miss?

            PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WE ARE LOOKING AT A TELEVISION SCREEN
            BEHIND THE COUNTER OF A SMALL-TOWN DINER.

            INSERT:            FAIR OAKS, KANSAS



      3     INT. TIP TOP DINER - DAY                                 3

            Quaint, Midwestern eatery.  Knick-knacks and photos abound.
            The booths and counter are packed with LOCALS.  A family
            dining section off in one corner.

            TWO GUYS sitting at the counter in team jackets.  The older
            of the two holds up his empty coffee cup.  But his WAITRESS,
            standing a couple seats down from him, doesn't move. She's
            completely absorbed in watching the soap opera that plays on
            two battered, fuzzy TV sets.
            BETTY SIZEMORE, 30, has a wholesome attractiveness that
            competes with a bit too much makeup and a cheesy white
            waitress uniform. TWO OTHER WAITRESSES attend to customers
            behind her.
            The younger of the two guys is involved in the soap opera.
            But the older one, still wants coffee.  He gestures toward
            Betty.

                                OLDER MAN
                      Miss?

            Betty leans forward, grabs the coffee pot and moves in front
            of him.  Without taking her eyes from the TV, she pours the
            java, which somehow lands in his cup without spilling a drop.

                                OLDER MAN
                                (cont'd)
                      Very impressive.  That is very...
                          (turning to others)
                      Did anybody see that?

            The LOCAL GUYS around him don't even bother to look up. Of
            course, they've seen it before.  Betty smiles.

                                                                    3.


                                OLDER MAN
                                (cont'd)
                      Thank you.  Could I bother you for a
                      little more...?

            Before he can even finish, Betty is topping him off with
            milk.

                                BETTY
                      Skim, right?
                          (tears open an Equal)
                      And half a pack, if I remember correct...

            The older gentleman's mouth works a bit but nothing comes
            out.  He is flabbergasted by her attention to detail.  She
            looks at the younger man, who is still following the show and
            gobbling down a huge bacon burger.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      You know, you're never too young to start
                      on a lean meat substitute...
                          (BEAT)
                      You wanna try some turkey bacon on that?

                                YOUNGER MAN
                      You want a tip when I'm through?

                                BETTY
                      It's your body...

            Betty turns back to change pots.  The older man watches her
            intently as the younger of the two mumbles to himself.

                                YOUNGER MAN
                          (to himself)
                      That's right, so why don't you get up off
                      it...

                                OLDER MAN
                      Wesley...
                          (to Betty)
                      I've told him the same thing.  Thanks for
                      the suggestion.

                                BETTY
                      No problem.

            Betty flashes the men a winning smile and moves off, one eye
            always on the TV as she approaches two local types.

            SHERIFF ELDEN BALLARD, 32, a short, tightly wound little man,
            sitting at his own booth.  Ballard is spit and polish all the
            way:  creases in his shirt, a glossy shine on his shoes.
            Badge proudly displayed.  He sits with

                                                                    4.


            ROY OSTREY, 31, a gangly, bookish local reporter.  Betty
            drops five ketchup packets and four mayonnaise packets on the
            table for him.  Another smile.

                                ROY
                      Hi, Betty.  You're looking good...

                                BETTY
                      Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar,
                      but sweet.  I liked your editorial this
                      morning...

                                ROY
                      Oh, appreciate it.  I was trying to, ahh,
                      give a sense of history to...

                                BALLARD
                          (interrupting)
                      Yeah, it was great.  Really put the whole
                      idea of "church bake sales" in
                      perspective...

                                ROY
                      You know, Elden, some people actually
                      read more than just the Classifieds...

                                BALLARD
                      Why don't you go back to doing something
                      you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts
                      column?
                          (chuckles to himself)
                      I'll take a refill there, Betty...

            His cup is full before he can even finish the sentence.

                                BETTY
                      Hey, Sheriff.  How's everything?

                                BALLARD
                      Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the
                      world safe.

                                BETTY
                      ... I meant your food.

                                BALLARD
                      Oh, right... 's fine.  Thanks.

                                ROY
                      I thought you said the eggs weren't...

                                BALLARD
                      It's fine.  Mind your own meal...

                                                                    5.


                                ROY
                      You should get the order you want.

                                BALLARD
                      And you should keep your nose out of
                      another man's omelette...
                          (to Betty)
                      It's no big deal, Betty.

                                BETTY
                      There's yolks in there, huh?  It's no
                      prob'... gotta keep you on track.

            Betty grabs Ballard's plate without another word, gives him a
            reassuring rub on the shoulders and moves off.  He smiles
            appreciatively after her, then turns on Roy.

                                BALLARD
                      Why you always gotta embarrass me?  I
                      been eating lunch with you since grade
                      school and you always gotta embarrass me!

                                ROY
                      They're just eggs, Elden, how
                      embarrassing can eggs be?

                                BALLARD
                      ... plenty

                                ROY
                      Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?

                                BALLARD
                      Mind your own business.  You just said
                      that shit so you could look at her a
                      little longer, anyway...

            Still carrying Ballard's plate, she returns to the counter.

                                BETTY
                      Come on, guys, I told you it's egg whites
                      only for the Sheriff...
                          (quietly)
                      ... I put him in that 'zone' thing.

                                COOK #1
                      Well, it better be a pretty good size
                      zone if he's in it...

            Betty and the cooks share a quick laugh.  They move to change
            his order while Betty glances up at the TV.

                                                                    6.




      4     INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - RETURN TO TV SCREEN             4

            Lonnie catches up to Blake in the corridor.

                                LONNIE
                      Blake, I can handle that transplant!

                                BLAKE
                      We need someone with the right kind of
                      experience, Lonnie.

                                LONNIE
                      Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?

                                BLAKE
                      Lonnie, it's a complex procedure.  Why
                      don't you observe?

                                LONNIE
                      I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh
                      out of medical school, Blake.

                                BLAKE
                      No, you're not.  You're a good doctor,
                      Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell.
                      I've made my decision.  Now, if you'll
                      excuse me ...

            Blake exits.  The camera moves in to hold on a CLOSEUP of
            Lonnie's face as he simmers in anger.  Music soars.



      5     INT. TIP TOP DINER - DAY                                 5

            Plates of food are piling up on the shelf in front of the
            COOKS.  One of them turns the TV off by remote.

                                BETTY
                      Hey!  We were watching that!

                                COOK #1
                      The other girls've got orders up... we're
                      not one 'a them goddamn Nelson families,
                      y'know.

            Betty snatches up several plates to help out.  Ballard's food
            appears with A CLATTER of porcelain.

                                BETTY
                      It's "Nielson"...

                                COOK #1
                      Yeah, well, we ain't one 'a them,
                      neither.

                                                                    7.

                          (BEAT)
                      Go on now...

                                DARLENE
                      When you gonna get those things fixed,
                      anyhow?

                                COOK #1
                      When you all quit watching 'em for a
                      living...

            Frustrated, Betty delivers several plates and drops them at
            tables where the people know her by name.  She moves off
            toward FOUR LOCAL GUYS in a booth jangling their empty cups.
            Betty weaves her way over to them and pours refills.  When a
            hand strays around to touch her ass, she pushes it away with
            her foot and keeps right on pouring. Absently, Betty takes a
            look around the restaurant.  The other waitresses are gone
            and no one is behind the grill.  Alarmed, she pushes through
            the double doors into the kitchen.



      6     INT. TIP TOP DINER - KITCHEN - SAME TIME                 6

            THREE WAITRESSES, along with the DISHWASHER and TWO COOKS are
            standing in a row waiting for her.

                                BETTY
                      ... alright, I get it, no more TV.
                      Sorry.

            No one moves, then DARLENE leads them in a huge SURPRISE!
            They produce a life-size cardboard cut-out of Dr. David
            Ravell, who looks dashing in his green hospital scrubs.
            Betty backs up in disbelief.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      Oh my gosh, this is so embarrassing!
                      Where did you ever find this?

                                DARLENE
                      On the goddamn internet, where else?

                                BETTY
                      You're joking...

                                WAITRESS #1
                      ... nope, got him at "T.V. Hunks with
                      Sweet Little Asses.Com."

                                WAITRESS #2
                      Seventy-five dollars...

                                COOK #1
                      ... Seventy-eight fifty.
                          (everyone looks at him)

                                                                    8.

                      Well, I paid for the damn thing, I oughta
                      know.

                                WAITRESS #2
                      C'mon, Betty!  Pose with him!

            Betty laughs and puts her arm around the cardboard man.  A
            flash photo is taken.  A cupcake with a single candle is
            placed in her hands.

                                DARLENE
                      One candle... uh-oh, you're getting up
                      there!  Doesn't David like 'em young?

                                BETTY
                      I'm over the hill, what can I say?

            Darlene gives Betty an envelope with cash showing.

                                WAITRESS #1
                      A little something for those nursing
                      classes you've been wanting to take...

                                DARLENE
                      ... but keep putting off thanks to a
                      certain husband we won't mention...

                                BETTY
                      Oh, guys, you didn't have to do that!

                                DARLENE
                      So how you gonna celebrate?  Del takin'
                      you into Wichita for a big fancy dinner?

            The others laugh; they know better.  So does Betty.

                                BETTY
                      Yeah, Dairy Queen, maybe...  Oh, I should
                      probably call him.  Thanks, you guys...

                                COOK #1
                      Alright, alright, come on... I'm not
                      running no bed & breakfast, we got
                      customers.  Let's go...

            Smiling, Betty grabs a wall phone as the others mingle about.



      7     INT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - DEL'S OFFICE - DAY                7

            The trailer/office of a small-time car dealership. As the
            PHONE RINGS, the CAMERA PANS across pictures of DEL SIZEMORE,
            35, dressed as Napoleon, Caesar and Abe Lincoln, arms raised
            in a high-energy sales pitch.

                                                                    9.


            The PHONE RINGS again.  We see a framed certificate of
            achievement from General Motors, dated 1986.

            After the THIRD RING an ANSWERING MACHINE clicks on. It's
            loud.

                                ANSWERING MACHINE
                          (Del's voice)
                      Hello there!  You've reached Sizemore
                      Motors, home of the best selection of
                      used General Motors cars in the Big
                      Springs - Fair Oaks area.  We can't come
                      to the phone right now 'cause we're out
                      making a sale, so leave us a message;
                      better yet, come on down and steal one 'a
                      these beauties right out from under us!
                      Coffee's always on!

                                BETTY  (V.O.)
                      Hi Del, it's me.  I guess you're busy.



      8     INT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - TRAILER/OFFICE - DAY              8

            Del's very busy.  He's on the rented sofa in the trailer's
            lounge, screwing his secretary, JOYCE.  But as he rocks the
            couch, he's listening to Betty's message.

                                BETTY  (V.O.)
                      I know you want the Oldsmobile back
                      tonight, so... I was wondering if I could
                      take one of the new Buicks.

            Del pulls out and lurches across the room.  He reaches for
            the desk phone but misses, spilling down onto the carpet.  He
            gathers himself and his pants up in disgust, pawing around
            the desktop until he finds the phone.

                                BETTY  (V.O.)
                                (CONT'D)
                      So, call me when you--

                                DEL
                      Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Hang on a second
                      there, baby.  Why do you need one of the
                      new Buicks?

                                BETTY  (V.O.)
                      Oh, you're there.  You sound out of
                      breath.

                                DEL
                      I ran back in to get the phone.

                                                                   10.


            The answering machine is on, so their VOICES are BOOMING. The
            phone cord is stretched across the trailer as he tries to get
            back to Joyce.  He motions for her to join him but she
            remains where she is, fuming.

                                BETTY  (V.O.)
                      I don't need one, but it's kind of a
                      special night, and--

                                DEL
                      What's so special about it?

            LONG PAUSE. Joyce looks at Del, incredulous. Then pissed off.
            He signals to hold on.

                                BETTY  (V.O.)
                      Sue Ann's taking me out and I thought it
                      might be fun to go in a nice car...

            Joyce wriggles to a sitting position and begins to pull up
            her panties.  Del shoots her a look that says 'I'm not
            finished yet!'  They pantomime frantically back and forth
            until Joyce throws him the finger and SLAMS out the door.

                                BETTY (V.O)
                                (CONT'D)
                      What was that?

                                DEL
                      Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here.  Look,
                      you don't need a LeSabre to go out with
                      Sue Ann.  Take the blue Corsica.  I'll
                      see you when I get home.

            He throws the phone onto the cradle, then bangs on a window
            to get Joyce's attention as she fires up a smoke.

                                DEL (CONT'D)
                          (through the pane)
                      Shit!  Joyce, open the damn gate, will
                      you?!

            As Del zips up his pants Joyce trudges across the lot to
            bring in the "Closed For Lunch" sign and open the gate.  Del
            silently studies the much nicer car lot next door for a
            moment.  He takes in the banners, the signs, etc.

                                DEL (cont'd)
                      ... that's what we need, some goddamn
                      flags.

                                                                   11.




      9     INT. OFFICE/TRAILER - LATER                              9

            Betty enters the office.  Joyce is on the phone.  She looks
            up, irritated, and says something under her breath to the
            caller.

                                JOYCE
                      Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet...
                      well, once he dumps her we will.
                          (to Betty)
                      He's out pricing banners... I don't
                      expect him back.

                                BETTY
                      "Banners?"

                                JOYCE
                      You know, flags and shit... he said "for
                      a livelier look" or something.

            Betty nods and swaps her car keys for a set Joyce gives her.

                                JOYCE (cont'd)
                      'S too bad about the LeSabres... they're
                      a really sweet ride.

            As Joyce prattles on, Betty notices the Buick LeSabre keys on
            a rack behind her.  She sidles around Joyce, deftly removes a
            set from the hook and drops them in her purse.  She smiles
            and starts to wave goodbye as Joyce puts her call on hold.

                                JOYCE (cont'd)
                      Need something else?

                                BETTY
                      No, I was just... How you doing?

                                JOYCE
                      Great.  Good.  Content...

                                BETTY
                      Oh.  How come?

                                JOYCE
                      I dunno.  Job satisfaction, I guess...
                          (BEAT)
                      How's things at the Tip Top?

                                BETTY
                      They're fine... you miss it?

                                JOYCE
                      You must be joking.

                                                                   12.


                                BETTY
                      Hmm.
                          (BEAT)
                      So, Del get that car he sold you up and
                      running yet?

                                JOYCE
                      Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running,
                      alright...

                                BETTY
                      'Kay, good.  Bye, then...

                                JOYCE
                      Uh-huh.
                          (back to phone)
                      Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I
                      just fucking love pastels.

            She whispers, then laughs loudly as Betty leaves.



     10     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - DAY                              10

            The cardboard doctor is standing next to Betty's Olds.  She
            thinks about leaving him, but picks him up and tosses him
            into a blue Corsica.  He lands with his face against the
            passenger window.

            She stands for a moment by the Corsica, dangling the LeSabre
            keys before her eyes.  Suddenly, she jumps inside the
            Chevrolet and slams the door.



     11     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS/TRAILER PARK - DAY                 11

            The blue Corsica leaves the parking lot and pulls onto the
            street.  The car makes an abrupt turn into a trailer park
            directly behind the car lot and glides to a halt behind a row
            of battered airstreams.

            Betty gets outs of the Chevy and looks back:  the handsome
            face of Doctor David Ravell is staring at her from the car.

                                BETTY
                      Oh, Christ, what am I gonna do with you?

            She goes back to pick him up, then starts off.



     12     EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME TIME                           12

            A row of cheap trailers on both sides of a crumbling
            driveway.  Betty appears with her cardboard man tucked under
            one arm and then disappears behind a pickup truck.

                                                                   13.




     13     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - SAME TIME                        13

            She tosses the cardboard "David" over a concrete slab wall,
            climbs over herself and walks straight to the LeSabres.  Her
            key opens the last one - maroon. She puts the doctor on the
            passenger seat, gets in the car and inhales the new car
            smell.

            Joyce can be seen inside the trailer, still talking on the
            phone.  She misses the whole scene as she works on her nails.

                                BETTY
                      We deserve this.



     14     INT. LESABRE - DRIVING - DAY                            14

            Betty has the car at 75 m.p.h., on the rural Kansas roads,
            wheat fields for miles on both sides of her.  The RADIO is
            blasting Bonnie Raitt and she's singing along.

            She sees her speed and punches the accelerator ... 80 m.p.h.
            ... 85 ... 90 m.p.h.  She turns the radio up louder.

            When she approaches a sign saying "You are leaving Kansas"
            Betty suddenly becomes self-conscious.  She eases up on the
            gas ... slows down ... does a U-turn and heads back toward
            Fair Oaks.  She glances wistfully in her rear view mirror at
            the billboard that quickly fades into the distance.



     15     EXT. BETTY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER                       15

            Betty enters a modest residential neighborhood and pulls into
            a driveway.  She parks in a detached garage and looks over at
            the cardboard David.  There's no way he's going in the house.
            She puts him in the trunk and closes the garage door.



     16     EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                        16

            She walks several houses down.  On her way to the door we
            hear a DOG BARKING, CHILDREN and GENERAL COMMOTION from
            inside.  SUE ANN ROGERS answers Betty's knock.  Her hair is
            matted with sweat as she struggles with CHILDREN, ages 4, 3
            and 6 months.  Suddenly, Sue Ann is hit by an errant rubber
            ball.

                                SUE ANN
                      Hey, darling... oww!  Sorry, got my own
                      little Gulf War going on here.

            Betty takes the baby as Sue Ann pulls a videotape from a
            shelf.  It's all one move; they do this every day.

                                                                   14.


                                BETTY
                      Did you watch it yet?

                                SUE ANN
                      Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was
                      any better looking it'd be a crime 'a
                      some sort...

                                BETTY
                      Yep.  Hey, I got a surprise for tonight.
                      We're going to the Starlite in style!

                                SUE ANN
                      Oh, Betty--

                                BETTY
                      I'll give you a hint.  If you scrunch up
                      your eyes a bit it looks just like a
                      Jaguar...

                                SUE ANN
                      Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call
                      you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge
                      meeting. There's no way I can get a
                      sitter this fast.

                                BETTY
                          (disappointed)
                      No... what about your sister?

                                SUE ANN
                      I can't ask her again-- Nathan, stop it!
                      Jesse, don't take that, hit back!-- I
                      feel terrible, hon.

            After a beat ...

                                BETTY
                      It's all right.

                                SUE ANN
                      You sure?  Maybe next week we could...

                                BETTY
                      Uh-huh.  No, we'll do it later.  'S only
                      a birthday, right?  I'll have another one
                      next year...

            Betty forces a smile, kisses the baby and hands it back to
            Sue Ann, who hands her the videotape.

                                SUE ANN
                      Aahhh...
                          (BEAT)
                      So what color is it?

                                                                   15.


                                BETTY
                      What?

                                SUE ANN
                      The LeSabre!

                                BETTY
                      Maroon.
                          (BEAT)
                      I stole it.

                                SUE ANN
                      What?

                                BETTY
                      He wasn't going to let us use it, so I
                      just took it.

                                SUE ANN
                      Oh, I wish we could just get in it and
                      drive, and drive, and drive!

                                BETTY
                      Yeah, me too.

                                SUE ANN
                      Sorry, hon.  Happy Birthday...

                                BETTY
                      I gotta go make dinner.

            Betty throws her a look as Sue Ann closes the door.  Betty
            turns around, frustrated.  She starts yanking her apron off
            as she crosses the street.



     17     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DAY                                17

            A low-end ranch.  A worn-out sofa and loveseat form an 'L'
            that dominates the living room.  Romance novels line a small
            bookcase.  SIX CANARIES in cages chatter away in the kitchen.

            Del sits at the dining room table, agitated.  He is presently
            attacking a pork chop, baked beans and a loaf of Wonderbread.
            All we hear is A FORK CLICKING and BIRDS CHIRPING.  Betty
            stands at the breakfast counter, barefoot, still in her
            uniform and quietly eating a salad.

                                BETTY
                      Sure you don't want any salad?

                                DEL
                      No, I do not want any goddamn... what was
                      all that shit on the phone about the new
                      Buicks?

                                                                   16.


                                BETTY
                      I told you.  Sue Ann was gonna take me
                      out tonight, but...

                                DEL
                      She's not comfortable in a Corsica?  'S
                      got air and leather...

                                BETTY
                      I took the blue Corsica, Del.  Relax.

                                DEL
                      All right, then.  Actually, I'm glad
                      you're going out.  I got something going
                      on tonight.  Some serious clients, with
                      real potential.

            Del BELCHES, smiles, then CLUCKS at the birds nearby.

                                BETTY
                      ... like the water purifiers?

                                DEL
                      What?

                                BETTY
                      Or the vitamins?  Or the...?

            Del almost comes out of his chair, pointing his finger at
            her.

                                DEL
                      Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they
                      changed the law, and you know it!
                          (BEAT)
                      Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some
                      dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress,
                      what do you got?

                                BETTY
                      I got you, Del...

                                DEL
                      ... well, then you ain't got much.

                                BETTY
                      Oh, I know.
                          (BEAT)
                      So, who're these clients?

                                DEL
                      Couple 'a guys in from outta town.  They
                      want to see the new LeSabres.

            Betty hides her reaction.

                                                                   17.


                                DEL (cont'd)
                      And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around
                      to fuck it up...

                                BETTY
                      Just knock it off, 'kay?  Anyhow, they're
                      97's, they're not even new.

                                DEL
                      They're new to us...

            Truce for a moment.  Del plucks a copy of Soap Opera Guide
            from Betty's purse while absently taking a bite from Betty's
            cupcake.  He narrowly misses the candle.

                                DEL (cont'd)
                      Jesus... you know these actors are mainly
                      models, which are mainly fags.  They've
                      done studies.  The rest're assholes.  But
                      you know what bugs me most about these
                      soaps?

            She silently mimics him as he says...

                                DEL (cont'd)
                      It's people with no lives watching other
                      people's fake lives.

                                BETTY
                      Yeah, I guess there's nothing like
                      watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?

                                DEL
                      That is a skill!

            Del lurches to his feet and crosses to the bird cages as the
            canaries CHIRP and SING EXCITEDLY at his approach.

                                DEL (cont'd)
                      Daddy's here, babies... daddy's here.
                          (to Betty)
                      Be back later... clean up.

            He exits.  She collects his dirty dishes, puts them in the
            sink and starts to wash them.  Then she stops.

                                BETTY
                      What the hell am I doing?

            She drops the dishes with a clatter, pours herself a glass of
            wine, lights the candle on her deflowered cupcake and opens
            the one card on the table.

            CLOSE ON

                                                                   18.


            a traditional greeting from her grandparents.  Red hearts and
            lace.  A color photo of them enclosed.

            Betty smiles at this.  After moment, she quietly sings a
            quick refrain of "Happy Birthday" to herself.



     18     INT. LONNIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)          18

            Standing wrapped only in a towel, Lonnie speaks into the
            phone.

                                LONNIE
                      Tell me something good, Sugar.



     19     INT. CHLOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)           19

            The beautiful nurse Chloe is curled up seductively on her
            sofa with her phone in one hand and a cigarette in the other.

                                CHLOE
                      We're all set.  I told him my car's in
                      the shop.  He said he'd be happy to give
                      me a ride home.

                                LONNIE
                          (V.O.)
                      You're beautiful.

                                CHLOE
                      Tell me something I don't know...

            Betty hits FAST FORWARD.  Characters flit on and off the
            screen at top speed until David Ravell appears.



     20     INT. WOODED ROADSIDE - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)             20

            Chloe's magnificent legs are folded into the seat of David's
            560 SL.  She struggles with her seatbelt, so he helps her.
            She makes sure their hands touch.

                                CHLOE
                      Thanks for pulling over, David... I can't
                      go that fast without taking a breather.

                                DAVID
                      Sorry... it's nice to see what this
                      little beauty can do, though.  I guess,
                      somehow, all that speed helps me forget
                      the past...

                                                                   19.


                                CHLOE
                      I'm sure it does...
                          (touching the seats)
                      Mmm, leather.  How far do they recline?

            David smiles, a little uncomfortable.

                                CHLOE (cont'd)
                      Listen, David, I know I've said it
                      before, but I want to tell you again how
                      sorry I am about your wife.
                          (BEAT)
                      It must make you scared to get close to
                      someone again.

            She puts her hand over his on the gear shift.  A moment.
            Finally, he has to move her fingers to start the car.

                                CHLOE (cont'd)
                      Let's not go... not yet.

            BETTY sits on an old couch in the den and watches, eyes glued
            to the screen.  Suddenly, she hears the sound of TIRES ON
            GRAVEL.  HEADLIGHTS sweep across the window.

                                BETTY
                      Damn!

            She hits PAUSE and crosses to look out.



     21     EXT. BETTY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                              21

            Del gets out of a black Lincoln Town Car, followed by CHARLIE
            and WESLEY - the guys in the team jackets from the diner.
            Charlie is 63 years old.  He wears a dress shirt, slacks and
            docksiders.  The suburban father look.

            Wesley is 28. He's in jeans, T-shirt and white Reeboks. Clean
            cut; the kid who used to mow your parents' lawn.

            Betty quickly snaps out the light and closes the door until
            it is open only a crack.



     22     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                              22

            Del swaggers into the house.  The two men follow politely.

                                DEL
                      ... you can have the best damn running
                      backs in the world, somebody's still
                      gotta block for 'em.

                                                                   20.


                                CHARLIE
                      You're a hundred percent right.  They
                      rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...

            Del stops and looks around, deflated by the mess.

            The den is only a short flight of steps from the living room
            and the kitchen.  Betty has a clean view of both from where
            she sits on the couch.



     23     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT                        23

            She hears Del come in, but doesn't take her eyes off the TV
            screen.

                                DEL  (O.S.)
                      My apologies, gentlemen.  I asked my wife
                      to straighten this shit up before she
                      went out.



    23A     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT               23A

            Del crosses to an old stereo and puts on an LP.  He smiles as
            the music overtakes the room.  Charlie and Wesley stand
            nearby, appreciating the quaintness of the surroundings.

                                DEL
                      Now, what can I get you gentlemen to
                      drink?

            Del crosses to the cupboard.  Charlie and Wesley stand
            leisurely in the living room.

                                CHARLIE
                      Bourbon, little water, thank you.

                                WESLEY
                      Beer, please.

                                DEL
                      You got it.

            Wesley looks at a wedding portrait of Del and Betty.

                                WESLEY
                      Hey... you got a fine one right here!

                                CHARLIE
                      Wesley...
                          (to Del)
                      Your wife's a very lovely woman.  Have I
                      seen her before?

                                                                   21.


                                DEL
                      If you ate at the Tip Top you did.

                                CHARLIE
                      Oh, yes, with the coffee...

                                DEL
                      Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.

            Del reaches into the fridge and produces a Miller for Wesley,
            then mixes two drinks and walks into the dining room and
            Charlie and Wesley follow to the table and sit down.

                                CHARLIE
                      I like this.  I like doing business in
                      the home. It's cozy...
                          (noticing the card and cupcake)
                      Who's birthday?

                                DEL
                      Ahh... my wife's.

                                WESLEY
                      What'd you get her?

                                DEL
                      Huh?  Oh, umm, a car.
                          (BEAT)
                      So, to a successful transaction...

            They raise their glasses and drink.  Del tosses back his
            drink in one gulp.



     24     INT. DAVID'S CAR - WOODED ROADSIDE - (ON TV SCREEN)     24

            Chloe is on top of David, kissing him on the mouth as he
            resists.  He finally has to push her away forcibly, and we
            hear a TEARING SOUND.  Chloe's blouse has been ripped.

                                DAVID
                      I'm sorry, Chloe.

            She starts to cry.  David reaches out to comfort her.

                                DAVID (cont'd)
                      It's not that I don't find you
                      attractive.  I'm just not ready...

            David looks up to find her lips on his.  In spite of himself,
            he gives in to the warmth of her kiss and responds hungrily.

            Betty is mesmerized.

                                                                   22.




     25     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT                25

            The men have retired into the dining room, sitting or
            standing around a worn wooded table.  Charlie and Wesley are
            just finishing their drinks.

                                DEL
                      All right gentlemen, let's get down to
                      it.  I need to know if you're for real.

                                CHARLIE
                      If we're for real?

                                DEL
                      You don't exactly look like drug dealers.

                                WESLEY
                      Isn't that the point?

                                DEL
                      Yeah, well,  I don't have time to screw
                      around.  I got buyers in Dallas, Houston
                      and Vegas who are ready to snap this
                      stuff up.

                                CHARLIE
                      We appreciate that.  But you just poured
                      me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your
                      hospitality for a few minutes.

                                DEL
                      Fine.  You got five...

                                CHARLIE
                      It's a nice place you got here.  Real
                      comfortable.  Sweet little town, Fair
                      Oaks.  You like it here?

                                DEL
                          (laughs)
                      Are you kidding me?  What's to like?

                                WESLEY
                      Seems like a nice place.

                                DEL
                      It is, if you like idiots...

                                CHARLIE
                      What do you mean?

                                DEL
                      It's a small town, man.  I never should
                      have left Omaha.  People here think

                                                                   23.

                      small.  They act small.  They're a bunch
                      of dumb fucks.

                                WESLEY
                      Really?

                                DEL
                      You better believe it.

                                CHARLIE
                      Could you give us an example?

                                DEL
                      Of what?

                                CHARLIE
                      I'm asking you for an example of one of
                      these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.

                                DEL
                      I don't follow...

                                CHARLIE
                      You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?

                                DEL
                          (warily)
                      No...

                                CHARLIE
                      I didn't think so.  So, give me an
                      example of a stupid person doing a stupid
                      thing.  Not being stupid, you're equipped
                      to recognize it.

                                DEL
                      Are we gonna do business here, or not?

                                WESLEY
                      Relax, we brought the cash.

                                CHARLIE
                      I'm just curious.  Can't you give me an
                      example?

                                DEL
                          (annoyed)
                      All right ... lemme see ... okay, new
                      Burger King opens up.  These assholes get
                      excited and start lining up.  Like it's
                      some five star restaurant.  The place is
                      mobbed.  Right?

                                                                   24.


                                CHARLIE
                      Hmmmm.  "Five Stars," huh?
                          (BEAT)
                      Is that stupid, Wesley?

                                WESLEY
                      No, that's ignorant.  They just don't
                      know any better.

                                CHARLIE
                      That's what I thought.
                          (to Del)
                      You better give me another example.

                                DEL
                      This is bullshit, can we get down to
                      business here, please?

            Off a look from Charlie, Wesley produces a pistol and gently
            nudges the barrel into Del's ear.

                                DEL (CONT'D)
                      Jesus Christ!

                                WESLEY
                      He's waiting...

                                DEL
                      Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.

                                WESLEY
                      "Injuns?"

                                CHARLIE
                      You did not just say "Injuns," Del.

                                DEL
                      The Indians, Injuns, whatever.  They're
                      always drunk and doing stupid things.

                                CHARLIE
                      Like what?

                                DEL
                      Driving their cars into trees... puking
                      on the sidewalk... stupid shit!

                                CHARLIE
                      Let's see... around here that would be
                      Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not
                      mistaken.

                                DEL
                      I... I don't know...

                                                                   25.


                                CHARLIE
                      Well, my idea of stupid is very different
                      from yours.
                          (BEAT)
                      So here's how this is gonna work.  Would
                      you take your socks off, please?

                                DEL
                      My socks?

                                WESLEY
                      You heard the man.

            Del slowly takes his shoes and socks off.  He's sweating,
            trembling.

                                CHARLIE
                      I'm gonna talk to you and when I'm
                      finished, you can answer.  But I don't
                      like being interrupted.  Now roll them
                      into a ball...

            Del does it.

                                DEL
                      Oh, Jesus, please...  Please, God.

                                CHARLIE
                      ... and put them in your mouth.

            At a sharp look from Charlie, Del obediently stuffs the socks
            into his mouth and starts to cry.  Wesley produces a roll of
            duct tape and fastens Del's hands to the back of his chair.



     26     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT                        26

            Betty is glued to the TV, oblivious to the men.  Chloe and
            David are still talking in his car.  She continues to cry.

                                DAVID
                          (V.O.)
                      You're wonderful, Chloe, you are... But I
                      just know there's something special out
                      there for me.



     27     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT                27

                                CHARLIE
                      Now I'm gonna tell you what stupid is.
                      Stupid is taking something that doesn't
                      belong to you.  Right Wesley?

                                                                   26.


                                WESLEY
                      That's right.

                                CHARLIE
                      Stupid is trying to sell it to other
                      people who are, by their very nature,
                      untrustworthy.

                                WESLEY
                      That is so right.

                                CHARLIE
                      Stupid is calling people in Kansas City
                      who are affiliated with the rightful
                      owners of the thing you stole, and trying
                      to sell it to them.  Right Wesley?

                                WESLEY
                      Now, that's really stupid.

                                CHARLIE
                      So you see, we have totally different
                      ideas of what's stupid and what's not.
                      Don't we?

            Del nods; crying, sweating.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Good.  Now we're getting somewhere.  You
                      agree that you were stupid?

            Del nods again.  Wesley collects Charlie's glass and mixes
            him another drink.  He gets a beer for himself and stands
            behind Del.  Charlie sips his drink slowly, savoring it.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      You know, a hundred and fifty years ago
                      you'd have been scalped for that remark
                      about Native Americans.  Right here where
                      your house is - you'd have been scalped.

                                WESLEY
                      Hell of a way to die.

                                CHARLIE
                      It wasn't always fatal, Wesley.  We could
                      scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty
                      alive to tell us how it feels.

            Del's eyes get huge.

                                CHARLIE  (CONT'D)
                      It's pretty simple, too.
                          (BEAT)

                                                                   27.

                      First you take a knife and just draw a
                      mark right across the hairline.

            Wesley produces a long knife and traces a line across the
            very top of Del's forehead.  Trickles of blood wind their way
            down his brow.  Del is MOANING and PANTING through his socks.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Hold still, Del, we're just talking
                      here...
                          (pointing to a spot)
                      Then you grab a big handful of hair and
                      pull as you cut.  It's amazing how easily
                      the scalp comes off.

                                WESLEY
                      A mark, huh?

            Wesley takes a jab at Del's forehead with his knife, leaving
            a small cut.

            Del starts twitching, rocking back and forth as Wesley grabs
            a fistful of his hair.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      Shut the fuck up!  I bleed more than that
                      when I shave...

            Del stops moving. He breathes furiously through his nostrils.

                                CHARLIE
                      Now.  I want to know the particulars of
                      your stupid act:  how you got what
                      doesn't belong to you, who helped you get
                      it, and of course, where it is now.

            Charlie pulls the socks out of Del's mouth.  Del splutters,
            gasping for air.

                                DEL
                      It's in the Buick!  I swear to God it's
                      all there!



     28     INT. BLAKE DANIELS' OFFICE - DAY  (ON TV SCREEN)        28

            David enters.  Blake nods to him grimly.

                                DAVID
                      You wanted to see me, Blake?

                                BLAKE
                      I wish I could say I had good news.
                          (off David's look)
                      David, I'll get right to the point.
                      Chloe Jensen has filed charges of sexual

                                                                   28.

                      assault against you.
                          (BEAT)
                      You can continue to practice at L.A.
                      County, but I'm afraid I have to revoke
                      your privileges here at Loma Vista until
                      this is resolved.

            HOLD on David's shocked expression ...  MUSIC UP AS

                                DEL  (O.S.)
                      PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!!!

            Betty's not sure what Del said, but the panic in his voice
            got through.  She hits PAUSE and takes a look.



     29     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT                29

            Del is facing her, tiny rivulets of blood running into his
            terrified eyes.  Wesley stands at his shoulder, still holding
            a handful of his hair, still poised with the knife.

                                DEL
                      I got it from a truck driver named Duane
                      Cooley, out of Amarillo.  He brings my
                      cars down from Detroit.  But I haven't
                      touched it, I swear to you... Please!
                      Please!  Please!

            Annoyed, Charlie stuffs the socks back in Del's mouth.

            Betty stares.  Her gaze shifts from Del to Wesley, drawn by
            Wesley's demonic expression.

                                CHARLIE
                      Consider yourself lucky.  Luckier than
                      those 'Injuns' you have such contempt
                      for.

            Wesley stares at the top of Del's head.  Betty stares at
            Wesley.  Charlie walks into the kitchen for another drink.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      I'll tell you, if anyone got a raw deal
                      it's the American Indian.  This country
                      has a black mark on its soul for what was
                      done to them.

            Wesley's nostrils flare.  Betty leans forward.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      I'm all for them owning casinos, getting
                      rich off the white man's greed.  It's a
                      beautiful piece of irony, isn't it,
                      Wesley?

                                                                   29.


                                WESLEY
                      IT SURE IS!!

            And with a long SCREAM, Wesley rips Del's scalp from his
            head. It makes a sickening sound like fabric tearing.  For a
            long moment, there is only silence.  An eerie silence.

            Suddenly, Del SCREAMS into his socks and thrashes in his
            seat, blood pouring down his head on all sides.

            Somehow, he manages to get to his feet, the chair still taped
            to him, and begins smashing into whatever is near.  Blood
            flies and curios shatter as Del thunders through the room.  A
            dying bull, only messier.  It's quite a show.

                                CHARLIE
                      JESUS CHRIST!!!

            Wesley steps back, staring at the dripping scalp in his hand,
            as if wondering how it got there.  Betty is transfixed,
            horrified.

            Charlie re-enters.  The two men look at each other over Del's
            MUFFLED SCREAMS as he plows headlong into wooden paneling, a
            china cabinet, and finally, back toward them near the
            breakfast counter.  Del bashes blindly into it.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                          (to Wesley)
                      What the fuck is the matter with you?!

            Wesley is practically foaming at the mouth, still rushing on
            what he did.  Charlie draws a silenced pistol and mercifully
            SHOOTS Del through the head.  The big man stops suddenly,
            blinks once or twice, topples over.



     30     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT                        30

            Betty points her remote at the dining room and clicks it, as
            if trying to make the image disappear.  Finally, she gives
            up, slowly turning away from the carnage and aims at the TV.
            "A Reason to Love" pauses on the face of David Ravell and
            Betty sits in absolute silence.



     31     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT                31

            Charlie quickly begins to hide their tracks, producing a
            plastic baggie and collecting the beer cans and his own
            glass.  He also wipes down the fridge as Wesley watches.

                                CHARLIE
                      Are you out of your mind?  You scalped
                      him!

                                                                   30.


                                WESLEY
                      You told me how to do it!

                                CHARLIE
                      That was to get him to talk!
                          (BEAT)
                      Get rid of that thing, will you?

            Wesley crosses to the garbage can, steps on the lever.  He
            looks at the scalp one more time before dropping it in.

                                CHARLIE  (CONT'D)
                      This is great - just great!  Now we don't
                      know where the goddamn stuff is.

                                WESLEY
                      He told us it's in the Buick.

                                CHARLIE
                      We don't know which Buick, do we?

                                WESLEY
                      Well, why'd you shoot him?

                                CHARLIE
                      I had to shoot him!  It was the only
                      decent thing to do.

            They exit the house.

                                CHARLIE  (O.S.) (cont'd)
                      This is very unprofessional, Wesley.



     32     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT                        32

            Betty is still in the family room, staring at the TV.  She
            pushes 'play' again and David Ravell begins to speak.



     33     EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - STREET - LATER                   33

            Sue Ann comes out of her house, balancing a homemade cake in
            front of her.  The candles give off an unearthly glow as she
            picks her way up the Sizemore's gravel drive.



     34     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - SAME TIME                    34

            Betty is catatonic, staring at the frozen image of David
            Ravell on her TV.  Downstairs, Sue Ann comes in.

                                                                   31.


                                SUE ANN
                          (O.S.)
                      Happy Birthday to you!  Happy Birthday to
                      you!  Happy Birthday, dear--

            A terrified SCREAM as the cake lands unceremoniously on the
            entryway.

            ON BETTY

            As she hits 'Play':

                                DAVID
                      ... you're wonderful, Chloe, you are...
                      But I just know there's something special
                      out there for me.



     35     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - FOYER - LATER THAT NIGHT           35

            Roy enters the foyer and looks around, carrying a pad and pen
            in hand.  He hears VOICES from the kitchen, sees FLASHBULBS
            going off.  He sneaks down the hall when A VOICE stops him.

                                DEPUTY
                      Hang on there, Roy.  Nobody comes in.

                                ROY
                      Elden called me.  He wants to, ahh, make
                      a statement for the paper...

            The deputy nods him through and Roy moves off toward the
            sewing room where he has spotted Betty.



     36     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - SEWING ROOM - SAME TIME            36

            Betty is packing an overnight bag on her bed when Roy enters
            and quietly closes the door behind him.  She is working with
            a purpose, almost like a different person from the woman we
            first met.  Still bright and cheerful, but with a willful
            glint in her eye.  Determined.

                                ROY
                      Hey, Betty.  Are you okay?

                                BETTY
                      I'm great, good, content.
                          (stopping)
                      What happened to your arm, Roy?

                                ROY
                      Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to
                      keep it wrapped for a few...

                                                                   32.


                                BETTY
                      Make sure it's elevated...

                                ROY
                      Uh-huh.

                                BETTY
                      You want me to make you a sling? It's no
                      problem...

            Betty starts whipping a T-shirt into place but stops
            abruptly. She turns curiously to Roy.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      What're you doing here, Roy?

                                ROY
                      Well, I was worried about you and I
                      wanted to make sure you were alright...
                      and I guess I was sort of hoping I could
                      ask you about what happened...

                                BETTY
                      Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing.
                      It was disgusting!

                                ROY
                      My God... did you get a look at who did
                      it?

                                BETTY
                      Yes.

                                ROY
                      You did?  Was it anyone that you...?

                                BETTY
                      It was Chloe...

            Sheriff Ballard enters the house, surveys the scene of the
            crime where one deputy wipes blood off his boot with a paper
            towel, and erupts when he sees Roy.

                                BALLARD
                      Hey, you guys wanna try not stepping
                      directly in the evidence, please?
                          (to Roy)
                      Ostrey, you and your goddamn police
                      scanner! I leave for ten minutes and...
                      Betty, I'm sorry about this.

            He motions to a female officer.

                                                                   33.


                                BALLARD (cont'd)
                      Why don't you take her down to the
                      station? We'll be along in a bit...

            She leads Betty out the kitchen door.

                                BETTY
                      'Night, guys...



     37     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT                37

            As Ballard leads Roy into the next room...

                                BALLARD
                      Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the
                      record yet.

                                ROY
                      Oww! My arm, careful!

                                BALLARD
                      Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your
                      bike again?

                                ROY
                      No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just
                      mauled me a little when I layed their
                      food out.

                                BALLARD
                      Good God...they're meat eaters, Roy, just
                      drop the shit in there!

                                ROY
                      I can't...they prefer a more formal
                      presentation. I don't usually go so close
                      to the surface, but I was...

                                BALLARD
                      ...you are so goddamn weird.
                          (BEAT)
                      Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta
                      here!

                                ROY
                      No, Elden, I need to...

                                BALLARD
                      You need to get yourself gone from my
                      crime scene. And leave Betty alone,
                      she's...

                                                                   34.


                                ROY
                      She knows who killed Del.  Elden, she
                      said it was a woman.

                                BALLARD
                      It wasn't a woman.

                                ROY
                      Yes it was.  Betty saw the whole thing!
                      Your killer's name is Chloe...

                                BALLARD
                      I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!



     38     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                38

            Ballard drags Roy into the living room, where he sees Del.
            He has been turned upright and is being carefully examined.

                                ROY
                      Jesus...

                                BALLARD
                      You think a woman did that?!

            Roy runs into the kitchen, covering his mouth.



     39     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                    39

            Ballard and his cronies delight in watching Roy struggle with
            the dry heaves. Roy runs to the kitchen sink, almost loses
            it, then wipes his mouth with a paper towel.

                                BALLARD
                      Kinda' looks like a burnt out roman
                      candle, don't he?
                          (BEAT)
                      Del must've sold a lemon to the wrong
                      Indian, and got paid back the old
                      fashioned way.  Them Kickapoos get pretty
                      mean when they drink...

            Roy sees Del's scalp in the garbage can as he goes to drop
            his crumpled towel inside.

                                ROY
                      So, you think you're gonna find his scalp
                      hanging in some tepee?

                                BALLARD
                      They no longer live in tepees, Mr.
                      College Graduate.

                                                                   35.


                                ROY
                      Did you send anyone out there?

                                BALLARD
                      You bet I did.  I got a squad car on the
                      way to the reservation right now.

                                ROY
                      Bad idea ...

                                BALLARD
                      You just go write your little story, Roy.
                      I'll handle the police work...

                                ROY
                      You better handle what's in this garbage
                      can first.



     40     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - NIGHT                            40

            Every car on the lot has its trunk open and spare tire on the
            ground behind it.  Charlie and Wesley are at the last car.

                                WESLEY
                      I still don't understand how you knew Del
                      was telling the truth.

                                CHARLIE
                      I saw his soul Wesley.  He was face to
                      face with his God, and no one lies in
                      that situation.  But your Geronimo act
                      rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.
                          (BEAT)
                      Never abandon you instincts.

                                WESLEY
                      I didn't.  You gave me a look!

                                CHARLIE
                      What 'look'?

                                WESLEY
                      That one look you got!  I thought you
                      were done, so I took him out...

                                CHARLIE
                      I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing
                      him whine.  And you didn't take him out,
                      you scalped him.  Christ, I almost puked,
                      did I tell you that?

                                WESLEY
                      Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian
                      story?

                                                                   36.


                                CHARLIE
                      What the hell does that mean?  If I'd
                      told a Ty Cobb story would you have
                      clubbed him to death with a bat?

            Wesley is stung.  Charlie slams the last trunk in disgust.
            The rest remain where they are; open.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      It's not here.  Let's go.

                                WESLEY
                      You just gonna leave these cars sitting
                      here like this?

                                CHARLIE
                      Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do
                      something, now that you fucked it up.

                                WESLEY
                      I wanted to make a statement.

                                CHARLIE
                      Let me tell you something.  In our
                      business you can't put food on the table
                      if your phone doesn't ring.  The guys who
                      get the calls are good - not flashy, just
                      good.  They get in, they get out.  Nobody
                      knows a goddamn thing.  Understand?
                      Boom, boom, boom.  Three in the head and
                      you know they're dead.

                                WESLEY
                      ... that's a good motto.

                                CHARLIE
                      Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but
                      you better start believing it!  It's the
                      only statement you need to make.



     41     INT. POLICE STATION / OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT          41

            Betty is questioned in a holding room by a POLICE OFFICER and
            a DOCTOR.  Ballard and Roy watch through a window.

                                DOCTOR
                      And did your husband know these people?

                                BETTY
                      Sort of...but he ignored them.

                                DOCTOR
                      And how did that make you feel, Betty?

                                                                   37.


                                BETTY
                      I felt all cold inside.  And angry.

            Ballard looks both ways to make sure he won't be overheard.

                                BALLARD
                      I questioned Joyce about all this...

                                ROY
                      Yeah?

                                BALLARD
                      Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol
                      Del. On a regular basis, if you get my
                      drift...

                                ROY
                      ... and half the other guys in this town.
                      Including you, I believe...

                                BALLARD
                      Junior year!

                                ROY
                      Anyway, so what?

                                BALLARD
                      So? ... Suppose Betty found out about
                      them?

                                ROY
                      You said a woman couldn't have done it.

                                BALLARD
                      A woman can write a check.

                                ROY
                      So you're saying Betty Sizemore - our
                      Betty Sizemore--who you were in swing
                      choir with--has now hired somebody to
                      scalp her husband in her own kitchen
                      while she watched?  You're amazing.

                                BALLARD
                      'S just a theory...just 'cause I'm
                      thinking it don't mean I like it.

            The doctor comes out of the holding room.

                                BALLARD (cont'd)
                      How is she?

                                                                   38.


                                DOCTOR
                      She's in a kind of shock. I see all the
                      signs of a post-traumatic reaction with
                      possible dissociative symptoms.

                                BALLARD
                      Could I have that in American?

                                DOCTOR
                      It's a type of altered state...it allows
                      a traumatized person to continue
                      functioning.

                                BALLARD
                      So she did witness it?

                                ROY
                      Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.

                                BALLARD
                      That's it!  YOU'RE GONE!

            He spins Roy around and marches him toward the door, one arm
            bent behind his back.

                                ROY
                      Oww, the arm, the arm!

                                BALLARD
                      You just don't know when to quit, Roy!
                      You were jealous of me when I got hall
                      monitor in seventh grade, and you're
                      still jealous now!!!

                                ROY
                      One question, Doctor, please! (outside
                      the door) You can't do this! I'm the
                      press, I have rights!!

                                BALLARD
                      That's right, you have the right to
                      remain silent.

            Ballard pushes Roy out the door. As he returns, Roy reappears
            behind him, leaning in to listen. Ballard doesn't see him.

                                BALLARD (cont'd)
                      Sorry you had to see that. You were
                      saying?

                                DOCTOR
                      I was saying that it seems probable that
                      she witnessed the murder, but her memory
                      of it is gone, at least for the time
                      being. I also think you ought to have her

                                                                   39.

                      stay with someone tonight.
                          (BEAT)
                      Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?

                                BALLARD
                      No... Friends from the diner maybe?

                                DOCTOR
                      Well, you should find out.  She keeps
                      talking about them...

            Ballard nods, sure he's got a clue here. He looks in at Betty
            again, just as she begins repacking her travel bag.  He
            frowns at this, his suspicions fueled all the more.



     42     EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                            42

            A police car pulls up to Sue Ann's house.  Betty gets out,
            carrying her overnight bag.  Sue Ann appears, embraces her
            and leads her inside.



     43     INT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER                  43

            Betty lies down in a bright red race car bed.  Sue Ann tucks
            her in and turns out the light.

                                SUE ANN
                      Let me know if you need anything, okay?

                                BETTY
                      Are you and Larry happy?

                                SUE ANN
                      Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.

                                BETTY
                      Then you should treasure that... you
                      gotta hold on to whatever you got that's
                      any good, even if it's only a little bit.

                                SUE ANN
                      All you been through... I ever tell you
                      what a good friend you are?

                                BETTY
                      All the time...

                                SUE ANN
                      Well, you are.

            After a beat...

                                                                   40.


                                BETTY
                      Something bad happened to Del and me,
                      didn't it?

                                SUE ANN
                      Yeah, hon.  Real bad.  You just get some
                      sleep, everything's gonna be fine.

                                BETTY
                      Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I
                      just know there's something special out
                      there for me...

            Sue Ann looks down at her friend, troubled.  She strokes
            Betty's hair gently and kisses her.  After she leaves, Betty
            lies awake, staring at the ceiling.  A mobile dangles
            overhead.

            LATER

            The Mickey Mouse clock on the wall reads 3:30.  Beneath it,
            Betty is sitting up in bed, wide awake.



     44     INT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT              44

            Betty comes down the stairs without a sound. She finds a pen
            and paper near the phone and writes a note.

            INSERT:            Dear Del:
                                           This is the hardest thing I've ever done and I can't
                                           even face you.  But I need to be honest.  We haven't
                                           been happy for a long time. You always say people
                                           need their space, and now you'll have some.  I'm
                                           sorry.

                                           Betty

            She takes off her wedding band and puts it on the table.



     45     EXT. BETTY'S HOUSE/GARAGE - NIGHT                       45

            Betty raises the garage door, tosses her overnight bag and
            birthday money envelope into the LeSabre, and gets in.
            She drives through Fair Oaks, past the town limits.  She
            keeps on driving until her car recedes into the moonlit
            prairie horizon.

                                                                   41.




     46     EXT./INT. LESABRE - DRIVING - NIGHT                     46

            She comes to a sudden halt in front of the "You are Leaving
            Kansas" billboard.  She stares hard at it through the
            windshield.  Suddenly, she hits the gas and bolts off along
            the Oklahoma blacktop.  She never looks back.



     47     INT. BETTY'S LESABRE - THE NEXT DAY                     47

            Betty yawns, looks at her watch and increases her speed.
            When she sees a sign for a MOTEL ahead, she pulls off the
            highway.



     48     EXT. TRUCK STOP/MOTEL - DAY                             48

            She parks at a truck stop/restaurant/motel complex, hops out
            and runs to the motel office window.



     49     INT. TRUCK STOP - MOTEL ROOM - DAY                      49

            Betty enters her room, immediately turns on the TV, and plops
            down on the bed.

                                VOICE (V.O.)
                      And now we return to "A Reason to Love."



     50     EXT. TRUCK STOP/MOTEL PARKING LOT - SAME TIME           50

            A crowded truck stop in the Texas flatlands.  THREE TRUCK
            DRIVERS in jeans, flannel shirts and denim jackets walk
            across the parking lot.

            One is an old, grizzled veteran with a salt-and-pepper
            stubble and a greasy CAT cap on his head.  It's CHARLIE.
            Next to him is DUANE, a burly young driver in fancy cowboy
            boots.  Flanking Duane is WESLEY.

                                WESLEY
                      So you got Asian women?

                                DUANE
                          (Southern accent)
                      Sure, I got Asian.  Got black, white, any
                      color you like, video and magazine.  Got
                      fat chicks and animals too, if you want
                      'em.  They're extra...

                                CHARLIE
                      Mmmm.  Well, it was a piece of luck
                      running into you, Duane. I thought I was

                                                                   42.

                      gonna have to take Wesley out and hose
                      him down.  All he talks about is those
                      Japanese gals.

                                WESLEY
                      I like 'em small.  When you're inside a
                      little Asian chick, it's like your dick
                      is the axle that holds her body together.

                                DUANE
                      That's nicely put.  You outta get
                      yourself to Thailand...

            They reach Duane's truck, an empty car-carrier with Michigan
            plates, and climb up into the cab.



     51     INT. DUANE'S TRUCK - DAY                                51

            Two Confederate flags criss-cross over Duane's CB unit.  On
            the dashboard is a Rebel flag pin, a bumper sticker that says
            "The South Will Rise Again" and a dozen country music tapes.

            Duane gets in the sleeper cab, where stacks of porno tapes
            and magazines reach the ceiling.  Wesley takes the driver's
            seat, Charlie, the passenger seat.

                                CHARLIE
                      What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?

                                DUANE
                      Georgia.  In case I didn't tell you, it's
                      cash only, gentlemen.

                                WESLEY
                      We can live with that.

                                CHARLIE
                      I'm a Yankee, myself.  Massachusetts.

            Duane passes two videos to Wesley.

                                DUANE
                      Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized
                      Zone. Get it?
                          (laughs)
                      They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.

                                CHARLIE
                      You know, it's interesting.  The South
                      lost the Civil War, but they still seem
                      to get all the glory.

                                DUANE
                      Huh?

                                                                   43.


                                CHARLIE
                      Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson
                      Davis - they're all losers in my book.

            Charlie smiles.  Duane stops digging through the videotapes.

                                DUANE
                      The fuck you talking about?

                                CHARLIE
                      Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.

                                DUANE
                          (to Wesley)
                      He goin' crazy on us, or what?

                                CHARLIE
                      Did you know the most brutal, inhumane
                      prison of the entire war was in Georgia?

                                DUANE
                      Really.  And where was that, old man?

                                CHARLIE
                      Andersonville.
                          (BEAT)
                      They did horrible things to men there...



     52     INT. CHLOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - (ON TV SCREEN)         52

            Chloe is curled up on her white leather sofa, cowering as
            Lonnie hovers over her accusingly.

                                LONNIE
                      I think you better tell me what's going
                      on here, Chloe.

                                CHLOE
                      I just feel... funny about what we did.

                                LONNIE
                          (laughs)
                      You feel guilty?  Let me remind you of
                      something, sweetheart.  You're in this up
                      to those fabulous eyes of yours.
                      Understand?

            The camera holds on her face for a melodramatic beat ...
            Chloe's trapped, and she knows it.

            PULL BACK to reveal Betty lying on the bed in her motel room,
            out cold.

                                                                   44.




     53     INT. DUANE'S TRUCK - LATER                              53

            The flag poles over the CB unit are bare. Duane is in the
            sleeper cab, his forearms bound to his thighs with duct tape.
            A telltale piece of Confederate red fabric hangs out of his
            mouth.  There is a purplish bruise on his forehead.  He's
            quiet, but glowering at his captors.

                                CHARLIE
                      ... So, at a rest stop outside Logansport
                      you noticed that two guys were slipping
                      something extra in one of your cars, and
                      you decided to see what it was.  Then you
                      figured you'd take this valuable
                      commodity and go into business yourself,
                      even though it didn't belong to you.  But
                      you needed a crackerjack salesman to move
                      it, so you made the biggest mistake of
                      your short life and chose Del.  Sound
                      right so far?

            Duane nods.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Del's dead, by the way.  I sent him to
                      the Great Beyond.

                                WESLEY
                      Actually, I scalped him, and then you
                      killed him.

            Duane narrows his eyes in disbelief.

                                CHARLIE
                      Exactly.
                          (BEAT)
                      Now, the one thing I don't get is that we
                      checked all the Buicks on that lot.  Four
                      '97 LeSabres and nothing in 'em.

            Duane smiles mockingly.

                                CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                      Ohhh ... There weren't four, were there?

            Charlie reaches up above the visor and pulls down a rumpled
            manifest.  He leafs through it.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      There were five, damn it!  I should have
                      known!!  Goddamn...
                          (BEAT)
                      So, what happened to the fifth car?

                                                                   45.


            Duane shrugs his shoulders.

                                CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                      You know you're going to die, don't you,
                      Duane?
                          (Duane nods)
                      And you really don't know where that
                      other LeSabre is, do you?

            Duane shakes his head.  Charlie sighs, resigned.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      He's telling the truth.  He doesn't know.

                                WESLEY
                      Should I kill him now?

                                CHARLIE
                      Wait.  Any last words, General Lee?

            Duane nods emphatically.  Wesley pulls the Confederate flags
            out of his mouth.

                                DUANE
                      Suck my dick, you Yankee piece of shit.

            He spits in Wesley's face.  Charlie has to restrain Wesley.

                                CHARLIE
                      God, I admire that.  Ya see that, Wesley?
                      That's why they get all the glory.

            Charlie climbs down from the big rig and heads across the
            parking lot. The Town Car is parked near the adjacent motel,
            just a few spaces away from Betty's LeSabre.

            With a furious calm Wesley wipes his face, then takes out a
            can of lighter fluid, sets it on the dash and looks at Duane.

                                WESLEY
                      ...why'd you spit on me?



     54     EXT. TRUCK STOP/MOTEL PARKING LOT - DUSK                54

            Charlie pulls the Town Car alongside Duane's rig and drums
            the steering wheel impatiently.  It begins to rain.  There
            are flashes of LIGHTNING in the distance.

                                CHARLIE
                      Come on, Wesley, three shots.

            A FLASH OF ORANGE FLAME ignites inside Duane's cab.  Charlie
            sighs.  Finally, THREE DULL THUDS reverberate from inside.
            Wesley climbs down clutching a videotape and gets in the car.

                                                                   46.


                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      What the hell was that, another
                      statement?

                                WESLEY
                      Well, no one ever spit in my face before.
                      Especially some cracker fuck.

                                CHARLIE
                      You have to rise above it.  The
                      professionals rise above that kind of
                      thing...

            As they drive away FLAMES are beginning to dance inside the
            cab.



     55     INT. TRUCK STOP/MOTEL ROOM - EVENING                    55

            The FLICKERING LIGHT of the TV screen is the only light.
            Betty lies asleep on the bed.  The NEWS comes on and she
            starts to stir as ...

                                NEWSCASTER
                      ... small town of Fair Oaks ... has left
                      people shaken ... owner-manager of
                      Sizemore Motors ...

            Betty sits up.  On the TV screen is a shot of Del as Julius
            Caesar from one of his commercials.

                                NEWSCASTER
                                (cont'd)
                      ... police are still investigating.

            She blinks at the screen, confused, as the next story comes
            on. Betty reaches for the phone.



     56     INT. POLICE STATION - EVENING                           56

            Ballard is doing paperwork. Roy is asleep on a nearby bench.
            A DEPUTY picks up a ringing phone and hands it to Ballard.

                                DEPUTY
                      Sheriff, it's Betty Sizemore, on two!

                                BALLARD
                      SHHH!... (Whispering) BETTY?   WHERE ARE
                      YOU?

                                                                   47.




     57     INT. TRUCK STOP/MOTEL ROOM - ON BETTY                   57

                                BETTY
                      I'm in a motel.  Has something happened
                      to Del?  Did he do something stupid?

                                BALLARD (V.O.)
                      BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU...IN PERSON!
                      WHERE'RE YOU AT?

                                BETTY
                      IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT!  I'M NOT
                      COMING BACK!

                                BALLARD (V.O.)
                      GODAMMIT, BETTY! ... WHO'S CHLOE?

                                BETTY
                      I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW!  GOODBYE!

            She hangs up. HEADLIGHTS sweep across the curtains, startling
            her.



     58     INT. BETTY'S LESABRE - MOVING - DAY                     58

            Betty crosses the border from Texas into New Mexico.  She
            grips the wheel intently, driving for all she's worth.



     59     OMIT                                                    59



     60     EXT. FAIR OAKS TRAILER PARK - LATE AFTERNOON            60

            Betty's blue Corsica sits surrounded by yellow police tape.
            Half a dozen COPS mill around.  To one side are several
            REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS, Roy included.  A FEW RESIDENTS
            mill around in the background.

            A stack of pictures of Betty sit on a makeshift table.

                                REPORTER #1
                      Who witnessed Ms. Sizemore driving here?

                                BALLARD
                      The Assistant Manager, Mr. Wylie.

                                REPORTER #2
                      But he couldn't identify the male
                      passenger?

                                                                   48.


                                BALLARD
                      Only to say he was wearing green.

                                ROY
                      What if the killers didn't see her?  You
                      published her picture - you're gonna get
                      her killed!

                                BALLARD
                      No, we're bringing the community into the
                      effort to find her.

                                ROY
                      You're lying!

                                BALLARD
                      I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.
                          (the reporters hush)
                      That's right.  There's no doubt in my
                      mind, folks... she's on the run.  Whether
                      or not she's mixed up in all this remains
                      to be seen...

                                ROY
                      That's bullshit, Sheriff!  You think
                      she's a suspect!

                                BALLARD
                      I'd like to apologize for our local boy.
                      He's been in love with Betty since the
                      fifth grade, y'see.  He means well, but
                      he's in over his head on this.



     61     INT. TIP TOP DINER - NEXT MORNING                       61

            CLOSE SHOT of a headline in the Wichita Eagle:  "EYE WITNESS
            TO BRUTAL MURDER MISSING" over a picture of Betty. Charlie is
            one of MANY CUSTOMERS reading a copy. Wesley is plowing
            through a stack of pancakes.

                                WESLEY
                      So how do we know that car's still in
                      Fair Oaks?

                                CHARLIE
                      We don't.  But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy
                      to find if it's here, town this size...
                          (BEAT)
                      He said he gave his wife some car as a
                      gift, remember?

            Charlie turns the page for emphasis and studies Betty's
            features.

                                                                   49.


                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      This is bad, Wesley.  Very, very bad.

            Wesley happily adds three strips of bacon brought by A
            WAITRESS, who wears a button with the word "Missing" over
            Betty's face.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      ... extremely bad.

            Wesley finally looks up, directly at the picture of Betty.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Did you hear what I said?

            Wesley nods, his mouth stuffed with food.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of
                      this situation.  It's bad enough that we
                      don't have what we came here for.  It's
                      worse that we don't know where it is. And
                      now this.
                          (points at the headline)
                      This was supposed to be my last job.  I
                      already put the deposit down on my boat.
                          (BEAT)
                      How can you eat at a time like this?  I
                      get nauseous just watching you...

                                WESLEY
                      I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap
                      that woman.  I can eat because they
                      aren't looking for us.  And I can eat
                      'cause I'm fucking hungry...
                          (off Charlie's look)
                      ... relax.  She's gonna end up on a milk
                      carton and that's about it.

                                CHARLIE
                      I hope you're right...

                                WESLEY
                      ... I know I am.  Let's just do what we
                      gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.

            They sit for a moment in silence.  Wesley swallowing without
            chewing and Charlie studying Betty's photo.

                                CHARLIE
                      She got out of town awfully fast. And
                      wasn't she quiet in that house?  I think
                      most women would have screamed, don't
                      you?  I know they would've...
                          (BEAT)

                                                                   50.

                      We could be dealing with a cunning,
                      ruthless woman...



     62     INT./EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - DAY                         62

            Sue Ann opens her front door to find Wesley standing before
            her.  It's a new Wesley:  glasses, conservative suit, and a
            convincingly humble manner.

                                WESLEY
                      Mrs. Rogers?  I'm Dwight Campbell, with
                      Neighborly Life Insurance.  I'm looking
                      for Betty Sizemore.

                                SUE ANN
                      I wish I could help you, but I can't.

            Wesley is hit by a flying action figure.  He doesn't flinch.
            Kids run by.

                                WESLEY
                      Aren't they precious?
                          (BEAT)
                      Ma'am, she has a substantial death
                      benefit coming to her from the tragic
                      loss of her husband.  Does she have any
                      relatives in the area?

                                SUE ANN
                      No.
                          (BEAT)
                      Well, her grandparents are down in
                      Oklahoma, but that's it...

                                WESLEY
                      I see.  And are you in touch with Mrs.
                      Sizemore?

                                SUE ANN
                      No.  But I'm taping her show every day so
                      she can watch it when she comes back.

                                WESLEY
                      Her show?

                                SUE ANN
                      "A Reason to Love."

            Wesley's eyes light up.  He can't help himself.

                                WESLEY
                      I see.
                          (BEAT)
                      Did Chloe testify?

                                                                   51.


                                SUE ANN
                          (reassuring)
                      I don't think she will. She's a slut, but
                      I just don't think she's that mean.
                      Jasmine'll bring her around...

                                WESLEY
                      Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show
                      on tape, by any chance?

            Sue Ann holds the door open, smiling, and Wesley enters.



     63     INT. TIP TOP DINER - KANSAS - DAY                       63

            Charlie nurses a cup of coffee at the counter while talking
            to Darlene.  His Federal Marshall's badge rests on the
            counter.  Shehands him two photos of Betty taken at her
            birthday celebration. In one she's holding the cardboard
            David Ravell.  The other, a closeup shot.

                                CHARLIE
                      ... and how long did she work here?

                                DARLENE
                      Oh, five years, give or take.

                                CHARLIE
                      Hmm... you two in high school together?

                                DARLENE
                      Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite.
                      Anyway, she's been with us awhile.

                                CHARLIE
                      But she wanted more out of life, right?

                                DARLENE
                      No... she just wanted something outta
                      life.  Anything.  And with Del, she
                      wasn't getting nothing.  That's her
                      husband, Del.  I'm sorry about what
                      happened and all, but that's the way I
                      feel about all of this...

                                CHARLIE
                      I see.
                          (holding up photos)
                      May I?

                                DARLENE
                      If it helps bring her back, be my
                      guest...

                                                                   52.


                                CHARLIE
                      Thank you for your cooperation.
                          (BEAT)
                      Just one more thing... did she ever talk
                      about getting rich?

                                DARLENE
                      ... who doesn't?

            Darlene tries to smile and returns to the kitchen.  Charlie
            studies the snapshots, comparing them.



     64     INT. APARTMENT/BEDROOM - DAY                            64

            Wesley is in bed on top of Joyce, humping her slowly.

                                WESLEY
                      ... and what kind of car does she drive?

                                JOYCE
                      Well, she wanted a LeSabre, but Del made
                      her use that blue Corsica...
                          (BEAT)
                      So, is this what you boys'd call 'pumping
                      me for information?'

            Joyce GIGGLES as Wesley stops moving.

                                WESLEY
                      Did you say LeSabre?

                                JOYCE
                      Look, she didn't kill Del over no car if
                      that's what you're thinking.

                                WESLEY
                      But she could have taken one, right?

            With her knees, Joyce prods him into humping her again.

                                JOYCE
                      Maybe, but I don't think she had the
                      nerve. I know her.  And I'm a pretty good
                      judge of character...

            Joyce reaches for a cigarette on the nightstand and takes a
            deep drag. Wesley closes his eyes and turns away, offended.

                                WESLEY
                      ... yeah, I can see that.

                                                                   53.




     65     EXT. DESERT ROAD - WILLIAMS, ARIZONA - DAY              65

            Betty drives along a lonely stretch of highway that slowly
            reveals a desert town in the distance.



     66     INT. CANYON RANCH BAR - DAY                             66

            Big ol' place.  Lots of wood and red leather.  Betty rushes
            in as the clock on the wall reads 2:58.  The Town Drunk,
            MERLE, is alone at the bar watching "Bass Masters" on a huge
            TV screen.  In front of him is a remote control.  A FEW
            OTHERS at tables.

            Betty sidles up to the bar and sits down.  She looks at
            Merle, at the clock, at the remote.

                                BETTY
                      Would you mind very much if I changed the
                      channel at three o'clock?

                                MERLE
                      Yes.

            He BURPS, then finally looks at her with bleary eyes.

                                BETTY
                      Please?  It's very important to me.  "A
                      Reason to Love" comes on at three around
                      here.

            He ignores her.  Betty puts her wallet on the bar.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      I'll give you money.

            Merle SLAMS his hand down on the bar, scaring her.

                                MERLE
                       ARE YOU DEAF?!!

            It's 3:01. ELLEN DRABER, 40's, appears behind the bar, looks
            at the clock and takes the remote from Merle.  She changes
            the channel to "A Reason to Love" as the opening titles end.

            Betty can't believe it. Merle smiles at her wickedly.

                                MERLE (cont'd)
                      Please keep it down, it's time for "A
                      Reason to Love..."

                                                                   54.


                                BETTY
                      That's real funny.  Why don't you have
                      another drink?

                                ELLEN
                      What's the matter here?

                                BETTY
                      I begged him to let me put that on!

                                ELLEN
                      He's a prick.  Merle?... You're a prick.

            MERLE grunts in reply.  Ellen turns back to Betty.

                                ELLEN (CONT'D)
                      So you're into "Reason," too?  Finally,
                      someone civilized!  I'm Ellen, what can I
                      get you?

                                BETTY
                      Hi, I'm Betty.  I'll take a Miller, if
                      you got it...



     67     INT. CHLOE'S APARTMENT - DAY  (ON TV SCREEN)            67

            Chloe paces in front of her white sofa, a matching white
            telephone in her hand.  She looks worried.

                                ELLEN (O.S.)
                      What's that bitch up to now?

            We hear the BEEP TONE of an answering machine.

                                CHLOE
                      Lonnie?  It's Chloe.  We need to talk ...
                      I don't think I can go through with this.

            She hangs up.  The camera stays on her for a melodramatic
            beat of introspection as we GO TO COMMERCIAL.



     68     INT. CANYON RANCH BAR - RETURN TO BAR                   68

                                BETTY
                      Do you have a phone?

            Ellen swings a phone up onto the bar.

                                ELLEN
                      If it's long distance you can leave me a
                      buck when you're done.

            Betty dials ...

                                                                   55.


                                BETTY
                      Sue Ann?  It's Betty. I just wanted to
                      let you know I'm okay ... Huh?  I'm at
                      the Canyon Ranch Bar in ...
                          (looks at Ellen)

                                MERLE
                      Phoenix...

                                ELLEN
                      Shut up, Merle... Williams.

                                BETTY
                      Williams, Arizona.  About halfway there,
                      I guess.



     69     INT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - DAY                              69

            Sue Ann is in her kitchen, ignoring the pleas of all three
            children.

                                SUE ANN
                      Halfway where? You've gotta come home.
                      We've been worried sick about you.  Are
                      you alright?

                                BETTY (V.O.)
                      Sue Ann, I thought you of all people
                      would back me up on this, you know what
                      Del's like.  How did he take my note?

                                SUE ANN
                      Betty, honey, listen to me.  A man came
                      by from Mutual Life Insurance.  He says
                      you've got money comin' to you from Del's
                      policy.
                          (BEAT)
                      Del's life insurance policy-- Are you
                      with me?

                                BETTY (V.O.)
                      What are you talking about?



     70     INT. CANYON RANCH BAR - DAY                             70

            "A REASON TO LOVE" comes back on the TV.

                                BETTY
                      Tell Del I'm sorry.  I left so quick, but
                      I need to do this.

                                SUE ANN (V.O.)
                      Do what?

                                                                   56.


                                BETTY
                      I gotta go.

                                SUE ANN (V.O.)
                      Betty!  Listen to me!  Del is ...

            Betty hangs up.



     71     INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)             71

            David is at a bar staring into his drink. Lonnie is with him.

                                LONNIE
                      How you holding up, amigo?

                                DAVID
                      I just wish I knew why she's doing it.

                                LONNIE
                      Yeah. Women are an unsolved mystery.

                                ELLEN (O.S.)
                      If that little weasel ever walked in here
                      I wouldn't serve him.

                                BETTY (O.S.)
                      I'd slap his face.

                                ELLEN (O.S.)
                      I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he
                      had any.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:



     72     INT. CANYON RANCH BAR - LATER                           72

            There are two empty beer bottles in front of Betty. The THEME
            MUSIC and CLOSING CREDITS of "A Reason to Love" are playing.
            Betty pushes the phone back across the bar.

                                ELLEN
                      Where you headed, Betty?

                                BETTY
                      Los Angeles, California.

                                ELLEN
                      And you called your friend, and she's
                      telling you not to go?
                          (Betty nods)
                      When I went to Europe my friends told me
                      I was crazy.

                                                                   57.


                                BETTY
                      Europe?  The Europe?
                          (laughs)
                      This is my first time out of Kansas.

                                ELLEN
                      I should call you Dorothy.
                          (BEAT)
                      When I left here I went straight to
                      Italy.  Everybody told me not to go.  But
                      I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw
                      Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and
                      goddamnit, I went.

                                BETTY
                      Did you love it?

                                ELLEN
                      Sure I loved it!  It was great.

            Ellen rinses a few glasses as she talks to Betty.

                                ELLEN (CONT'D)
                      Let me tell you something.  I got groped
                      by these Tunisian guys who thought I was
                      a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter
                      than stink the whole time, and I got some
                      kind of weird gum disease from the water.
                      Plus, it ended my marriage--

                                BETTY
                      That's horrible!

                                ELLEN
                      No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad
                      than Merle... I just wear the ring to
                      keep the flies away.  Rome was the best
                      thing I ever did, because I DID IT!  And
                      I swear to you, it changed me.  I've been
                      to Rome, Italy!  I sat every morning at
                      the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino,
                      and watched the pilgrims walk to mass,
                      and no one can ever take that away from
                      me.

            Betty leans across the bar conspiratorially.  She looks at
            Merle to make sure he won't hear her.

                                BETTY
                      I left my husband two days ago.

                                ELLEN
                      Really?

                                                                   58.


                                BETTY
                      I'm getting back with my ex-fianc.  He
                      proposed to me right around here, so I
                      guess this is just sort of a sentimental
                      stop...

                                ELLEN
                      Wait, I thought you said you'd never been
                      outta Kansas...

                                BETTY
                      Oh.  I mean, except for that.
                          (BEAT)
                      Yep.  I'm trading in a car dealer for a
                      heart specialist, so that's pretty
                      good...

                                ELLEN
                      Nice move.  Cedars Sinai?

                                BETTY
                      No.  Loma Vista.

                                ELLEN
                          (laughs)
                      I s'pose his name's David Ravell.

                                BETTY
                          (truly shocked)
                      How did you know?

                                ELLEN
                      What's his real name?

                                BETTY
                      Dr. David Ravell.

                                ELLEN
                      You mean... George McCord, the actor?

                                BETTY
                      No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.

            Ellen looks at Betty.

                                ELLEN
                      Yeah, I know, we just watched him
                      together, remember?  Up there on the TV.
                          (off Betty's earnest look)
                      Good God Almighty ... You're serious.
                      I've heard about people like you.

            Ellen whistles, wipes the bar down to buy a few seconds.
            Merle looks over at Betty, then catches Ellen's eye.

                                                                   59.


                                ELLEN (CONT'D)
                      Piss off, Merle.
                          (to Betty)
                      So how you gonna find him, Betty?

                                BETTY
                      I'll go to the Hospital.

                                ELLEN
                      What if you can't find him?  What if you
                      get out there, and nothing's the way you
                      thought it was gonna be?

                                BETTY
                      Like Rome?

                                ELLEN
                      Worse.

                                BETTY
                      You made out alright.

                                ELLEN
                      Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna
                      be there when I arrived...

            Ellen walks to the end of the bar and starts rinsing glasses.
            After a beat, Betty gets up and moves down close to her.

                                BETTY
                      Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've
                      ever done, but I've gotta do it.

                                ELLEN
                      You take care of yourself then, Betty,
                      and don't let anybody stop you...

                                BETTY
                      To tell you the truth, I can't believe
                      I've made it this far.  It may not be
                      Europe, but I just know there's something
                      special out there for me...

            Ellen looks into Betty's eyes - sees the innocence, the hope
            and enthusiasm - and has to look away. Betty takes it as her
            cue to leave. She smiles, puts two dollars on the bar near
            the phone and leaves.  Ellen stands perfectly still, watching
            the door.

                                MERLE
                      What planet is she from?

                                                                   60.




     73     INT. BETTY'S LESABRE - GRAND CANYON - MOVING - DAY      73

            Betty approaches the GRAND CANYON, driving slowly along the
            South Rim, searching for a specific spot.  Finally, she pulls
            over abruptly. This is it. We can tell by the joy in her
            expression.



     74     EXT. GRAND CANYON - DAY                                 74

            Betty walks to the rail and gazes out at the canyon. Turning
            her head slowly, as if expecting it, she sees DAVID RAVELL
            leaning on the rail about twenty feet away, clutching a
            bouquet of roses.

            Betty starts toward him... he starts toward her... A magic
            moment... Shattered when a black sedan appears, inching its
            way along. She freezes. David vanishes, and ...
            An ELDERLY MAN helps his wife out of the car and snaps her
            picture in front of the canyon.  Betty moves away.



     75     INT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR - KANSAS - MOVING - NIGHT         75

            Charlie and Wesley drive across Kansas farm country.

                                CHARLIE
                      So she gets rid of the asshole and is set
                      for life in the same day.

                                WESLEY
                      You think so?  Joyce says she's timid.

                                CHARLIE
                      Joyce was screwing Del.

                                WESLEY
                      ... among others.

                                CHARLIE
                      I'd say that about torches her
                      credibility, wouldn't you?

                                WESLEY
                      Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell
                      it she'll fuck up.  She's an amateur,
                      just like Del was.

            The CAR PHONE RINGS.  Charlie answers.

                                                                   61.


                                CHARLIE
                      Maybe...
                          (into phone)
                      Yes?

                                SUE ANN (V.O.)
                      Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?

                                CHARLIE
                      Sorry, you've got the wrong number.

            He hangs up.

                                CHARLIE          (CONT'D)
                      No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic
                      type.  Ice water in her veins.  A clear
                      thinker.  Probably a Swede or a Finn.

                                WESLEY
                      A 'Finn?'  What is a Finn?

                                CHARLIE
                      You should read more.  Listen to me.  I
                      think this woman was waiting for a chance
                      to do this, and we gave it to her.  She
                      kept to herself for years, living with a
                      pompous asshole.  Then she sees her
                      opportunity, and BOOM! - she leaves that
                      little mudpatch in the dust.  These
                      heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause
                      that's not their sweet little Betty.
                      Hah!  We've been tracking her for, what,
                      three days and I already understand her
                      better'n most the people in that shitty
                      little burg.

            Charlie pulls out the close-up photo and studies it.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Betty, Betty, Betty...

                                WESLEY
                      So what the fuck's a Finn?

                                CHARLIE
                      Oh, for Chrissakes.  It just means the
                      kind of person who can eat shit for a
                      long time without complaining, then cut
                      their momma's throat and go dancing the
                      same night.

                                WESLEY
                      Like... us?

                                                                   62.


                                CHARLIE
                      No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley.
                      Like a very worthy adversary.



     76     OMIT                                                    76



    76A     INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY                             76A

            Roy approaches his fish tank cautiously.  He leans down and
            looks at the piranha as a TV commercial ends and "A Reason to
            Love" comes on.

            He then returns to his computer, struggling to find the right
            words and to type them with only one hand.  He types a
            little, stares at the screen, then deletes an entire sentence
            one character at a time, hammering on the 'Delete' key.  He
            glances up at the television as the words 'Chloe' and
            'Lonnie' are repeated.



     77     INT. POLICE STATION - BALLARD'S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY   77

            Roy and Sue Ann go straight to Ballard's office, where they
            find him at his desk eating lunch out of tupperware
            containers.  He wears a napkin tucked into his shirt-top.

                                BALLARD
                      What the hell do you want?...  Hey, Sue
                      Ann, what's up?

                                ROY
                      We think we know where Betty is.

                                BALLARD
                      Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?

                                SUE ANN
                      What's with the tupperware, Elden, did
                      Meredith run outta baggies?

                                BALLARD
                      No reason to get a plate dirty.

                                ROY
                      I see you're sticking to the diet Betty
                      put you on...

                                BALLARD
                      Worry about your own goddamn lunch!

                                ROY
                          (excited; to Sue Ann)
                      Tell him what you told me.

                                                                   63.


                                SUE ANN
                      Betty is a big, big fan of the soap
                      opera, "A Reason to Love." Look...

            She tosses a copy of "Soap Opera Digest" on the desk. Ballard
            ignores it and keeps eating.

                                BALLARD
                      Why do I need to see this?  Did he ask
                      you to...?

                                ROY
                      Listen!  I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on
                      T.V.  They're television characters.

                                SUE ANN
                      Betty's in love with Dr. David Ravell,
                      from the show.  What if she's out in Los
                      Angeles looking for him?  The actor, I
                      mean...

                                BALLARD
                      That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

                                ROY
                      Yeah?  Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday
                      from Arizona.

                                BALLARD
                      She said she was in Arizona, did she?

                                ROY & SUE ANN
                      Yes!!

                                BALLARD
                      You people are even more stupid than I
                      thought.  The woman's on the run and
                      she's gonna just phone in her location?

                                SUE ANN
                      Come on, Elden, she's not on the run.
                      Couldn't you at least call the Los
                      Angeles Police Department?

                                ROY
                      You gotta do that much.

                                BALLARD
                      Hey, I'm the law.  I don't gotta do
                      nothing...

                                                                   64.




     78     EXT. FARMHOUSE - OKLAHOMA - DAY                         78

            The Lincoln pulls into the dusty, overgrown driveway and
            front yard of a derelict farm.



     79     INT. FARMHOUSE / KITCHEN - DAY                          79

            The remains of pie and coffee on the table, Charlie and
            Wesley kick back with JERROLD BLAINE and his wife ELIZABETH,
            both in their 80's.  Photos of Betty at various ages lie
            scattered in front of them.

            Charlie holds up a picture of a young Betty in ballerina
            costume posing at the barre.  He studies it intently.

                                ELIZABETH
                      This is Betty at twelve.

                                CHARLIE
                      Very graceful.  Perfect form.

                                ELIZABETH
                      Betty was a lovely child.

                                JERROLD
                      And she always had such spirit!  But,
                      after her mother died...

                                WESLEY
                      Would you say she was ambitious?

                                JERROLD
                      Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl
                      could've accomplished, and she never had
                      it easy.  Never really had a childhood...
                      caring for her father, going to school.

            Charlie admires a photo of Betty, around 18 years old.  He
            continues to rummage through a box of collectibles, pocketing
            a small child's diary when it is convenient.

                                CHARLIE
                      Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such
                      poise, too.
                          (quietly)
                      Very, very impressive...

                                WESLEY
                      Well, then, did you ever get any
                      indication that she wanted to leave her
                      husband?

                                                                   65.


                                ELIZABETH
                      I don't like talking bad about the dead,
                      but now that he's gone I can tell you she
                      put up with things in that marriage I
                      wouldn't have.  And yes, she, of all
                      people, was the one who defended him.
                      And that's why what that sheriff said
                      makes me so angry.

                                CHARLIE
                      What do you mean?

                                ELIZABETH
                      If anyone had paid to have that husband
                      of hers killed, it would have been me.

                                CHARLIE
                          (taking her hand)
                      Mrs. Blaine?  I can tell you right now,
                      without a doubt, that your granddaughter
                      is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.

                                JERROLD
                      You've got to be missing a piece of your
                      soul to kill someone. That's not our
                      Betty...

                                WESLEY
                          (defensive)
                      ... why do you think you have to be
                      missing a piece of your soul to kill
                      somebody?

                                JERROLD
                      Because it ain't natural, young man.

                                WESLEY
                      What are you talking about?  Killing's
                      totally natural.  It's dying that isn't
                      natural...

                                CHARLIE
                          (covering)
                      My partner's still young, Mr. Blaine, and
                      he loves his job.
                          (laughs)
                      He'd like to kill all the criminals
                      himself!
                          (BEAT)
                      Now, if Betty was running from someone,
                      where do you think she'd go?

     83     INT. BETTY'S LESABRE/ EXT. COUNTY USC HOSPITAL - MOVING -83
            AFTERNOON

            Betty drives through Boyle Heights - East L.A., holding a map
            and checking street signs.  She is wearing a brand new
            Nurse's uniform.  Up ahead, she sees the hillside complex of
            L.A. County/USC Hospital.  Hurriedly, she pulls over and
            checks herself in the visor mirror.  She is underwhelmed.

                                BETTY
                      God... I still look like a waitress.



     84     INT. HOSPITAL - CHIEF NURSE'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON        84

            The CHIEF NURSE, a large, dynamic woman in her 50's, faces
            Betty across her desk.

                                CHIEF NURSE
                      Of course, I don't know every doctor who
                      works here...

                                BETTY
                      Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the
                      staff.  You must know him.  He's
                      incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate.
                      He's being sued for sexual assault right
                      now, but--
                          (Off Chief Nurse's look)
                      It's not true.  He was set up.

                                CHIEF NURSE
                      Well, I certainly would have heard about
                      that.

                                BETTY
                      Of course, he's only here two days a
                      week.  He's also on staff over at Loma
                      Vista.

                                CHIEF NURSE
                      ... I don't think I know that hospital.

                                BETTY
                      It's in a very pretty area that gets a
                      lot of sun, has palm trees out front,
                      mountains in the background...

                                CHIEF NURSE
                      Really?  You've just described all of
                      Southern California.

            The Chief Nurse looks at Betty for a moment, then stands
            abruptly, signaling the end of the interview.

                                                                   67.


                                CHIEF NURSE
                                (cont'd)
                      Well, I'm sorry, but I can't even
                      consider you without references or a
                      resume.  And frankly, I don't know how
                      you could have forgotten them.



     85     INT. HOSPITAL / HALLWAY - LATER                         85

            On her way down the hall Betty passes a patient's room when
            the sound of A PERSON MOANING stops her.  She can't help but
            go inside.  A TV plays commercials.

            AN OLDER WOMAN lies in bed, alone and staring at the ceiling.
            Betty looks around and notices several arrangements of
            flowers on a deserted nightstand.  She brings them over to
            the older woman's bedside, positions them, then gently
            strokes her head.

                                BETTY
                      There... you rest now.

            The woman's eyes flutter.  She is disoriented at first, then
            calms as she adjusts to the comforting sight of Betty.  Betty
            takes her hand.

                                OLDER WOMAN
                      Who... who're you?

                                BETTY
                      I'm... I'm Nurse Betty.

            The woman smiles serenely at this and begins to drift off.
            Betty checks her monitors as the opening credits of "A Reason
            to Love" begin to play.

            She glances up at the doorway at the same moment and sees Dr.
            David Ravell standing at the entrance.  He checks the chart
            on the door, smiles warmly at Betty and then moves off.  In a
            flash, Betty is up and after him.

            The THEME MUSIC is her private soundtrack as she checks out
            every man in surgical scrubs, looking for David Ravell.
            Then... She sees him.  In all his glory at the end of a
            corridor walking away from her.  Betty gives chase.  She
            gains steadily on him, her heart racing.  As they near
            Emergency the NOISE LEVEL picks up.
            He stops at the nurses' station.  Betty closes the gap.  She
            starts to run.

                                BETTY (CONT'D)
                      DAVID!!!

                                                                   68.


            He turns to face her ... It's not David Ravell.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      Sorry, I thought you were someone else.
                          (BEAT)
                      Do you know Dr. David Ravell?

            The man shakes his head.  Betty keeps going, looking around:
            it's incredible - the size, the activity, the intensity.



     86     INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY AREA - SAME TIME              86

            DOZENS OF PATIENTS lie on gurneys awaiting treatment in a
            holding area.  It's still more intense at the entrance:
            VOICES talking back and forth urgently, POLICE OFFICERS,
            CIVILIANS, DOCTORS AND NURSES converging.



     87     EXT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY AREA - LATE AFTERNOON         87

            FIVE AMBULANCES unload patients at the same time.  At that
            moment a group of TWENTY JAPANESE HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS
            reaches the E.R. portion of their tour.

            A WHITE MERCEDES tears up the ramp and SCREECHES to a stop.
            A YOUNG MAN in gang colors is pushed out, bleeding heavily.
            A DOCTOR runs at the Mercedes to head it off, yelling
            indignantly.  The car plows right into him and takes off.
            Another ambulance crests the ramp, lights flashing.  The
            Mercedes SLAMS into it head-on.  NURSES AND DOCTORS run into
            the parking lot. A GANGBANGER gets out of the Mercedes, dazed
            and wobbly.  He pulls a pistol.  Everyone dives for cover.

            The Mercedes driver is unconscious. The driver of the smashed
            up ambulance is slumped over the wheel.  The rear doors fly
            open, and a young Hispanic woman, ROSA HERRERA, leaps out.

                                ROSA
                      SOMEBODY HELP US!  PLEASE, SOMEBODY!

            Doctors and nurses work on patients and try to get to the
            injured doctor, but the kid with the gun keeps them away.
            SECURITY GUARDS draw their guns and scream at him to drop it.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      WHY ISN'T ANYBODY HELPING US?!!
                          (to gunman in Spanish)
                      Hey, you little shit!  If I had a gun I'd
                      shoot you right now!

            The loading area is jammed with panicked people.  Doctors and
            nurses creep out of the hospital on all fours, trying to stay

                                                                   69.

            low.  No one is getting to Rosa, whose frantic eyes find
            Betty.  They look right at each other.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      What are you standing there for?!

            Betty walks toward her calmly, indifferent to the danger as
            Rosa pulls the gurney out of the ambulance herself.  A
            PARAMEDIC lies unconscious inside.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      You gotta help him, he's hurt bad!!

            On the gurney is a YOUNG MAN with a chest wound, nearly dead
            from blood loss.  A DOCTOR appears and quickly examines him
            while keeping one eye on the gunman.  He looks up at Betty.

                                DOCTOR #1
                      Forget it!  He doesn't have a chance.
                      Help us over here.

            The doctor takes off.  Rosa looks at Betty, crying.

                                ROSA
                      Please!

            Betty hesitates, then checks his pulse - he has none.  She
            peels back the bandages over a huge chest wound.

                                ROSA (CONT'D)
                      Danny, it's gonna be all right!

            Betty looks at Rosa again; looks around for help - there's no
            one.  She plunges her fingers into the wound.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                          (panic)
                      What are you doing?

                                BETTY
                      He has no heartbeat!

                                ROSA
                      You're hurting him!!

                                BETTY
                      I'm massaging his heart.  I saw it done
                      once.

                                ROSA
                      ARE YOU CRAZY?!!  STOP IT!!!

                                BETTY
                      LISTEN TO ME!  IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S
                      DEAD!

                                                                   70.


            She keeps working on him.  We hear a GUNSHOT, and the kid
            with the pistol falls to the pavement.  The loading area
            immediately fills with DOCTORS, NURSES and COPS.

                                BETTY (CONT'D)
                      All right, we're moving him inside!  Give
                      me a hand!

            Rosa is shocked into motion. Together they wheel Danny toward
            the entrance.  A DOCTOR and TWO NURSES come out to take over.
            Betty, her white uniform now covered in blood, steps aside.



     88     INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - LATER                  88

            The DOCTOR tries to calm Rosa and keep her from entering the
            treatment area.

                                ROSA
                      Is he gonna live?

                                DOCTOR
                      He's got a chance.  Thanks to what that
                      nurse did.

            They exit together as AN ADMINISTRATOR and several Japanese
            officials approach.  The Chief Nurse hovers nearby.

                                ADMINISTRATOR
                          (to Chief Nurse)
                      Harriet?  Who is that remarkable nurse?

                                CHIEF NURSE
                      That's Betty Sagamore.  I hired her
                      today.



     89     INT. CHEAP HOTEL - NIGHT                                89

            SEVERAL LOW LIFES are hanging out in the lobby.  When Betty
            comes in with a bag of groceries they look up, ready to
            hassle her as she approaches the DESK CLERK.

                                BETTY
                      May I have my key, please?

            She puts the bag on the counter, revealing that the front of
            her white uniform is covered with blood.  She smiles at the
            low lifes, stopping them in their tracks.



     90     INT./EXT. MOTEL ROOM - HOUSTON, TEXAS - DAY             90

            The Town Car's looking a little muddy around the rims.
            Charlie and Wesley look tired as they wait in a seedy motel

                                                                   71.

            room.  Charlie sits near a window, reading diary entries
            aloud.  Wesley kicks back on the bed, fast-forwarding through
            "Genghis Kunt" and talking back to the screen.

                                WESLEY
                      Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.
                          (BEAT)
                      What time're they coming?

                                CHARLIE
                      It's not an exact science, Wesley.  He
                      said they'll be here... My Houston
                      contact has always been very reliable.

                                WESLEY
                      And then we're gonna do her right here.
                      Right?

                                CHARLIE
                      You're always so coarse... "Do her right
                      here."  Let's just see what happens,
                      okay?
                          (reading)
                      "I wish that I could find a way; To speak
                      my thoughts on Mother's Day.  There are
                      no words that quite express; My gratitude
                      or happiness.  A pleasant smile perhaps a
                      kiss; I would not fail to give her this.
                      I'd make her glad the whole day through;
                      By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!'  P.S. I
                      wish I could say this to my mother's
                      face, but I can't anymore."

            Wesley rolls his eyes and turns up the volume.  Finally a car
            pulls up outside and Charlie snaps the book closed.  He makes
            a quick attempt to arrange himself and motions to Wesley, who
            turns off the tape.

            A WOMAN with greasy blonde hair and skinny legs shown off by
            a short skirt comes in with another MAN.  Charlie looks her
            over disgustedly as his face falls.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Who are you?!
                          (to the man)
                      What the... Who the hell is this?

                                MAN #1
                      Easy, Charlie!  She's exactly who you
                      said you were looking for.

                                CHARLIE
                      Wait, wait a minute.  We have a major
                      miscommunication here.  This not Betty.
                      This is not even close to Betty...

                                                                   72.


                                WOMAN
                      What the fuck're you talking about?  My
                      name's Betty...

                                CHARLIE
                      Then I'm sorry... Wrong Betty.

                                WESLEY
                      Let's get out of here.  We got another
                      long drive ahead of us.
                          (BEAT)
                      ... the fuck where I do not know, but I
                      know it's gonna be long.

                                CHARLIE
                          (gathering his things)
                      Betty would never dress like that.  She's
                      not some trailer park slut!

                                WOMAN
                      Fuck you!

                                CHARLIE
                      And she doesn't have a sewer for a
                      mouth...

                                WESLEY
                      Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in
                      touch...

                                CHARLIE
                      ... She's got class, and poise.  Lots of
                      poise...

            The man looks at Charlie, then at Wesley, who shrugs in reply
            as he steers them out the door.

                                WESLEY
                      Will you ease off on the 'poise' shit,
                      you're spooking me here...



     91     INT. HOSPITAL - CHIEF NURSE'S OFFICE - DAY              91

            The Chief Nurse sits behind her desk.  Betty faces her like a
            student in the principal's office, now dressed in her white
            waitress uniform.  She hopes no one notices.

                                CHIEF NURSE
                      What you did yesterday was reckless at
                      best.  You are not an employee of this
                      hospital!  If that boy dies I don't even
                      want to think of the lawsuit that'll
                      follow.  Are we communicating here?

                                                                   73.


                                BETTY
                      Yes, ma'am.

                                CHIEF NURSE
                      Good.  I'm prepared to offer you a job.
                      You can help out in the pharmacy until
                      your California certification and
                      references arrive, but you are not to
                      touch anyone.  Is that totally clear?
                          (Betty nods)
                      Fine...

            The Chief Nurse gets up, and Betty follows suit.

                                CHIEF NURSE
                                (cont'd)
                      You can start tomorrow.  And don't say a
                      word about this to anyone.
                          (studying Betty's uniform)
                      Is that issue?

                                BETTY
                      Umm... yes.  Back home.

                                CHIEF NURSE
                      Alright.  Oh, and one more thing about
                      what you did yesterday... Well done.



     92     INT. HOSPITAL - INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - DAY               92

            Danny Herrera is in bed unconscious.  Rosa and her MOTHER are
            keeping vigil when Betty enters. Rosa jumps to her feet.

                                ROSA
                      Hey, it's Supernurse!  Betty, right?

            Rosa hugs her and tells her mother in Spanish who Betty is.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      My mother doesn't speak English.

            Sra. Herrera smiles at Betty and starts to cry.  As she steps
            forward, Rosa stands aside. The short, stocky woman envelops
            Betty in a bearhug.

                                MOTHER
                      No podremos olvidar lo que hizo ayer.

                                ROSA
                          (translating)
                      We can't forget what you did yesterday
                      ... How can my family ever repay you?

                                                                   74.


                                BETTY
                      Tell her I was just--

                                MOTHER
                      Yo s que es su empleo, pero...

                                ROSA
                      She doesn't care if it was just your
                      job...  Danny would be dead now but for
                      you.

            Sra. Herrera kisses Betty's hands and smiles through her
            tears.  Then she motions to Rosa to take her place as she
            goes to Danny's bedside. Betty picks up Danny's chart and
            reads it.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      You don't sound like you're from here.

                                BETTY
                      I'm not.  I just drove in from Kansas.

                                ROSA
                      So why'd you come to L.A.?

                                BETTY
                      I came for love.  My fianc  is here.

                                MOTHER
                      Bravo! Mi hija no hace nada para amor...

                                ROSA
                      You're making me look bad... My mother
                      says I wouldn't move across the street
                      for love.

                                BETTY
                      It's something I had to do.  For David.

                                ROSA
                      'David.'  That's your guy.  So, you
                      staying with him?

            THE ICU NURSE enters and adjusts the bank of machines
            feeding, medicating and monitoring Danny. Betty watches with
            interest.

                                BETTY
                      No... I don't really know where he is
                      yet.  I'm at a hotel around the corner.

                                ROSA
                      Man, that is love.

                                                                   75.


                                MOTHER
                      Ella debe quedar contigo.

                                ROSA
                      What?  Ahh, Mom says you should stay with
                      me... Okay, yeah, why not?

            Betty looks at Sra. Herrera curiously.

                                ROSA (CONT'D)
                      You can go get your stuff right now. I'll
                      walk you down.

                                BETTY
                      No, that's not, I couldn't...

                                ROSA
                      Listen, when someone does the kind of
                      thing you did, you gotta do something in
                      return.  So, you stay with me until you
                      find your David and live happily ever
                      after.  Okay?

            Rosa follows Betty out the door.



     93     EXT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                           93

            Betty and Rosa make their way up the stairs of a Silverlake
            apartment house.

            At the sound of SCREECHING TIRES they both look down as a
            black Lincoln Town Car drives by.  Betty shudders.

                                ROSA
                      You okay?  This neighborhood, you get
                      used to it...

            She nods. Rosa continues to talk as they climb the many
            stairs that lead to her door.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      I got this apartment with a guy.

                                BETTY
                      The one you were telling me about?

                                ROSA
                      No, this one was worse...I had to have
                      the place sprayed when he left.  Twice...
                      He was two guys before the last one--not
                      counting a little office thing in there,
                      which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it
                      gets out, I'm on the street...

                                                                   76.




     94     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME                       94

            The place is neat.  As well furnished as a legal assistant's
            salary will allow.  The living room is dominated by a large
            glass tank filled with tropical fish.  Betty checks out the
            space.

                                BETTY
                      It's lovely...I really like your
                      aquarium.

                                ROSA
                      Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your
                      razor or pee on the seat...

                                BETTY
                      Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty
                      tough go of it with men...

                                ROSA
                      Oh, I dunno...but just once I wish I'd
                      run into a guy who noticed the Koi before
                      my tits.

            Betty smiles, a little embarrassed.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      ...come on, I'll show you your room.



     95     EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - THE NEXT DAY                       95

            The black Lincoln Town Car is parked on a lonely stretch of
            prairie highway.  Wesley sits in the passenger seat with the
            door open. The RADIO is on. Charlie is on his cell phone
            nearby.

                                CHARLIE
                          (into phone)
                      No, we don't know where she is... I
                      understand... No, we'll find her...
                          (BEAT)
                      I understand.

            He hangs up and looks out at the horizon, where huge black
            storm clouds are gathering.  Then he walks slowly to the hood
            of the car, staring at the ground in front of his feet.

                                WESLEY
                      What'd they say?  Can we go back to
                      Detroit?

            Charlie rests his hands gently on the hood, as if considering
            buying the car.  Wesley's MUSIC BANGS from the radio.

                                                                   77.


                                CHARLIE
                      They said find it.  Find her, find it.
                      Finish the job you were paid to do.

                                WESLEY
                      Half.

                                CHARLIE
                      What?

                                WESLEY
                      They paid us half.  They still owe us
                      half...

                                CHARLIE
                          (disappointed)
                      There it is again.  That lousy attitude
                      that got us here in the first place.
                      That "make a statement," do an end zone
                      dance, shake your ass and sue everybody
                      in sight attitude that's dragging this
                      whole country down the drain.
                          (BEAT)
                      They don't owe us shit, Wesley!  WHEN YOU
                      FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!!  WE
                      HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!

            Charlie POUNDS on the hood of the car, scaring Wesley.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      That woman could be in any one of four
                      states.  Four big states where the deer
                      and the antelope play, Wesley!  We're not
                      in Rhode Island!

                                WESLEY
                      I know that.

                                CHARLIE
                      AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!

            Wesley switches it off.  Charlie turns his back to the car
            and addresses the angry clouds on the horizon.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Do I deserve this?  In the twilight of my
                      career, do I deserve this?  I don't think
                      so!  I've always tried to do what's
                      right.  I never took out anybody who
                      didn't have it coming.  I'm a
                      professional!
                          (BEAT)
                      AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I?  I'M IN
                      PURGATORY!

                                                                   78.


                                WESLEY
                      Worse... you're in Texas.

                                CHARLIE
                      Well, I should be in FLORIDA now!  If
                      Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones
                      removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be
                      on my way to the Keys.  On my boat,
                      RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!!  Re-ti
                      red!

            The first raindrops begin to fall.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      I'm very tired, Wesley!  I've worked
                      hard, and the work should be over, but
                      IT'S NOT!  This job is just beginning.
                          (he turns around)
                      GET IN THE CAR!

            Wesley is in the car, but he's too scared to tell Charlie,
            whose eyes are blazing.  Charlie silently walks around to the
            driver's side and gets in.  He and Wesley stare at each other
            over a photo of Betty, which is between them on the dash.
            Charlie starts the engine and snatches up the picture.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      What're you thinking, girl?  What's going
                      on in that pretty little mind of yours?
                      Huh?  You can tell me...

            He paws at the picture, imploringly.  He mutters to himself.
            Wesley shakes his head and stares out.



     96     INT. HOSPITAL - PHARMACY - DAY                          96

            Betty sits in an office along with a CLERK who taps away at a
            computer keyboard while she studies a printed list of names.

                                BETTY
                      I can't find Loma Vista Hospital...

                                CLERK
                      I never heard of Loma Vista Hospital.

                                BETTY
                      I don't believe this!  You're the second
                      person here who's told me that.  That's
                      like Ford saying they never heard of GM!

                                CLERK
                      Try another county...

                                                                   79.


            He exits.



     97     INT. LAW FIRM - LATER                                   97

            Rosa is on the phone at her desk in a law office.

                                BETTY (V.O.)
                      Hey, Rosa...it's Betty. How do you get to
                      this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange
                      County...

                                ROSA
                      Tustin?  Take the Hollywood Freeway to
                      the Five...

                                BETTY (V.O.)
                      The Five?

                                ROSA
                      Just look for the really crowded road and
                      follow that.

                                BETTY (V.O.)
                      Okay...oh, umm, would you mind if I
                      borrowed some clothes?

                                ROSA
                      Huh?  Sure, look in my closet, take any
                      dress you want!
                          (BEAT)
                      We're still on for tonight, right?



     98     INT. EXAMINING ROOM - LATER                             98

            Betty stands in a sexy pink dress, trying to decide if she
            should put on a hospital gown and waits, tensing each time
            she hears a voice from the hallway.  Finally, the DOORKNOB
            BEGINS TO TURN.

            A man's hand and the bottom of a white sleeve appear.  The
            door swings open and a silver-haired, bespectacled DOCTOR in
            his mid-60's enters.  The nametag on his white coat reads
            "DAVID RAVELL, M.D."



     99     INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                                  99

            Tasteful jazz, plenty of red leather booths.  Betty winds her
            way through a PACKED CROWD, passing out small white cards.
            Rosa spots her and goes over to meet her.

                                                                   80.


                                ROSA
                      You made it! Hey, that looks great on
                      you.  'S classy... (BEAT) So, how'd it go
                      today? You find him?

                                BETTY
                      Ummm...no, no. Different 'Ravell.'

            Rosa starts to lead her to the bar.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      You know, the more I think about it, this
                      really isn't David's kind of place.

                                ROSA
                      What are you talking about?  This bar is
                      packed with professional people!
                          (BEAT)
                      Everybody says if you're going to get
                      married, this is the spot to meet
                      someone...  Luckily, I'm currently off
                      men, so I've got the luxury of not giving
                      a shit.

                                BETTY
                      I know what you mean, I recently had some
                      trouble with a man, a different man...and
                      David's still getting over Leslie.
                          (off Rosa's look)
                      His wife.

                                ROSA
                      He has a wife?!

                                BETTY
                      Had. She died in a car accident last
                      year.  She was decapitated.

                                ROSA
                      God, that's awful!

                                BETTY
                      It may not have been an accident.  They
                      never did find her head...

                                ROSA
                      Her 'head'?! You're making this up...

                                BETTY
                      No, no! Well, see, she was having an
                      affair with a Russian diplomat who I
                      believe was mixed up with the Mafia...

                                                                   81.


                                ROSA
                      Jesus, I thought my love life was
                      crazy...

            LATER

            Rosa and Betty are sitting in a booth, talking over drinks.
            The place is a little quieter now.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      ... so, we'll hit the library first and
                      fan out from there.  They've got all the
                      L.A. phone books, plus medical
                      directories...
                          (BEAT)
                      We're not gonna let him hide from you any
                      more, okay? I'm making this my personal
                      mission.

                                BETTY
                      David isn't hiding from me, I left him
                      standing at the altar six years ago and
                      now I'm...

                                ROSA
                      Fuck the details, they're always to
                      blame...  Look, too many of these guys
                      duck out on us, especially after they
                      become doctors or lawyers.  I see it at
                      my company all day long!  So I'm just
                      gonna make sure you get your, you know,
                      fairy tale ending or whatever...
                          (BEAT)
                      One of us should.

                                BETTY
                      Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all
                      this for me...thank you.

            Rosa glances over to see Betty pass a business card to A
            WAITER who checks on them.  When he is safely gone, Rosa
            touches Betty on the sleeve.

                                ROSA
                      Hey, how 'bout a card for me?  What is
                      that?
                          (takes one, reads)
                      "Please call if you have any information
                      on David Ravell."  This is my phone
                      number!  How many of these have you given
                      out?

                                BETTY
                      How many men have I talked to?

                                                                   82.


                                ROSA
                      Jesus!  They're all gonna be calling me!

                                BETTY
                      You said in L.A., anything goes.

                                ROSA
                      I was talking about what you could wear!



    100     EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - THE NEXT DAY                     100

            The Town Car's parked on a barren stretch of desert highway,
            white smoke billowing from the hood.  Half a mile ahead
            Charlie and Wesley are walking in the sweltering heat.

            They're in their shirtsleeves, drenched in sweat as the sun
            beats down on them.

                                CHARLIE
                      See, in a LeSabre Betty's probably
                      getting twenty-two, maybe twenty-five
                      miles to the gallon, where we're topping
                      out at fifteen.
                          (BEAT)
                      She's probably all cool and fresh, and
                      comfortable in that nice air-conditioned
                      car right now.

            Wesley wipes the sweat from his eyes and trudges on in
            silence. Charlie takes out a photo of Betty and speaks to it.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      You don't look comfortable here.  That's
                      'cause you don't like being the center of
                      attention, do you?  Nah. You're like me.

                                WESLEY
                      What the hell's the matter with you?

            Wesley grabs the photo, tears it in half and tosses it. Then
            he starts walking. Charlie is stunned for a moment, but
            recovers quickly. He finds the pieces and stuffs them in his
            pocket, then catches up to Wesley.

                                CHARLIE
                      That was a really shitty thing to do.

                                WESLEY
                      I'm sick of looking at her mother-fucking
                      face.

            A beat... they walk for a moment.

                                                                   83.


                                CHARLIE
                      Don't talk like that.  She's my last one,
                      Wesley, my final target.
                          (to photo)
                      Don't you realize your special, that you
                      represent something?

            This is too much.  Wesley explodes.

                                WESLEY
                      What?  What does she represent?!  What
                      could some cornbread white bitch from
                      Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up
                      and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly
                      mean to you?!!  I'd just love to know...

                                CHARLIE
                      I dunno... something.
                          (BEAT)
                      Why is she doing this to me?  Why?...

                                WESLEY
                      I don't know, but when we find her she's
                      gonna die for it.

   102A     INT. ROADSIDE GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON                 102A

            The Lincoln Town Car is raised up high on the hydraulic jack.
            Wesley is at a pay phone out front.

                                WESLEY
                      Can you describe her to me?... Okay...
                      Yeah, that sounds like her... Thanks.

            He hangs up and goes into the garage, where he addresses the
            Town Car above him.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      They found her in Vegas.

            No answer.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      Perfect match on the description.

            ON CHARLIE

            Lying across the front seat taping the reassembled photo of
            Betty to the dash.  Charlie's beginning to come apart.  His
            hair is uncombed and his clothes are wrinkled.  His eyes have
            a thousand-yard stare.

                                                                   84.


                                WESLEY (O.S.)
                                (CONT'D)
                      Sounds like she's with the buyer Del
                      lined up.

            Charlie pulls himself up on the door and looks down.

                                CHARLIE
                      How'd they describe her?

                                WESLEY
                      You know, blonde, thin, whatever...

                                CHARLIE
                      Not so fast!  Slower... 'blonde, thin',
                      yes... Did they say she had style?  A
                      kind of grace or anything?

            Wesley rolls his eyes, then goes straight to the levers
            controlling the hydraulic jack.

                                WESLEY
                          (to mechanic)
                      How do I get this fucking thing down?

                                MECHANIC
                      I wouldn't if I were you.  He got pretty
                      upset when I tried it...



    103     INT. LAW OFFICE - A DIFFERENT DAY                      103

            MERCEDES LOPEZ, early 40's, impeccably dressed, enters her
            office loaded down with a bulging briefcase and a stack of
            files under her arms.
            (The entire scene is in Spanish.)

                                MERCEDES
                      What do you think my father would do if I
                      told him I didn't want to be a lawyer
                      anymore?

                                ROSA
                      Probably the same thing my mom would do
                      if I got engaged... have a heart attack.

                                MERCEDES
                      So how's it going with your new roomie?
                      What's her name?

                                ROSA
                      Betty.  It's O.K. except I'm worn out.
                      We spent all weekend looking for her

                                                                   85.

                      doctor-boy.  How can a big time heart guy
                      leave no trace of himself?

                                MERCEDES
                      So tell her to settle for the old one in
                      Orange County.

                                ROSA
                      She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of
                      ideas.

                                MERCEDES
                      Maybe we're suing him for malpractice.
                      What's his name again?

                                ROSA
                      David Ravell.

                                MERCEDES
                      God, that sounds so familiar.  Ravell,
                      Ravell... where's he out of?

                                ROSA
                      I'm not sure now.  She said he used to be
                      over at Loma Vista.  I never heard of it.

                                MERCEDES
                      Loma Vista?
                          (laughs)
                      You mean like the guy on "A Reason to
                      Love?"



    104     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LATER                          104

            Rosa enters, tosses her purse on the table and goes straight
            to the VCR.  Written in magic marker on a video is "A Reason
            to Love, Apr. 23."  The tape Sue Ann gave to Betty.
            She pops it in and turns it on. The OPENING TITLES start ...
            The characters appear ... one is an impossibly handsome man
            over the title "DOCTOR DAVID RAVELL."



    105     INT. HOSPITAL PHARMACY - LATER STILL                   105

            Betty working at a desk in the pharmacy.  The same clerk as
            before busies himself at another counter.  Rosa appears at
            the glass partition and raps urgently on it.

                                ROSA
                      Guess who I saw today.

                                BETTY
                      Who?

                                                                   86.


                                ROSA
                      Doctor David Ravell.

                                BETTY
                      What?  Where was he?!

                                ROSA
                      ON TELEVISION!!
                          (off Betty's puzzled look)
                      Cut the shit, will you!

            A BEAT.  Rosa SLAMS the videotape down on the counter.

                                ROSA (CONT'D)
                      Either you're making a fool out of me
                      because you get off on it, or you got
                      serious problems.  Which one is it?!

                                BETTY
                      I have no idea what you're talking about.

                                ROSA
                      I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!

                                BETTY
                      Shhh!  I heard you the first time.

                                ROSA
                          (suddenly calm)
                      I spent my weekend looking for someone
                      who does - not - exist.  I should have
                      been here at the hospital with my
                      brother, but I was with you.

                                BETTY
                      If you didn't want to do it, you should
                      have said so!  Is this about gas money?

                                ROSA
                      IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!
                          (BEAT)
                      You have a thing for an actor on a stupid
                      white soap opera, and we searched all
                      over town for his character!  Not the
                      actor - whose name is George, by the way.
                      His character!

            Rosa stands over Betty, fuming.

                                BETTY
                      Are you having a nervous breakdown?

            Rosa SCREAMS and smacks her hand on the glass as Betty
            watches.  SEVERAL PEOPLE in a nearby lounge look up.  Rosa
            stares at them until they look away.

                                                                   87.


                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      Why'd you help me in the first place?

                                ROSA
                      I helped you because I'm an idiot!  Ask
                      my mother, I love it when people take
                      advantage of me!  I TRUSTED YOU!! I
                      THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!

                                BETTY
                      HE IS REAL!!

            Betty tries to return to her work but Rosa confronts her
            loudly.  The nearby VISITORS and STAFF pretend to be busy.

                                ROSA
                      You need help, Betty! Even if this is
                      your idea of a joke, you need SERIOUS
                      HELP!!
                          (walking away - to herself)
                      Necesitas un mdico! Pront simo!

            ON BETTY

            fuming in her humiliation.  After a moment, Rosa reappears at
            the window.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      I'm not going back on our arrangement. My
                      word is good, and my family owes you. But
                      I think it's best for both of us if you
                      get your own place as soon as you can.

                                BETTY
                      Fine.

   106A     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - KANSAS - NIGHT                 106A

            Roy and Joyce approach the door to the trailer/office.  She
            takes out her key, then stops. It's been padlocked and barred
            with yellow police tape, as is the whole lot.  Roy pulls hard
            on the lock, then starts looking around.

                                JOYCE
                      You're wastin' your time, Roy.

                                ROY
                      Look Joyce, I need your key to the files,
                      not advice, okay?  This is a complex
                      case.

                                                                   88.


            Roy works on opening a side window.

                                JOYCE
                      Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead,
                      Betty's gone.  She's probably dead, too.

                                ROY
                      You'd like that wouldn't you?  You've
                      hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad
                      together...

                                JOYCE
                      No... before that.

                                ROY
                      Ahh, I hate this town!  Places like this
                      just make you small...
                          (BEAT)
                      I should have never come back here after
                      college.

                                JOYCE
                      Blah - blah - blah...  Hurry up, will ya,
                      I got a date tonight...

            Roy forces the glass open and starts to squirm through the
            window as Joyce watches.

                                JOYCE (cont'd)
                      I don't know what you think you'll find,
                      anyway.

                                ROY (O.S.)
                      Names, a phone number, something...
                          (BEAT)
                      Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who
                      brought the missing car down from Detroit
                      was murdered, but do you see him doing
                      anything about it?  If Ballard wasn't
                      such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to
                      be breaking in here...

            The color drains from Joyce's face.

                                JOYCE
                      What did you say?

                                ROY (O.S.)
                      The driver was killed. I think there's a
                      connection--

                                JOYCE
                          (starting to cry)
                      No, about... Are you talking about Duane
                      Cooley?

                                                                   89.


                                ROY (O.S.)
                      Yeah.  Why, you know him?

                                JOYCE
                          (crying)
                      Know him?  We were gonna get married! He
                      was gonna leave his wife for me!
                      Fuck!!...

            Joyce begins to sob at the side of the trailer as Roy
            shimmies through the window frame.

            Suddenly, Ballard is there, weapon cocked and placed roughly
            into Roy's privates.  Joyce backs away.

                                BALLARD
                      I know you don't use them, but if you
                      wanna keep 'em you'll back out of there
                      slowly...



   106B     INT. SQUADCAR - MOVING - NIGHT                        106B

            Roy is in the rear of the car, handcuffed to the screen
            dividing the front seat from the back. Ballard is driving.

                                ROY
                      Come on, Elden, think about it.  The
                      driver, all them trunks standing open
                      like that... something's going on here!

                                BALLARD
                      I know that...

                                ROY
                      Well, do something, then, damnit!

                                BALLARD
                      You watch your mouth when you're in a
                      goddamn county vehicle... You don't think
                      I see what's going on?  Del, now this
                      Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with
                      Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some
                      episode off the X-Files... 's just a
                      crime of passion, plain and simple.
                      Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral
                      rampage, that's what is going on here.

            A moment of silence as they drive.

                                ROY
                      Oww... Did you have to make these things
                      so tight?

                                                                   90.


                                BALLARD
                      No, I didn't have to.

            He grins at Roy in the rearview mirror.



    107     INT. LAW FIRM - ANOTHER DAY                            107

            Mercedes Lopez arrives at the office and stops at Rosa's
            desk.

            (The entire scene is in Spanish)

                                MERCEDES
                      Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that
                      soap opera guy?

                                ROSA
                      Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that
                      actor just to see the look on her face,
                      watch her bubble burst in mid-air.

            Mercedes hands her two tickets to a benefit.

                                MERCEDES
                      Here's your needle... He's supposed to
                      make an appearance here tonight.



    108     INT. BETTY'S BEDROOM - LATER                           108

            Betty's lying on her bed reading "Modern Nurse".  The L.A.
            Times Classifieds are open on the bed.  Rosa looks in.

                                BETTY
                      Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a
                      tiny break.

                                ROSA
                      This is crazy.  I come home, you go to
                      your room.  You go in the kitchen, I go
                      to my room.  It's stupid.

            Betty nods in agreement.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      So what do you say?  Can we be friends?

                                BETTY
                      ...okay.

            Rosa smiles and starts looking at the tickets in her hand.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      What are those for?

                                                                   91.


                                ROSA
                      Oh, it's a charity dinner.  The money
                      goes to a good cause, but I don't have
                      anybody to go with...

                                BETTY
                      Umm...

            Rosa exits for a moment, then reappears in the doorway.

                                ROSA
                      ...you hungry at all?



    109     INT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON        109

            The car is covered in dust and mud from the road. It's worse
            inside: food wrappers, empty bottles, pieces of clothing,
            filthy windows.  They've been living in it.

            Wesley's driving now. Charlie's almost unrecognizable: a six
            day beard, uncombed greasy hair, bloodshot eyes, rumpled
            clothes and an exhausted, faraway look.  The photo of Betty
            faces him, taped to the glove box.  He is reading from the
            diary, which he clutches like the Bible.
            They roar along a desert highway, passing a sign that says
            "Grand Canyon, This Exit.  74 Miles."  Charlie looks up,
            marking his place.

                                CHARLIE
                      We should go.

                                WESLEY
                      We don't have time to look at a hole in
                      the ground.  We can make Vegas in four
                      hours.  This one's got to be her.

                                CHARLIE
                      It's a very moving experience, trust me.

                                WESLEY
                      No.

                                CHARLIE
                      One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the
                      World.

                                WESLEY
                      No... be dark before we get there.  You
                      wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?

                                CHARLIE
                      What difference does it make?  She wasn't
                      in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We

                                                                   92.

                      went to every goddamn place Del mentioned
                      and no Betty.  So what the hell makes you
                      think she's in Vegas?  You think she's
                      waiting for us with tassles on her
                      titties?  Vegas is too crass for Betty.

                                WESLEY
                      I said, 'No.'  N-O.

            Charlie turns to a passage and reads aloud.

                                CHARLIE
                      "When I grow up I'm going to become a
                      nurse or a veterinarian.  I always want
                      to help people and value all life, be it
                      animal, plant or mineral..."
                          (to Wesley)
                      Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl
                      to you?

                                WESLEY
                      Do you hear yourself right now...?  Like
                      a fucking madman...

            Wesley drives on stoically.  The Exit comes and goes.

                                CHARLIE
                      Every American should see the Grand
                      Canyon.  Are you an American?

                                WESLEY
                      Yes, I am and we're not going.  Act
                      professional.

            Charlie stares at him, hate rising from just below the
            surface.  He draws a nickel-plated pistol and points it at
            Wesley's head.  Wesley looks at it and keeps on driving.

            Charlie knows this isn't the way to handle it.  He lowers the
            pistol.

                                CHARLIE
                      If you don't take the next turn for the
                      canyon, I'm blowing my goddamn brains all
                      over this car.

            He puts the pistol in his mouth and cocks it.  Wesley looks
            over, not so sure this time.

            LONG SHOT of the black Town Car as the turn signal comes on,
            and it eases onto a lonely dirt road.  Their headlights pick
            out a sign that says: "Grand Canyon Fire Trail.  Forestry
            Personnel Only."

                                                                   93.




    110     EXT. BEVERLY HILTON - EVENING                          110

            Rosa and Betty approach the hotel entrance.  Ahead of them a
            black Lincoln Town Car pulls up. Headlights glint on the
            chrome, hitting Betty in the eye. She freezes, and Rosa bumps
            into her.

                                ROSA
                      Sorry.

            Betty stares at the car, unable to remember what it should
            mean.  Then a MAN in a tuxedo gets out.  Betty moves on.



    111     INT. BEVERLY HILTON - LOBBY - EVENING                  111

            A sign on an easel reads "Save the Children."  Betty and Rosa
            present their tickets at the door to a ballroom.

            Several times there is a stir near the entrance and a
            scattering of flashbulbs.  Rosa scans the crowd.

                                BETTY
                      Looking for someone?

                                ROSA
                      You never know who you'll see.

            Rosa keeps looking.  Finally, GEORGE McCORD - the actor who
            plays DAVID RAVELL - enters.

            He comes in with LYLA BRANCH, late 40's, and TWO OTHER MEN.
            Several women approach George, some starry-eyed, for quick,
            polite greetings.  He's doing his job of being a soap star.

            Rosa waits for an opening, then puts her hands on Betty's
            shoulders and points her at George.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      Look who's here!

            Betty's jaw drops.  She freezes.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      What are you waiting for?   Talk to him!
                      You came fifteen hundred miles for this.

            Rosa prods her, then Betty makes her way unsteadily toward
            George.  When she's a few feet away he looks up.

            He can't help but notice her - she's beautiful.  She's also
            looking right into his eyes.  The conversation stops as he
            does a double take in Betty's direction.

                                                                   94.


                                GEORGE
                      Do I know you from...?

            His friends watch as George studies her face.

                                 BETTY
                      ...of course you do.
                          (hurt)
                      You don't remember me?

                                GEORGE
                      I take it I should.  I'm sorry.

                                BETTY
                      We were engaged.

                                LYLA
                      Oh good, another one...

            George's friends look at each other.  A few heads turn.

                                GEORGE
                      I beg your pardon?

                                BETTY
                      But I'm the one who's sorry.  Letting you
                      go was the biggest mistake of my life.
                          (to his friends)
                      We were thirteen days away from getting
                      married and ... I just got scared. It's a
                      mistake I've had to live with for six
                      years.  But it's behind me now...
                          (to George)
                      And I hope you can put it behind you.
                      I've missed you... David.

            George sighs with relief.  His friends smile.  The tension
            evaporates.  They can handle a fanatical fan.

                                GEORGE
                      That's very kind of you.

                                BETTY
                      The day I left you I just drove and
                      drove.  I drove all day and all that
                      night, and I didn't go anywhere.  I just
                      kept driving.  I stopped at a little
                      country church, and the pastor let me in,
                      and I sat--

                                LYLA
                      ... in the very first pew, where we would
                      have sat on our wedding day.

                                                                   95.


            Betty looks at her.  So does George.

                                LYLA (cont'd)
                      I can't believe I remembered that,
                      although I suppose I should.  I wrote
                      it...
                          (to Betty)
                      But that was seven years ago, and you're
                      quoting it verbatim.  I'm flattered... I
                      think.  Or frightened.   What's your
                      name?

                                BETTY
                      Betty Sizemore.  What do you mean you
                      wrote it?

                                LYLA
                      I'm Lyla Branch.  I'm the Producer.

            They shake hands.  ACROSS THE ROOM Rosa watches expectantly.

                                LYLA (cont'd)
                      Alright, I admit it, you had me there.
                      You're better than most of them,
                      anyway...do you have a headshot?

                                GEORGE
                      No, wait...what happened next, Betty?

                                LYLA
                      Are you sure you want to encourage this?
                          (BEAT)
                      No, you're right, let's have some fun.
                      So, what did happened next, "Betty"?

                                BETTY
                      Well, David moved out here and started
                      his residency.  Then he met Leslie--

                                LYLA
                      No, no, no.  We know all that.  What
                      happened with you?

                                BETTY
                      I married a car salesman.

            The friends laugh.  Rosa watches, confused.  So is Betty.

                                FRIEND #1
                      You were dumped for a car salesman,
                      George!

                                BETTY
                      Why are you calling him George?

                                                                   96.


                                FRIEND #2
                      Yeah - David - tell us about this car
                      salesman.

            George likes the challenge. This party isn't so boring after
            all.

                                GEORGE
                      Oh, you mean Fred.

                                BETTY
                      No, Del.

                                GEORGE
                      Right, Del.  Del was one hot salesman.
                      Of cars.  He could talk anyone into
                      anything.

                                BETTY
                      You knew Del?!

                                GEORGE
                      Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the
                      time, but Del and I go way back.  We went
                      to school together.  In fact, he saved my
                      life.  Two more minutes in that icy water
                      and I would have drowned.  But Del jumped
                      in and grabbed me.  We fell out of touch
                      eventually, but I still owe him one.

                                BETTY
                      He never told me anything about...that's
                      unbelievable!

                                LYLA
                      Funny, that's just what I was thinking...

                                GEORGE
                      I can't tell you how much it hurts me to
                      hear that you married him.

            His friends snicker.  Rosa stares.  Betty is oblivious to
            everything but George.

                                BETTY
                      I'm so sorry.  Life makes us do awful
                      things sometimes.

            She's ready to cry.  Which only inspires him all the more.

                                GEORGE
                      I tried to tell myself it was for the
                      best, that there was a reason behind it.
                      But... Del?

                                                                   97.


                                BETTY
                      There was no plan!  I was just young and
                      stupid and scared!

                                GEORGE
                      You never gave us a chance...

                                BETTY
                      I know that.  I can't tell you how many
                      times I've said that to myself in those
                      exact words.

            Betty wipes her tears away as they flow freely now.  George
            doesn't like seeing her cry; he tries to say something but
            his friends interrupt.

                                GEORGE
                      Hey, don't... come on, I was just...
                      you're not really crying, are you?...  I
                      was just playing along...

                                FRIEND #1
                      Now, look what you've done, George.

                                BETTY
                      Why do they keep calling you George?

                                GEORGE
                      I don't know.  Why do you keep calling me
                      George?

                                LYLA
                      Listen - David - It's getting late.

            George hesitates; Lyla sees it.

                                GEORGE
                          (to Betty)
                      Right, uhh...I feel terrible about this,
                      we have a prior engagement at another
                      party.
                          (BEAT)
                      But... I'd be honored if you'd come.

                                LYLA
                      Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure
                      you got a lot of catching up to do...


            Rosa watches, stunned, as Betty waves to her as she leaves
            arm-in-arm with the man of her dreams.

                                                                   98.




    112     EXT. GRAND CANYON - NIGHT                              112

            The Town Car is parked near one of the viewing stops at the
            rim.  Charlie stands in the darkness, but Wesley stays in the
            car.

                                CHARLIE
                      You don't know what you're missing,
                      asshole.

            Charlie walks toward the canyon rim.  Suddenly, Betty appears
            in the headlights standing at the rail - her back to Charlie -
            with a bouquet of flowers.

            ON WESLEY

            Just as he closes his eyes to rest, the CAR PHONE RINGS.

                                WESLEY
                      Yeah?

                                SUE ANN (V.O.)
                      Mr. Campbell?

                                WESLEY
                      Huh?

                                SUE ANN (V.O.)
                      Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?

                                WESLEY
                          (recovering)
                      Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.

                                SUE ANN (V.O.)
                      It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's
                      friend?  I heard from her.

            ON CHARLIE

            walking toward the rail.  As he nears her, they kiss.

            Suddenly, REPEATED BLASTS from the car horn.

            The image of Betty shudders, then blurs, then fades away
            entirely.  Charlie rubs at his eyes tiredly, then slowly
            trudges back toward the car.

            Charlie returns and gets into the car.  Silence.  Wesley
            stares at him.

                                WESLEY
                      ... you have a good time?  You make a
                      little wish?

                                                                   99.


            Silence from Charlie.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      Well, guess what?  I found Betty... where
                      she's been, anyway.

                                CHARLIE
                      Where?  Where is she?

                                WESLEY
                      I'm not telling.

                                CHARLIE
                      What?

                                WESLEY
                      I'm not telling 'til you straighten up.
                      You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis
                      on me and this shit's gotta stop or you
                      can forget about your Betty... I mean it.

            A slow transformation comes over Charlie.

                                CHARLIE
                      Wesley, I'm fine... just tell me where
                      she is.



    113     EXT. BEVERLY HILTON - NIGHT                            113

            George, Betty, Lyla and the two friends are waiting outside
            the hotel for their cars.

                                FRIEND #2
                      I bought a car from Del, too. He sold me
                      a lemon.

                                LYLA
                      Really?  I put a hundred and thirty
                      thousand miles on mine.

                                BETTY
                      Huh. I had no idea our little lot was so
                      popular...

                                FRIEND #1
                      I never bought a car from Del.  But I
                      loved him.  In my own way.

                                GEORGE
                      I guess we all did. (to Betty) You know,
                      I didn't marry Leslie because I loved
                      her.  I married her to forget you...

                                                                  100.


                                BETTY
                      Oh, David...I'm sorry I caused you that
                      much pain.

            A black jeep 4x4 pulls up and ERIC AUGUSTINO, the actor who
            plays LONNIE, gets out.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      Oh my God!  What's Lonnie doing here?

                                GEORGE
                      You're late, Eric.

                                ERIC
                      I know.  Why are you guys leaving?

                                LYLA
                      We did our twenty minutes.

            Before Eric can take another step Betty SLAPS him across the
            face.  FLASHBULBS go off as PHOTOGRAPHERS capture the moment.

                                BETTY
                      You bastard!  How can you even show your
                      face around here?  Do you think we're not
                      onto you?

                                ERIC
                      Who the hell is this?

                                GEORGE
                      Sorry.  She thinks you're someone else.

            George hustles Betty to his car as photographers continue to
            shoot.

                                BETTY
                      I know exactly who you are!



    114     EXT. CANYON RANCH BAR - NIGHT                          114

            The Lincoln Town Car rumbles into the dusty parking lot and
            parks.

                                CHARLIE
                      This doesn't look like the kind of place
                      Betty would go to.

                                WESLEY
                      Maybe she had to use the bathroom.  She
                      pees, doesn't she?!...

            Wesley tears the photo of Betty from the glove box.

                                                                  101.


                                CHARLIE
                      Be careful with that!

            Charlie takes it back and gingerly secures the tape.



    115     INT. CANYON RANCH BAR - NIGHT                          115

            Merle is at the bar, drunk, the only customer on a slow
            night.  Ellen drops two coasters in front of Charlie and
            Wesley as they sit down.

                                ELLEN
                      What can I get you?

                                WESLEY
                      We're Federal Marshals, ma'am.

            Ellen looks dubiously at their unshaven faces and rumpled
            clothes.

                                CHARLIE
                      We're looking for this young lady.

            He slides the photo of Betty across the bar. Ellen's gaze
            drops to the picture for a second, and Charlie sees what he
            was looking for - a flicker of recognition.  He allows
            himself a satisfied grin.

            Wesley shows Ellen his badge as Merle checks out the photo.

                                ELLEN
                      I haven't seen her.

                                MERLE
                      Sure you have!  That's ...

                                ELLEN
                      Shut up, Merle.

            Charlie continues to grin at Ellen ...

                                WESLEY
                      Ma'am, if you've seen this woman--

                                MERLE
                      Betty!  That's her name - Betty.

            Charlie takes the photo and puts it back in his pocket.

                                ELLEN
                      I never saw that woman before, and
                      neither has Merle.  He drinks too much.
                      And don't try to tell me you're cops.  I

                                                                  102.

                      was married to a cop for nine years, and
                      you're not cops.  Now get out of here.

            Wesley steps behind Merle, takes a handful of his hair and
            SLAMS his head into the popcorn machine on the bar.  Merle
            staggers away, stunned. Wesley removes the tin popcorn scoop
            from a nearby hook.

            Ellen reaches for something under the bar, but Charlie's
            faster.  He pins her arm with one hand.

                                CHARLIE
                      You haven't been very forthcoming with
                      us.

            They watch Wesley follow Merle at a slow walk around the pool
            table, CLOBBERING him over the head about every five steps
            with the popcorn scoop.

            Merle wobbles with every shot, but won't go down.  They begin
            a torturous second lap around the table, punctuated by the
            CLANG of the scoop against Merle's head.

                                CHARLIE
                      What's your name, dear?

                                ELLEN
                      Ellen.

                                CHARLIE
                      That's a nice name.

            After one more CLANGING shot Merle staggers, then falls.
            Wesley walks over to Charlie and Ellen, drawing his knife.

                                WESLEY
                      That's a really nice name...



    116     INT. GEORGE'S RANGE ROVER - MOVING - LATER - NIGHT     116

            George and Betty are alone.

                                BETTY
                      Lyla's very nice.

                                GEORGE
                      Yes, she is.

                                BETTY
                      She told me I was charming and
                      relentless, and would go far in this
                      town.  And she said that unlike the other
                      charming, relentless people she knew, she
                      liked me.

                                                                  103.


                                GEORGE
                      She's a good person to know.
                          (BEAT)
                      So where did you study again?

                                BETTY
                      Carleton School of Nursing.  Two
                      semesters, but Del made me give it up...

                                GEORGE
                      Alright, okay... I think you broke the
                      record for staying in character about
                      three hours ago.

                                BETTY
                      You told me that two hours ago.

            He pulls up in front of Rosa's apartment and parks.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      I haven't been this happy since I was
                      twelve years old.

                                GEORGE
                      What happened when you were twelve?

                                BETTY
                      For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance
                      that I'd been saving to take my mother to
                      Kansas City.  We got our nails done and
                      had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the
                      top of a building from where you can see
                      the whole city.  It was the last outing
                      we took together.  She died the following
                      year.

                                GEORGE
                      Wow ... You just gave me goosebumps, you
                      know that?  You make it all sound so
                      real.  Great improv...

                                BETTY
                      I just want everything to be perfect
                      between us.

                                GEORGE
                      I know. Listen, we need to take a time
                      out here.  Can we talk seriously for a
                      minute?

                                BETTY
                      Of course.

                                                                  104.


                                GEORGE
                      At last!  I know how much you want this.
                      You're gifted and extremely determined,
                      but ... it's not up to me.

                                BETTY
                      I know. It's up to us.

            Betty leans over and kisses George - so deeply that he's too
            surprised to react. She pulls away abruptly and gets out.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      I love you, David.  And I want to see you
                      tomorrow, and the next day, and the next
                      day.

            Still surprised, and now a little intrigued, he watches her
            go inside.



    117     INT. ROSA'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                            117

            Betty comes in and pours a drink from the fridge. Rosa
            appears in a nightshirt behind her, framed in the doorway.

                                ROSA
                      Were you with him this whole time?

                                BETTY
                      Oh, God!  You scared me!  Yes...

                                ROSA
                      You still in love?

            Betty nods.

                                ROSA
                      Does he know you think he's real?

                                BETTY
                      He is real.

                                ROSA
                      Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?

                                BETTY
                      Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out
                      here, what we've both been doing, you
                      know...

                                ROSA
                      No, I'm not sure I could begin to
                      imagine... So, where'd you go?

                                                                  105.


                                BETTY
                      To a party in the Hollywood Hills.

                                ROSA
                      Was it a huge place?  With a view of the
                      whole world?

                                BETTY
                      Yes.  I'd never been in a place like that
                      before.

                                ROSA
                      I have, lots of times.  My mother used to
                      clean them.  I used to piss in their
                      pools.

            Rosa gets up and starts for her bedroom.  She stops.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      This isn't fair, you know.  Do you always
                      get what you want?

                                BETTY
                      No, almost never.

                                ROSA
                      But, you're in love with someone who
                      doesn't exist.  You come here, you meet
                      this guy, who should laugh in your face,
                      and instead you leave with him!
                          (BEAT)
                      Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...

            Rosa goes into her bedroom and closes the door. Betty smiles
            and nods, sipping at her drink as she retires to her room.

    119     INT. POLICE STATION - JAIL CELL - THE NEXT DAY         119

            From his cell Roy Ostrey hears a door open, then the sound of
            approaching footsteps.  It's Ballard.

                                ROY
                      Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is
                      ridiculous, I need medical attention!

                                BALLARD
                      That's a nice name for what you need...

                                                                  106.


                                ROY
                      Come on, I have to get this dressing
                      off...it itches!  And what about my fish?
                      Who is taking care of them?

            Ballard doesn't say anything. He's very grim, subdued.  Roy
            has never seen him like this.

                                BALLARD
                      Just shut up a second and listen... That,
                      uh... that bar in Arizona?  Where you
                      said Betty was?

                                ROY
                      What about it?

                                BALLARD
                      Any idea where it is?

                                ROY
                      Little place called "Williams," why?

                                BALLARD
                      I just got something off the wire. The
                      woman who owns it was murdered last
                      night.
                          (BEAT)
                      Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or
                      nothing, but... what else do you know?

                                ROY
                      I know plenty.



    120     EXT. LYLA'S HOUSE - DAY                                120

            Palatial, spartan.  Lyla is sitting in the inner court of her
            Lloyd Wright home with George at one knee.

                                GEORGE
                      She makes me stretch!  I got inside my
                      character last night like I haven't done
                      in six years on "Reason".  It was a
                      totally rejuvenating experience.

                                LYLA
                      I know, George, I was there.  I'm not
                      denying that she's good.

                                GEORGE
                      She's even taken a job as a nurse!
                          (BEAT)
                      David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.

                                                                  107.


                                LYLA
                      We know that...

                                GEORGE
                      Can I have an evil twin?

                                LYLA
                      No, George, we've already done that with
                      Lonnie.  The blind one last year,
                      remember?

                                GEORGE
                      Oh, of course.  Who can forget the Emmy?
                          (BEAT)
                      Then let me bring Betty to the set and
                      see what happens.

                                LYLA
                      I don't know, George...

                                GEORGE
                      I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do
                      you say?

                                LYLA
                      I'll think about it.

                                GEORGE
                      It'll be like live television!  Let's
                      live on the edge a little.  You and I can
                      break the mold here!

                                LYLA
                      I said I'll think about it.

                                GEORGE
                      Fine, but promise me one thing.  If we
                      use her, I want to direct those episodes.
                      She's my discovery.

                                LYLA
                      Actually, she was my discovery... just
                      like you.

                                GEORGE
                      Hmm?

                                LYLA
                      "Would you like ground pepper on that
                      salad, Ms. Branch?"  Remember?

                                GEORGE
                      ... yeah.

                                                                  108.




   120A     EXT. L.A. FREEWAY - NIGHT                             120A

            The black Lincoln Town car hurdles along the 10 Freeway, a
            revitalized Charlie back at the wheel.  Surrounded by
            traffic, the lights of the city in the distance, the two men
            push on toward their new destination.



    121     EXT. HOLLYWOOD MOTEL - THE NEXT DAY                    121

            The black Lincoln Town Car - now washed and gleaming - is
            parked in front of a modest motel.



    122     INT. HOLLYWOOD MOTEL / BATHROOM - DAY                  122

            Charlie looks like a new man - showered, clear-eyed and
            energized - he's at the sink shaving as Wesley watches from
            his seat on the edge of the bathtub.

                                CHARLIE
                      So you believed the bartender.  Why?

                                WESLEY
                      Well... I think I saw her soul.

                                CHARLIE
                      That's good.  You're learning.  But let
                      me tell you why I know she was lying.
                          (BEAT)
                      First off, Betty would never fall for a
                      soap star.  It's beneath her.

                                WESLEY
                      I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...

                                CHARLIE
                      No, no, Betty came here strictly for
                      business, 'cause it's the biggest market
                      for what she's selling.  I should have
                      known it all along.  I'm kicking myself
                      as I shave here.  So, first thing we...

                                WESLEY
                      Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't
                      make sense.

                                CHARLIE
                      What doesn't?

                                WESLEY
                      You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends
                      theory, you believe that dumbshit
                      trucker, you believe this woman...

                                                                  109.


                                CHARLIE
                      I never said that I believed...

                                WESLEY
                      No, you believed her, we drove all the
                      way to L.A. so that means you trusted her
                      that much... so why's the rest of her
                      story suddenly so kooky?  Huh?

                                CHARLIE
                      'Cause I just don't buy it.  Call it
                      instinct.  Call it 35 years of
                      professional know-how...

                                WESLEY
                      I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat
                      Almond Roca...

                                CHARLIE
                      You need to remember who you're talking
                      to...

                                WESLEY
                      I need to get my goddamn head examined.
                          (BEAT)
                      You can't rule something out on a whim.
                      Or because she's cute.  I've been
                      following your whims all across the U.S.
                      of A. and now I'm tired!  Me!

                                CHARLIE
                      Wesley...

                                WESLEY
                      "It's beneath her..."  She's a mother
                      fucking housewife... nothing's beneath
                      her!

            Wesley stands up for emphasis, pointing a finger in Charlie's
            personal space.  Charlie reacts at this, throwing his razor
            into the sink and turning on Wesley.

                                CHARLIE
                      Boy, you need to get outta my face...
                      now! You got a feeling, then you do what
                      you gotta do, but don't you ever try to
                      tell me my job.  Not ever.

            It's a standoff.  Wesley blinks first.  He stalks off and out
            of sight.  In a moment, he returns.

                                WESLEY
                      Fine.  Just fine... I'll go check some
                      shit on my own then.  And don't call me
                      'boy...'

                                                                  110.


            He turns and slams into the door frame.  He glares at
            Charlie, then exits.  When the front door BANGS SHUT allows
            himself to go back to his shaving.



    123     EXT. STUDIO BUILDINGS - DAY                            123

            Map in hand, Wesley stand near A GUARD and discreetly asks
            questions.

                                WESLEY
                      ... what kinda car's Jasmine drive?

                                GUARD
                      Ahh, Mercedes, I think.  Black.

                                WESLEY
                      Yeah?  The sport utility?

                                GUARD
                      Uh-huh.

                                WESLEY
                      Damn, that's sweet...
                          (BEAT)
                      She really that good-looking in person?

                                GUARD
                      Better.

                                WESLEY
                      Oh fuck...

            Wesley looks around covertly, then produces a fifty.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?

                                GUARD
                      Sure.

            Wesley smiles and wanders off, headed toward a series of
            studio buildings in the distance.  The guard watches him go.

                                GUARD (cont'd)
                      ... it's Sunday, I can sneak anybody on
                      the lot.



    124     INT. HOLLYWOOD MOTEL ROOM - DAY                        124

            Charlie toys with matches from the Canyon Ranch Bar. Working
            off a list of names and phone numbers from his Zaurus, he
            makes calls from his room.

                                                                  111.


                                CHARLIE
                      Betty Sizemore, she's got ten kilos...
                      Blonde hair, a great figure... sort of a
                      whole Doris Day thing going on.  That's
                      what I said-- Doris Day.  You could see
                      her working at the U.N., or something.
                      'The U.N.'  "United Nations."  Forget
                      it...
                          (BEAT)
                      Nobody like that?  You're sure?  Yeah,
                      Detroit by way of Kansas... Alright, let
                      me know if you hear anything, okay?

            He hangs up.  Deletes another one off the list and looks out
            the window.  Checks the now well-worn photo of Betty.  He's
            starting to doubt himself.



    125     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT / BATHROOM - EVENING             125

            Rosa stands in the doorway as Betty, wearing one of Rosa's
            hotter outfits, puts on her makeup.

                                BETTY
                      Are you sure I can borrow this?

                                ROSA
                      No, please.  Go ahead, it's your
                      funeral...

                                BETTY
                      Rosa...

                                ROSA
                      Well, what if this guy's just playing
                      with you?  What if he's lying about who
                      he is?

                                BETTY
                      You should have a little faith in people.

                                ROSA
                      Does he ever talk about medicine?  His
                      patients, the hospital?

                                BETTY
                      All the time.  It's always "Loma Vista"
                      this, "Loma Vista" that.

            The DOORBELL RINGS.  Rosa goes to the front door and looks
            through the peephole, then opens the door. George McCord,
            flowers in hand, gives his best leading man smile.

                                                                  112.


                                GEORGE
                      You must be Rosa.  I've heard so much
                      about you...  I'm George McCord.

                                ROSA
                      Not as much as I've heard about you.
                      She's a very nice girl and you better not
                      hurt her.

                                GEORGE
                      What?

            Betty appears.

                                BETTY
                      Rosa, so you've met David?

                                ROSA
                      Sure did!  And a funny thing, Betty, he
                      introduced himself to me as George!

                                BETTY
                      Oh, he does that.
                          (hugging him)
                      It's this silly game he plays.  Half the
                      people who know him call him George.



    126     EXT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                          126

                                GEORGE
                      I don't think your friend likes me.

                                BETTY
                      She's a little jealous, I think.  And
                      confused when it comes to men...
                          (BEAT)
                      So where are we going?

                                GEORGE
                      Well, first I thought Patina, and then
                      the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere
                      a little more romantic.  Like my place.



    127     INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                            127

            Modern glass and steel structure in the hills.  Austere.
            Betty and George sit on the sofa with the lights low and SOFT
            MUSIC playing.

                                GEORGE
                      God, I haven't felt like this since I was
                      with Stella Adler in New York.  You're
                      so...real.

                                                                  113.


            He leans forward slowly to kiss her, but Betty pulls back.

                                BETTY
                      You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.

                                GEORGE
                      Didn't I?

                                BETTY
                      No, I would have remembered that name.
                      The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.
                          (BEAT)
                      Was this before Leslie?  Before us?...

            George takes her face in his hands and looks at her.

                                GEORGE
                      I've never met anyone like you, Betty.

                                BETTY
                      I know, that's why we were meant to be
                      together...

                                GEORGE
                      No, I mean your dedication scares me...

                                BETTY
                      It's easy to be dedicated, when you care
                      about something...

                                GEORGE
                      Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first
                      started, but now... the hours, the
                      repetition... it's not all glamour and
                      mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've
                      listened to my people and tried to make
                      the crossover to nights earlier, I don't
                      know...
                          (BEAT)
                      ...I just hope it's not too late for me.
                      God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so
                      easy to get caught up in the whole ego
                      cycle of this business and make it all
                      about yourself. Stop, right? That's it,
                      no more about me tonight, I promise...
                      Let's talk about you...what do you think
                      about me? I'm kidding... Seriously,
                      Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...

                                BETTY
                      ...but I love listening to you, so that's
                      okay...

                                                                  114.


                                GEORGE
                      Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're
                      feeling...

                                BETTY
                      Well, I just feel that life'll be much
                      sweeter for you now with me around.  I
                      promise...

                                GEORGE
                      You know, I almost believe that... you're
                      like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown
                      into my life...
                          (laughs)
                      I said that to Leslie, once, at her
                      funeral, remember?...

                                BETTY
                      I remember.  You said it to her, but it
                      was meant for me, wasn't it?

                                GEORGE
                      Yes... maybe it was.

            She kisses him deeply, then allows herself to fall back on
            the sofa, pulling George down on top of her and kissing him
            passionately.



    128     INT. HOLLYWOOD MOTEL - THE NEXT DAY                    128

            Wesley hands Charlie a newspaper folded open to the
            Entertainment section, where there is a picture of Betty
            slapping the actor Eric Augustino. George is in b.g.

                                WESLEY
                      ...so I'm standing there, minding my own
                      business on Hollywood Blvd., checking out
                      Gladys Knight's star-thing there, I look
                      up at this little souvenir shop dude,
                      Chinese dude, reading a paper... and who
                      do I see?
                          (holding up paper)
                      That's Lonnie.  He's the show's Main
                      Prick.  And that is definitely Betty.
                      Now, that ain't no coincidence...
                          (BEAT)
                      I found out where they shoot it, and
                      where the dressing rooms are.

            Charlie studies the photo, troubled by something.

                                CHARLIE
                      Who's this?

                                                                  115.


                                WESLEY
                      A doctor on the show... why?

            Charlie thinks about it, then reaches into his pocket and
            takes out the photo of Betty with the cardboard David.  As he
            compares the photos, Wesley peeks over his shoulder.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      What in the...
                          (simmering)
                      What the hell is this?  You've been
                      holding out on me.  All this fucking
                      time!

                                CHARLIE
                      It just didn't fit her profile...

                                WESLEY
                      Fuck the profile!  That's the same guy!!

                                CHARLIE
                      She can't be here because of a... a soap
                      opera.  Not a soap opera.  That'd make
                      her...

                                WESLEY
                      ... crazy!  No shit, Shaft!!  And you
                      ain't far behind...

                                CHARLIE
                      ... but she's, no, Betty's smarter than
                      that.  She wouldn't be here for a...

                                WESLEY
                      I do not know how the fuck you lasted an
                      hour in this job!  Dragging our asses
                      around with the answer to our prayers in
                      your motherfucking jacket... a picture of
                      that cunt right next to the...

            Charlie cuts Wesley short by grabbing his shirt and pulling
            him close.

                                CHARLIE
                      Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like
                      that.  I don't care who she ends up
                      being, you never use that word again.
                      Got it?

                                WESLEY
                      Man, you have got to get some therapy.

                                CHARLIE
                      I said 'got it?'

                                                                  116.


                                WESLEY
                      ... yeah, I got it.
                          (struggling)
                      Come on, you're stretching out my vest...

                                CHARLIE
                      You made your point...
                          (drops him)
                      I was wrong.

            He carefully folds the paper, pockets the photo and
            straightens his clothing.  He straps on his holster and
            checks his weapon for emphasis.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Now, get yourself ready.



    129     INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY                              129

            Wesley gathering his gear through the open door.  Charlie
            stands looking at himself in the mirror.  Touches at the gray
            in his hair.  As an afterthought, he tosses on a splash of
            cologne.



    130     OMIT                                                   130



    131     INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY                                  131

            George leads Betty past several standing sets and into the
            'operating room' as CREW MEMBERS buzz around. Betty walks
            with her eyes closed and holding George's hand.

                                GEORGE
                      Just a little further... come on...

            George stops and puts both hands over Betty's eyes. He looks
            about expectantly and then uncovers them with a flourish.

                                GEORGE (cont'd)
                      Surprise!

            Betty stares, slowly trying to take in her new surroundings.
            It looks like Loma Vista, but something is different.  Odd.
            Cameras, lights, etc. - all the apparatus of a TV show - are
            in plain sight... And very disorienting.

                                BETTY
                      Oh my gosh...I didn't know I was going to
                      meet your friends today...I dressed a
                      little casual.

                                                                  117.


            He leads her to a taped mark on the floor as CAST MEMBERS
            appear, including JASMINE and BLAKE DANIELS.

                                GEORGE
                      That's cute...listen, you got the part,
                      and I'm directing.  You've only got four
                      lines today, so I thought I'd just spring
                      it on you.  No blocking or anything, just
                      stand near the nurse's station... we're
                      gonna do a quick walk-through.  Alright?

            He kisses her cheek and walks off toward the waiting Lyla
            before she can respond.

                                VOICE (O.S.)
                      Quiet on the set!

                                GEORGE
                      Traffic was terrible...

                                LYLA
                      No, that's fine, we've only got seventy
                      pages to shoot...take your time.

            A STAGE MANAGER hands Betty a set of sides and an on-set
            COSTUMER tries to fit her.

                                BETTY
                      Excuse me.  What are you doing?

                                STAGE MANAGER
                      We'll get you into hair and make-up after
                      this, just put this on...

            The other actors take their positions.  Lyla watches from
            behind the cameras as David readies himself. Chloe enters the
            set with Kleenex tucked into the neck of her costume.

                                CHLOE
                          (to Betty)
                      Hi.  I hear you're great.  Good luck...

                                BETTY
                      What are you doing here?  David...

                                GEORGE
                      Your lines'll are in the script, but you
                      can ad lib.

                                BETTY
                      Ad lib?

                                                                  118.


                                GEORGE
                      In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the
                      magic I'm after.  I wanna give a whole
                      new feel to the show.

            She's sliding toward a complete meltdown.

                                VOICE
                      Slate it!

            George steps back behind the cameras.  Betty's still frozen
            to her spot, overwhelmed.

                                GEORGE
                      Just do what you've been doing.  Watch
                      the scene and on your cue take off from
                      there.

                                VOICE
                      5-4-3-2...

            Chloe and Blake run through their lines lifelessly, then stop
            when they get to Betty's cue. Their faces loom around her
            menacingly.  Staring.  The lights are impossibly bright.
            People begin to shuffle and stare at one another. Lyla clears
            her throat as George bounds on stage, still smiling.

                                GEORGE
                      Betty?

                                CHLOE
                      Are you all right?

                                BLAKE
                          (to Chloe)
                      I think you stepped on my first line...

                                CHLOE
                      ... I was talking to her.
                          (to Betty)
                      Do you need anything...?

            She's freezing up.  George approaches her.

                                GEORGE
                      Betty, I thought this would be the best
                      way.  You know, throw you into it...

                                LYLA
                      What the hell's going on?

                                GEORGE
                      If you need a minute, that's okay. But I
                      thought you'd want to--

                                                                  119.


                                BETTY
                      David, I don't...  Can we talk privately
                      for a second?

                                GEORGE
                      Stop calling me David.  We're on set, for
                      Christ's sake, you don't have to call me
                      David here.

            As he pulls away Betty grabs his arm.

                                BETTY
                      Why are you doing this to me?

                                GEORGE
                      Why am I doing this to you?  Isn't this
                      what you wanted?

            Lyla approaches.

                                LYLA
                      Is there a problem, George?

                                GEORGE
                      No!  No problem, there is no...
                          (to Betty, sotto)
                      What is the problem?  Just do that...
                      thing... you do!  Come on!  You drove me
                      nuts with this for three days, now do it!

            George steps back behind the cameras as if nothing's wrong.
            Betty still hasn't moved.  She's shaking with fear.  The cast
            and crew members find it hard to look at her.

                                LYLA
                      All right, everybody!  That's ten
                      minutes!

                                GEORGE
                      No!  Let me try this!

                                JASMINE
                          (storming off)
                      This is bullshit!

                                LYLA
                      Forget it, George.  It was a gamble, it
                      didn't work.  Nice try.

                                GEORGE
                      Let me try this, goddamnit!  SHE'S BEEN
                      DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!

                                LYLA
                      I SAID FORGET IT!

                                                                  120.


            George throws down his script and rushes up to Betty, who
            reaches out to him.  He brushes her hands away.

                                GEORGE
                      Well, I don't know what you had in mind,
                      but I hope you're happy.  I put myself on
                      the line for you, my reputation, and
                      you're making me look like an idiot.

                                BETTY
                      What do you mean?  What did I do to
                      you...

                                GEORGE
                      Who put you up to this?  Did my ex-wife
                      ask you to...?

                                BETTY
                      David, please--

                                GEORGE
                      STOP CALLING ME THAT!  MY NAME IS NOT
                      DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE
                      DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I
                      THOUGHT YOU WERE!

            Betty begins to cry.

                                STAGEHAND
                      Leave her alone, George!

                                GEORGE
                      SHUT THE FUCK UP!! You're a fucking grip,
                      go grip something!!!
                          (to Betty)
                      And you're not an actress, you're nothing
                      but a soap opera groupie, aren't you?
                      YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO!  DO YOU??
                      Well, why don't you get a fucking life,
                      and stop ruining mine!

            Betty stands dead still as George continues to berate her.
            ALL SOUND slowly starts to drop out, then comes back abruptly
            with a RUSH.  Suddenly a light snaps on for her and she
            stares at him.

                                BETTY
                      I'm sorry...Oh my gosh, are you George
                      McCord?!

                                GEORGE
                      ...What?  What did you call me?

                                                                  121.


                                BETTY
                      George...McCord. You're my favorite actor
                      on...

                                LYLA
                      She called you 'George,' George.

                                BETTY
                      ...did I win some contest?

                                GEORGE
                      But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David,
                      but she thinks I am!  You heard her...
                          (looking around the group)
                      Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she
                      is!

                                BETTY
                      Why are you screaming at me?  I mean,
                      what am I... why am I here?  I don't...

                                GEORGE
                      You're doing this now?  After all the..
                      are you sick?  Are you going to kill me
                      now?

                                BETTY
                      No, I... I'll leave.  Forgive me if I
                      caused you all any trouble... I just, I
                      don't know how I...
                          (to George)
                      ... I'm sorry.

            George watches Betty walk off the set.  The cast and crew try
            to pretend this scene didn't happen, except for Lyla, who
            burns a hole into George's back.  Their eyes meet.

                                GEORGE
                      What?!



    132     OMIT                                                   132



    133     INT. TV STUDIOS / RECEPTION AREA - DAY                 133

            George McCord, wearing sunglasses and still angry, strides
            into the lobby.  Charlie and Wesley stand quickly and take
            out their badges as he approaches.

                                GEORGE
                      What can I do for you, gentlemen?

                                                                  122.


                                CHARLIE
                      How do you do, Mr. McCord.  We're trying
                      to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a
                      Ms. Betty...

                                GEORGE
                      Deranged.  That would be the right word.

            Wesley takes out the photo of Betty.

                                GEORGE (cont'd)
                      That won't be necessary.  She's staying
                      with a Rosa something... Hernandez,
                      Herrera.  I know it's an 'H' sound... in
                      Silverlake.

                                CHARLIE
                      Thanks so much.  You must get bothered by
                      this kind of thing a lot.

                                GEORGE
                      More than you know.  Is there anything
                      else?

                                CHARLIE
                      No, that should be more than--

                                GEORGE
                      Good.

            George turns to leave.

                                WESLEY
                      Actually, there is one more thing.

            George stops.  Wesley is suddenly shy, hesitant.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      It's just... well... I watch the show
                      too, and you being Dr. Ravell and all, I
                      thought you could maybe get Jasmine to
                      come out here.

                                GEORGE
                      You thought wrong.

            George pulls away.  Wesley grabs his sleeve.

                                WESLEY
                      It's just for an autograph.  It's not for
                      me...

                                GEORGE
                      It never is.

                                                                  123.


            George wrenches free of Wesley's grip and takes off.

            Wesley is furious.  He catches George in two strides, spins
            him around and SLAPS him across the face.  George's glasses
            go skittering across the floor.  PEOPLE stare.

                                WESLEY
                      You need to learn some manners, friend...
                      reach out to your goddamn fan base a
                      little more.

            Charlie pulls Wesley away.  George is frozen to the spot,
            humiliated, a pink handprint emerging on his cheek.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      ... and I saw your movie-of-the-week.  It
                      sucked dick!



    134     EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY                             134

            Betty walks aimlessly along a busy street.  She moves without
            direction, in a daze until a glint of bright light hits her,
            causing her to turn.  She is staring at a black Lincoln
            sitting in a car lot, sunlight dancing off its chrome.  She
            shudders involuntarily at it.  Suddenly, she hears a familiar
            voice.

                                DEL (O.S.)
                      What the hell are you doing here?

            It's Del.  He's in a pastel version of his usual shirt,
            slacks, and tie.

                                DEL (cont'd)
                      Well, are you gonna answer me?  What'd
                      you come here for?

                                BETTY
                      I came for love...

                                DEL
                      You're not on that soap opera thing
                      again, are you?  'Cause you know what
                      that is?

                                BETTY
                      It's people with no lives watching other
                      people's fake lives.

                                DEL
                      That's right.  So, if you know it, why
                      are you in trouble?

                                                                  124.


                                BETTY
                      I don't know.

                                DEL
                      You sure don't.  Who do you think you are
                      coming to Hollywood, anyway?  You should
                      remember where you came from. And who you
                      really are.

            Del looks up at the sun for a moment, shading his eye from
            it.

                                DEL (cont'd)
                      I gotta run.  Got some serious clients to
                      meet, with real potential.
                          (BEAT)
                      Goddamn, it's hot!

            He wipes the sweat from his brow.  Betty looks at his
            handkerchief and sees that it's soaked in blood.  Then back
            at his face, now obscured by blood pouring down from his
            head.
            She stares, horrified, and in that moment Del becomes... a
            MAN, staring back at her as he wipes the sweat from his brow.

                                MAN
                      Who are you talking to?  Are you crazy?

            Betty backs away and melts into the flow of PEDESTRIANS.



    135     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LATER                          135

            Rosa comes home from work and tosses her purse and jacket on
            the chair.  No Betty in her room.

                                ROSA
                      Bet-ty!?  Did the pizza guy show up yet?

            She emerges from Rosa's bedroom with toiletries and moves to
            an open suitcase in her room.  She barely acknowledges Rosa.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      Are you all right?
                          (no answer)
                      What happened?
                          (BEAT)
                      He dumped you, didn't he?  I KNEW IT WHEN
                      I MET HIM!!  He's a loser, like the rest
                      of them.  Mother-fucker!

            Rosa now notices Betty packing.

                                                                  125.


                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      What are you doing?

                                BETTY
                      I'm going back to... I need to... I don't
                      know.

            Rosa tries to stop Betty for a moment to talk.  Betty grabs a
            pile of Rosa's clothes and heads for her room.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      ... this is your sweater, right?

                                ROSA
                      Where are you going?

                                BETTY
                      I have to leave now.

            She tries to put Betty's suitcase away.

                                ROSA
                      What?  No, I'm not gonna let you just run
                      out of here... You need to talk about
                      what's going on...

                                BETTY
                      You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't
                      know the half of it.  My husband was,
                      ahh...

                                ROSA
                      Your husband?!

                                BETTY
                      Yes, I had a husband and he was killed
                      two weeks ago in my kitchen.  I was right
                      there...

            Rosa stops.

                                ROSA
                      Jesus!... What are you saying?

            They stare at each other for a beat.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      What?!  That you had something to do with
                      it?

                                BETTY
                      I don't know.  I'm just starting to
                      remember it now.  I don't...

                                                                  126.


                                ROSA
                      Yeah, but your running away isn't going
                      to help you with all this...

                                BETTY
                      There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw
                      it, I think I watched the whole thing
                      happen... Oh my God...

                                ROSA
                      Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk
                      a little first and you'll feel better, I
                      promise.

            The doorbell rings.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      That's our pizza...  You can't go yet.



    136     EXT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - DAY                            136

            Charlie watches Betty undress from a nearby fire escape.  He
            stares at the object of his desperate search with relief and
            some fascination.

            Betty's movements are unhurried, mindless.  Charlie stares,
            mesmerized, until she steps into the shower.



    137     EXT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - STREET - SAME TIME             137

            Wesley gently nudges open the trunk to Betty's LeSabre. The
            cardboard cut-out of David Ravell pops out at him.

                                WESLEY
                      Whoa!  What the fuck're you doing here?

            He breaks it over his knee and throws it in the gutter, then
            quickly removes the wing nut holding the spare tire.  He
            removes the tire, then raises the panel on the floor of the
            trunk as Charlie joins him.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      It's all here.  It hasn't been touched.

            The bottom of the trunk is lined with brown paper-wrapped
            bricks of cocaine.  Charlie stares at it, shaking his head.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      You were right.  Del wasn't lying.

                                CHARLIE
                      Well, you were right about what that
                      bartender said.

                                                                  127.


            Wesley looks at him.  He appreciates the compliment.

                                WESLEY
                      But you were right first.  You gotta
                      follow your instincts.

            Charlie takes a long look at Wesley and smiles proudly.

                                CHARLIE
                      What do your instincts tell you to do
                      now, kid?

                                WESLEY
                      Leave.  Take this shit back to Detroit
                      and get the rest of our money.

                                CHARLIE
                      We could do that.  I could be on my way
                      to Florida, and you could go to Thailand
                      and fuck your brains out.

                                WESLEY
                      ...but that's not what we're gonna do, is
                      it?

                                CHARLIE
                      No... if we don't finish this job, how
                      are we gonna look at ourselves in the
                      mirror?  This is it for me, Wesley, she's
                      the last one.  My instinct says I gotta
                      see this through with her, and if there's
                      one thing I've tried to teach you here--

                                WESLEY
                      It's to follow my instincts.  And my
                      instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.

                                CHARLIE
                      No, I said to follow 'my' instincts.
                      Now, we go up there and conclude our
                      business.  Case closed.

            Charlie walks off.  Wesley closes the trunk up and prepares
            to follow him.

                                WESLEY
                      ... oh, that's fucking democratic.



    138     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT / HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER        138

            At the sound of the BUZZER Rosa goes to the door.  She looks
            through the peephole and sees Charlie holding up a badge.

                                                                  128.


                                CHARLIE
                      I'm Detective Jefferson--

                                ROSA
                      Oh... Did Betty call you?

            Charlie nods.  Rosa opens the door, and he enters with
            Wesley.

                                ROSA
                      She's got problems, but she's no killer.
                      I hope you guys can straighten this
                      out...

            Charlie and Wesley exchange a puzzled look.

                                CHARLIE
                      We'll do what we can.  Where is she?

                                ROSA
                      Bet-ty!
                          (to the men)
                      Please, go easy on her.  She's had a
                      really rough day.

            Betty appears. She recognizes the men instantly and freezes.
            Charlie's eyes wander over her... slowly.   Wesley notices.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      These guys are here to help you, Betty.

                                BETTY
                      I don't think so.
                          (BEAT)
                      Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.

            Wesley produces a pistol, sitting Rosa forcibly on the sofa
            and tapes her mouth and hands.  Charlie walks over to Betty.

                                CHARLIE
                      We meet again.

            He moves closer to her... almost whispers.  Wesley steps in
            and quickly tapes her hands.  Charlie stops him.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Not her mouth...
                          (to Betty)
                      I've spent many long hours in a car with
                      your face staring back at me.  I've seen
                      it painted on the horizon.

                                WESLEY
                          (to Charlie)
                      What's wrong with you?

                                                                  129.


            A KNOCK at the door ruins Charlie's moment.

                                ROSA
                      That's our pizza.

            Wesley hustles Rosa out of the room.

                                CHARLIE
                      Get rid of them.  You understand?

            Betty nods, scared, and looks through the peephole.  She
            stares with disbelief at ROY OSTREY.  He KNOCKS again. She
            opens the door a crack.

                                ROY
                      Betty!  Boy, am I glad to see you!

                                BETTY
                      Roy!  What are you doing here?

                                ROY
                      You're in serious danger!

                                BETTY
                      Ahh, look, right now's not very...

                                ROY
                      I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard
                      put me in jail.  He still thinks you had
                      Del scalped.

                                BALLARD
                      I never said that!  Open the door, Betty.

            BALLARD shoves Roy aside; Charlie's getting edgy ...

                                BETTY
                      Sheriff, I don't...

                                BALLARD
                      C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some
                      questions for you about...

                                ROY
                      Have you checked the trunk of that car
                      you're driving, Betty?  I think there
                      might be...

                                BETTY
                      It's not really a good time, guys...

                                BALLARD
                      Don't give me that.  I've come two
                      thousand miles for this!

                                                                  130.


            Charlie has been listening quietly on the other side of the
            door and finally snaps.

                                CHARLIE
                      Two thousand miles?  That's nothing!

            He flings the door open, sticks a pistol in Ballard's face
            and yanks them both inside.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Hah!  You probably flew!  I've crossed
                      the river Styx looking for her, pal!  I
                      travelled the fucking country to be here!

            Charlie slams the door and frisks them, taking a gun and
            handcuffs from Ballard.  Wesley returns with Rosa.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                          (to Betty)
                      Who are these idiots?

                                BETTY
                      This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter.  And
                      this is Sheriff Ballard.  We all went to
                      Fair Oaks High together...

                                CHARLIE
                      Oh, this is wonderful...

            Wesley takes over.  He sits Rosa down on the sofa, then
            pushes Betty down next to her and beckons to Roy.

                                WESLEY
                      Come here.

            He breaks Roy's nose with his pistol. Roy crumples to the
            floor, holding his face. Betty starts to scream, but Charlie
            puts his hand over her mouth.

            Wesley tapes Roy's hands together, then beckons to Ballard.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      Your turn.

            Ballard drops to his knees in a prayer-like position near the
            aquarium.

                                BALLARD
                      I got two kids and a dog...

            Wesley grabs his shirtfront and slams him to the floor, then
            with a foot on his neck, he loops Ballard's arms around one
            leg of the steel aquarium stand and handcuffs him.

                                                                  131.


            Charlie does nothing but stare at Betty, his eyes locked with
            hers.  Wesley sees it.

                                WESLEY
                      Act professional, remember?

            Charlie pulls her to her feet.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      What are you doing?

            Charlie leads Betty out of the room.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      No way!  This is not professional!



    139     INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME                               139

            Silence.  Then Charlie takes out a knife and cuts the tape
            from Betty's wrists, touching her hair.  Gently.  He leaves
            her standing in the corner while he sits on the edge of the
            bed.

                                BETTY
                      ... I s'pose you did that so I could take
                      my sweater off or something.

                                CHARLIE
                      No, just stand there... lemme look at you
                      a minute.

            She does.  Charlie stares intently at her.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Do you know who I am?

                                BETTY
                      ... I... I know what you are.

                                CHARLIE
                      Do you know why I'm here?

                                BETTY
                      I've got a pretty good idea. You're here
                      to kill me, so kill me.  You want me to
                      be afraid, but I'm not.  I don't care who
                      you are, or why you two killed my
                      husband...

            Charlie studies her, then sets his gun down on the bed.

                                CHARLIE
                      You really... didn't have anything to do
                      with what Del was doing, did you?

                                                                  132.


                                BETTY
                      I have no idea what he was mixed up in...
                      it was always something.

                                CHARLIE
                      So you weren't involved with him in his
                      pathetic attempt to diversify?
                          (off her blank look)
                      Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?

                                BETTY
                      Drugs?  God, no!  I'm totally against
                      drugs.

                                CHARLIE
                      Damn, life is strange.  I had you figured
                      for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch--
                      Not that I didn't admire you for it.

            Charlie slowly folds his knife and pockets it.

                                BETTY
                      ... well, if you're not going to slit my
                      throat, why'd you come up here?

                                CHARLIE
                      ... to see you.



    140     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME        140

            Wesley stands over Ballard, about to tape his mouth. Rosa and
            Roy are sitting in chairs opposite them, their mouths and
            wrists already taped.

                                BALLARD
                      You killed that bartender in Arizona and
                      the trucker in Texas, didn't you?

                                WESLEY
                      How did you find Betty?

                                BALLARD
                      I just put it all together. I knew David,
                      Lonnie and Chloe were from that show.

            Roy starts freaking out, trying to talk through the tape.

                                BALLARD (cont'd)
                      Betty thinks they're real people.  It
                      sounded crazy, but it was worth a shot.

            Roy is apoplectic...

                                                                  133.


                                WESLEY
                      What do you want?!

            Wesley tears his tape off.

                                ROY
                      That's a lie!  I figured it out!  I've
                      been trying to tell this dumbass--

                                BALLARD
                      Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!

                                ROY
                      --small-time, pissant, Barney Fife--

                                WESLEY
                      SHUT UP!  Shut the fuck up, both of you,
                      before I kill you!

                                ROY
                      I'm the one who watched the show...I
                      was...

                                WESLEY
                      Did Chloe crack?

                                ROY
                      Totally.  She came apart like a house of
                      cards.  They dropped the charges...

                                WESLEY
                      Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?

                                ROY
                      She's a lesbian.

            Wesley immediately pulls his gun and points it at Roy's head.

                                WESLEY
                      You lie, motherfucker...

                                ROY
                      I swear to God!

            Rosa STAMPS her feet, drawing Wesley's attention.  She tries
            to talk through the duct tape; gestures for him to come to
            her.

                                WESLEY
                       What?!  You scream, you die.

            He yanks the tape off.  Rosa winces.

                                ROSA
                      I have a tape of today's show.

                                                                  134.




    141     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME            141

            Betty is sitting on the bed.  Charlie leans against the wall,
            facing her.  He has trouble starting this.

                                CHARLIE
                      ... I never meet people like you.  I'm a
                      garbageman of the human conditon. I deal
                      with trash, mostly, people willing to
                      trade any part of themselves for a few
                      more minutes of their rotten lives.  But
                      you... you're different.

                                BETTY
                      I am?

                                CHARLIE
                      Sure. You could probably have any thing
                      you wanted... somebody as beautiful and
                      stylish as yourself, and you don't even
                      realize it.

            Betty looks curiously over at Charlie.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      I'm appreciably older than you, but my
                      health is good.  I take care of myself,
                      and I got some money socked away.  You'd
                      never have to work agin, that's for sure.
                      I'd treat you like a queen.

                                BETTY
                      Umm, I don't think that...

                                CHARLIE
                      Wait.  Let me get this out.
                          (clears his throat)
                      I like the symphony, walks in the rain,
                      sunsets, animals and children.  I read
                      passionately, and I like to discuss
                      things.  I'm basically conservative, but
                      flexible.  I've been involved in the
                      death of thirty-two people, but I can
                      live with that because the world is
                      lighter by thirty-two pieces of shit,
                      excuse my language.

                                BETTY
                      "Thirty-two?"

                                CHARLIE
                      Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting
                      Del, on account of you... so, what do you
                      think?

                                                                  135.

                          (BEAT)
                      You probably feel I'm flattering myself
                      to see us together.

                                BETTY
                      I don't feel that, no. I just....I'm not
                      really who you think I am.

                                CHARLIE
                      No one is, honey.  Here, listen to
                      this...  "If who I am and who I hope to
                      be should meet one day, I know they will
                      be friends."  Now that's beautiful.

            Betty is stunned.

                                BETTY
                      I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd
                      you get that?!

                                CHARLIE
                          (he pulls out the diary)
                      I know.  I borrowed it from your
                      grandparents because I... I... it doesn't
                      matter.  Don't worry, they're fine...
                          (he gives the diary back)
                      Look, I used to feel that same way, said
                      practically those same words, sitting at
                      night in a foxhole in Korea...
                          (BEAT)
                      I've chased you across the country,
                      Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot
                      more alike than you'd think.

                                BETTY
                      I thought you were a garbageman of
                      humanity, or something.

                                CHARLIE
                      Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that
                      behind me now...



    142     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME        142

            Wesley is engrossed in watching "A Reason to Love."  Behind
            him, Ballard quietly walks his feet up the wall until he's
            completely upside down.  He rubs one foot against the other
            until one pantleg is above his cowboy boot. Rosa and Roy
            watch.
            He finally lifts the boot off.  It falls soundlessly onto his
            chest. A small pistol is revealed, holstered above his ankle.
            He works the holster open using the edge of the fishtank.

                                                                  136.

            Roy and Rosa COUGH LOUDLY at the same time to cover the
            noise. Wesley glares at them.

            Ballard gets the pistol free. But it falls into the fishtank.
            The air goes out of Roy's sails. Ballard has fucked up again.

            On screen, Chloe and Jasmine kiss and embrace.  Wesley reacts
            as if he was slapped.

                                WESLEY
                      ... goddamn!

            Wesley immediately runs the sequence back to view it again.

            Ballard KICKS the wall of the fishtank with his cowboy boot.
            Roy and Rosa cover the sound again with COUGHING. Wesley
            pauses the T.V. and looks around.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      What's your problem?

            Ballard KICKS at the tank again.  But he can't break the
            glass. Roy can't take it any more. He launches himself at the
            tank, grabs it by the rim and pulls it down on top of
            himself.  A torrent of water, fish, plants and gravel pours
            down upon him.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      You stupid piece of fuck!

            He leaps at Roy and starts kicking him savagely.  Rosa throws
            herself onto Wesley's back, knocking him to the floor.
            Ballard paws through the muck, scattering fish and gravel
            everywhere.  He spots a glint of metal in the sand.

            Wesley struggles out from under Rosa. Just as he gets free,
            Ballard FIRES, hitting him TWICE into his chest. Wesley
            stares in disbelief at the blood rushing out of him.  Then at
            Ballard, as if trying to link the two.

            He slumps to the floor and opens his mouth to scream ...

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      D-A-A-A-D-D-D-Y-Y-!!!!

            Charlie opens the bedroom door.

                                CHARLIE
                      Wesley??!

            Charlie sees Wesley turn to him as Ballard FIRES again.
            Wesley's face explodes.  The flying lead drives Charlie back
            to the bedroom.

            Crawling through the muck, Roy notices a fish flopping
            helplessly on the carpet inches from his face.

                                                                  137.


                                ROY
                      Those're Japanese koi!

                                ROSA
                      Yes!  How'd you know that?

                                ROY
                      You gotta get 'em in water right away!

                                BALLARD
                      We're in a shootout, Roy!  Shut up about
                      the damn fish!

                                ROY
                      YOU shut up!
                          (to Rosa)
                      They're beautiful, but get them some
                      water.

            He gently hands her the fish, then picks up Wesley's nearby
            gun.  Rosa nods; she's amazed that he knew what it was.  She
            looks at Roy in a slightly different way before crawling away
            toward the kitchen.

    145     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME            145

            Charlie FIRES back from the doorway.

                                CHARLIE
                      Oh, Christ, they shot my boy!

            Enraged, he empties his pistol at the living room.  Ballard
            and Roy return fire, and Charlie ducks back in.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                          (reloading)
                      How the hell did this happen?  I'm in a
                      goddamn shoot-out!  Wesley?   What the
                      fuck happened out there?!

            He opens the door, and a bullet slams into the doorjamb near
            his head. He ducks back in.

            Charlie sags against the wall, looking toward Betty.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      That's my son!  My son is dead!

                                BETTY
                      I'm sorry.

                                                                  138.


                                CHARLIE
                      You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE
                      HERE!

                                BETTY
                      WAIT A SECOND!  I AM NOT THE REASON
                      YOU'RE HERE!  I WAS MINDING MY OWN
                      BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE
                      UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!

            Charlie fights back his grief.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      What do you want from me?

            Charlie can't handle the moment.  He breaks for the door,
            and BLASTS away. This time he's nicked in the shoulder.  He
            stumbles back, losing his balance.  His gun falls and slides
            right into Betty's hand.  Equally surprised they stare at one
            another.

            Charlie slumps over in his defeat as Betty holds a shaky
            pistol on him.

                                CHARLIE
                      Oh shit...



    146     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME        146

            Rosa crawls to a flower vase and dumps a second koi into the
            water inside.  Roy and Ballard crouch behind the open
            archway, using the hanging beads as protection.

                                BALLARD
                          (checks his gun)
                      We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll
                      cover you.

                                ROY
                      I'm not going out there!  Let's wait for
                      the real police...

                                BALLARD
                      You gotta go, we're pinned down!

                                ROSA
                      So why can't we just sneak outside?  Huh?

                                BALLARD
                      Lady, you don't just run away from
                      crime... besides, Betty's in there.

                                                                  139.


                                ROY
                          (checking)
                      You wanna see if he has more shells, go
                      ahead.  I say we wait...

                                BALLARD
                      No, no, no... you don't know shit about
                      procedure!  You don't send your best...

                                ROY
                      I've got the working gun, Elden, me!  You
                      wasted all your bullets so you crawl out
                      there.

            Ballard stares at him in disbelief, then back at the closed
            bedroom door. Ballard starts off on his belly.

                                BALLARD
                      Goddammit...

    147     INT. ROSA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME            147

            A LONG BEAT passes.  POLICE SIRENS wail in the distance.
            Betty moves close to Charlie to look at his shoulder.  He
            watches her intently.

                                CHARLIE
                      If we went out that window right now we'd
                      have a chance...

                                BETTY
                      I better go check on them.

                                CHARLIE
                      Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered
                      me.

                                BETTY
                      This is really awkward...

            The SIRENS are coming closer.  He waves her off.

                                CHARLIE
                      Ahh, it's too late, anyway.  It's too
                      late.
                          (BEAT)
                      Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe
                      take one of them with me... If you'd
                      gimme my gun back.

                                                                  140.


                                BETTY
                      I'd rather not...

                                CHARLIE
                      Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in
                      some stinking prison.  No way.  I've got
                      some professional pride.  And I don't
                      want anybody else to get the credit for
                      taking me out.

                                BETTY
                      ...what're you saying?

                                CHARLIE
                      When a Roman general knew a battle was
                      lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.

            Charlie fumbles in his pocket, then pulls out the photo of
            Betty with the cardboard David Ravell.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Did... did you really come here because
                      you love this guy?

                                BETTY
                      Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor.
                      I think.

            Charlie's sinks slowly to the floor.

                                CHARLIE
                      So all this...really was because of that
                      soap opera?  My son is dead because you
                      came out here to be with that doctor?  A
                      fake doctor?

                                BETTY
                      I wouldn't have put it quite that way,
                      but...

                                CHARLIE
                      Wesley didn't even want to come up here.
                      He warned me, but I insisted...
                          (BEAT)
                      I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?

                                BETTY
                      I don't think I am.

            Charlie remains sitting pensively for a long beat.

                                CHARLIE
                      I want you to listen to me, Betty.
                      People don't lie when they're about to
                      die.

                                                                  141.

                          (BEAT)
                      You don't need that doctor.  You don't
                      need that actor.  You don't need any man.
                      It's not the forties, honey.  You don't
                      need anybody. You've got yourself...  and
                      that's more than most people can say.

            Charlie reaches out slowly and takes the gun from Betty. She
            doesn't fight him. He kisses her hand and steps into the
            bathroom and closes the door.  A single GUNBLAST sends a
            shiver through Betty.



    148     INT. LYLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT                              148

            TV Newscast

            CLOSE SHOT of an ANCHORMAN.

                                ANCHORMAN
                      In a story that police say is bizarre,
                      even for Hollywood, a father-son team of
                      killers tracked a Kansas soap opera fan
                      halfway across the country, only to find
                      themselves the victims in a final, bloody
                      confrontation...

            The Anchorman continues as the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal
            Lyla and George watching television in a plush living room.

                                LYLA
                      This story is beyond belief, which is
                      perfect for us.  It's free advertising
                      and it's gonna run for months.

                                GEORGE
                      I don't think she can do it.  You saw
                      what happened.

                                LYLA
                      You fucked it up.  Who wouldn't freeze in
                      those circumstances?  And I don't care
                      what her problems are.  She wouldn't be
                      the first one in that cast with problems.
                      We have nothing to lose by making her an
                      offer.

                                GEORGE
                      What about me?  Don't you wanna know how
                      I feel about it?  I'm the one who...

                                LYLA
                      Why would I give a shit how you feel. And
                      I got news for you. I loved your 'icy
                      water' idea the other day... I'm toying

                                                                  142.

                      with the idea of killing David Ravell off
                      in a boating accident.

                                GEORGE
                      That's not a bad idea.  How many episodes
                      before he comes back?

            Lyla shakes her head "no."

                                GEORGE (cont'd)
                      Jesus, don't do that!  If it gets around
                      that you fired me, I'll never land a
                      pilot.

                                LYLA
                      Then do as you're told. Get her back.



    149     INT. TIP TOP DINER - DAY                               149

            George and Betty sit across from one another in a booth.
            Betty listens patiently.  Her former co-workers try to remain
            busy but can't help gawking.

                                GEORGE
                      I'm sorry for what I did.  It was
                      inexcusable.  I'm sorry for the things I
                      said, and for not respecting you, and for
                      all the stupid things that...

            Darlene approaches, puts a piece of paper on the table.

                                DARLENE
                      When you have a minute...

                                GEORGE
                      Look, I don't really like the whole idea
                      of autographs, and I'm kind of in the
                      middle of...

                                DARLENE
                      Don't flatter yourself.  It's the check.

            She walks off.

                                GEORGE
                      Oh.  Of course... sorry.

                                BETTY
                          (grabbing it up)
                      My treat.  You were saying... something
                      about how stupid you've been?

                                                                  143.


                                GEORGE
                      Right... I was.  I was an idiot, plain
                      and simple, and I hope you can find it in
                      your heart to forgive me.  How's that?

                                BETTY
                      Kinda like you'd been saying it since you
                      got on the plane...

                                GEORGE
                      I have... did it sound that bad?

                                BETTY
                      Mmm-hmm.  Listen, I forgive you, Mr.
                      McCord...

                                GEORGE
                      George...

                                BETTY
                      ... George.  I do.
                          (BEAT)
                      My best friend once said if you were any
                      handsomer it would be a crime...

                                GEORGE
                      Thanks...

                                BETTY
                      ... it's too bad you're such an asshole.
                      'S the only thing that Del was ever right
                      about.

            George winces... accepts it.

                                GEORGE
                      No, that's... okay.  Fair enough.
                          (BEAT)
                      So, now that we've sort of settled the
                      'asshole' thing, is there any chance
                      you'll come back to the show?  At all?

            Dr. David Ravell sits with Nurse Betty in a diner, catching a
            bite to eat before going back on shift.  They smile at one
            another over their meals.

                                BETTY
                      ... there's always a chance, David.

                                DAVID
                      Right.  But will there be a tomorrow, and
                      the next day, and the next?

                                                                  144.

                          (whispering to him)
                      Doctor, if you were any handsomer it'd be
                      a crime...

                                DAVID
                      I guess that means you're free tonight.
                      Of course, it's up to you...

                                BETTY
                      No, it's up to us.  I love you, David.
                      And I want to see you tomorrow, and the
                      next day, and the next day...

            leaps from her chair.

            Roy, Rosa, Danny and Sra. Herrera watch Betty lean across the
            table, take David's face in her hands and move into a

            On the sofa, Rosa takes Roy's hand in hers.

                               business cards Betty handed out.  But she fell
                               in love with Roy Ostrey, married him and moved
                               to Kansas.



    154     EXT. CAFE SISTINA - ROME - DAY                         154

            Betty watches the pilgrims on their way to St. Peter's as she
            sips a cup of coffee.  HER WAITER stands nearby with one eye
            on a TV set that broadcasts "A Reason to Love" in Italian.

                                                                  145.


                                BETTY
                      Could I get some service here, please?

            Without looking, the waiter approaches, tops off her cup and
            moves back to watching the show.  Betty smiles knowingly at
            this, takes a sip and settles back in her seat.  Slowly, the
            world passes by.
