          It's Election Day 1997. Up and down the country, the PEOPLE
          OF BRITAIN, people of all shapes and sizes and denominations,
          black and white, young and old, are going to the Polls.
          
          Everyone, that is, except the people that live in...


          EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

          The most instantly recognisable Palace in the world.

          The Royal Standard, (the flag of heraldic lions and symbolic
          harp-strings that signals the Monarch's presence), flutters
          on the roof.
          

          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CHINESE ROOM DAY

          We're in a state room at Buckingham Palace. A TV plays in the
          corner..

                                  COMMENTARY
                     ..here's Tony Blair, just 43 years
                   old, arriving at the polling station
                   of his constituency in Sedgefield.."
          
          QUEEN ELIZABETH II, wearing formal robes of the Garter, is
          posing for an official portrait by an elderly black PORTRAIT
          ARTIST, (representative, one assumes, of one of the many
          Charities of which she is patron)..


                                   ELIZABETH
                     Have you voted yet, Mr Crawford?

                                  ARTIST

                           (proudly dabbing palette)
                     Yes, Ma'am. I was there when they
                    opened. First in line. Seven o'clock.
          
                                COMMENTARY

                    If he wins, he'll be the youngest
                   Prime Minister in almost two hundred
                   years.."

          He straightens..
          
                                 ARTIST
                   And I don't mind telling you, it
                   wasn't for Mr Blair.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Not a moderniser, then?

          
          
                               ARTIST
                   Certainly not. We're in danger of
                   losing too much that's good about this
                   country as it is.
          
                               TV COMMENTARY
                   "The only questions that still remain:
                   how big will his landslide be? And how
                   extensive, how sweeping will the
                   modernisation programme be that he
                   ushers in?"
          
                              ELIZABETH
                   Hmm.
          
          The QUEEN watches as he paints..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I rather envy you being able to vote.
                        (a beat)
                   Not the actual ticking of the box,
                   although, I suppose, it would be nice
                   to experience that ONCE.
                        (a beat)
                   But the sheer joy of being partial.
          
                              ARTIST
                   Yes..
          
          The ARTIST squints as he scrutinises the canvass..
          
                               ARTIST
                   One forgets that as Sovereign, you are
                   not entitled to vote.

                               ELIZABETH
                   No.
          
                               ARTIST
                   Still, you won't catch me feeling
                   sorry for you. You might not be
                   allowed to vote, Ma'am..
                        (a beat)
                   But it IS your Government.
          
                              ELIZABETH
                   Yes.
          
          The QUEEN raises her eyebrow..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I suppose that is some consolation.
          
                                                       FADE TO BLACK:
          
                              

          
          
                                                                  3.
          
          
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - QUEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          The QUEEN's face. Fast asleep. It's shortly before 8.00 am.
          Daylight filters through the curtains. As does something
          else..
          
          The stirring sound of bagpipes..
          
          
          EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - INNER COURTYARD - DAY
          
          The inner courtyard of Buckingham Palace. In a ritual
          unchanged since Queen Victoria, a uniformed PIPER, wearing a
          kilt of Ancient Hunting Stuart tartan, marches under her
          Majesty's windows, playing the bagpipes.
          
           t's her morning alarm call, and it's the way she wakes up
          wherever she is - anywhere in the world.
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - QUEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Darkness. A soft knock at the door. (The strains of bagpipes
          can still be heard from below). Her Majesty's DRESSER sticks
          her head round the corner, with a calling tray of Earl Grey
          tea and the newspapers.
          
                               MAID
                   G'morning, Ma'am.
          
          The DRESSER puts the tea and newspapers on a bedside table.
          
                               DRESSER
                  Shall I draw the curtains?
          
          The QUEEN's sleepy voice answers..`Please'. The DRESSER goes
          to the window.
          
                               ELIZABETH (O.S)
                   Did you stay up?
          
                                 DRESSER
                   Yes, Ma'am.
          
                               ELIZABETH (O.S)
                   And? Was it as expected..?
          
          The QUEEN's hand reaches for spectacles, then for the
          newspapers. She puts on her glasses.
          
                                RESSER
                   Yes, Ma'am. Mr Blair, by a landslide.
          
          The QUEEN's expression changes..
          
                         
          
                                                                   4.
          
          
          
                              ELIZABETH
                   I see.
          
          She lifts the newspaper up. The front page comes into sharp
          focus.
          
          FULL FRAME: the beaming smile of TONY BLAIR, the new Prime
          Minister. The QUEEN stares back. Their eyes meet - as it
          were. Headlines tell us..
          
                 "IT'S BLAIR!", "LANDSLIDE VICTORY FOR BLAIR".
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY
          
          The QUEEN sits at breakfast. Reading the newspapers. Dogs
          under the table. A knock on the door, and ROBIN JANVRIN,
          (40's), her deputy Private Secretary, pops around..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   The Prime Minister is on his way,
                   Ma'am.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   To BE, Robin.
                        (correcting, terse)
                   Prime Minister to BE.
          
          The QUEEN frostily flicks a page, without looking up..
          
                                ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   He hasn't asked my permission yet.
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          The QUEEN and JANVRIN walk through a corridor of the Palace.
          It has the air of a grand hotel. Chintz. Flock. Long, gilded
          mirrors. Portraits on the walls..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   He's a hard one to read, isn't he?
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Yes. On the one hand his background is
                   quite establishment. Father a
                   Conservative. A public school
                   education at Fettes, where he was
                   tutored by the same man as the Prince
                   of Wales.

                                ELIZABETH
                   Well, we'll try not to hold that
                   against him.
          
                         

          
                                                                5.
          
          
          
                               JANVRIN
                   On the other, his manifesto promises
                   the most radical modernisation and
                   shake-up of the Constitution in three
                   hundred years.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Oh. Is he going to `modernise' us, do
                   you think?
          
                               JANVRIN
                   I wouldn't put it past him. He's
                   married to a woman with known anti-
                   Monarchist sympathies - you may
                   remember her curtsey the first time
                   you met. It could best be described as
                   `shallow'.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I don't measure the depth of a
                   curtsey, Robin. I leave that to my
                   sister.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary
                   who said he was expecting the
                   atmosphere at Downing Street to be
                   very informal. Everyone on first name
                   terms.
                        (a beat)
                   At the Prime Minister's insistence.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   What? As in `Call me Tony?'
          
                              JANVRIN
                   Yes.
          
          The QUEEN's face puckers in distaste..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Oh. I'm not sure I like the sound of
                   that.
                         (a beat)
                   Have we sent him a protocol sheet?
          
          
          EXT. MALL - DAY
          
          ARCHIVE FOOTAGE: as TONY BLAIR's motorcade drives down the
          MALL.
          
          
          EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
          
          The motorcade sweeps into the grand, inner quadrangle of
          Buckingham Palace, and stops at the King's door.
          

          
                                                                6.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CAR - DAY
          
          Three secret service BODYGUARDS leap out and open the car
          doors. TONY looks out at the palace..
          
                               TONY
                   Funny, I'm actually rather nervous.
          
                                HERIE
                    hy? You've met her often enough
                   before.
          
                               TONY
                   I know. But never one to one. And
                   never as Prime Minister.
          
                               CHERIE
                   Remember, you're a man that's just
                   been elected by the whole country.
                               T
                                TONY
                   Yes. But she's still, y'know..
          
          TONY looks up at the vast palace in front of him..
          
                                TONY
                   The Queen.
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR/STAIRCASE - DAY
          
          A uniformed EQUERRY leads TONY and CHERIE through corridors,
          and up a grand staircase..
          
                               EQUERRY
                   When we reach the audience room, I
                   will knock. We will not wait to be
                   called, we will go straight inside.
                   Standing by the door, we bow. From the
                   neck. I will introduce you. The Queen
                   will extend her hand, you go to her,
                   bow again, then shake her hand.
          
          TONY shoots his cuffs, `Right', clears his throat.
          
                                QUERRY (cont'd)
                   Couple of other things. It's `Ma'am'
                   as in ham, not Ma'am as in farm.
          
                                 TONY
                   Yes..
          
                               EQUERRY
                   And when you're in the Presence, at no
                   point must you show your back.
          
                             

          
                                                                   7.

                               EQUERRY
                   Yes, Sir. That's what it's called,
                   when you're in her Majesty's company.

           TONY turns, shoots a look at CHERIE, who sticks her fingers
          down her throat. TONY smiles back..
          
          The EQUERRY reaches a grand door, and knocks gently. Without
          waiting for a reply, he enters..
          
          CHERIE is left in the corridor. Alone. She stares at a
          liveried FOOTMAN.
          
          He stares back. No life behind his eyes. CHERIE takes a seat
          on a chair. Eyes widen to herself.
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - AUDIENCE ROOM - DAY
          
          TONY and the EQUERRY enter, and gently bow their heads. The
          EQUERRY then straightens, and announces..
          
                               EQUERRY
                   Mr Blair, your Majesty.
          
          The QUEEN extends her hand. TONY walks forward, and shakes
          it. The EQUERRY leaves. The door is then closed.

                   Then we take your passport and spend
                   the rest of the time sending you
                   around the world.
          
                               TONY
                   You obviously know my job better than
                   I do.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Well, you are my tenth Prime Minister,
                   Mr Blair. I'd like to think there
                   weren't too many surprises left. My
                   first was Winston Churchill. He sat in
                   your chair, in frock coat and top hat,
                   and was kind enough to give a shy
                               T
                   young girl like me quite an education.
          
                                TONY
                   I can imagine.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                    ith time, one has hopefully added
                   experience to that education, and a
                   little wisdom - better enabling us to
                   execute our constitutional
                   responsibility.
                        (a pointed addition)
                   To advise, guide and warn the
                   government of the day.
          
                               TONY
                   Advice which I look forward to
                   receiving.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                    ell, we will save that for our weekly
                   meetings.
                         a beat)
                   Now, if there's nothing else, I
                   believe we have some business to
                   attend to..
          
          TONY stares, then clicks..
          
                                 TONY
                   Of course..
          
          He falls, rather extravagantly, on bended knee. The
          supplicant position of deference...
          
                  

          
                                                                 9.

                   Your Majesty, the country has
                   spoken...and I come now to ask your
                   permiss..   E
                                ELIZABETH
                        (interjecting)
                   No, no, no. It's usual for ME to ask
                   the questions.
          
           TONY winces. Wishes the ground would swallow him up.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Mr Blair, the people have elected you
                   to be their leader. And so the duty
                   falls on me, as your Sovereign, to ask
                   you to become Prime Minister, and form
                   a government in my name.
          
           TONY stares. Lost for words. Then..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Generally, this is where you say
                   `yes.'
          
                                 TONY
                   `Yes'.
          
          The QUEEN extends her hand, which TONY kisses. She withdraws
          it again - quite sharply, then DISCREETLY PRESSES A BUZZER by
          her chair indicating the ceremony is over. The EQUERRY opens
          a door, and CHERIE is invited inside.
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   How nice to see you again, Mrs Blair.
          
           HERIE curtseys awkwardly, reluctantly, shallowly..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   You must be very proud.
          
                                  HERIE
                   Yes.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   And exhausted, I imagine. Where will
                   you be spending the summer?
          
                                 CHERIE
                   France.
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                   How lovely.
          
                               TONY
                    ou'll be in Balmoral, I expect.

                               ELIZABETH
                   Yes, I can hardly wait. Wonderful
                   place.
          
          The QUEEN indicates a portrait of QUEEN VICTORIA..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   My great, great grandmother said of it
                   - "In Balmoral all seems to breathe
                   freedom and peace and to make one
                   forget the world and its sad
                   turmoils."
          
           t that moment, the doors open, and JANVRIN enters, and
          whispers urgently in the QUEEN's ear. The QUEEN's face
          changes as she listens.
          
                                ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Really..?
          
          Her expression changes. She frostily turns to the BLAIRS..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   I'm afraid we're going to have to
                   leave it there.
          
          With that the QUEEN shakes TONY's hand. TONY and CHERIE
          awkwardly back out of the royal presence, leaving The QUEEN
          and JANVRIN.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Not too short, was it? I gave him
                   fifteen minutes.
                        (a beat)
                   One doesn't want to be rude.

          TONY and CHERIE walk down a corridor. CHERIE whispers under
          her breath..
          
                               CHERIE
                        (mimics QUEEN's manner)
                   "Thank you so much for coming. Now
                   bugger off."
          
                               TONY
                   I know. What was all that about?
          
                               CHERIE

          Doors slam. The CROWD surges. An explosion of flashlights.
          Tyres burn. The squeal of rubber as the MERCEDES pulls off.
          
          Swarms of PAPARAZZI give chase, kick-starting their
          motorcycles, speaking into cell-phones to their COLLEAGUES..
          

          
          
                                                                13.
          
          
          
          
          INT. RITZ HOTEL - SAME TIME
          
          The real ROYAL PARTY, meanwhile, walks briskly through an
          underground corridor which leads to the back door of the
          hotel..
          
          
          EXT. RITZ HOTEL - BACK EXIT - SAME TIME
          
          PAPARAZZI who were waiting at the back exit, speak to their
          COLLEAGUES on their cell phones, and are about to jump on
          their motorcycles to join them in the chase, when suddenly..
          
          HENRI PAUL, PRINCESS DIANA, her BODYGUARD and DODI FAYED
          emerge from a door, and climb into a waiting Mercedes. HENRI
          PAUL turns to the PAPARAZZI..
          
                               PAUL
                        (in French, we see sub-
                         titles)
                   Don't bother following. You won't
                   catch us.
          
          The engine starts with a roar. The PAPARAZZI double-take, and
          frantically shout into their phones to their COLLEAGUES.
          `Wait! They've come out at the back.'
          
          
          EXT/INT. MERCEDES LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
          
          The Mercedes pulls up at a traffic light.
          
          ALL AROUND THEM: the glare of Paparazzi motorcycles and
          camera flashbulbs around the car. The Paparazzi call out in
          French and Italian. They thump the window. It's terrifying.
          
          An explosion of flashing lights. Popping flashbulbs. The
          traffic light turns amber. DODI barks at the DRIVER..
          
          The DRIVER, a short squat man in glasses, (we do not see his
          face), slams his foot down.
          
          
          EXT. EXPRESSWAY - NIGHT
          
          The car roars ahead, then speeds down into a tunnel, followed
          by the PAPARAZZI MOTORCYCLES.
          
                                                       FADE TO BLACK:
          
          
          EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - NIGHT
          
          The Scottish Highlands. To establish.

          
                                                                  14.
          
          
          
          The silhouette of a magnificent ten year old STAG stands on a
          rock, and roars into the night.
          
          
          INT. CRAIGOWEN LODGE - NIGHT
          
          `RRRRrrrinnnnggg', the phone rings..
          
          A SILHOUETTE fumbles for a light switch, and hits the light.
          We immediately recognise the face. It's JANVRIN, the Queen's
          deputy Private Secretary.
          
                               JANVRIN
                        (into PHONE)
                   Robin Janvrin.
          
          He listens, then his expression changes.
          
                               ANVRIN (cont'd)
                   What?
          
          He checks the clock on the bedside table, waking rapidly now.
          Deadly serious..
          
                                ANVRIN (cont'd)
                   Right. I see.
          
          JANVRIN hangs up. Then urgently dials a number on the
          telephone..
          
          
          INT. CRAIGOWEN LODGE - NIGHT
          
                               JANVRIN (cont'd)
                   I'm going to need to speak to her
                   Majesty. Right away.
          
          
          EXT. BALMORAL ESTATE - NIGHT
          
           till pulling on clothes, JANVRIN rushes on foot towards the
          big house in the distance. Lights go on all over the darkened
          castle.
          
          
           NT. BALMORAL - STAIRCASE. NIGHT
          
           ANVRIN and a middle-aged   DRESSER, (half-asleep and still
          rearranging her uniform),   walk urgently up the stairs towards
          the second floor corridor   where the QUEEN's bedroom is
          located. They pass a PAGE   on the way down..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Tell Sir Guy I'd like everyone in. As
                   soon as possible.
          
          The PAGE nods. Departs.
          

          
                                                               15.
          
          
          
          
          INT. QUEEN'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
          
          A knock on the door. The door opens, and the DRESSER's voice
          gently calls out..
          
                                 DRESSER
                   Ma'am?
          
           he QUEEN stirs in her bed..
          
                               DRESSER
                   Mr Janvrin is here to see you..
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                   Oh..
          
          The QUEEN turns on the light. The DUKE of EDINBURGH flinches
          in irritation, scrunching his eyes as they are blinded..
          
                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                   What the..?
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
           he QUEEN emerges from her bedroom wearing an old-fashioned
          dressing-gown, and clutching a hottie, (a velour-covered
          Cosimax hot water bottle), to find ROBIN JANVRIN waiting..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Good evening, Ma'am. I'm sorry to
                   disturb..
          
          He clears his throat..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   I
                    've just had a call from our Embassy
                   in Paris. It's...the Princess of
                   Wales.
          
          PRINCE PHILIP appears in the doorway. Irritable.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Why? What's she done now?
          
          
          INT. MYROBELLA - TRIMDON - TONY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          "Rrrrrinng", the phone rings. We're in TONY BLAIR's
          constituency house in Trimdon, near Durham in northern
          England.
          
           Click', TONY, in T-shirt, turns on the light. His face is
          creased with sleep. He blinks..
          

          
          
          
                                                                16.
          
          
          
                               TONY
                   What? How badly?
          
          The figure of CHERIE stirs in the bed. Groans. TONY listens
          to the voice at the other end..
          
                               TONY
                   I see. Who are we speaking to there?
          
                                TONY
                   Right.
                         shell-shocked)
                   Keep me posted.
          
          TONY hangs up. CHERIE turns..
          
                               TONY
                   It's Diana. She's been in a car
                   accident. In Paris.
          
                               CHERIE
                   Is it serious?
          
                               TONY
                   Apparently Dodi Fayed is dead.
          
                               CHERIE
                   What?
          
          CHERIE's face. Visibly shocked.   TONY has switched on the TV
          in the bedroom.
          
                               NEWSREADER
                   Let's just re-cap on what's happened.

          INT. BALMORAL - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
          
           he QUEEN is sitting with the DUKE OF EDINBURGH.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   What was she doing in Paris?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                    ou know what she's like.
          
          The QUEEN flicks channels, peering over her glasses, trying
          to catch the latest news on the television..
          
          At that moment CHARLES enters the room. His face ravaged with
          concern. It's the first time the QUEEN has seen him since
          news of the crisis..
          

                                                            17.
          
          
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   It's quite awful...
                         (wants to console CHARLES
                          but finds it easier to
                          say..)
                   What are you going to do about the
                   boys?
          
          An awkward moment. Stifled..
          
                               CHARLES
                   Let them sleep until we know more.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Yes that's sensible.
          
                               CHARLES
                   I should go to Paris. I told my people
                   to start organising a jet.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   What? A private one?
          
                               HARLES
                   Yes.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Isn't that precisely the sort of
                   extravagance they attack us for?
          
                               CHARLES
                    ell, how else am I going to get to
                   Paris at this time of night? The
                   airport at Aberdeen will be closed.
          
          Presently, a voice from behind..
          
                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   You can use the Royal Flight. They
                   keep one of the planes on permanent
                   stand-by.
                         deadpans)
                   In case I kick the bucket.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Out of the question. It's not a matter
                   of State.
          
                                HARLES
                   What are you talking about?
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Diana is no longer an HRH, nor a
                   member of the Royal Family. This is a
                   private matter.
          

                                                               18.
          
          
          
                                 CHARLES
                     She's mother to your grandchildren.

          The QUEEN MOTHER sits on the sofa next to PRINCE PHILIP..
          
                                 QUEEN MOTHER
                     That's the latest?
          
                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                     I don't know. I can't hear..
                          (indicates TELEVISION)
                     Everyone's shouting!
          
          CHARLES stares in disbelief. Exits the room..
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL - JANVRIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
              television plays in the corner..

                     Good evening, Sir.
          
          JANVRIN listens to what the person is saying at the other
          end. His expression changes..
          
                                   JANVRIN
                     Right.

           NT. BALMORAL - 1ST FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
          An ashen-faced JANVRIN walks along the corridor, reaches the
          room where the ROYAL FAMILY is watching television.
          
           e clears his throat, knocks on the door..
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL - LARGE SITTING-ROOM - NIGHT
          
          JANVRIN enters.

          PRINCE CHARLES's face: he lets out a strangled cry, as he
          hears the news..
          
                                CHARLES
                     No!
          
          CHARLES roars in pain and disbelief. His knuckles whiten..
          
                                 CHARLES
                     No, no, no, no..!

          and already in Downing Street. Also watching television. (WE

                   Well, let's cancel everything else.

                   started coming up with ideas.

           he QUEEN's FACE in close-up. Her eyes flicker as she watches
          something intently.
          
           e REVERSE ANGLE to see: a half-open door. SILHOUETTES
          inside. The sound of male voices. Whispering. Speaking
          softly.
          
          It's the moment the BOYS are being told. We make out the
          SILHOUETTES hugging. The sound of tears. Soft voices. CHARLES
          repeatedly kissing his SONS.
          
           ur CAMERA stays on the QUEEN's FACE. A distant flicker of
          pain at the unrestrained intimacy and affection between them.
          
          Presently, the door opens, and a red-eyed PRINCE CHARLES
          emerges.
          
          C

                   They're going to go back to sleep.
                        (clears his throat, speaks
                         with difficulty)
                   Well, try anyway.
          
          The QUEEN goes up to CHARLES and stiffly, poignantly, tries
          to touch him. But cannot. Is unable. She withdraws her hand.
          
                               CHARLES
                        (reading the message)
                   My Private Secretary's office has
                   found a travel agency open in New York
                   that will sell me a flight to Paris
                   with an hour's stop over in
                   Manchester.
          
          CHARLES contains himself with difficulty..
          
                               CHARLES
                   Perhaps now you might consider whether
                   it's still an extravagance to bring
                   back the mother of the future King of
                   England in one of our planes?
          
                              ELIZABETH
                        (after a long pause)
                   All right.
          
           HARLES's eyes burn. He turns, and walks out.
          
          The QUEEN is left alone. She stares for a moment, then
          leaves, passing a FOOTMAN.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                        (to FOOTMAN)
                   I don't want the boys to see the news
                   and get upset. First thing tomorrow
                   morning, I want the radio taken out of
                   their bedroom, and the television
                   taken out of the nursery.
          
          The FOOTMAN bows..
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - QUEEN'S BEDCHAMBER - VERY EARLY DAWN
          
          The QUEEN sits in bed, writing her diary, in a bedchamber
          where the decor is unchanged in a hundred years..
          O
           utside, the sound of bird-song. The first rays of light.
          
          The DUKE OF EDINBURGH sticks his head around the corner. He
          looks at the QUEEN..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Well, well, well.

                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Are you all right?
          
          A silence.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd)
                   Your sister called about an hour ago.
                   From Tuscany.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                     hope you told her to come back? Cut
                   the holiday short?
          
                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                   I did.
          
          ELIZABETH raises her eyebrow..
          
                                  ELIZABETH
                       an't imagine she was pleased.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   That's putting it mildly.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   What did she say?
          
          PHILIP smiles to himself recalling MARGARET's words..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Something about Diana managing to be
                   even more annoying dead than alive.
          
          The QUEEN looks up..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Just make sure the boys never hear you
                   talk like that.
          
                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                   Of course.
          
          PHILIP produces a bottle of pills from his dressing-gown
          pocket, and shakes them..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd)
                   Something to help you go down?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   No. I'm going to do my diary a little
                   longer.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Fine. I'll sleep next door.
          

                                                               23.
          
          
          
          PHILIP touches her on the shoulder. But she doesn't
          reciprocate. He goes. The QUEEN appears to continue writing,
          but our CAMERA slowly turns to reveal her PEN is not moving.
          Nor writing.
          
          She's staring in thought.
          
          
          AXT. MYROBELLA - DAY
            Victorian, red-brick house. In the driveway, the
          incongruous mix of a grey Renault Espace people-carrier and
          two POLICE VEHICLES.
          
          In the modest garden: two ARMED POLICE OFFICERS are playing
          football with three young CHILDREN..

          Inside the plain, unfashionably decorated house..
          
          The TV plays in the corner of the kitchen. CHERIE BLAIR,
          visibly upset, watches TV while cooking breakfast.
          
           TONY is not wearing his Newcastle shirt.
          
          TONY is reading out his statement which is written on a pad
          of paper, filled with crossings-out..

                   "..that's how she will remain. In our

          ALASTAIR CAMPBELL is in Downing Street, sits in an office,

                               TONY
                   I thought at church. On the way in.
          
          ON TV: breaking news: Diana's brother, EARL SPENCER, makes a
          statement from the gates outside his house in South Africa..
                               S
                                PENCER (ON TV)
                   ...this is not a time for
                   recriminations, however I would say
                   that I always believed that the press
                   would kill her in the end.

                               SPENCER(cont'd)
                   But even I could not imagine that they
                   would take such a direct hand in her
                   death as seems to be the case. It
                   would appear that every proprietor and
                   editor of every publication that has
                   paid for intrusive and exploitative
                   photographs of her has blood on his
                   hands today...
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   Not the press, mate. You've got the
                   wrong villain.
          
          An AIDE appears in the doorway, catches TONY's eye, and
          indicates her watch..
          
                               TONY
                   I've got to go.
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   You about to speak to the Queen?
          
                                TONY
                   Yes.
          
          ALASTAIR shoots a mischievous look..
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   Ask her if SHE greased the brakes.
          
                                TONY
                   Now, now..
          
          TONY hangs up, crosses to the study, making sure the doors
          are shut so he won't be disturbed. We notice his shirt has
          no. 10 on the back, under the name, `BLAIR'.
          
          
           NT. BALMORAL - DINING ROOM - DAY
          
           he QUEEN, PRINCE PHILIP and the QUEEN MOTHER sit in silence
          at the table, eating breakfast, stoically listening to radio
          coverage, soberly flicking through newspapers..
          
          The QUEEN is the only one who is fully dressed, (the others
          in bathrobes), and she wears black. She is reading "The
          Sunday Times".
          
          All around them the QUEEN's (elderly) MAIDS perform the
          choreography of service as the radio coverage continues. One
          MAID pours tea. Another brings fresh toast.
          
          Also present is the rather smarter VALET and MAID belonging
          to the PRINCE of WALES, and his separate HOUSEHOLD. They have
          a separate, (and more stylish), uniform of their own.

          healthy food).

          A flamboyant napkin is folded into an elaborate fleur-du-lis,
          (traditional symbol of the PRINCE OF WALES). The QUEEN turns
          to Charles's VALET..
          
          A knock on the door, JANVRIN enters, and bows in respect to
          the QUEEN..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   I'm sorry to disturb, Ma'am, but I've

                   constituency.
          
                              QUEEN MOTHER
                        (privately rolls eyes,
                         without looking up from
                         newspaper)
                   Lucky you.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Thank you, Robin. I'll take it next
                   door.

          The first-floor corridor. STAFF flatten themselves against
          the wall, averting their eyes as..
          
          The QUEEN unexpectedly comes out of the dining-room, walks
          along the corridor, and disappears into..
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL - QUEEN'S STUDY - DAY
          
          The QUEEN's study. High ceilings, portraits, stag's antlers
          on the wall. The QUEEN picks up the phone..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Good morning, Prime Minister.
          
          
          INT. TRIMDON - BLAIR'S STUDY - DAY
          
          The contrast in surroundings could hardly be greater. TONY
          sitting in a cramped room, surrounded by toys, in track suit,
          in a working-class house..
          
                                TONY
                   Good morning, your Majesty. May I say
                   right away how very sorry I am - and
                   that the thoughts and prayers of my
                   family are with you at this terrible
                   time and with the two princes in
                   particular.
          

          
                                                               26.
          
          
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Thank you.
          
           HERIE appears in the doorway.
          
                                TONY
                   Is it your intention to make some kind
                   of appearance. Or statement?
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Certainly not.
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL - QUEEN'S STUDY - DAY
          
          The QUEEN's face, bristling at the suggestion. (WE INTERCUT
          AS NECESSARY)..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   No member of the Royal family will
                   speak publicly about this. It is a
                   private matter and we would all
                   appreciate it if it could be respected
                   as such.
          
                                TONY
                   I see.
          
          TONY straightens, taken aback..
          
                               TONY
                   I don't suppose anyone has had time to
                   think about the funeral yet?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   We've spoken to the Spencer family,
                   and it's their wish..
                        (a beat)
                   ..their express wish, that it should
                   be a private funeral. With a memorial
                   service to follow in a month, or so.
          
                                TONY
                   Right.
          
          TONY shoots a look at CHERIE..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Given that Diana was no longer a
                   member of the Royal Family we have no
                   choice but to respect their wishes.
          
                                TONY
                   I see.
          
           TONY shoots a look at CHERIE..
          

                                                               27.
          
          
          
                               TONY
                   You don't feel that in view of her
                   high profile and popularity..
                        (
                          choosing his words
                          carefully)
                   ...it might be an idea to pay tribute
                   to her life and achievements?
                        (a beat)
                   Or even just to her as a mother?
          
          The QUEEN's face freezes over.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   As I said. That's the Spencers' wish.
          
                               TONY (cont'd)
                   And the public, Ma'am? The British
                   People?
          
          TONY hesitates..
          
                               TONY
                   You don't think a private funeral
                   would be denying them a chance..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                    hance to what..?
          
                               TONY
                   To share in the grief?
          
          The QUEEN's face: did she hear right?
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   It's a family funeral, Mr. Blair. Not
                   a fairground attraction.
                        (a beat)
                   I think the Princess has already paid
                   a high enough price for exposure to
                   the press, don't you?
          
          PRINCE PHILIP enters, dressed and ready for church. He
          indicates his watch..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Now, if there is nothing else I must
                   get on. The children have to be looked
                   after.
          
                                TONY
                   Of course.
          
          `Click', the QUEEN hangs up. TONY stares at the receiver.
          
                               TONY (cont'd)
                   Good bye, Your Majesty.
          

          
                                                               28.
          
          
          
          He puts down the phone...
          
                                TONY
                   Her instinct is to do nothing. Say
                   nothing. And give her a private
                   funeral.
          
                               CHERIE
                   Are you surprised? She hated her guts.
          
                               TONY
                   Well, I think it's a mistake.
          
          TONY's face becomes dark..
          
                               TONY
                   They screwed up her life. Let's hope
                   they don't screw up her death.

           veryone is getting ready to go to church. The QUEEN and
          QUEEN MOTHER are putting on their hats. PRINCE PHILIP, in
          full Highland regalia and black tie, helps both LADIES into
          their long coats...
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   The Chaplain called. Wanted to know
                   whether he should make any changes to
                   the service or make special mention of
                   Diana.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   What did you say?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I told him he shouldn't change a
                   thing.
          
                                  UEEN MOTHER
                   Q
                    uite right.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I think the less fuss one makes, or
                   draws attention to it, the better.
                         she lowers her voice, as
                         the PRINCES approach from
                         the saloon with CHARLES)

                              QUEEN MOTHER
                   Yes.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   And we should probably arrange some
                   company for them. Some young people.

                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   I'll take them for a long walk this
                   afternoon. Up Craggy Head.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Good. They'd like that.
          
           RINCE PHILIP opens the doors..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   But no guns. It's Sunday.
          
          They walk off to the waiting CARS..

                               AIDE
                   Alastair? He's on..
          
          CAMPBELL turns, and excuses himself from his conversation,

          ON TV: TONY, wearing a dark suit, and tie, takes his position
          in front of the statue of the Virgin Mary, in front of the

                    e are today a nation in a state of
                   shock, in mourning, in grief that is
                   so deeply painful to us. People
                   everywhere, not just here in Britain,
                   kept faith with Princess Diana..

          JANVRIN watches the broadcast on television, surrounded by
          several MEMBERS OF STAFF - MAIDS, COOKS, VALETS, FOOTMEN, all
          craning their necks, watching the television in the Private
          Secretary's room..

                    They liked her, they loved her, they
                   regarded her as one of the people. She
                   was the people's princess, and that is
                   how she will stay, how she will remain
                   in our hearts and memories forever.."

                   A bit over the top, don't you think?
          
          JANVRIN turns, fully expecting everyone to agree..
          
          But instead all the STAFF MEMBERS behind him have tears

                        (taps head, "Nuts")
                   Anyway, raves in the press.
          
          ALASTAIR dumps the papers on the desk..
          

          
          
                                                               37.
          
          
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   This lot call you "The Nation's
                   Mourner in Chief", this lot say you're
                   "The only person who has correctly
                   judged the mood of the country". Even
                   the "Mail"..
                        (disdainfully holding the
                         paper between finger and
                         thumb)
                   ..was impressed.
          
          ALASTAIR drops the papers on TONY's desk.
          
                                LASTAIR
                   "People's Princess", mate. You owe me.
          
           LASTAIR goes. TONY watches, then jumps up, opens the door.
          His AIDE calls after him, covering the phone..
          
                               AIDE
                   Gordon for you.
          
                               TONY
                   Tell him to hang on.
          
          
          INT. DOWNING STREET - CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          TONY follows ALASTAIR out, calls after him..
          
                               TONY (cont'd)
                   So it's decided? It's going to be a
                   public funeral.
          
                                LASTAIR
                   Yes. On Saturday. A whopper. The
                   Abbey. The works.
          
                               TONY
                   Good. Has anyone told the Queen yet?
          
                                LASTAIR
                   Dunno. No doubt some flunkey will be
                   despatched. Grovelling on all fours.
          
          TONY smiles imagining the prospect, goes back into his
          office.
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - LARGE SITTING-ROOM - DAY
          
          `Knock', a knock on the door, and ROBIN JANVRIN enters
          carrying a large file. He bows first to the QUEEN..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Good morning, Ma'am.
          

          
                                                               38.
          
          
          
          ..then to the QUEEN MOTHER..

                   ..Ma'am.
          
          The QUEEN looks up..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   What can we do for you, Robin?
          
          JANVRIN braces himself. This is not going to be easy...
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Ma'am, there was a meeting at the
                   Palace this morning.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   About the funeral arrangements, yes.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   The Lord Chamberlain faxed over these
                   plans for you to consider.
          
          JANVRIN puts a large file on her desk..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   There is now general agreement, Ma'am,
                   that a public funeral would be more
                   appropriate.
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                   I see.
          
           he QUEEN perceptibly bristles..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                    nd what form will it take?
          
                               JANVRIN
                   At the moment, they're suggesting..
                        (clears throat)
                   And of course these are early days..
          
          JANVRIN braces himself. Shoots a nervous look at the QUEEN
          MOTHER..
          
                               JANVRIN (cont'd)
                   ...basing it on Tay Bridge.
          
          The QUEEN MOTHER looks up. Horrified.
          
                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   Tay Bridge..?
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                   What..?
          

          
                                                            39.
          
          
          
          A stunned silence..
          
                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   B-but that's the code name for my
                   funeral?    J
                                ANVRIN
                    ndeed, Ma'am.
                         (a beat)
                   But it would be for practical reasons
                   only.
          
          JANVRIN is dying.
          
                                ANVRIN
                   It's the only one which has been..
                        (treads delicately)
                   ..`rehearsed'. The only one that could
                   be put together..in time.
          
          The QUEEN MOTHER needs to sit down..
          
                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   But I supervised those plans myself.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Indeed, and the Lord Chamberlain was
                   at pains to stress the spirit of the
                   occasion will be quite different.

                   For example, in place of four hundred
                   soldiers marching behind the coffin,
                   the suggestion is that four hundred
                   representatives from the Princess's
                   various charities march behind the
                   coffin.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   I see..
          
          The QUEEN MOTHER's eyes widen..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   And that instead of foreign Heads of
                   State and Crown heads of Europe, the
                   guests would include a sprinkling of
                   actors of stage and screen, fashion
                   designers and other..
                        (clears throat)
                   ...celebrities..
          
                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   Celebrities..?
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Oh.
          

          
          
                                                                40.
          
          
          
          The QUEEN looks ashen. The QUEEN MOTHER is pouring herself a
          drink..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Wa..was there anything else?
          
                                 JANVRIN
                    o, Ma'am.
          
          JANVRIN bows, and leaves. Then stops, remembering..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Oh, yes. One other thing. The Police
                   Commissioner was keen that you
                   consider the idea of a condolence
                   book.
                         (a beat)
                   It would give the growing crowds
                   something to do. Make marshalling them
                   easier.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                        (distracted)
                   Yes, of course..
          
           ANVRIN reaches the door..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Oh, and the flowers.
          
           he QUEEN looks up..

                               JANVRIN (cont'd)
                   The flowers that have been left
                   outside Buckingham palace. Currently
                   they're blocking the path through the
                   main gate, and will make things
                   difficult for the Changing of the
                   Guard.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Fine. Then move them away.
          
           ANVRIN flinches slightly in anticipation..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Actually, the Lord Chamberlain was
                   wondering whether we shouldn't leave
                   the flowers, and send the Guards
                   through the North Gate.
          
          The QUEEN looks thrown..

                   Yes.
          
          TONY hangs up. He turns to his AIDE..

                   Bizarre. Why is Charles doing this?

                               TONY
                   Creeping up to me like this. He did it
                   at the airport when he asked me to
                   `deal' with his mother.

                   continues to get it wrong over Diana,

                   become public enemy no 1.

                   Who, Charles?
          
                               AIDE
                   His people have already been onto us
                   asking for extra protection.
          
                                IDE #2
                   He probably thinks if he's seen to be
                   on our side, the Queen will be the one
                   left in the firing line, not him.
          
                               TONY
                   What? So it's OK for his mother to
                   take the bullet, not him?
                         shakes head)
                   What a family.
          
          
          EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY
          
          The QUEEN, in tatty old Barbour, head-scarf, Wellington
          boots, loads Corgis and picnic hampers into the back of an
          old Land Rover.
          

          
          
                                                                43.
          
          
          
          She climbs into an old, muddy Jeep, and starts the oily,
          smoky diesel engine. As she begins to drive out, she turns a
          corner, and passes CHARLES who is climbing into his much
          smarter, luxury, leather-upholstered jeep..
          
                               CHARLES
                   Wait! Where are they?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Up at Craigghead.
          
                               CHARLES
                   I'll come with you.
          
          CHARLES climbs in. The QUEEN notices how extravagantly
          dressed he is. A kilt and tailored hunting jacket..
          
                               CHARLES (cont'd)
                   Want me to drive?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Certainly not.
          
           HARLES shudders at the rough interior of the car, the mud-
          spattered windows, the hard, uncomfortable ride..
          
                               CHARLES
                   I thought you were going to get a new
                               E
                   one of these?
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   What for? It's perfectly all right.
          
          The engine splutters as she changes gear. The car lurches
          forward.
          
          
          INT/EXT. JEEP - BALMORAL ESTATE - DAY
          
           he QUEEN drives hard through woods, dust kicking up in the
          old Land Rover's wake. It's a bone-shaking ride.
          
           HARLES stares out of the window, lost in thought..
          
                               CHARLES
                   I was thinking last night what Diana
                   might have done had it been me that
                   died in the tunnel in Paris.
          
          The QUEEN privately rolls her eyes..
          
                               CHARLES
                   She would certainly have taken the
                   boys to Paris. I rather regret not
                   doing that now.
          

          
                                                                  44.
          
          
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   What? And expose them to the media? It
                   would have been a dreadful thing to
                   do. They're much better off here.
          
                               CHARLES
                   Look, whatever else you may have
                   thought of Diana - she was a wonderful
                   mother.
                         a beat)
                   She adored those boys. And never let
                   them forget it.
                         a beat)
                   Always warm.
          
           he QUEEN's hands tighten on the steering wheel..
          
                               CHARLES
                   And physical.
                         a beat)
                   Never afraid to show her feelings.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Especially whenever a photographer was
                   in sight.
          
                               CHARLES
                   Yes, she MAY have encouraged all that,
                   but still..
          
          CHARLES looks out of the window. His eyes mist over..
          
                               CHARLES (cont'd)
                   That was always the extraordinary
                   thing about her. Her weaknesses and
                   transgressions only seemed to make the
                   public love her MORE. Yet ours only
                   make them hate us. Why is that?
          
          CHARLES looks up..
          
                               CHARLES (cont'd)
                   Why do they hate us so much?
          
          The QUEEN mutters under her breath...
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Not `us', dear.
          
                                 CHARLES
                           (not having heard)
                   What?
          
          The QUEEN salutes GAME-KEEPERS who remove their hats as the
          QUEEN roars past.
          

          
          
                                                               45.
          
          
          
                               CHARLES
                   Yesterday, when we drove the coffin
                   back into London, there was a noise. A
                   bang. I don't mind telling you I
                   thought it was a gun.
          
          CHARLES's hands wring in anxiety..
          
                               CHARLES (cont'd)
                   I thought someone had taken a shot at
                   me.
          
           he QUEEN hits the brakes, and pulls up. Visibly irritated by
          her son's weakness. She opens the door, and steps out..
                               E
                                ELIZABETH
                   Why don't you go on without me? I'm
                   going to walk back..
          
                               CHARLES
                   Are you sure?
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Yes. It looks like rain..
                        (the DOGS jump out)
                   And I'm not in the mood for stalking
                   anyway.
          
          CHARLES knows better than to contradict his mother. He gets
          into the driving seat, puts on the safety belt, and drives
          off.
          
          The Land Rover disappears in a cloud of dust.
          
          The QUEEN straightens, then notices her shoe-laces are
          undone. The DOGS bark excitedly.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Wait! My shoe-lace is undone. You
                   don't want me to trip and hurt myself,
                   do you?
                         a beat)
                   You wouldn't get any proper walks
                   then.
          
          The QUEEN blissfully chatters away to the DOGS. So much
          easier than people...
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Right. Done. Now who knows the way
                   home?
          
           he DOGS yap excitedly, immediately scamper off in the
          direction of the castle..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   You clever things!
          

          
                                                                   46.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY
          
           HARLES's Land Rover drives up into the hills, into
          spectacular landscape. A mile or two ahead, above the tree-
          line, PHILIP, the two PRINCES and STALKERS carrying guns,
          crawl on their bellies in pursuit of their quarry..
          
          A hundred years ahead of them, the STAG, unaware of the
          danger, imperiously, grazes on the grass..
          
                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - QUEEN'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
          
          The QUEEN, granite-faced, still smarting from her row with
          CHARLES, is in her bedroom. A nightcap martini is on her
          bedside table. She is writing her diary.
          
          PHILIP emerges from the bathroom, appears in the doorway..
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                     I spoke to Charles this afternoon.
          
              flicker of coldness behind her eyes..
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                     Who was good enough to share with me
                     his views on motherhood.
          
                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                     What did he say?
          A
            TV plays in the corner. DIANA, starved thin, panda-eyes,
          the infamous Martin Bashir `PANORAMA' interview..
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                     How wonderful Diana was.
          
                                  RINCE PHILIP
                     That's changing his tune.
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                     What a natural.

                     some kind..
          
          PRINCE PHILIP sees what's on television, then grimaces..
          
                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                          (puckers face)
                     Oh, for God's sake..
          

          
                                                               47.
          
          
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Maybe he's got a point. Maybe we are
                   partly to blame.
          
          PHILIP goes over to the television..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   I can't watch this.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   No, wait. Leave it.
          
          PHILIP stares at the screen..
          
                               DIANA (ON TV)
                   "Every strong woman in history has had
                   to walk down a similar path.."
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   We encouraged the match. And signed
                   off on it. Both of us.

                   You were very enthusiastic, remember.

                   She was a nice girl. Then.
          
                               DIANA (ON TV)
                   "And I think it's this strength that
                   causes the confusion and the fear."
          
          PRINCE PHILIP shakes his head..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   And I was sure he'd give the other one
                   up. Or, at least make sure his wife
                   towed the line.
                        (a gesture)
                   Isn't that what everyone does?
          
          A flicker behind the QUEEN's eyes.
          
                              ELIZABETH
                   Is it?
          
          Her knuckles momentarily whiten. Unaware, PHILIP stares at
          the television..
          
                               DIANA (ON TV)
                   "Why is she strong? Where is she
                   getting it from? Where is she going to
                   take it? How is she going to use it?"
          
          He rolls his eyes in disbelief..
          

                                                               48.
          
          
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd)
                   I can't bear it any more. If you're
                   watching, I'll sleep in here. Early
                   start tomorrow..
                        (kisses her on the
                         forehead)
                   See you in the morning.
          
          PHILIP goes, leaving the QUEEN staring. Still stinging from
          his remark about adultery.
          
           ZAP', she angrily hits the remote. The picture goes black.

          CHARLES. TONY and CHERIE sit on the sofa, watching
          television, eating pasta on their knees. STARKEY defends the
          QUEEN. Part of an older generation. She knows no better.

                               CHERIE
                   Why? They exist in a ludicrous cocoon
                   of privilege and wealth. They don't
                   pay tax.

                   Because...no would would wear it.

                         the idea)

                   Think about it. If she were still
                   alive, wouldn't Hazel be exactly the
                   same age? Whenever you talk about your
                   mother, you mention her stoicism. Her
                   frugality. Her sense of duty. The fact
                   she was brought up in the way. Well
                   c'mon..?

                   and there aren't enough barriers to
                   line the route. So we've gone cap in
                   hand to the French for theirs. And
                   there's something else I think you
                   should see.

           TONY follows ALASTAIR into an office where a television plays
          in the corner. Several young AIDES and INTERNS are watching,
          recording, making notes. Shirtsleeves, feet on desks.
          Informal.

                   going to love this.
          
          An INTERN puts in a video, hits the `play' button. ON SCREEN:
          several members of the public complain about the royals. TONY
          watches for a moment, then..

                   flying at half mast above Buckingham
                   Palace.

          The ROYAL FAMILY is gathered for a bar-be-cue lunch. At a
          distance, the BOYS, are in the river, being taught fishing by
          a GHILLIE..
          
          PRINCE PHILIP stands by a barbecue, struggling to get the
          fire to light. The QUEEN MOTHER is in another corner..
          A
            LAND ROVER pulls up. The QUEEN gets out with her dogs. She
          notices PHILIP's struggle with the bar-be-cue..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Those fire-lighters no good?

                   I brought some stew just in case. I
                   think it's lamb. We could always have
                   that cold..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   No, we'll be all right.
          
           he QUEEN throws some food to her dogs, but makes several
          hand gestures forbidding them to eat. The DOGS salivate, and
          whimper, but dutifully show their forbearance. Staring at the
          food.
          
          The QUEEN, meanwhile, starts setting places at the table with
          plates, knives and forks..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Robin had a call from the Prime
                   Minister. Who expressed his concern.
          
           HILIP turns, an exasperated look..
          
                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                   About WHAT?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   The flag above Buckingham Palace. He
                   thinks it should be flying at half-
                   mast.
          
          The DOGS continue to P
                               whimper hungrily.
          
                                RINCE PHILIP
                   Then I hope Robin told him there ISN'T
                   a flag above Buckingham Palace...
                        (angrily jabs coals with a

                   To denote the presence of the Monarch.
                   Since you're here, the flag pole is
                   bare. Which is as it should be.
          
           HARLES clears his throat..
          
                               CHARLES

                   people...the Royal Standard is just..
                   ..a flag? And that the flap pole being
                   bare sends out the wrong signal.
          
          The QUEEN turns. A withering look..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   That's not the point.
          
                                RINCE PHILIP
                   The point is it's more than four
                   hundred years old. It has never been
                   lowered for ANYONE..

                   Your grandfather didn't get that flag
                   at half-mast when he died and if your
                   mother were to die tomorrow, she
                   wouldn't get it either.
          
                               CHARLES
                   Yes...but sometimes...in a situation
                   like this..one has to be flexible..

                   When we started with one, everyone
                   predicted they would grow and grow.

                   eventually be the one seen by the
                   public. But it's not. The two Dianas,
                   theirs and ours, bear no relation to
                   one another at all.

                   Prime Minister?
          
          
          INT. DOWNING STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          TONY sits up on his sofa in his office..
          
                               TONY
                   Good afternoon, your Majesty. I'm
                   sorry to disturb. I was just
                   wondering..
          
          
           NT. BALMORAL - QUEEN'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS
          
          PRINCE PHILIP indicates she should put TONY on speaker-phone.
          The QUEEN obliges. TONY's voice comes out..
          

                                                                60.
          
          
          
                               TONY
                   ...whether you'd seen any of today's
                   papers?
          
          The QUEEN looks at her desk. Most of the newspapers are
          strewn out in front of her..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   We've managed to look at one or two,
                   yes.
          
                               TONY
                   In which case, my next question would
                   be - whether you felt some kind of
                   response might be necessary?
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   No. I believe a few over-eager editors
                   are doing their best to sell
                   newspapers..and it would be a mistake
                   to dance to their tune.
          
                               TONY
                   Under normal circumstances I would
                   agree, but..P
                                RINCE PHILIP
                        (under his breath)
                   Here we go! The bloody flag again..!
          
          ELIZABETH indicates for PHILIP to be quiet..
          
                               TONY
                   ..my advisers have been taking the
                   temperature among people on the
                   streets - and the information I'm
                   getting is that the mood..
                        (choosing words carefully)
                   ...is quite delicate.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                        (under his breath)
                   Of course. That's where all the ruddy
                   cameras are.
          
           ELIZABETH gestures again for PHILIP to `SSSsshhh'..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   So what would you suggest, Prime
                   Minister? Some kind of statement?
          
                               TONY
                   No, Ma'am. I believe the moment for
                   statements has passed.
          
           TONY takes a deep breath..
          

                                                            61.
          
          
          
                               TONY
                   I would suggest flying the flag at
                   half-mast above Buckingham Palace...
          
          PRINCE PHILIP almost has an apoplexy..
          
                              PRINCE PHILIP
                   See!
          
                               TONY
                   And coming down to London at the
                   earliest opportunity.
          
          PHILIP stares in disbelief.."What?"
          
                               TONY
                   It would be a great comfort to your
                   people and would help them with their
                   grief.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   THEIR grief?
          
           he QUEEN exchanges a look with PHILIP..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   If you're suggesting that I drop
                   everything and come down to London
                   before I attend to two boys that have
                   just lost their mother..you're
                   mistaken.
          
                               RINCE PHILIP
                   Absurd..   E
                                ELIZABETH
                   I doubt there are many who know the
                   British more than I do, Mr. Blair, nor
                   who has greater faith in their wisdom
                   and judgement. And it is my belief
                   that they will soon reject this `mood'
                   which has been stirred up by the
                   press...in favour of a period of
                   restrained grief, and sober, private
                   mourning.

                   That's the way we do things in this
                   country. Quietly. With dignity.
                        (a beat)
                   It's what the rest of the world has
                   always admired us for.
          
                               TONY
                   Well, if that's your decision, Ma'am,
                   of course the government will support
                   it.

                   Yes.

                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Bloody fool.
          
          He indicates the tea..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP

          INT. PRIVATE SECRETARY'S OFFICE - BALMORAL - SAME TIME
          
          JANVRIN speaks on the telephone to TONY BLAIR.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Prime Minister, I understand how
                   `difficult' her behaviour must seem to
                   you..how `unhelpful'..but try to see
                   it from her perspective..
                        (searches for right words)
                   She's been brought up to believe its
                   God's will that she is who she is.
          
                                TONY
                   I think we should leave God out of it.
                   It's just not helpful.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   She won't have seen anything like this
                   since the Abdication.

                               JANVRIN(cont'd)
                   And I cannot emphasise enough what
                   affect that had on her. Unexpectedly
                   becoming King as good as killed her
                   father.
          
                                TONY
                   All right - but first we have to deal
                   with these terrible headlines. I'll
                   see what I can do with the Press.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   I'm most grateful, Prime Minister.

                   But I can't promise anything. It's not
                   me they want to see.
          
          TONY hangs up, thinks, then..

          Tony comes out of his office and walks down the corridor to
          where the secretaries are.

                    nd cancel whatever I'm doing tonight.

          EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY
          
          The QUEEN drives out in her Land Rover. And into the
          countryside..
          
          
          EXT. HIGHLANDS - DAY
          
          The Land Rover shakes and judders. The QUEEN bobs up and
          down. ESTATE WORKERS remove their hats as she drives past..
          
          
          EXT. HIGHLANDS - DAY
          
          The roads have become rougher and narrower. The QUEEN drives
          with surprising confidence and ability. The QUEEN reaches a
          fork. She drives on, taking the right fork.
          

                                                               64.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. RIVER DEE - DAY
          
          The QUEEN reaches the River Dee, then slows down. She stops
          and stares. Ahead of her is a difficult, quite perilous
          crossing.
          
           he QUEEN composes herself, visibly intimidated. A deep
          breath, then..
          
          She drives into the fast-moving river.
          
          
          EXT. RIVER DEE - DAY
          
          The Land Rover's engine roars. The jeep rocks alarmingly side
          to side as it slowly crosses the river.
          
          One big rock after another. The QUEEN skilfully negotiates
          the challenge, and is beginning to enjoy the experience..
          
          But ahead is one rock she hasn't seen..
          
          `Crreeak', the Land Rover's undercarriage hits the rock. The
          ugly sound of tearing metal.
          
           he QUEEN instinctively brakes, then sensing that was the
          wrong thing to do, slams her foot down on the accelerator.
          The engine roars in protest, and..
          
          `Snap'. An ominous mechanical sound.
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                   Oh..
          
          The QUEEN's eyes widen. Knowing that sound was serious.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Oh, you are stupid.
          
          She tries to start the car again, but to no avail. No matter
          what she does, the Land Rover is stuck..
          
          The QUEEN looks into the glove box. Inside is a mobile
          telephone.

                   rear. I've lost the four-wheel drive.

          Rover's door.
          
          
          EXT. HIGHLANDS - RIVER DEE - DAY
          
          The QUEEN gingerly climbs out of the Land Rover, and walks
          across the stones to the river bank, getting her shoes wet.
          
          
          EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY
          
          The QUEEN sits on a stone by the stranded Land Rover. She
          sits in silence..
          
           othing but the sound of running water, wind in the trees,
          and birdsong.
          
          Ah, that's good.
          
           he QUEEN closes her eyes. All around her, silence except for
          the sounds of the great outdoors.
          

          
                                                               66.
          
          
          
          Privacy at last. The first moment of silence in what feels
          like months. The QUEEN breathes deeply. It's all been a bit
          much.
          
           o time to think.
          
           ne shock after another.
          
           veryone shouting.
          
           ll far too dramatic.
          
           ome to think of it, this is the first time she's been able
          to..
          
          Suddenly, almost imperceptibly, we notice her shoulders are
          shaking. Not dramatically, but enough to suggest what is
          happening. The QUEEN - away from the world - is crying.
          W
           e only see her back. Presently, she reaches into her jacket
          pocket, produces a handkerchief, and dabs her eyes.
          Gradually, she composes herself.
          
          That's better.
          
           on't want to make a fuss.
          
           he GILLIES will be here soon.
          
          The QUEEN takes a deep breath. That's better.
          
           resently the sound of rustling leaves, and the unmistakable
          sense that she is being watched. Strange..
          
          The QUEEN turns to have a look, then almost drops the cup..
          
          Standing in front of her, no more than twenty yards, is the
          STAG.
          
          The QUEEN freezes, hardly dare breathe. It is enormous. His
          antlers are bigger and more dramatic than she could have
          imagined.
          
          His fur is thick. His blaze across his nose is distinctive.
          He is vast, almost the size of a horse.
          
           nd staring at her. The QUEEN stares back.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Oh, you are a beauty.
          
          It is unprecedented - almost supernatural. No STAG ever
          willingly comes this close to humans.
          
           he QUEEN looks into his dark, brown eyes. An unmistakable
          connection between them..
          

                                                                67.
          
          
          
          It's a magical moment. All around them the whistling of wind,
          the sound of trees bending. Then, ever so faintly, in the
          distance..
          
          The hum of approaching engines. It's the GILLIES coming to
          look for the QUEEN. Sensing this..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                        (indicating the STAG
                         should go)
                   Go. Go on. You'd better go..
          
          The STAG remains rooted to the spot..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                        (claps hands)
                   Go. Shoo. Go on.
          
          The ENGINES get closer and closer. The STAG takes a last look
          at the QUEEN, then briefly inclines his head, turns, and
          walks off.
          
           o sooner has he disappeared into the woods, than..
          
          Several LAND ROVERS appear, driving across the river, and
          GILLIES and EQUERRYS jump out, holding tow-ropes, waving in
          greeting and calling out, concerned for the QUEEN's safety..
          
          The QUEEN takes a last look in the direction of the STAG, to
          make sure he has gone, and smiles to herself.
          
           e's vanished. It's as if he was never there.

                                TONY
                   I know...but allowing her to hang
                   herself might not be in our best
                   interests either.

                   everyone's started to bully her.

          head-scarf and old raincoat on. DOGS barking excitedly..
          
          She is about to set off, when JANVRIN appears, breathlessly..

                   The Prime Minister for you, Ma'am.
          
          The QUEEN looks pained at the thought..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   I'm afraid he's rather insisting.

          comes into the kitchen, DOGS barking..
          
          COOKS and MAIDS doff their caps, bowing in respect, then run
          into hiding, as the telephone extension rings..
          
          The QUEEN picks it up..

          cup of tea. The QUEEN sits down..
          
          The DOGS duly follow suit. And sit.
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                     Yes, I have.
          
                                 TONY
                     Then I'm sure you'll agree. The
                     situation has become quite critical.
          
          TONY takes a breath. Knows this won't be easy.

                     Ma'am, a poll that's to be published
                     in tomorrow's paper suggests 70% of
                     people believe your actions have
                     damaged the monarchy and one in four
                     are now in favour of abolishing the

                   above Buckingham Palace and all other
                   Royal residences. Two - leave
                   Balmoral, and fly down to London at
                   the earliest opportunity. Three - pay
                   respects in person at Diana's coffin.
                   And four - make a statement via live
                   television to my people and the world.

                               ELIZABETH
                   Something's happened. There's been a
                   change...a shift of values..

                   people, isn't it time to hand over to
                   the next generation?
          
                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   Certainly not! Remember the oath you
                   took
          
                               ELIZABETH

                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   Damaging them? My dear, you are the
                   greatest asset this institution has.
                   One of the greatest it has EVER had.
                   The problem will come when you leave,
                   but that's not for you to worry about -
                   and certainly not today.

                               ELIZABETH
                   It's just no one seems to value
                   tradition or constancy any more.
                        (a beat)
                   It's all about show. About wearing
                   your heart on your sleeve.
          
                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   And you're not like that. Never have
                   been. No...you must show strength. Re-
                   assert your authority. You sit on the
                   most powerful throne in Europe. Head
                   of an unbroken line that goes back
                   more than a thousand years. How many
                   of your predecessors do you imagine
                   would have dropped everything and gone
                   down to London because people holding
                   candles wanted help with their grief?

          The QUEEN MOTHER's tirade continues, but the QUEEN is not
          listening. She knows she has a decision to make.

                   What? It's madness! The whole thing!
                   Bloody madness!
          
          Thunderous, Philip hangs up.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP

                         the right words)

          of the WORLD's MEDIA whir and pop through the gates of
          Balmoral Castle.
          
          It's an eerie, venal image. An unmistakable echo of DIANA's
          world, and her last moments in Paris.
          
          The QUEEN, CHARLES, PHILIP, and the two PRINCES try not to
          show their hostility, and gingerly inspect the flowers laid
          at the gates of Balmoral..
          
          The QUEEN's face is grim set. Lips pursed. Visibly uneasy
          with the CAMERAS audibly whirring all around her.
          
          CHARLES holds his son's hand, and tries to concentrate on the
          flowers and wreathes and tributes.
          
            RINCE WILLIAM stares at the CAMERAS. Hostile,
          uncomprehending looks. The beginning of a lifelong animosity.
          Suddenly..
          `
           BANG' a passing motorbike's exhaust backfires. CHARLES jolts
          in shock, and flinches privately.
          

          
                                                                78.
          
          
          
          Clearly, his fears have not lessened. He's expecting the
          bullet at any moment..
          
          
           NT. DOWNING STREET - BLAIR FAMILY FLAT - SAME TIME
          
          In the kitchen: CHERIE is feeding the kids supper at the
          kitchen table. The cheery chaos of family life. Everyone
          talking at once. Laughter. Teasing.
          
          Through an open door, we can see TONY in the sitting-room
          working. Shirt-sleeves, tie loosened..
          
          
          INT. BLAIR FLAT - SITTING ROOM - SAME TIME
          
          TONY sits with his feet up, doing his boxes, signing papers,
          and half watching television at the same time.
          
          ON SCREEN: the QUEEN and the Royals doing their photo-call.
          The voice of the NEWS READER at Channel Four..
          
                               NEWS READER (ON T.V.)
                   We are just getting some pictures now
                   from Balmoral. These are rather
                   historic shots. Clearly the Queen has
                   responded to criticism that the Royal
                   Family is not engaged..
          T
           TONY looks up. Breathes a sigh of relief..
          
                               TONY
                        (to himself)
                   Thank God for that.
          
          From the kitchen: CHERIE's voice..
          
                               CHERIE (cont'd)
                   It's fish-fingers. Want any?
          
                               TONY
                   Be right there.
          
          TONY finishes signing the papers. Turns off the TV. Walks
          into the kitchen. We hear CHERIE's voice as the door closes..
          
                               CHERIE
                   I'm afraid they're a bit burned.
          
                                                           FADE TO BLACK
          
          
          EXT. BALMORAL - DAY
          
          The PIPER SERGEANT walks around the castle perimeter playing
          the bag-pipes.
          

          
                                                               79.
          
          
          
          
          INT QUEENS BEDROOM - DAY
          
          The Queen is being dressed in black by her DRESSERS. Her Face
          apparently inscrutable. But the difficulty of the situation
          is clear.
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - BEDROOMS - VARIOUS - DAY
          
          The QUEEN comes downstairs to the first landing where bags
          are being brought out of the rooms by MAIDS and VALETS
                               P
                                RINCE PHILIP
                   Where are the boys? Have they already
                   left?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Yes. They left for London after
                   breakfast. With Charles.
          
           HILIP shakes his head..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   It's not right, you know
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Yes, but further discussion is no
                   longer helpful either.
          
          The QUEEN heads downstairs.   PHILIP follows...
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Oh, well. I suppose it gives the
                   ghillies time to find a new stag for
                   the boys now theirs has been shot.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   What?
          
          The QUEEN momentarily stiffens..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Haven't you heard? It wandered onto
                   one of the neighbouring estates where
                   it was shot by one of the commercial
                   guests.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Really..?
          
          The blood has drained from her face..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Which estate?
          

                                                               80.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. BALMORAL - COURTYARD - DAY
          
          The QUEEN, pulling an old Barbour over her black dress,
          emerges into a courtyard where the royal cars are being
          loaded with bags for the trip.
          
          She climbs into a landrover, starts the engine.
          
          SECURITY MEN stare quizzically at one another, then leap into
          life and dash to their own cars to follow
          
          They drive out of the Balmoral Estate.
          
          
          INT. DOWNING STREET - BLAIR OFFICE - DAY
          
          TONY sits at his desk working on his speech. A knock on the
          door. ALASTAIR CAMPBELL enters..
          
                               CAMPBELL
                   Here's your box. There's some
                        (
                   important policy unit stuff on top.
                          a beat)
                   And you've seen the papers?
          
                               TONY
                        (snaps, irritated)
                   I'm the Prime Minister. Of course I've
                   seen the papers.
          
          ALASTAIR indicates the newspapers laid out on the table..
          
          'The Times': `PALACE BENDS THE KNEE TO BLAIR"
          
          'The Sun': "QUEEN CAVES IN ON PALACE FLAG".
          
          `The Express': "DOWNING STREET STEPS IN TO SAVE QUEEN".
          
          `The Mirror': "A QUIET WORD FROM TONY BLAIR AND THE NATION
          GETS ITS WISH".
          
                                LASTAIR
                        (in comic voice)
                   "Your Maj? Come down to London." "Who
                   says so?" "Tony Blair."
          
           LASTAIR reaches the door - sees TONY. Then..
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   "Mr. Father of the Nation."
          
          ALASTAIR goes. TONY watches. Losing patience.
          

                                                                 81.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOURING CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY
          
          The QUEEN's Land Rover, plus a protection vehicle, pulls up
          in a courtyard at Braemar Castle.
          
          The DRIVERS jump out. Go to open the doors for her..
          
          Working STALKERS and GHILLIES stop in their tracks, and
          double-take. Faces appear at windows. STABLE-HANDS, VISITORS
          and ESTATE STAFF stop and stare..
          
          We over hear whispers, `Bloody hell!' `It's her!'
          
          Presently, the HEAD GHILLIE appears in a doorway,
          deferentially straightening his hair, and clothes. He walks
          towards the QUEEN.
          
                               HEAD GILLIE
                   Morning, Ma'am. Is it his Lordship
                   you've come to see?
          H
           e reaches into his pockets for his cell-phone..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   No, no..please don't disturb him. I've
                   come on another matter. I hope you
                   don't mind..
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOURING ESTATE - DAY
          
          The QUEEN and HEAD GILLIE walk towards a circular cooling
          room. The HEAD GILLIE opens the door..
          
          
          INT. NEIGHBOURING ESTATE - REFRIGERATED ROOM - DAY
          
          A large cooling room, where the shot animals are washed,
          disembowelled and cut up.
          
          Hanging in the centre of the room, his innards removed, blood
          draining onto the floor, is the STAG. A GAMEKEEPER, in
          overalls, is working on the carcass, when the door opens, and
          the QUEEN walks in.
          
           he GAMEKEEPER straightens. Stops what he's doing..
          
                               HEAD GILLIE
                   There he is..
          
          The QUEEN gasps in shock. Notices the GAMEKEEPER was about to
          begin the process of severing the STAG's head. The HEAD
          GILLIE, mistaking her reaction for admiration, smiles..
          

          
                                                                  82.
          
          
          
                               HEAD GILLIE (cont'd)
                   Yes, he's a beauty, isn't he? An
                   Imperial, Ma'am. Fourteen pointer.
          
           ut the QUEEN has not heard. She indicates a nasty wound..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                    e was wounded.
          
                               HEAD GILLIE
                   Yes. We got our guest in very close,
                   had him lined-up perfect, and still..
                         shrugs apologetically)
                   ..an investment banker, Ma'am. From
                   London.
          
          The QUEEN stretches her hand out, almost touches the wound..
          
                               HEAD GILLIE (cont'd)
                   I'm afraid the stalkers had to follow
                   him for miles - to finish him off.
          
                               ELIZABETH

                   Let's hope he didn't suffer too much.
          
          Unseen by others, the QUEEN's knuckles whiten..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Please pass my congratulations to your
                   guest.
          
                               HEAD GILLIE
                   I will, Ma'am.
          
           he clears her throat, then goes..
          
                               HEAD GILLIE
                        (removing hat)
                   God bless you.
          
          The QUEEN goes. Dignified on the outside, but dying a
          thousand deaths underneath.

           n the table in between them are all the morning's NEWSPAPERS
          with their humiliating headlines.

          A shadow passes across her. The sound of a clearing throat.
          The QUEEN looks up. It's ROBIN JANVRIN. She snaps out of it.
                               E
                                  ELIZABETH
                   Yes, Robin..
          
          She puts on her glasses. Composure returns. Professional
          again.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   I've done a draft of your television

                   Thank you.
          
           ANVRIN puts it down. He notices all the NEWSPAPERS.
          
                                ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Was there anything else?
          
          JANVRIN opens his mouth, wants to say something to comfort
          her..but realises it would be inappropriate.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   No, Ma'am. Landing in fifteen minutes.

          ALASTAIR sits at his desk. A TV plays the footage of the
          QUEEN's car driving through the MALL..
          
          A SECRETARY walks in..
          
                               SECRETARY
                   I've got a copy of the Queen's speech.
          
          She passes it over to ALASTAIR..
          
                               SECRETARY
                   Shall I give Tony a copy?
          
                                LASTAIR
                   Let me have a look at it first.
          
          ALASTAIR starts reading it..
          

          
                                                                  84.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CAR - SAME TIME - ARCHIVE / RECONSTITUTED ARCHIVE
          
          The QUEEN and PHILIP stare out of the car. For the first
          time, they get an idea of the actual size and scale of the
          CROWDS..
          
                              PRINCE PHILIP
                        (jaw drops)
                   Good God..
          
          The QUEEN stares in fear and disbelief at the people lining
          the MALL. In places, the CROWDS are standing twenty deep.
          
           he FACES are reflected in the car windows. Are they hostile?
          Are they people she understands? Camera flashlights pop.
          
          
           NT. DOWNING STREET - ALASTAIR'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
          
          ALASTAIR makes a change to the Queen's speech. We CLOSE on
          the text as he writes, inserting...
          
                         "..speaking as a Grandmother"..
          
          In the background, on TV: we see the QUEEN's car pulls up.
          The doors open, the QUEEN gets out..
          
          Unaware her words are being edited by her Government.

           he QUEEN steps out into the crowds..
          
          
          INT. DOWNING STREET - MONITORING ROOM - DAY
          
          TONY and several AIDES are watching the televisions.
          
          ON SCREEN: the QUEEN and PHILIP are looking at bouquets laid
          at the gates of the palace, reading messages and
          inscriptions..
          
          Candles are burning. Incense sticks. There are pictures of
          DIANA, and mini-shrines. Poems have been written.
          
           TONY watches intently. Behind him, the door opens and
          ALASTAIR enters..
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   They sent a copy of the Queen's
                   speech.
          
          ALISTAIR holds it between finger and thumb..
          

          
                                                               85.

                   You might want to scrape the frost off
                   it first.
          
          ALASTAIR passes it to TONY..
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   I made a couple of changes. So it
                   sounds like it comes from a human
                   being.
          
          ALASTAIR turns, walks towards the door..
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   Oh, and one bit of good news. The old
                   boot's FINALLY agreed to pay respects
                   at Diana's coffin.
          
          TONY spins round, eyes flashing in anger..
          
                               TONY
                   You know when you get it wrong, you
                   REALLY get it wrong.
                         a beat)
                   That woman has given her whole life in
                   service to her people - fifty years
                   doing a job she NEVER wanted - a job
                   she watched kill her father. She's
                   executed it with dignity, honour and,
                   as far as I can tell, without a single
                   blemish - and now we line up baying
                   for her blood - why? Because she's
                   struggling to lead the world in
                   mourning for a woman who threw
                   everything she offered back in her
                   face, and who seemed, in the last few
                   years, to be committed twenty-four
                   seven to destroy everything she holds
                   dear.

           TONY storms off.
          
          
          EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
          
          The QUEEN continues to read the hand-written messages for
          DIANA, "We love you." "Rest with the angels, Diana". "You
          touched us with your love."
          
           nd also some which are downright hostile. "You were too good
          for them." "They have your blood on their hands."
          
           he QUEEN stares, visibly shocked, then..
          
          Behind her, a small GIRL approaches, holding a bouquet of
          flowers. She stops, in front of the QUEEN..
          
                            

                                                                 86.

                   Oh..hello.
          
           he LITTLE GIRL tries to curtsey..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Would you like me to place them for
                   you?
          
                                LITTLE GIRL
                   No.
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                   Oh.
          
                               LITTLE GIRL
                   They're for you.

                        (visibly shocked)
                   For me..?
          
          The QUEEN is thrown. Suddenly looks utterly lost. Vulnerable,
          almost childlike. Her eyes are puffy and swollen, as though
          she is fighting tears..
          C
           ROWDS of MOURNERS watch intently. The QUEEN takes the
          flowers, then turns and walks away, visibly shaken..
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CHINESE ROOM - DAY
          
          A television CREW is rigging lights in the Chinese Room in
          Buckingham Palace. JANVRIN enters and crosses the room.
          CAMERAS are being fixed to tripods..
          
          The QUEEN sits in a corner going through her speech.
          
                                ANVRIN
                   Your Majesty, there's a last minute
                   addition from Downing Street. They're
                   suggesting adding `..and as a
                   grandmother..' here.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Right.
          
          The QUEEN makes a note on the text..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   "So what I say to you now, as your
                   Queen and as a grandmother, I say from
                   my heart."
          
                               JANVRIN
                   You think you can say it?
          

          
                                                               87.
          
          
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Do I have a choice?
          
          The QUEEN turns as SOUND RECORDERS fix a clip-mike to her
          dress.
          
                                IRECTOR
                   We're ready for you, your Majesty..
          
          The QUEEN gets up.
          
                               DIRECTOR
                   Just to confirm this is going out
                   live.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Right
          
                               DIRECTOR
                   And you'll be at the front of the six
                   o'clock news on all the channels
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I see.
          
          The QUEEN is led over to where the DIRECTOR has placed a
          chair and table in front of the cameras and lights..

          The QUEEN sits at her desk. Final touches from hair and make-
          up. The MALL is clearly visible. The QUEEN holds the speech
          in front of her..
          
                               DIRECTOR (cont'd)

          We close on the QUEEN's face, and..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Since last Saturday's dreadful news we
                   have seen, throughout Britain and the
                   world, an overwhelming expression of
                   sadness at Diana's death..

                               ELIZABETH
                   We have all been trying in our
                   different ways to cope. The initial
                   shock is often succeeded by a mixture
                   of other feelings. Disbelief,
                   incomprehension, anger and concern for
                   those who remain.
          
          
          INT. DOWNING STREET - SAME TIME
          
          TONY and CHERIE BLAIR watch from their apartment..
          
                               ELIZABETH (ON TV)
                   We have all felt these emotions in
                   these last few days. So what I say to
                   you now, as your Queen and as a
                   grandmother, I say from my heart...
          
          TONY flinches in sympathy as she says the line. CHERIE
          notices this, then..
          
                               CHERIE
                   "Heart"? What "heart". She doesn't
                   mean a word of this.
          
                               TONY
                   That's not the point. What she's doing
                   is extraordinary.
                        (points to the TV)
                   That's how you survive.
          
          CHERIE turns, and stares..
          
                               CHERIE
                   Listen to you! A week ago you were the
                   great moderniser, making speeches
                   about the "People's Princess", now
                   you've gone weak at the knees.
          
          TONY bristles with irritation..
          
                               CHERIE
                   I don't know why I'm surprised. In the
                   end, all Labour Prime Ministers go ga-
                   ga for her Maj.
          
                               ELIZABETH (ON TV)
                   I hope that tomorrow we can all,
                   wherever we are, join in expressing
                   our grief at Diana's loss, and
                   gratitude for her all-too-short life.
          

                                                                  89.
          
          
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CHINESE ROOM - SAME TIME
          
          The QUEEN draws to a close. Her face is inscrutable. The
          DIRECTOR prepares his CREW to wind up..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   May those who died rest in peace and
                   may we, each and every one of us..
          
          CLOSE-UP OF THE QUEEN:
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   ..thank God for someone who made many,
                   many people happy.
          
          The QUEEN holds her expression for the camera. Then..
          
                               DIRECTOR
                        (calls out)
                   And we're out..!
          
          The QUEEN's face relaxes. As does everyone in the room. A
          huge, collective breathing out.
                               D
                                IRECTOR (cont'd)
                   Thank you, your Majesty.
          
          But the QUEEN doesn't acknowledge him. She removes her clip-
          mike, and hands it to the DIRECTOR..
          
          ..then walks over to a waiting PRINCE PHILIP, who
          protectively extends an arm. The QUEEN and PRINCE PHILIP
          leave the room. People are left staring awkwardly at one
          another..
          
          OVER THIS: we FADE IN the sound of a haunting, elegiac hymn..

          A soloist sings "Libera me, Domine" from Verdi's Requiem, in

          GUESTS, (including TOM CRUISE, TON HANKS, NICOLE KIDMAN and

                                                       SLOW FADE TO BLACK:
          
          
          CAPTION: `TWO MONTHS LATER'
          
          
           NT. DOWNING STREET - BLAIR'S FLAT - EVENING
          
          The face of TONY BLAIR stares back from a bathroom mirror.
          CHERIE is proudly tying his tie. Checking his appearance.
          
          We're in the family apartment above 11, Downing Street.
          CHERIE puts the finishing touches to his appearance..
          
          We notice her appearance has become even more stylish. Gone
          is her spiky hair. And the rough edges. Every inch the First
          Lady. They've both come a long way in a short time.
          
                               CHERIE
                   So? Off to see your girlfriend?
          
                                TONY
                   Now, now..
          
                               CHERIE
                   I hope she shows you some respect this
                   time. It's quite a debt of gratitude
                   she owes you.
          
          CHERIE straightens his tie..
          
                               CHERIE
                   Mr "Saviour of the Monarchy."
          
                                 TONY
                       doubt she'll see it that way.
          
          
           XT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - COURTYARD - EVENING
          
          TONY's motorcade sweeps into Buckingham Palace. Doors are
          opened by his PROTECTION OFFICERS.
          
           TONY steps out to be greeted by the waiting JANVRIN..
          
                               TONY
                   Robin. Good to see you.
          

                                                                 91.
          
          
          
                                 JANVRIN
                     Prime Minister.
          
                                 TONY
                          (his most winning smile)
                     Tony, please..
          
          JANVRIN allows himself a private smile..
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR - EVENING
          
          TONY BLAIR and the EQUERRY walk along the corridor, and reach
          the door.
          
           TONY shoots his cuffs. Clears his throat. The EQUERRY knocks.
          
          
          INT. AUDIENCE ROOM - EVENING
          
          TONY and the EQUERRY enter. Both bow from the neck..
          
                                 EQUERRY
                     The Prime Minister, Ma'am.
          
          TONY walks forward and meets the QUEEN, who, like JANVRIN,
          barely smiles, doesn't make eye contact, shakes his hand, and
          indicates a seat..
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                     Do sit down.
          
                                  TONY
                     Thank you.
          
           TONY sits, and stares at the QUEEN. Her face is inscrutable.
                               T
                                  TONY
                     It's good to see you again. After
                     quite a summer..
          
          The QUEEN's face. Stiffens.
          
                                 TONY (cont'd)
                     I'm referring to your visit to India
                     and Pakistan, where your comments
                     about ending historic disagreements
                     went down very well.
          
           ilence.
          
                                 TONY (cont'd)
                     And the Commonwealth Heads of
                     Government Meeting. I spoke to the
                     Prime Minister of Malawi, who was
                     saying how much he appreciated your
                     tough stance on Nigeria.
          

          
                                                               92.
          
          
          
          Silence.
          
                                  TONY
                      I meant to tell you at the time but
                      you were being monopolised rather.
          
           ilence.
          
                                  TONY
                      I imagine those occasions are quite
                      difficult. Twenty-four heads of
                      Government each clamouring for a
                      private audience..
          
          Silence. TONY takes a deep breath, then..
          
                                  TONY
                      Also, we haven't had a chance to speak
                      since THAT week. And I wanted to offer
                      my apologies..
          
          The QUEEN looks up..
          
                                  ELIZABETH
                      Whatever for?
          
                                  TONY
                      In case you'd felt `manhandled' or
                      `managed' in any way.
          
                                    ELIZABETH
                      Not at all.
          
              beat.
          
                                  ELIZABETH
                      I don't think I shall ever understand
                      what happened this summer.
          
                                    TONY
                      The circumstances were exceptional,
                      Ma'am. And in the end, you showed
                      great personal strength, courage, and
                      humility.   E
                                   ELIZABETH
                       ou're confusing humility with
                      humiliation.
          
                                   TONY
                      That's not true.
          
                                   ELIZABETH
                      You didn't hear what they were saying
                      in the Mall that Friday.
          

          
                                                                 93.
          
          
          
                                    TONY
                        I still believe History will show it
                        was a good week for you.
          
                                     ELIZABETH
                        And an even better one for you, Mr
                        Blair.
          
                                    TONY
                        But there are fifty-two weeks in a
                        year, Ma'am. And two and a half
                        thousand in a half century.
          
          The QUEEN looks up. Thrown by his compliment..
          
                                    TONY
                        And when people come to assess your
                        legacy, no one will remember those few
                        days.
          
                                       ELIZABETH
                        Really?
          
          
          
                                    ELIZABETH
                        You don't feel that what respect or
                        affection people might once have had
                        for..
          
          She wants to say `Me', but instead says..
          
                                    ELIZABETH
                        ..this institution has been
                        diminished?
          
                                      TONY
                        Not at all.
          
              pause..
          
                                    ELIZABETH
                        I gather some of your closest advisors
                        were less fulsome in their support..
          
                                     TONY
                        One or two. But as a leader one
                        has...a different perspective.
                              a beat)
                        I could never have added my voice to
                        the chorus.
          
                                     ELIZABETH
                        You're very kind.
          
          The QUEEN looks at TONY, raises an eyebrow..
          

          
                                                               94.
          
          
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   But let's also not forget the more
                   pragmatic reason.
          
                               TONY
                   Which is?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   That without me there to distract
                   everyone, it'd suddenly become
                   embarrassingly clear how much
                   unchecked power the British Prime
                   Minister actually has.
          
           TONY looks up..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   If fifty years of doing MY job has
                   taught me anything, it is that the
                   people doing YOURS generally prefer me
                   with all my faults to some kind of
                   meddling President..
                        (a beat)
                   Just look at the French.
          
          The QUEEN opens her handbag, and takes out her reading
          glasses..            E
                                ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   I suppose we'd better get on with the
                   business in hand..
          
          The QUEEN looks out of the window. Notices how the sun is
          setting..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   I do love this time of day. Shall we
                   walk while there's still some sunshine
                   left? I do hope you're a walker.
          
                               TONY
                   I am.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Good. The clocks go back next week,
                   then it'll be dark by five.
          
          TONY and the QUEEN get to their feet.
          
                                ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   I always think these meetings stand a
                   better chance of succeeding if the
                   Prime Minister is a walker.
          
          FOOTMEN open the door as TONY and the QUEEN go out of the
          Audience Room, and into..
          
                                                                  95.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CORRIDOR - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
          
          BLAIR and the QUEEN turns a corner, and emerge into a
          corridor from the audience room...
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   As a matter of fact, it's how I think
                   best. On my feet. I've never been one
                   for sitting around endlessly. A good
                   walk and fresh air sorts everything
                   out..
          
          Unexpectedly, she stops. And suddenly we realize she's been
          holding something back..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   One in four, you said? Wanted to get
                   rid of me? T
          
                                TONY
                   For about half an hour. But then you
                   came down to London and all that went
                   away.
          
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I've never been hated like that
                   before.
          
                               TONY
                   No. And that must have been difficult.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   It was. Very.
          
          They begin walking again..
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                   Ever since Diana people want glamour
                   and tears..the grand performance..and
                   I'm not very good at that. I prefer to
                   keep my feelings to myself. Foolishly
                   I believed that's what people wanted
                   from their Queen. Not to make a fuss
                   nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve,
                   duty first... self second.
          
          The QUEEN stops..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   It's how I was brought up. It's all
                   I've ever known
          
                               TONY
                   One forgets. You were so young when
                   you became Queen.
          

                                                                96.
          
          
          
          The QUEEN drifts off..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I was. A girl.
          
          Then pulls herself back..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   But I can see the world has changed.
                   And one must 'modernise'.
          
                               TONY
                   Well, perhaps that's where I can help.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   (with a twinkle as they set off)
                   Don't get ahead of yourself Prime-
                   minister, I think you'll find that I'm
                   supposed to be advising YOU!
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GRAND STAIRCASE - DAY
          
          The corridor outside. As the QUEEN passes JANVRIN, he
          surreptitiously looks at his watch, and raises his eyebrow.
          The QUEEN smiles..
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GARDENS - DAY
          
          FOOTMEN open double-doors which lead out into the gardens.
          The QUEEN and the PRIME MINISTER walk out..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   So...what might we expect in your
                   first Parliament?
          
          TONY clears his throat, then..
          
                               TONY
                   Well, Ma'am, top of the list is
                   education reform. We want to radically
                   reduce classroom sizes...
          
          Our CAMERA slowly pulls back over the gardens, until the
          QUEEN and TONY are two dots in the distance...
          
          Time has moved on. Sand has covered the footprints.
          
          The momentary hiccup that was `Diana' already long
          forgotten..
          
                                                       FADE TO BLACK:
