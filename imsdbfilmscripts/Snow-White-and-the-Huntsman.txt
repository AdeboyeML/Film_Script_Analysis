          1 EXT. GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 1

          From high above we see the castle gardens covered in a blanket
          of snow. We hear the tread of footsteps then see a beautiful
          WOMAN in a fur-lined cloak heading towards an unseen object.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          Once upon a time, in deep winter, a Queen
          was admiring the falling snow when she saw
          a rose blooming in defiance of the cold.
          The rose looks miraculously red. Nearby, a RAVEN looks on. The
          Queen gazes at the flower, then bends down.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          Reaching for it, she pricked her finger and
          three drops of blood fell.
          BOOM -- with the impact of an artillery shell, a DROP OF BLOOD
          lands in the snow. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.
          The Queen startles, then calmly touches her stomach.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          And because the red seemed so alive against
          the white, she thought, if only I had a
          child as white as snow, lips as red as
          blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and
          all with the strength of that rose.
          A beat, then we hear the piercing cry of a new-born baby --

          2 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 2

          We find ourselves in a crowded chamber full of MIDWIVES and
          PHYSICIANS. Moving through the chaos we glimpse buckets of
          water, dirty sponges, astrology charts and protection charms --
          until we see a BABY GIRL in the arms of her happy mother.

          ERIC (V.O.)
          Soon after, a daughter was born to the
          Queen and was named "Snow White."
          With a radiant smile, the Queen offers SNOW WHITE to her proud
          father, KING MAGNUS. The baby's CRIES grow louder as the King
          cradles her gently in his arms, turning towards a mirror.

          ERIC V/O
          And she was adored throughout the kingdom
          as much for her defiant spirit as for her
          beauty.

          A wounded MAGPIE is twitching in a puddle of water. SNOW WHITE,
          aged 7 now, steps towards it hesitantly, looking concerned.

          Pick it up, William.
          Her companion, William, also 7, braces himself, reaches down,
          then steps back in alarm as the bird starts flapping wildly. He
          tries to cover his embarrassment by sounding knowledgeable.

                         YOUNG WILLIAM
          It's dying. It doesn't want to be touched.
          Snow White ignores him, approaching the bird herself. She kneels
          down, hesitates, then reaches out and strokes the magpie,
          calming its flapping before she picks it up.
          High up on a tree, ANOTHER MAGPIE looks on.

          4 EXT. SEASIDE VILLAGE/ CASTLE BRIDGE - DAY 4

          SNOW WHITE runs, cupping the wounded bird in her hand, William
          dashing after her. The sun is out and the fields and forests are
          lit up in all their glory. The children sprint through a
          BEAUTIFUL SEASIDE VILLAGE -- thatched homes with flower gardens,
          HAPPY FARMERS and FAIR VILLAGE MAIDENS --

          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
          Hurry, William! Hurry!
          They run down the dunes, waves crashing, the sand gleaming in
          the sunlight, until they see the BEAUTIFUL CASTLE up ahead --

          5 EXT. CLOISTER GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY 5

           A single apple tree stands in the middle of the cloisters. It
           stands out. Snow White and William dash past it into the castle.

          7 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 7

          Snow White bursts into her parent's chamber. The King and Queen
          turn from the window. Two PHYSICIANS are in attendance. Snow
          White is too young and preoccupied to notice but her mother's
          smile is tinged with sadness and her father looks heartbroken.

          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
          We found it in the woods.
          The Queen takes the wounded magpie from Snow White. The King
          looks on sadly as she pulls a RIBBON from Snow White's hair and
          carefully binds the magpie's wing. William watches from the
          doorway, noticing how frail the Queen looks.
          The magpie's flapping gradually calms, its pain easing.

                         QUEEN
          It will heal in time.
          Snow White's eyes are fixed on the little bird.

          So does the Queen, holding back her tears.

                         QUEEN
          You possess a rare beauty, my love. In
          here.
          (She touches Snow white's heart)
          Never lose it. Hold it dear. You will need
          its strength to one day become Queen.

          8 EXT. CLOISTER GARDEN/ CASTLE - DAY. 8

          Snow White and William, with a small toy bow strapped to his
          back, climb the branches of the apple tree in the cloister
          gardens. William picks a DISTINCTIVE RED AND WHITE APPLE and
          offers it to Snow White.
          He makes a point of the offer, holding it out, nodding.
          Just as she comes to take it he pulls it away and takes a
          huge bite himself, grinning. Snow White shoves him off the
          tree and they fall to the ground.
          And now we PULL BACK to reveal the King and William's father,
          DUKE HAMMOND, watching from the throne room balcony.

                         KING MAGNUS
          My daughter will need your son's friendship
          more than ever, Duke Hammond. As will I
          yours.

          The garden is covered in snow but there is no red rose now. King
          Magnus walks with his arm around Snow white, heartbroken.
          A single tear rolls down Snow White's cheek. Palace onlookers
          and mourners, fixed on her face, feeling what she feels, move
          aside.

          A year went by but the King was

           From above we see horses movie through the forest and enter a
           clearing. At the head is --
          King Magnus, with Duke Hammond by his side, surrounded by a
          line of the King's Army. They are frozen as they look at--
          Across the battlefield - Horsemen in a line. THE RIDERS are
          silhouetted on a misty plain -- a VAST SHADOW ARMY of faceless
          warriors.
          King Magnus and the Duke trade a look -

          From what hell comes this army?

          A hell they'll soon revisit!
          King Magnus SCREAMS A BLOOD CRY, kicks his horse and rides
          forward with blind courage, no longer caring what happens to
          him.
          The two lines of warriors race, pell-mell to the center of
          the battlefield. When they meet --
          Hand to hand combat at its most brutal.
          King Magnus swings his great sword, and a SHADOW WARRIOR

          SHATTERS LIKE GLASS.
          All down the line the same is happening - Shadow Warriors
          shattering, evaporating.
          Strange.
          DUKE HAMMOND shatters an opponent as well and as loud and
          furious as the battlefield was only moments before, it is now
          that quiet.
          The King and the Duke watch in amazement as the rest of the
          SHADOW ARMY melts away, DISSOLVING INTO THE MORNING MIST until
          all that is left in the field is --

          The unholy army was defeated, leaving
          King Magnus with the spoils of victory.
          A CAGED PRISON WAGON. Odd. Not even sure how it got there.
          King Magnus moves toward it, with a little trepidation. When
          he's close he gets off his horse, walks closer and dares to
          look inside.

          Inside the cage, a WOMAN COWERS, her face hidden behind a veil.
          King Magnus stares at her through the prison bars, then with a
          mighty blow of his sword shatters the lock and enters.

                         KING MAGNUS
          You are now free. You have nothing to fear
          from me.
          Duke Hammond watches from outside the cage, a bit wary, as the
          King kneels beside the terrified woman.

          What is your name, my lady?
          Slowly, the woman turns. For a moment the King wonders if it's
          his beloved Queen behind the veil. Gently, he lifts her veil.
          It's not his wife, but the most beautiful woman he's ever seen.

          several sets of HANDS. Her eyes stare straight ahead,
          unblinking, her mind elsewhere.
          Attendants are preparing Ravenna for her wedding to the King.

          White. Ravenna beckons to her with a look and then holds out

          Snow White rushes towards her father's chamber and sees Ravenna
          at the end of the corridor. Relieved, she hurries towards her
          stepmother when suddenly she notices her father's lifeless body
          lying on the bed. FINN and his KNIGHTS appear beside Ravenna. It
          takes a moment for the betrayal to sink in, tears of shock
          welling in Snow White's eyes, before she turns and flees --

          The chaos has spread to the courtyard, DUKE HAMMOND'S KNIGHTS

          dazed by the sight of battle, then sees William pull free of his
          father's guards and run towards her --
          William grabs her protectively when strong arms reach down and
          lift them both onto the back of separate horses. Duke Hammond
          and his personal guard are attempting to ride out of the castle
          before the portcullis closes.
          The Duke rides under the portcullis with William. His bodyguard
          is about to follow when an ARROW FROM FINN STRIKES HIM IN THE
          BACK and both he and Snow White are thrown off their horse.

          tearing them from the walls. Cleaning house. Ravenna's soldiers
          deliver a large object, then leaving her alone. A BEAUTIFUL

          wood for a fire. She's done this every day for years. A
          regimen. Her hands work precisely as she stacks the wood and

          in her bed and pretends to sleep.
          A GUARD opens a cell opposite Snow White. A few seconds
          later the door CLANGS SHUT.
          As soon as the Guard is gone, Snow White rises, walks to her
          cell door and looks down the hall to the other cell.

          Two magpies appear in the window. She looks at them and
          watches as they flap their wings. Like they're trying to
          tell her something. She moves toward them.
          They jump back and up to the edge of the roof that is beside
          the cell window, hovering there.
          She is confused but notices --
          A roofing nail, right where the Magpies hover.
          Snow White reaches a hand out the window and touches the
          loose nail. Her fingers move it back and forth as it, bit by
          bit, breaks free.
          She yanks hard.at the nail, almost has it when --
          The Magpies flutter again and blast away, as if afraid --

          loose.
          she jumps down, lies in her bed again just as --
          Finn unlocks her door, leaving the key in the lock, and walks
          into the cell. He stands there until she turns her head
          slightly to him.
          She doesn't move, grips the nail in her closed hand as she
          tries to lure him closer with her eyes.

          Snow White hurtles down the steps to Greta's cell. She is
          shocked by what she sees. Rose, now an old woman, looks to her.
          Snow White fumbles with the keys. Rose holds out both her

          Snow White runs down the steps into a corridor and sees ARMED
          GUARDS appear at the other end. She hurries into another tower,
          bolting the door shut behind her, and charges down the steps.

          41 EXT. COURTYARD/ CASTLE - DAY. 41

          SNOW WHITE BURSTS OUTSIDE -- into the light. She almost
          hyperventilates at all the air, the sky. Then she runs through
          the courtyard toward the portcullis.
          The magpies fly right into her face then away, telling her to
          follow. She does and heads straight for the small opening at
          the base of the castle wall - the entrance to the SEWERS.
          As the magpies rise, she slides on one hip, plunging into the
          darkness below. The guards follow but can't squeeze through
          the opening, running towards the Portcullis instead.

          Snow White is swept out of the sewers into the sea. Seaweed
          wraps itself around her limbs, pulling her deeper.into the
          depths, but she kicks and fights her way back to the surface --
          gasping for air.

          Snow White swims ashore. She looks up and sees a maze of large
          rocks stretching out. She sets off in one direction when the two
          MAGPIES reappear, urging her to follow them in another
          direction. She scrambles after them and sees a WHITE MARE
          waiting for her on the beach, lying on its side, allowing her to
          climb on. The mare raises itself and is away in a flash.

          Galloping hooves skim the surf, RIDERS pursuing Snow White.

          Snow White rides towards the village -- only it's unrecognizable
          now -- most of the cottages have been razed to the ground or
          boarded up.
          A group of people including children - skeletal, hungry,
          desperate - see her approach and move out to greet her.
          She stops her horse for a moment, gazing past tears at the
          devastation and the state of villagers all around her.
          At first their approach seems harmless but as they get closer
          their faces reveal dangerous desperation and --
          She gallops off, looking back to see the Queen's men giving
          chase.

          48 EXT. FIELDS AND WOODLAND BEYOND THE VILLAGE - DAY. 48

          The fields and woods are even more devastated than the village.
          Farmland has been burnt to cinders and trees chopped down. All
          around Snow White the world is stubble and ash.

          49 EXT. ENDLESS MOOR - AERIAL SHOT - DAY. 49

          Snow White crests a hill, her mare rearing as she sees -- THE
          DARK FOREST -- A VAST WALL OF PRIMORDIAL TREES. A mist seeps
          from the forest like an evil miasma. Snow white hesitates --
          then sees the riders closing in and urges her mare on --

          Shadows everywhere. The mare charges into the misty bog then
          suddenly loses her footing. She rears -- throwing Snow White
          onto the safety of solid ground.
          Snow White tries to grab her reins but the horse pulls away, not
          wanting to endanger her life. She tries again but the horse
          backs farther away from her. Slowly they're separated by the
          swirling fog --
          As Snow White sees the silhouettes of the riders reappear.
          Reluctantly she turns and runs into the forest --

          The riders are about to follow when their horses rear and kick
          in terror. One guard is thrown off and sucked down in the bog,
          frightening off the others.
          Despite their concern for Snow White, the MAGPIES are also too
          afraid to enter the forest.

          51 EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 51

          Snow White hurtles through the trees, a ghostly fog rising up
          all around her, then trips over a root, landing face first in --
          A patch of LARGE MUSHROOMS that unleash CLOUDS OF POLLEN. She
          coughs, trying to fan the pollen away, but it's too late. She
          hurries on, but the hallucinations come thick and fast now --
          The trees look almost human, hooded figures peering at her
          through the haze. She sees owls without eyes. Black oil oozing
          out of tree trunks. A hanging vine reaches down and touches her
          like a hand and now she runs --
          More terrors rage at her from the swirling mist. She stumbles
          again and when she looks up vampire bats scream at her from the
          trees. Huge skeletal forms crack out of the bark, descending on
          her until she finally passes out.

          Eric, still drunk, filthy, damp clothes, face bruised, enters
          the room, eyes the ravens, then looks at --
          Ravenna on her throne. She watches him curiously. He's more
          interested in the aged scullery maids, including Rose, who are
          staring at him accusingly. He has no idea who they are or what
          he's done wrong. Finally he comes before the Queen, sizing her

          You are a drunk and a fool. My Queen has
          many powers; she can take life or sustain
          it. But she can't bring your wife back

          His face tells us how much Eric wanted, needed to believe.
          The Guards keep inching toward Eric.
          Eric, still with a knife to Snow White's throat, starts
          slowly backing up.
          Finn pulls his own sword and approaches.
          Four against one. As they burst toward him he tosses Snow
          White to the ground and in the same motion throws his knife
          into the chest of one of the Guards, who crumbles.
          Eric reaches behind, grabs both hatchets and faces off with
          the others.
          They all rush at once. Eric fights off the guards as he
          raises a hatchet, throws it --
          Right into Finn's chest. Just like Ravenna, no blood, no
          wound. Finn pulls it out, laughs and throws it at the
          huntsman who ducks as it sticks into a tree.
          Snow White, terrified, races off into the forest. They
          notice her exit but keep fighting.
          Eric fights on three sides now - holding his own until Finn
          manages to plunge a sword in his side.

          off but Eric lunges and --
          Flips Finn onto his back and into a grove of mushrooms.
          Eric covers his nose with his arm and looks at the other
          Guards, who look from Finn, who is dazed, to Eric, who is
          hurt.

          You ventured beyond the walls tonight,
          disobeying my orders. We are all that's
          left, William. I cannot afford to lose
          any more of my men.

          A single blossom flowers on the dying apple tree. Ravenna,
          looking weaker than before, stares at it quietly, as if she
          were gazing at Snow White. She reaches out and crushes the
          blossom in her hand, turning it into ash.
          Her look is one of conviction.

          Finn reacts as if he heard Ravenna's words. He did. They have
          that kind of connection. Spooked, he continues on. The other
          trackers follow, William looking tense. At the back of the
          group, one of the mercenaries slows down, sensing something in
          the forest.
          William is still watching Finn when they hear a bloodcurdling
          CRY behind them. The mercenary's horse gallops out of the trees
          without its rider, a gaping wound in its side. William and the
          others look shaken but Finn doesn't even turn around, riding on.

          Eric pulls Snow White along. Beyond a bridge we see open fens
          -- the bridge LEADS OUT OF THE DARK FOREST -- and birds
          circling on the distant horizon.
          Snow White looks relieved as she follows him down a slope.
          They hurry through a sea of mist when suddenly Eric stops.

          How far to the Duke's castle?
          He ignores, follows tracks, then stops as he sees the STONE
          BRIDGE below -- LEADING OUT OF THE DARK FOREST. Snow White
          stares at it too, relieved. Beyond the bridge there are open
          fens.
          They hurry down together and start to cross the bridge.
          They're half way across WHEN SUDDENLY WE SEE THE STONES START

                         ERIC
          Troll!
          Eric and Snow White are SLAMMED off the bridge and land in
          the shallow creek below -- among the CARCASSES OF SLAIN
          ANIMALS. The troll roars and comes after them, swinging its
          giant stone fists. Eric grabs Snow White and runs --
          As the troll catches up with them, Eric shoves her out of the
          way and draws his hatchets.

                         ERIC
          Run!
          Snow White turns and flees. Eric runs at the Troll. He ducks
          as a mighty arm sweeps over him, darts between the troll's
          legs, and hacks at its leg with his hatchets.
          The Troll falters a bit then --
          A swinging stone fist catches him and hurls him across the
          creek.
          Snow White looks back to see Eric lying stunned on the
          ground, his wound bleeding again, at the troll's mercy. She
          hesitates, still terrified, then runs back.
          The Troll towers over the huntsman. It raises its stone hands
          to crush him when --
          Snow White arrives -- SCREAMING LIKE A BANSHEE!
          The Troll looks around in surprise. So does Eric. A beat,
          then the monster turns away from Eric, striding towards Snow

                         WHITE --
          She stands her ground, fighting her terror, PULLS HER KNIFE.
          The TROLL looms over her, but she doesn't retreat. She raises
          an arm, just as Eric instructed.

          Snow White stares into the troll's eyes, seeing something
          almost gentle in its monstrous gaze, slowly losing her fear.
          The troll stares at her too, confused, then slowly pacified,
          until it finally turns and strides away.
          Eric stares in disbelief. Snow White is rooted to the spot,
          also confused but strangely moved by what's happened. Eric
          rises to his feet painfully and heads over, taking her by the
          arm.

          It's clear he sees her in a different light. She stares back

          The sun glints through the thinning trees. Eric wades through
          the deep sludge, Snow White following in his steps.
          Eric looks at her a moment, then suddenly turns away as he
          sees her expression change --
          GHOSTLY BACKLIT FIGURES EMERGE on the banks of the marsh now,
          holding bows and arrows. Eric looks around for an escape route,
          but everywhere he turns MORE FIGURES APPEAR.
          He draws his axe when A FIGURE IN A HOODED CLOAK (ANNA) appears,
          clutching her bow like a goddess.

          with awe as they pass. They stare at Snow White and murmur.
          They can't take their eyes off her. Some even reach out to

          a mirage. The air is filled with specks of pollen and a strange
          HUMMING NOISE echoes like music. For Snow White, it's the most
          beautiful sound she's ever heard. Next to her, Nion, snorts:

          rubbing his son's sleeping head.
          Snow White sits amazed, drinking in the sights and sounds.
          Animals emerge from the forest -- SQUIRRELS, BEAVERS, FOXES,
          BIRDS. Slowly they make their way towards the ruins, gazing at

          THE NIGHT SHIMMERS WITH FAIRY LIGHT AS THEY OBSERVE HER.
          Snow White feels the light on her face and to her surprise, she
          sees the two MAGPIES who watched over her at the castle. Two
          BEAUTIFUL FAIRIES WITH THE DEER EYES slip out of the magpies'
          bodies, beaming at her.
          As Snow White sits up, they direct her to the woods WHERE A
          DAZZLING LIGHT SHINES THROUGH A TREE. As she walks animals fall
          in alongside her.
          A little way away, Gus snores in his sleep. The golden light
          crosses his face and he wakes up. As he opens his eyes, he
          stares in wonder, then quickly wakes the other dwarves.
          They all stare in amazement now, even the blind MUIR. Eric is
          the last to wake up, wondering what the fuss is all about.
          They rise and follow to --

          Eric looks up to see ALDAN the Yakut emerging through the trees
          on horseback, notching another arrow to his bow.
          A FIERCE WIND rips through the sanctuary now, shadows spreading
          where there was once light. Eric sees FINN appear on horseback,
          looking like a demon god in the gathering darkness.

          battle masks.

          drain the color from her lips. He kneels down and gazes at

          almost gone. Eric looks over, sees William's grief is as
          great as his own, and finally stops fighting.
          Snow White looks up at William as if she wants to say
          something, then the light in her eyes goes out.
          The dwarves are heartbroken. Eric looks dazed.
          William leans down and kisses Snow White gently on the lips.
          He pulls away,.hoping against hope. And then --
          Nothing happens. She lies there, lifeless and white as the
          falling snow.
          On all the faces - realizing that she is truly gone.

          I carried with me the stench of death and
          the anger of the lost. I wasn't worth
          saving. But she did so anyway. I loved
          her more than anything or anyone. And
          then I let her out of my sight and she
          was gone and I became myself again. A
          self I never cared for. Until you. You
          remind me of her. Her spirit. Her
          heart. And now you, too, are gone. You

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          The Queen cannot be defeated. She cannot
          be killed. And therefore there can be no
          victory.
          Snow White hesitates, her heart pounding, then replies:

          I can vanquish her. Defeat her. I am the
          only one. She told me so herself.
          Duke Hammond starts to object, but Snow White's eyes and, now
          her feet, lead her down the stairs to her people. When she
          reaches the last step - now at their level - she speaks...

                         SNOW WHITE
          I have been told that I represent you,
          that it is my place to inspire you. That
          is wronct. I am not a Queen, not a
          leader, not a warrior.
          Absolute silence in the courtyard as people, lords, knights
          hang on her every word.

          William's face with his sharp claws as William tries to hold
          the creature's arm with his bare hands, severely bleeding.

          The Faeries have slowed down dramatically. Eric grabs a sword
          on the ground and slices the Faerie in front of him... the
          Faerie shatters.
          William looks at Eric, in desperation begging for help. The
          two men lock eyes. A silent understanding.

          pieces, releasing William.
          A silent pact has been made at this moment between the two
          men.
          The remaining Dark Creature freezes. Eric and William are
          barely alive.

          Snow White approaches Ravenna and kneels beside her, Ravenna
          is weak. She ages dozens of years within seconds, her face
          shows no anger, no hate, just a strange understanding.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Why this? Why all of this?

                          
          Snow White, overwhelmed by compassion, places her hand on
          Ravenna's chest. Ravenna puts her own wrinkled hand on Snow
          White's.
          Ravenna smiles. She gently taps on Snow White's... in a 
          strange and affectionate motherly way.

                          
          Eric and William, exhausted and battered climb the steps of 
          the mirror chamber. It is over. 
          Ravenna stares up at Snow White's face in a shining halo of
          light above her from the ceiling.

          Ravenna whispers incomprehensible words with a peaceful smile
           on her face. The clouds move in the disc of light above Snow 
           White. The light falls over Ravenna's face. 
           The light fades out of her eyes and she dies.
