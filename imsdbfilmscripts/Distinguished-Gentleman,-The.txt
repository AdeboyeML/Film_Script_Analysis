    THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92
    FADE IN:
1   A FLASH OF LIGHT                                            1
    A radiant shiny something dazzling in EXTREME CLOSEUP.
    BEGIN TITLES.
    CAMERA very slowly PULLS   BACK. The sparkling surface
    turns out to be a lot of   carats. WE SEE the stone, then
    the ring, then suddenly,   in b.g., something HUGE SWEEPS
    by. REVEAL a mechanical    claw above the ring, hanging
    from a crane. The ring    sits in a sea of tiny dolls,
    joke eyeballs, and other   carnival junk.
    The claw descends on the ring again and again, sometimes
    catching it for a moment then tragically dropping it --
    accompanied by OOHS and AAHS (O.S.) of hope and disap-
    pointment. INTERCUT with the HANDS of a young black man
    working the controls. The EYES of a young black woman
    watching him work. Another guy's HANDS digging in his
    pocket for change. QUARTERS going into the slot.
                             MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
               This'll never work, Tommy.
                             TOMMY (O.S.)
               Be positive, Armando. Course it will.
    The claw inadvertently snags a rabbit's foot.
                              TOMMY (O.S.)
               Look.   See what a lucky fuck I am?
                             WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
               He don't mean the ring, hon, he
               means the whole plan.

                              TOMMY (O.S.)
               So do I.
    The claw catches the   ring and closes on it. QUICK CUTS
    of their FACES as the   crane rises. A very pretty lady.
    A beefy Latino with a   two-day beard. Their apprehension.
    Tommy's confidence.    Then his exceptional smile. He gets
    the ring.
2   INT. PENNY ARCADE - DAY                                     2
                             TOMMY
               Okay -- one down, one to go.
                      (returning to the
                       claw)
               You got quarters, Loretta?
    END TITLES.

3   EXT. FLORIDA LUXURY HOTEL - DAY                             3
    Palm trees. The smell of money. Valets in Foreign
    Legion khakis greeting arriving luxury cars.
4   INT. HOTEL FUNCTION ROOM - DAY                              4
    A big crowd of GUESTS at a cocktail reception. A lot
    of lime jackets, cherry trousers, and blue hair. People
    wear name tags.
    ON Tommy, in pastel bow tie and full waiter drag, con-
    firming orders for a group of guests. He speaks in a
    PRISSY, OVER-SOLICITIOUS VOICE:
                           TOMMY
             That's a diet ginger ale, an extra-
             spicy virgin mary no salt, a club
             soda -- good choice -- a lime
             rickey, and a bourbon and a
             planter's punch. Five people,
             five drinks... it's Kismet!
    Tommy turns away, looking toward the entrance to the
    room.
5   INT. LOBBY - DAY - CLOSE SHOT - THE RING                    5
    glittering on Loretta's finger. LORETTA, stunning in
    designer clothing and accessories, enters. Her looks
    attract looks.
6   INT. FUNCTION ROOM - DAY                                    6
    Tommy, maintaining his vantage point, repeats another
    order, this time in a heavy CARRIBEAN ACCENT:
                           TOMMY
             That's a vodka tonic, a Pellegrino,
             lime and no ice, a gin Gibson
             straight up with ex-tra onions
             -- I am also fond of de onions --
             and a Chardonnary spritzer...also
             with extra onions -- no, no, do
             not worry, that is just a little
             joke. There will be no onions
             whatsoever in your spritzer!
    He LAUGHS HUGELY, rather amused with himself.   The guests
    aren't.
                           GUEST
             You don't need to write it down?

                            TOMMY
             Mr. Memory?   Do not make me laugh!
    He LAUGHS HUGELY, turns, takes two steps away and makes
    absolutely no effort to get their drinks. He looks
    toward the door.
7   INT. HALLWAY/ENTRANCE TO FUNCTION ROOM - DAY              7
    Loretta approaches the function room, where pert  DEBBIE,
    wearing a JOHNSON FOR CONGRESS button, staffs a  felt-
    covered table. On  a nearby easel, a photo of a  silver-
    haired Man with a legend in blue and gold: JEFF   JOHNSON.
    THE NAME YOU KNOW.

                           LORETTA
                    (Eurotrash accent)
             I'm not too late, am I, dear?
                    (extending a hand)
             Hello, darling, Alma Preston,
             how are you today?
                           DEBBIE
             Thanks for coming, Ms. Preston,
             I'm Debbie Bartle.
                    (consulting a list)
             Do we have your check yet?
    Loretta pulls a Mont Blanc pen and a checkbook from her
    bag.
                           LORETTA
             No, honey, I don't think you do, we
             just got in last night from our
             place in Barbados -- how much is it?

                           DEBBIE
             Five hundred a person.   Barbados?
                           LORETTA
                    (writing)
             Yes, we're just down the beach
             from Mick Jagger and Jerry.
                    (looking up)
             You wouldn't turn down a couple of
             thousand, would you?
    A pleased smile from Debbie. Loretta opens the check-
    book, flashing the immense RING in front of Debbie.
                           DEBBIE
             Um, that's a lovely ring.

                           LORETTA
             Oh, thank you. I thought it might
             be a little gaudy...who should I
             make this out to?
                           DEBBIE
             Johnson for Congress. It's not
             gaudy, it's just...nice and big.
                           LORETTA
             That's my Carlos...I can't even
             look in a store window. We're
             walking down this street in Rio,
             we pass a jewelry store...I didn't
             even turn my head and he's in the
             shop...
                    (holds up ring)
             ...$250,000. I said it's crazy...
             but you know Carlos.
                             DEBBIE
             I wish I did.
    ON Tommy watching Loretta. A Guest standing just behind
    Tommy -- wearing MRS. ZEKE BRIDGES name tag -- watches
    JEFF JOHNSON gladhand the room robustly.
                           MRS. BRIDGES
             I hear they had him open for six hours.
    ZEKE, a very fat cigar-smoker, marvels at Johnson's
    appearance.
                           ZEKE
                    (chuckling)
             The sum' bitch looks terrific.

    Tommy, eavesdropping, joins Zeke's chuckle, which unfor-
    tunately turns into a wheeze and then a cough. Zeke
    turns to Tommy.
                           ZEKE
             How about taking our orders, son?
                           TOMMY
             Absolutely my friend!    How can I
             pleasure you?
                           ZEKE
             Bourbon straight up and a Perrier
             rocks for the lady.

                           TOMMY
             Ah! Fire and ice! Wonderful!
             But may I suggest you make that a
             double sir? After all, so many
             guests, so few of me -- who knows
             when I may be back?
                           ZEKE
             Sure, why not.
    AT THE ENTRANCE LORETTA pauses before going into the room.
                           LORETTA
             You know where the powder room is, hon?
             I should freshen my face before I go in.

                           DEBBIE
             It's just over there.
    ON JEFF JOHNSON with his well-groomed wife, VERA, and a
    barrel-chested Man in full resort wear, wearing an OLAF
    ANDERSEN name tag.
                           JOHNSON
             So how the heck are you, Olaf?
                           ANDERSEN
             I should be asking how you are, congressman.
    Johnson pats his chest and smiles at Vera.
                           JOHNSON
             This old ticker never felt better.
                           ANDERSEN
             It's good to see you back on your
             feet, Jeff. We need you in Washington.
    Inconspicuously, a pretty young redhead whispers to Vera.
    This is JENNIFER, Johnson's Administrative Assistant
    (his AA).
                           VERA JOHNSON
             How's that granddaughter of yours,
             Olaf? Ready for the Olympics?
                           ANDERSEN
             She'll be thrilled you asked after her.
8   IN THE HALLWAY Loretta emerges from the Ladies' Room...    8
    catches a spike heel... recovers her balance... then
    frantically searches her hands and clothes, SCREAMS,
    and gets down on hands and knees.

    Debbie rushes over to her.
                           DEBBIE
             What's the matter?
                             LORETTA
                      (hyperventilating)
             My --   my ring. My diamond. I took
             it off   in the ladies' room to wash my
             hands.    I was just putting it on --
             I must   have dropped it.

                           DEBBIE
                    (getting down)
             Let me help you, we'll find it.
                           LORETTA
             Call Security!
9   IN THE FUNCTION ROOM Tommy maintains his watch on          9
    Loretta. Zeke Bridges taps Tommy on the shoulder.
                           ZEKE
             Hey, what about our drinks?
    Tommy instantly assumes an ANGRY YOUNG STREET BLACK
    VOICE:
                             TOMMY
             Yeah?    What you want?
                             ZEKE
             What?    You already took our order.

                           TOMMY
             That wasn't me! You must be
             thinking of Jamal. I'm Karim.
             What you want?
                           ZEKE
             Bourbon straight up and a Perrier
             rocks.

                      (snorts derisively)
             Hunh.
    He walks two steps...and once again makes no attempt to
    get the drinks. Zeke returns to Jeff Johnson.

              Don't get me wrong, Jeff. Pyramid
              Insurance doesn't want special breaks.
              I just think we ought to be able to
              set our own rates without Uncle Sam
              sticking his nose in our business.
     Johnson signals Jennifer to come over.
                            JOHNSON
              Do you know my AA? Zeke Bridges,
              this is Jennifer, my Administrative
              Assistant. Zeke's been a
              tremendous help to us. I'd like
              you to listen to his view on health
              insurance.
                            JENNIFER
              I'd be very happy to.

10   IN THE HALLWAY Loretta and Debbie are on hands and      10
     knees, still looking. A pair of shoes comes INTO FRAME.
     They LOOK up at a bullet-headed man.
                             BRUNO
              Ms. Preston?   Bruno Handler, hotel
              security.
                             LORETTA
              My ring!   My ring! Oh my god...!

              Now just calm down, Ma'am... can you
              describe the ring?
                            LORETTA
              It's a diamond ring! A big diamond
              ring! Oh my Christ!
     She's frantic.   Debbie takes Bruno aside.
                            DEBBIE
              I saw it. It's huge... it must be
              like eight carats. She says it was
              a quarter of a million dollars!
     Bruno turns back to Loretta, trying to calm her.

              Ma'am... calm down.   Now, is the

                            LORETTA
              Of course it's insured! But you
              know how it works -- if I report
              it, they'll cancel me. And I don't
              want another ring! I need this
              ring! The ring Carlos gave me.
     Bruno turns, speaks into the walkie-talkie he's carrying.
                            BRUNO
              Where the fuck is housekeeping? I called
              for those dickheads ninety seconds ago.
11   IN THE FUNCTION ROOM the Guests have gathered to hear      11
     Johnson speak. As Andersen introduces him, Tommy con-
     tinues eyeing Loretta.
                            ANDERSEN
              Now I won't run through Jeff's

              twenty years, and I've only got two

              we've needed him, Jeff's been there
              for us. And we've been there for
              Jeff, too -- we raised a hundred
              thousand dollars today!

              I should be in there. Good luck,
              Ms. Preston. I hope you find it.
     She leaves.   Loretta, mascara smeared, gets up, as
     does Bruno.

              I can't go in there like this. God!
              Please... listen... I'll pay a ten
              thousand dollar reward for anybody
              who finds my ring. Just don't tell

     slips out.

              What do you make of all this campaign
              reform business, Jeff?
                            JOHNSON
              Well, y'know Ernie... these days,
              everyone's down on the political
              action committees and so-called
              special interests. But, heck, I
              think you and Fran have a right to
              participate in our democracy in
              exactly the way you're doing today.
              I'm in Congress to represent you.
              I don't want any so-called reform
              to take that power away from you.

              I want every heating grate opened and
              inspected. I want every air
              conditioning duct vacuumed. Do you
              understand what I'm saying?
     AS he speaks, Bruno SEES Tommy pass through the hallway
     ... spot something on the floor... pick it up... furtive-
     ly put it in his pocket... and walk rapidly toward the
     door to the kitchens.

              Hey, you! Waiter! Hold it right
              there!

     Bruno puts an arm on Tommy. Tommy instantly assumes a
     frantic, wimpy, craven persona, along wth his CARRIBBEAN
     ACCENT.
                            TOMMY
              No! Please! Do not report me!

              Very valuable. All right, I'll
              give you a hunnert bucks for it.
                            TOMMY

              No! It's a trick! You will
              call me a thief and send me back
              and the Security Police will make

              of dollars in reward money waiting.

              No, no, no...you said thousands.
              With an 'S'. This is plural.

              No, thanks, I'll call back.
     ARMANDO hangs up the phone and exits the hotel room.
     BRUNO crosses to the far side of the lobby, where Tommy
     waits inconspicuously. He gives him the money. Tommy
     gives him ring.

              Now get back to work!

     a house phone, dials, listens. He dials again, listens.
     No answer. He dials the operator.

              This is Bruno in Security. Put me
              through to 502 -- there must be
              something wrong with the line, I can't
              get an answer... What do you mean,
              there's no one in 502? I just spoke to
              them!... No one's registered in 502? Are
              you sure?... Well, check again!... Shit!
     He hangs up, looks at the ring, and realizes he's been
     taken. His face twisting with rage, he hurries after
     Tommy.

     Tommy conceals himself behind a pillar, across the court-
     yard, away from the Guests. But from another direction,
     Johnson and Andersen approach, arm in arm, and sit on a
     bench by the pillar.
                            JOHNSON
              Olaf, there's something I wanted to

              in the world and calling it "official
              business." Golfing and skiing and
              fishing, and never picking up a tab.

              A few thousand worth of stock options

              As long as your blind trust buys them,
              you're clean -- the SEC can't shake a
              stick at you. Half a million, easy --
              and that's just a start.

     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            14B.
22   INT. CHURCH - FLORIDA - DAY                               22
     The congregation is SINGING. We SEE the widow Johnson.
     At her side, in the aisle seat, a powerful man with bushy
     eyebrows, about 60, in a three-piece suit and watch
     chain: congressman DICK DODGE. The HYMN ends. Dodge
     steps up to the pulpit.
                            DODGE
              It was my honor to serve in Congress with
              Jeff Johnson for a generation. No one
              could have been a better legislator. No
              one could have been a finer husband and
              father. And now --
     He presses the tips of his fingers together and looks
     skyward, as if communing with his memory of the deceased.

                            DODGE
              And now God has called his servant home.
     ANGLE ON Jennifer, in black.
                            DODGE (O.S.)
              We will miss him. But we are grateful
              that his passing was so peaceful -- and
              so like him -- working late into the
              night at his desk, the consummate
              public servant.
                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             15.
22   CONTINUED:                                                    22
     Vera sneaks a look at Jennifer, who is poker-faced.
23   EXT./INT. VERANDA/JOHNSON HOME - DAY                          23
     On the veranda of the gracious  home, mourners pay
     respects to the family. Dodge   puts a gentle hand on
     the widow's shoulder and draws  her aside. He throws
     a look at Jennifer, who joins  them.
                            DODGE
              Vera, I know you're still in shock
              from Jeff's... passing. But we have
              to talk about his seat.
     Vera stares at Jennifer.   She knows the score.

                            JENNIFER
              Mrs. Johnson, if you'd like to
              discuss this in private --
                            VERA
              You can stay -- what's the
              difference?
                            DODGE
              Vera, I'd like you to announce that
              you're going to run for Congress.
              Let a few days pass to show proper
              respect. But next week, I want to
              stand next to you at a press
              conference where you declare for
              Jeff's seat in the House.
                            VERA JOHNSON
              No, Dick -- no.

                            DODGE
              There's nothing to be afraid of,
              Vera. With your name, you can't
              lose. People around these parts
              are so used to voting for Jeff
              Johnson -- why, Mrs. Jeff Johnson
              would win in a walk.
                            VERA JOHNSON
              Dick, I was a Washington wife for
              twenty years. Twenty years of
              Potomac bullshit is plenty for one
              lifetime.
                            DODGE
              Vera, we're talking about becoming a
              Member of Congress. We're talking
              about a sure thing.

               Don't worry about running the
               office -- I'll be there night
               and day.
                             VERA JOHNSON
               I'm sure you would, dear. But I
               couldn't give you the same job
               satisfaction Jeff gave you.
     Jennifer, embarrassed, didn't know Vera knew.    Nor
     did Dodge.

     open. A supermarket shopping cart full of groceries,
     tied with a big bow, rolls out, pushed by Tommy. Loretta
     accompanies him.
     Tommy BUZZES at a door. It's answered by Tommy's
     GRANDMA, a limber lady in leggings and a bright top.
     She sees the groceries, kisses him.
                             GRANDMA
               This is very sweet of you, darling.
               But you shouldn't have done it.
               Where did you get the money?
                             TOMMY
               You don't want to know.

27   INT. GRANDMA'S CONDO - DAY                                   27
     Tommy and Loretta are watching the track results on the
     local tv news. Tommy, playing solitaire, shuffles bril-
     liantly. Grandma comes in from the kitchen, shaking
     her head.
                             GRANDMA
               How did I end up with a thief
               for a grandson?
                             TOMMY
               Grandma -- I told you.    I'm not a
               thief. I'm a con man.     An artist.
                             GRANDMA
               But also a crook.

               You can't con an honest man. Only
               somebody who wants something for
               nothing.
                      (pause)
               But the good Lord must have been
               fond of pigeons, because he made
               so many of them.
                             GRANDMA
               Sometimes I just wish you were
               more like your Daddy...
                             TOMMY
               You mean, dead?

               No, smartmouth... I mean someone
               who made something of himself.

     Loretta gets up and goes for the kitchen. We hear a
     high-pitched ELECTRONIC WARBLE. Tommy reaches into
     Loretta's purse and pulls out a cellular phone.
                                TOMMY

     He opens the phone and speaks in a toneless, recording-

                            TOMMY

     He covers the mouthpiece and calls to Loretta.
                            TOMMY
              Bingo! Loretta...guy wants to

     TOMMY grins mischievously and speaks into the phone in

              Ja, this is Inga. Hello Paul...
              how are you tonight? You are
              feeling naughty? That's all right
              ...you have your what in a bowl of
              oatmeal? Yes, that is very
              naughty, and maybe a little sick.

              Disgusting.

              So you like to talk dirty out of

              Man, you are one twisted bastard!

              third minute out of him.
     He clicks off the phone and slams it back into Loretta's
     purse. Loretta, meanwhile, has reappeared.
                            LORETTA
              You hung up on Paul? He's one of

              I'm Ned Grable, vice president and
              general manager of WFLA. We think
              Mrs. Jeff Johnson did the right
              thing in not running for the
              congressional seat left vacant by
              her husband's death.
     The editorial catches Grandma's attention.
                            GENERAL MANAGER
              Jeff Johnson's name may still be magic.
              But it'll take more than the magic of
              name recognition to solve our region's
              problems. I'm Ned Grable.
                            GRANDMA
              Name recognition. Lordy, what a
              notion. People have to be some
              boobs just to vote for someone
              because their name is Johnson.
     Tommy's eyes widen.
                            GRANDMA
              I remember once back in Georgia,
              they even elected a dead man. His
              name was still on the ballot --
              people were just used to voting
              for him.

              nobody talks to my woman like

     They all look at him expectantly. He takes a dramatic
     pause, then launches into a "Come to Jesus" speech.
                            TOMMY
              My friends, I want to tell you
              about a town where the streets are
              paved with gold. This is a town
              where the marks give you money
              before you ask. A town where they
              take you to dinner after you fuck
              'em. A town where when they need
              money, they just print more. This
              is a town where a guy bounced nine
              hundred checks and he didn't even
              have to skip town!!!

                            ARMANDO
              Ain't no town like that.

     His big smile meets their blank surprise.   Their faces
     fall.

              You remember what he said? They
              asked him, Why do you rob banks?
              And he said, That's where the money
              is. I tell you, people -- Washington.
              That's where the money is.

              I found this shit in the library.
              You know how much a congressman
              makes? A hundred and thirty a year
              -- and that's just base pay for
              getting your ass elected. Then
              there are these things called PACs,
              and these lobbyists, whose whole
              point in life is to buy you off.
              It's the con of a lifetime -- and
              the damn thing is, it's legal!
              This is hot, people, we can do this!

              Yeah -- why would anyone vote for
              you?
                            TOMMY
              Not for me, Homer. For Jeff
              Johnson. Name recognition -- that's
              what it's all about. You think
              folks know their congressman died?
              I get on the ballot as Jeff Johnson,
              I guarantee they'll vote for me.
              Now all's I have to do is get on the

     Senior citizens fold brochures, stuff envelopes, make

              Okay... gimme the four-one-one on

              Don't laugh, they get an enormous
              turnout. But the big thing is,
              they have their own line on the
              ballot. They already got the
              signatures.

     Tommy and Van Dyke are seated opposite HATTIE RIFKIN, a
     high-energy woman, 70s, with a frizz of white curls.
                            HATTIE
              So, what brings you here?   You want
              to talk politics... talk!
                            VAN DYKE
              We were wondering who you were going
              to run for Congress this year.
                            HATTIE
              Oh, the usual sacrifical lamb.
              Probably Sylvia Roland. She just
              lost her husband, she needs to meet
              new people. Why?
                            TOMMY
              Mrs. Rifkin... I want to run.
                            HATTIE
              Well, I want to run too -- but with
              this plastic hip, it's not gonna
              happen.
     Tommy breaks up.   In spite of himself, he's charmed by the
     salty old babe.
                            TOMMY
              What I mean is... I'd like to run
              for Congress on the Silver Fox
              ticket. I care about you and your
              issues.
                            HATTIE
              Yeah, that's what my son says. But
              does he call? Anyway, what makes
              you think a group of alter cockers
              are gonna support a man who hasn't
              clipped his first nose hair yet?
                            TOMMY
              Because I can win.
                            HATTIE
              No, no... a Democrat can win. A
              Republican can win. A Silver Fox
              can only make a symbolic point.
                            TOMMY
              Mrs. RIfkin, if you give me a ballot
              line, and if I can get support
              from...

              best cards to win.
                            HATTIE
              Maybe not in gin, but in politics,
              young man, you need money to win,
              you need a name to win, you...

     The widow Johnson is pouring tea for Tommy, now in super-
     nerd drag -- wire-rim glasses and tweed sport jacket.

              I'm not sure I understand, Professor
              Franklin -- you wrote your doctoral
              thesis on my husband?

              He was a great man, Mrs. Johnson.
              He did so much for my people.
                               VERA JOHNSON
              He... did?
                            TOMMY
              Oh, yes. I'll never forget when he
              said 'Welfare is a drug -- and you
              gotta kick it cold turkey.' It
              was... inspirational.

                            VERA JOHNSON
              Really... well, I'm sure...
                            TOMMY
              And I was actually in the audience
              when he said, 'If you people would
              just get off your dead asses and
              look for work, this country might
              be fit to live in again.' Powerful
              stuff.

              It's very kind of you to say so.

              But I didn't just come to pay
              respects, ma'am. I came because
              your husband deserves an archive.
              A place where scholars can study
              his legacy. A storehouse for the

                              TOMMY
              Really.
     Tommy looks at his own troops, then back to Reinhardt.

               You mean like an affirmative

     Tommy opens the cab door.

               Tell you what -- I'll think about
               it, okay?
     Tommy gets in and closes the door.

               Thanks for getting us settled,
               really appreciate it.

55   EXT. CANNON BUILDING - DAY                                 55
     Morning. Tommy and cronies get out of a cab and bound up
     the grand flight of stairs. In b.g., the Capitol dome.

56   INT. CANNON GROUND FLOOR CORRIDOR/ELEVATOR - DAY           56
     They walk the superb ground floor corridor of Cannon,
     salivating. Marble columns... chandeliers... grand
     offices. Real class.
     AT AN ELEVATOR with a sign above it -- MEMBERS ONLY --
     they stop. Tommy presses the button. The door opens.
     The seated ATTENDANT gets a load of this group.
     Especially Loretta.
                             ATTENDANT
               Sorry, folks, this elevator's
               for Members only.

              I'm going to my office.
                            ATTENDANT
              I said Members only.
                            TOMMY
              I am a Member. Now take us to six
              before I haul your ass in front of
              the committee on disrespectful
              behavior.
                            ATTENDANT
              Elevator don't go to six. You
              have to get off at five and walk.
57   INT. CANNON STAIRWELL - DAY                                 57
     Looking puzzled, they make their way up a drab stairwell.
58   INT. CANNON TOP FLOOR - DAY                                 58
     Not classy. On one side of the hallway, the windows give
     out on a brutally ugly courtyard. On the other side of
     the hall are cages: windowless storage bins behind metal
     fences crammed with junk -- and an occasional xerox
     machine, Mr. Coffee, and pitiful staffer at a tiny desk.
     Tommy opens the door to 609.
59   INT. TOMMY'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY                           59
     Tommy's office is a small, dark garret, with dirty car-
     peting, bare shelves, and a pile of bulging canvas U.S.
     Mail bags.

                             TOMMY
              Wait here.
     He heads further into the office.

              Oh -- you missed the freshman   lottery
              for offices. They assign them    by
              draw. You didn't show for the    draw,
              so you got the worst office in   Congress.
                            TOMMY
              I missed what lottery?
                            REINHARDT
              It was all in the briefing books I

                            REINHARDT
              Are you hiring me, congressman?
     Tommy gives Reinhardt a good once-over, seeing him anew.
                            TOMMY
              You're shaking me down, aren't you?
     Tommy laughs, then clasps Reinhardt's shoulders.
                            TOMMY
              This is fantastic, Reinhardt. I
              haven't been here five minutes,
              and you're shaking me down. God,
              I'm gonna love this town. You're
              hired, man. Just tell me what to
              do next. I don't want to miss out
              on any of the good shit.

     BEGIN elegant, spirited classical MUSIC.
61   INT. UNION STATION - MAIN HALL - NIGHT                      61
     With its hundred-foot barrel-vaulted ceiling and grand
     windows, the magnificent Beaux-Arts station has been
     beautifully restored.

     A big crowd slowly makes its way along a red carpet to
     the party.
     Tommy was born to wear a  tux. In his  lapel, a red-and-
     gold eagle pin. On his   arm, Loretta, in a dramatic
     shoulderless and nearly  backless gown, with three-quarter
     gloves. The other Women   in sight are far more conserva-
     tively dressed.
62   INT. UNION STATION - ADIRONDACKS RESTAURANT - NIGHT         62
     A STRING QUARTET provides the music. Tommy and Loretta
     linger uncertainly near the entrance. Then:
                            TOMMY
              Let's meet some natives.
     Tommy leads her over to two Men, 30s, excellent haircuts.
     Both wear pins. He extends a hand.
                            TOMMY
              Tommy Johnson, how'd you do, nice
              party, heck of a railroad

                            RAFE
              Let me tell you something, Jeff.
     A tense beat.   Then Rafe breaks into a smile.
                            RAFE
              Fuckin' brilliant.
     Bo winks at Tommy.

              And it's Tommy. My friends call
              me Tommy. "Jeff" is my...
              professional name. So what line
              of work were you boys in before
              you got elected? You lawyers or
              something?

               So then I ran an ad calling him a
               draft dodger, but then he ran an
               ad calling me a plagiarist.

               What did you do?
                             FIRST MEMBER
               Oh, leaked a rumor that his father-
               in-law was a Nazi. I went up ten
               points in a weekend.

      Tommy and Loretta pass some large stone statues, a man

               here.

              Wait a minute. What's wrong in
              Washington?
                            IOWA
              C'mon -- there's acid rain killing
              fish, and no one's stopping it...
              there's topsoil washing away, and no
              erosion program... there's chemicals
              in our livestock -- God, I sound like
              a Boy Scout.
                            TOMMY
              That's alright, Iowa -- this place
              could use a few geeks like you.

              Hey... thank you... nice to see
              you... hope you can make it to my
              reception. Have y'all met Miss
              Loretta?
     TOMMY'S TABLEMATE is lawyer-lobbyist TOMMY O'CONNOR, 40s.

              Tommy O'Connor. Soon as I saw how
              you got elected, I knew you were a
              real comer. Hell, I bet old Olaf
              Andersen voted for you.

              Who's Olaf Andersen?

              Say, could I host a little    welcome-
              to-Washington thing for you    down at
              my law firm? Meet some of     my clients,
              five hundred a head -- you    could
              pick up twenty, twenty-five    grand
              to get you started.

              And how much of that do you get?
                               O'CONNOR
                        (amused)
              Oh,    it doesn't come off the top.
              Down    the road, I'll bill 'em each
              five    hundred an hour whenever I
              take    you to lunch.
                            TOMMY
              Tommy, I think this is the beginning
              of a beautiful relationship.
65   INT. UNION STATION - ADIRONDACKS - NIGHT - ON DODGE         65

     making a speech from the dais.
                            DODGE
              Tonight we unite the two great
              pillars of our system -- political
              and financial. To the forty-four
              newly-elected Members of Congress,
              I say, Look around you tonight.
              Look around, and be thankful for
              the generosity.
     Tommy inspects the sea of barracudas.

              The people you see not only provided
              tonight's hospitality. They are the
              people you serve. That's our system
              of checks and balances at its best.
              Their support helped get you
              elected... your work will help
              them... and their support will help
              you in your next campaign, which I
              remind you is already less than two
              years away.

     In b.g., the Capitol dome. As Tommy and Loretta leave,
     they pass Dick Dodge, who is saying goodnight to guests.
     He stops them.
                            DODGE
              You know, Mr. Johnson, it's
              customary for new Members to pay a
              courtesy call on the old fogies in
              the leadership. Especially from
              their HOME STATE.
                            TOMMY
              Well, I would have, but I just got
              to town. It's an honor to meet you,
              sir. A real privilege. This is
              Miss Loretta.

     She pronounces the word so carefully, it sounds lewd.

                               DODGE
              How do you    do?
                     (to    Tommy)
              You could    make up for it by having
              a nightcap    with me.
                     (to    Loretta)
              May I have    my car take you home?

              Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, but this
              ain't no homo shit we up to, is it?
                            DODGE
              No.  No, it's not. But --
                     (amused)
              Good thinking, Johnson. I'm
              impressed by your instincts.
69   INT. DODGE'S OFFICE - CAPITOL - NIGHT                      69
     A single table lamp lights Dick Dodge's office, reflecting
     off the velvet drapes, sculpted ceiling, and crystal
     chandeliers. Tommy and Dodge are in leather armchairs,
     ties undone. On the table between them, a bottle of Jim
     Beam. Dodge casts a cool eye on Tommy.
                            DODGE
              Tell me, Johnson. Why did you come
              to Washington?
                            TOMMY
              Well... of course... it's a chance
              to do something for my country. I
              mean, there's the topsoil thing, and
              acid rain is killing the cattle --
                            DODGE
              Cut the bullshit, Johnson. I saw how
              you got elected. Flukes like you are
              either nutcases or troublemakers.
              I just want to know which one I have
              on my hands. Who sent you here?
                            TOMMY
              No one sent me.
                            DODGE
              You pulled off that upset on your
              own?

              I'm impressed, Johnson, I am.     But
              why did you run for Congress?

     A stunned silence from Dodge -- then deep and generous
     laughter.
                            DODGE

     He laughs again, richly amused.   Tommy joins in the
     laughter.

              was just thinking, wouldn't it be
              a plus for old Ken Korngold if I
              was to -- how should I put this --
              showcase some of his distillers'
              products at my reception? You know,
              like they put Reese's pieces in
              E.T.? It's called "product
              placement." People come in, they
              have a tremendous time, they see
              your products, they think well of

              It's just that -- I'm so happy you
              straightened out.
     Tommy smiles ambiguously. As APPLAUSE continues, his
     eyes roam the room and make contact with Dick Dodge,
     standing at one of the leadership tables. Tommy winks
     conspiratorially at him. There's such diabolical glee in

     It's packed, mainly with men.  Everyone has drinks and
     talks noisily. It looks like  a fraternity smoker for
     lobbyists. MUSIC comes from  a boom box. The bar -- a
     tablecloth over some desks -- is lavishly stocked. So are
     the bookcases, which now look like liquor store shelves.

     BACK TO SCENE - ON Tommy and Reinhardt talking with a
     LOBBYIST.
                            FOURTH LOBBYIST
              It's an informal breakfast. You
              give us your views, we give you
              bacon and eggs, plus a couple of
              thousand dollar honorarium.
                     (winking)
              For your favorite charity.
     Tommy looks at Reinhardt, who explains.
                            REINHARDT
              The Tommy Johnson Foundation.

              Honorarium. I like that.
     Loretta appears with a platter of food.
                            LORETTA
              Herring, gentlemen?
                            FOURTH LOBBYIST
              Uh, no thanks.
                            LORETTA
              Really? We've got it in cream sauce
              and in wine sauce.

              I think I'll pass.
     Tommy steers her aside and takes a roll of soggy,
     toothpick-impaled herring.
                              TOMMY
              What is this?    Where's the cheese?
                            LORETTA
              The cheese guy didn't return my
              call. So I called the guy at the
              American Smoked Fish Institute.
     She points at the food table. There's nothing but a
     few boxes of crackers and two huge mounds of herring --
     one white, one pink. The centerpiece is a large
     smoked fish, eyes staring accusingly.
                            TOMMY
              Oh, that's just wonderful. Sixty
              heavy hitters drop in, and I'm
              feeding 'em cat food.
     He breaks off, as Celia comes into view in the doorway
     behind. Tommy picks her up on his radar.
                            TOMMY
              We'll talk about this later.
     We follow Tommy through the crowd until he reaches Celia.
                              TOMMY
              Hi   there. Glad you could make it.
              So   you're... Celia Kirby. That's
              an   extremely beautiful name. For
              an   extremely beautiful woman.
                            CELIA
              Wow! That's smooth. After ten
              straight hours on my feet making
              small talk and breathing cheap
              cigar smoke, that's exactly the
              kind of line I'm ready to fall for.
                            TOMMY
              Whoa, slow down.
                            CELIA
              Sure, sure, forget it. Can you just
              tell me, which one's Congressman
              Johnson?

     Tommy has to laugh.

              I want an appointment, Congressman,
              not a date.
                            TOMMY
              Yeah, sure, we'll type it up on the
              schedule, it'll be an appointment,
              except with wine and flowers on the
              table.

              No thanks.   I really should be going.

              I heard in the steam room you're

              bill.
                              MARSHALL
              Not screw up.    Amend.
                            DODGE
              Come on, Eli, your amendments don't
              have a chance in hell to pass. My
              bill isn't perfect, I know, but
              it'll pass. And the President'll
              sign it.

                            MARSHALL
              "Isn't perfect"? Dick, your bill's
              the Incumbents Protection Act! How
              can you even call it an ethics bill?
                            DODGE
              Because the public wants an ethics
              bill! So that's what we call it.
                            MARSHALL
              But it's got no teeth! It won't
              change a thing, and you know it.
                            DODGE
              Come on, Eli, you're a politician,
              too. The less you're going to do
              about something, the more you have
              to talk about it. You know that.
     They start walking.

                            MARSHALL
              I see. We close the bank, we
              stop the rubber checks, we raise
              the prices in the barber shop, we
              stop fixing parking tickets, and
              abracadabra! We say we've cleaned
              up Congress. Well, I don't think
              the American people want what
              this place has become.
                            DODGE
              That's the beauty of it! They
              must, Eli -- they keep re-electing
              us.
                            MARSHALL
              Not anymore! This new Congress is
              full of new faces.

              redistricting -- nothing more than

              Do you? What's unemployment up

              percent? Eight-five?

              look at what we cover: energy,
              health, telecommunications,
              environment... the committee is

              It's something. What is it? Why
              me?
     Reinhardt puts his hand on Tommy's shoulders.

              Congressman, I don't want you to
              take this the wrong way, but...
              you're black. And I mean that in
              the nicest possible way.
                              TOMMY

              Dodge wants to run for Speaker.
              And he ain't gonna make it without
              votes from the black caucus.
     Suddenly, Dodge reappears.   He throws his arm around
     Tommy's shoulders.
                            DODGE
              Tommy, someone I want you to meet...
     Dodge steers TJ to a preppy-looking man at the witness
     table -- BARCLAY "SKEETER" WARBURTON.
                            DODGE
              Skeeter, do you know Tommy Johnson?
              Meet the new member of the committee.
              Tommy, this is Barclay Warburton.
                            TOMMY
              Pleased to meet you, Barclay.
     WARBURTON'S voice is aristocratic, a la George Plimpton.
                            WARBURTON
              Skeeter. Please. Been called
              that since boarding school.

                              TOMMY
              Skeeter.
                            WARBURTON
              Damned fine to meet you.
     As Dodge and Tommy head for the dais, Tommy imitates
     Warburton's lockjaw.
                            TOMMY
              "Tommy. Please. Been called
              that since reform school."
     Dodge chuckles, shakes his head in mock rebuke. Tommy
     takes his seat at the lower dais, smiles at the Members
     on his left and right.

              This EPA oversight hearing of the
              Committee on Power and Industry

              a new Member is joining us today,
              the distinguished gentleman from

     THE BIGGEST EXPLOSION OF FLASHES YET... and as the motor
     drives whir, Tommy flashes his biggest smile yet.
85   INT. TOMMY'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY                           85
     Tommy's office walls are now richly hung with plaques,
     awards, and framed photos. We see he has been named the
     PESTICIDE COALITION'S Man of the Month. The winner of
     the NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION'S Achievement Award. The
     MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA'S Outstanding Young
     Legislator. Etc. The liquor is gone.
     Loretta is at the receptionist's desk.   A LOBBYIST
     enters.

     He sits and opens his briefcase. Van Dyke approaches him
     with the dignity of a superb butler.

              Let me start with a confession. I
              don't know much about poultry.
              But I do know something about
              people. And let me tell you: I
              like you people. So when you have
              something to say about poultry,
              I listen. Thank you very much.
     He sits down to generous APPLAUSE. ON Armando, in
     attendance, CLAPPING, marveling at the response TJ gets.
87   INT. CATACOMBS - MOVING - DAY                              87
     Capitol Hill is actually two worlds: the aboveground
     buildings that visitors and television cameras see, and
     the catacombs, the busy tunnels and corridors connecting
     the congressional office buildings and the Capitol.
     They're surprisingly unglamorous -- exposed pipes, white-
     washed brick walls, dumpsters, pizza carry-outs -- and
     through them move the legislators and their staffs.
     And here is Tommy, whistling ZIPPEDY DOO DAH. He loves
     this place. Passing a snack bar, he greets the Cashier.
                             TOMMY
              My man.
     He blows a kiss to a pretty Teller in the credit union.
     Passing the barber shop, he calls out to the Shoeshine
     Guy. He passes a black TELEPHONE MAN at an open panel of
     wires.
                              TELEPHONE MAN

     Several lobbyists are now awaiting Tommy balancing plates
     of herring on their knees. Some are enjoying it more
     than others. Tommy breezes in.
                            TOMMY
              Hey, how you folks doin', good to see

     a word with Reinhardt. Tommy indicates his office.
                              TOMMY
              She in there?
     Reinhardt nods.   Tommy gives himself a couple of squirts of
     Binaca.

              Stick around for this, Reinhardt.

              Thank you for seeing us, congressman,

              That's all right. They can wait.

              These are issue papers. This

              But I'm flying blind here, I need

              I'm no different from anyone else.
                            MARSHALL
              That's not true. Some people here
              actually try to do something
              besides save their own ass.
                            TOMMY
              You know, Eli, I like you, I really
              do. You remind me of my father.
                             MARSHALL
              Oh, really?   How so?
                            TOMMY
              He thought I was scum, too.
     BELLS begin RINGING and LIGHTS FLASHING on all the clocks
     and sconces down the corridor. Three RINGS, pause,
     three RINGS, pause... Marshall does a U-turn. Tommy
     doesn't follow suit.
                            MARSHALL
              Aren't you going to vote?

              Vote? Is that what that is? We

93A   INT. LOBBY OUTSIDE HOUSE CHAMBER - DAY                    93A
      It's called "Gucci Gulch." The lobby just outside the
      doors to the House chamber is pandemonium -- a sea of
      lobbyists, lawyers, PACmen, Members, and staffers
      urgently trying to find their masters and signal them
      thumbs-up or-down. Tommy enters, sweeps the room with
      his eyes, looking for Reinhardt, shrugs, then goes
      through the doors onto the floor.
93B   INT. HOUSE CHAMBER - DAY                                  93B
      Tommy goes to a console on the rear of a seat.
      A blue light says OPEN. Tommy inserts a card (it looks
      like an electronic hotel key). Red, green, and amber
      lights at buttons labeled NAY, YEA, and PRES. Tommy
      shrugs, pushes NAY.
93C   INT. LOBBY OUTSIDE HOUSE CHAMBER - DAY                    93C
      As Tommy heads away, he passes a class trip -- a dozen
      fifth-graders and their TEACHER, who hails him.
                              TEACHER
                Excuse me -- Congressman? Do you
                have a moment? We're from the

                               TOMMY
                Yes, it was.

                              TEACHER
                And what did you vote?
                              TOMMY
                I voted "Nay." It's a terrible
                bill. It'd destroy the fabric of
                American life.
                              TEACHER
                And what was the vote on?
      Tommy hasn't a clue. He calls out to Rafe, who is among
      those leaving the chamber.
                              TOMMY
                Hey, Rafe! Tell these kids what
                that vote was about.

              Shit -- makes no difference to me.
              If you're for 'em, I got money for
              you from my sugar producers in
              Louisiana and Hawaii. If you're

                            O'CONNOR
              Well, if you're for 'em, I got
              money from the doctors and
              insurance companies. If you're
              against 'em, I got money from the

              no higher than the common clod.

      LOBBYIST host.
                                GUN LOBBYIST
               Frankly, we    think the semi-automatic
               has gotten a    bad rap. That's why
               the American    Sporting Gun Users PAC
               put together    this trip.
      ON TOMMY AND DODGE enjoying champagne and hors d'oeuvres.

100   EXT. DUCK BLIND - DAY                                     100
      Tommy, wearing full L.L. Bean drag, wading with the other
      Members.
      Someone blows a shrieking DUCK CALL. A flock takes flight.
      Everyone in the group raises their weapons: AK-47s. A
      burst of GUNFIRE. Rambo time.
      We SEE the flock still flying.
      One duck drops at the feet of the hunters.
                             TOMMY
               Must have had a heart attack.

101A   EXT. GOLF COURSE - FIRST TEE - DAY                            101A
       A LARGE SIGN READS:
                SCRAP IRON INSTITUTE CELEBRITY PRO-AM.
       Tommy tees off. He is wearing a veritable pro     shop of
       custom golf gear, all emblazoned with logos of    corporate
       sponsors and lobbies. He hits the ball about     200
       yards...but more or less perpendicular to the    hole.
       REVEAL BOB HOPE standing nearby, watching.
                              BOB HOPE
                I knew all these congressmen get
                a slice, but I didn't know it was
                that big.

                Oh, a fact-finding mission, some
                issue conferences, a few speaking
                engagements, a charity event... the
                usual.

                I can't -- we're having a press
                conference.

      Tommy and Celia walk over the bridge to the cherry trees
      by the Tidal Basin.

                             TOMMY
               So, how'd you end up hustling for
               Pro Bono instead of pesticides? I
               mean, you could have been a big-
               time lawyer, right?
                             CELIA
               Oh, I was for a while.   It...
               depressed me.
                             TOMMY
               At a hundred grand a year, how
               depressed can you get? Doesn't
               it depress you to lose all the
               time?
                             CELIA
               Sometimes. Mostly it gets me
               angry. And the anger keeps me
               going. Sure, I wouldn't mind
               winning a few. And it's not like
               I'm allergic to money...
                             TOMMY
               So why do you do it?
      She skips a stone on the water.
                             CELIA
               God, it's so embarrassing to come
               out and say it.
                             TOMMY
               Say it.
                            CELIA
               Meaning. I need my life to mean
               something.

      This actually hits Tommy.    Celia, embarrassed, changes
      the subject.
                             CELIA
               My question is, how'd you get
               named after a Memorial?
                             TOMMY
               Grandma like Jefferson. Y'know,
               "Life, liberty and the pursuit of
               happiness." It's a lot to live
               up to, so I specialized in the
               last part.
                             CELIA
               And how's the pursuit going?
                             TOMMY
               Fine...'til I met you. Now...the
               better I do, the worse I feel.
      They have stopped walking.    They are standing close
      together. They kiss.
                             TOMMY
               So...when can I see you again?
               How about dinner Saturday night?
      She shakes her head.
                             CELIA
               How about Sunday morning?
                             TOMMY
               Brunch?

104   INT. OLD CHURCH - BALTIMORE - DAY                             104
      In the pulpit, Rev. Elijah Marshall thunders:
                             MARSHALL
               The wages of sin is death! And
               to the man who values Gold over
               Goodness...the Lord allows no
               exemptions!
      REVEAL TOMMY and Celia in the front pew. Marshall
      appears to be preaching directly to Tommy, who wears a
      slightly sick smile.
                             MARSHALL
               To the man who shows no respect
               for the privilege of walking this
               Earth, God allows no deductions!

105   EXT. CHURCH - DAY                                          105

      On the steps, Marshall shakes hands with his Congregants.
      Tommy and Celia exit the church. Marshall takes Celia by
      the hands and kisses her familiarly. Tommy is taken
      aback.
                             MARSHALL
               Hello, darling. Glad you could
               make it.
                             CELIA
               I liked the sermon, Uncle Eli.
                             TOMMY
               Uncle Eli?
                             MARSHALL
               My niece says you're not half as
               slimy as I thought.
                             TOMMY
               Your niece?

                             MARSHALL
               That would put you somewhere
               between a lizard and a toad.
               Quite a step up.
      Tommy looks from Marshall to Celia and back again.
                             TOMMY
               How could I have missed the
               family resemblance?

      Ahead of him, encamped in the hallway, he sees a phalanx
      of SENIOR CITIZENS, many carrying placards, and some
      camera crews. Tommy adjusts his tie, turns on the charm,
      and approaches.
                             TOMMY

                             DODGE
               Now let me get this straight. You
               voted to make people on Medicare
               pay more money to their doctors?
                             TOMMY
               The Medical Association made a
               persuasive case. Ten grand from
               their PAC, plus Christmas in Aspen.

               Tommy -- if I'm not mistaken, you
               wouldn't be here without the good
               senior citizens of your district.
               You got to dance with the girl
               that brung you, son. If you have
               a bit of business to do, do it
               quietly... in the corridors... in
               the subcommittees... with little
               amendments. You mess around on
               the big ones like Medicare, you'll
               be dead meat on election day.
                             TOMMY
               Yeah, well, then it's thanks for
               the memories, and on to the next
               gig.
                             DODGE
               Do you know what your problem is,
               son? You don't think big enough.
               You have a real knack for this
               town, but you have the soul of a
               two-bit hustler. Listen to me,

               Five hundred thirty-five Members

               before that. It's like that
               election after election. If you

                             VAN DYKE
               Just a moment, please.
                      (dials; into phone)
               Could you come out? Thank you.
                      (hanging up)
               Be right with you.
                      (to Mickey)
               I like your hat.
      Loretta comes out and extends a hand.

               How do you do, I'm Miss Loretta,
               public liaison for the congressman.

               Ellen Juba. My daughter Mickey.
               We'd like to see him.
                             LORETTA
               Y'all from the district? Up    here
               seein' the sights? How'd you    folks
               like some gallery passes? Go    on
               over and listen to the great   debates
               of our day?
      She reaches into Van Dyke's desk drawer to get some passes.
                             MICKEY
               We don't want to go to the gallery.
               We want to see Congressman Johnson.

      Loretta exchanges a look with the Lobbyists, who get the

               Look what I won! Must be that

      Armando has come out to hear this.

               There a problem, congressman?

               I was lucky. They said they got it

               Oh, at first, none of us in the
               neighborhood wanted to believe it,
               but then we all saw it -- for me,
               it was when the two-year-old across
               the street developed a brain tumor,
               same as Mickey. We looked at
               everything -- the water, the air,
               dump sites, insects, you name it.
               But we didn't have to look that far.
               It was staring us in the face.

               Turns out a lot of schools are near
               power lines. The land's cheap, so
               the schools tend to buy it from the
               power companies in the first place.

               We asked the superintendent to

               it'll cost forty thousand dollars,
               and what program did we want him to
               cut that from?

                 No, that's not fair. Some people

      Dodge downs his drink.   Tommy follows suit.
                             DODGE
               Son, you're a real comer. I
               wouldn't be surprised if you ended
               up in the leadership. I'll say
               this: if I were Speaker, I'd
               sleep better with you as a
               lieutenant.
                             TOMMY
               Why, thank you, Mr. Chairman. You
               know, to tell you the truth, I
               didn't know you'd be on my side on
               those power lines.
                               DODGE
               But I'm not.
                             TOMMY
               But you said you were sympathetic --
                             DODGE
               Of course I did. We're all
               sympathetic to little girls with
               cancer. But I'm not sympathetic
               to holding an inquiry.
                             TOMMY
               But you said --
                             DODGE
               I know what I said. But that was
               just a press conference, son. I
               wasn't under oath.
      The intercom BUZZES.

               Yes?... Bring them right in!
                      (hanging up)

               your name in the paper.

               I bet the gentleman from Iowa was
               all over the evening news in Des
               Moines tonight. Getting good
               press -- letting them know you
               care -- that's what it's all about.
               Smart move, Tommy. But that's as
               far as I'd go with this, if I were
               you.
      The door opens. Dodge turns to see Olaf Anderson, Tommy
      O'Connor, and Zeke Bridges enter.

               The boys here have told me a lot

                             O'CONNOR
               Yeah -- I told him you voted for him!
      They all share a laugh.    Except for Bridges, who squints
      at Tommy.

               Tommy and I were just talking about

               Yeah, what a coincidence. I

               I think we should hold those

               Oh, I keep my ear to the ground,

               Listen, Tommy, why don't we just get
               Olaf's take on this.
                             ANDERSEN
               It's tragic, cancer's a terrible
               thing, but there's no way you can
               link it to power lines. Truth is,
               there's a bigger electromagnetic
               field given off by an electric
               blanket, or a microwave oven, than
               by those derricks.

                             TOMMY
               But there are studies that say --
                             ZEKE
               For every study that says one thing,
               I'll show you a study saying another.
               We've studied it ourselves. Nada.
                             ANDERSEN
               There's not a single state health
               official anywhere in this country
               who says power lines cause cancer.
                             TOMMY
               But what if you're wrong?
      As Tommy persists, Andersen looks increasingly angry.
                             TOMMY
               People didn't use to say smoking
               causes cancer, either. What if the
               evidence is just building, and some
               day we wake up and discover that
               your power lines are killing us?

      Andersen backs off, regains his composure.    The outburst
      makes an impression on Tommy.
                             Tommy
               I'm just saying, it's worth looking

               Tommy -- do you want to move the power
               lines? Do you know how much it
               would cost to bury them? Millions.
               Tens of millions. I don't have that
               money. The state doesn't have that
               money. You people up here sure
               don't have that money. You know
               who'd end up paying for it? Folks
               who sent you here, that's who.
                             O'CONNOR
               Now how'd you like the   people in
               your district to think   of you as the
               putz who tripled their   electric bill?

                             O'CONNOR
               Think for a minute, boychik. You
               hold your hearings. Overnight,
               everyone who lives near a substation
               finds the value of his home in the
               toilet. You kill the real estate
               market.

                             ZEKE
               You kill the insurance companies.
                             O'CONNOR
               You kill the school district.
                             ANDERSON
               You kill the local economy.
                             DODGE
               For a smart boy, you're not

      The door opens.     Eli Marshall, fully dressed, comes in.
                             MARSHALL
               You shafted me on the ethics bill.

               Hello, Eli, good to see you.   Why
               don't you loosen your tie?
                             MARSHALL
               It's a closed rule. I can't get my
               amendments on the floor. I can't get
               a recorded vote. I can't get squat.
                             DODGE
               Last time I looked, it was the Rules
               Committee in charge of that. This
               isn't the Rules Committee, Eli.
               This is the steam room.

                             MARSHALL
               This is the U.S. Congress! The
               American people deserve better than --
                             DODGE
               You know what your problem is, Eli?
               You've got sermonitis.
      The other Members chuckle.
                             DODGE
               Can't open your mouth without
               climbing into the pulpit, can you?
               Why don't you just calm down, have
               a massage --
                             MARSHALL
               I've got news for you, Dick. I'm
               going to run against you for Speaker.
               I may not have a rat's ass of a
               chance to beat you. But I sure as
               hell can tell the world the kind of
               sleaze you stand for.

               He'll listen to you, Tommy. I want
               you to go make peace between us.
               Tell him we'll work something out
               on his amendments -- not a vote, I
               won't go that far, but at least
               he'll get to say his piece on the
               floor. Just get him off my back.
               Can you do that for me?
                             TOMMY
               That's not a question, is it?

               That's right.     Is there a problem?

      Marshall takes a boiled crab from the platter between them,
      places it on the butcher paper in front of him, christens

      -- raises a big wooden mallet, and SMASHES it on the crab,
      smiling.
                             TOMMY
               You know, Eli, sometimes people do
               things they regret. Everyone makes
               mistakes. Fact is, Dick's been

               like the way it looks. For anybody.
               Look. You said you wanted to get
               back into Marshall's good graces.
               Well, here's an opportunity.

                             DODGE
               Listen carefully. Tell the
               ambulance to take you to Walter
               Reed. It's a privilege they give
               congressmen. It's also the only
               hospital without a bunch of goddam
               reporters shtupping the nurses in
               exchange for leaks. They'll keep
               it quiet. I'll handle the police.
               You go home and keep your mouth shut.

      Two figures approach one another in the shadows:
      Reinhardt, and the Taxi Driver who rear-ended Marshall's
      car. The cabbie nods.   Reinhardt hands him an envelope.
      The Driver inspects the cash.

      Tommy is shaving.   He HEARS the local tv news from the
      bedroom.
                             WASHINGTON ANCHOR (V.O.)
               ... and the Beltway is bumper-to
               bumper, so you might as well take a
               day of annual leave and enjoy
               yourself. At the top of the news,
               Maryland Congressman Elijah Marshall
               is in satisfactory condition at
               Walter Reed Hospital after an
               overnight accident in the District.
      Tommy bolts into the bedroom.    On the television he sees

               That's right, Tom. Marshall
               reportedly had alcohol in his blood.
               Also slightly injured was an
               unidentified woman whom police say
               has a record in several states for
               prostitution.
      Tommy looks sick.

               Linda, Congressman Marshall --
               that's Reverend Marshall, isn't it?

                             CORRESPONDENT
               Right you are, Tom. How this plays
               into his longstanding campaign to
               reform congressinoal ethics is now
               anyone's guess.

      She tries her hand at a false shuffle.
                               TOMMY
               Not bad, kid.    You've got potential.
                             MICKEY
               So what's happening? I thought you

      She indicates the derricks.      Tommy looks at her, comes to

               I am.
      He takes the deck from her, fans it face up, pulls all the
      kings and aces, stacks them on top, and squares the deck.

      Tommy, smiling, calculates something for a moment, then
      gives the deck four shuffles. He hands Mickey the cards.

               Your deal.
      She deals out six hands in a circle on the ground.

               Look at the sucker's hand.

      She turns over the hand at number two.   It has the four
      kings. Mickey WHISTLES at the hand.
                             TOMMY
               Look at your hand.
      She turns over her own hand. It has the four aces.

      It's Homer. In a jacket and tie, his stubble shaved off,

               Congressman, I have information I
               think you may want. It's about
               something going on at the EPA.
                             TOMMY
               What have you got?
                             HOMER
               I got a wife and three kids, and a
               note on my house, that's what I got.

               You got any cash on you? I'm kind

               This stuff's pretty good?

                             HOMER
               In the right hands, it could mean a
               great deal.
                            TOMMY
               Okay. Sunday. Fifth race at Del
               Mar. Blueboy is running twenty to
               one. I'd take a major position.
                             HOMER
               You have to be shitting me.
                             TOMMY
               No, not at all -- my Cousin Henry
               spends his days pumping water into
               horses' stomachs and stuffing
               Percodan up their butts. Trust me.
      Reinhardt is interested in this.   And he admires Tommy's
      m.o.

                             HOMER
                      (after a moment)
               Alright. The White House is putting
               heat on the EPA. They want us to
               announce a major investigation of
               the relation between power lines and
               cancer clusters.
                             REINHARDT
               But didn't the EPA already do a study?
                             HOMER
               Yeah, but when the draft got to the
               White House, they didn't like it. So
               they brought their own scientists in
               to kill it.

                               HOMER

               Is there new evidence?
                             HOMER
               Yeah -- their polls have dropped
               like a rock. They need an issue.
               This one makes them look good on
               the environment, and they don't have
               to spend a penny.
                             TOMMY
               And what good is this to me?
                             HOMER
               Come on, congressman, in this town,
               information is currency. And
               advance information is gold.
      Reinhardt nods in agreement.
                                HOMER
               But you've    got to move fast. Once
               the White    House goes public with
               this, they    can't turn back. If your
               friends at    the power company want to
               kill this    investigation, they'd better
               do it now.     Evening, gentlemen.

      The Longworth Room, a small circular committee room with

               Unless there is further business,
               our caucus stands adjourned.
      Dodge gets up.    As he makes to leave, Tommy comes in.
                             TOMMY
               Got a minute, Dick?
      Tommy takes him aside.    The room empties except for them.
                             TOMMY
               Listen, Dick, I heard something.
               There's got to be some bid'ness in it.
      Tommy very discreetly gestures with his thumb and palm:
      money.
                             TOMMY
               Maybe we can go in on it together.

                             DODGE
               I'm listening.
                             TOMMY
               The EPA is going to make a stink
               about power lines. The White House
               is pushing them to do a big study.
                             DODGE
               That's very interesting, my friend.
               I've heard that, too.
                             TOMMY
                      (acting surprised)
               Nothing gets by, do it?
      Tommy touches his nose, in tribute to the master.

               that started this.
                             DODGE
               No, this is a stunt for the polls.
                             TOMMY
               So do you think there's something

                      (musing)
               If we got the EPA off Olaf Andersen's
               back, he'd be extremely appreciative.
                             TOMMY
               And how do we do that?
                             DODGE
               My committee writes the EPA's programs.
               We audit their funds. We confirm their
               appointees. I've got them by the balls.
                             TOMMY
               And you're going to -- ?
      Tommy makes a squeezing gesture, grins.
                             DODGE
               Oh, no, not at all -- just...
               persuasion. Strenuous persuasion.
                             TOMMY
               That's allowed?
                             DODGE
               Persuasion, yes. Intimidation, no.
               But it's a gray area. Who's to say
               which is which?
                             TOMMY
               Dick, wait a minute -- shouldn't we
               check out the tip? Make sure the
               EPA's really going through with this
               investigation?

               I'm screwed. Whole insurance
               business is screwed. You know how
               much cash I'd have to pay out in
               settlements? Even if I stiffed
               everybody on claims, the legal
               fees'd be enough to kill me.

               I can't believe it.

               You better believe it. You're
               screwed, too. Every hot dog trial
               lawyer in America soon be lining up
               to sue both our asses. We got to
               move on this, Olaf. If I wasn't
               tied up here, I'd go to Washington
               myself. Shouldn't you be getting
               on a plane? Just between us -- you
               find a way to stop this, I'll find
               a million bucks if I have to.

               How do we play it?
                            DODGE

               I don't know how I can help you on
               this one, Olaf. This is the EPA.
               This is the President.
                             ANDERSEN
               This is my lifeblood!
                             DODGE
               I see that, Olaf, I see that. But
               in this town, you pick your fights.
                             ANDERSEN
               This could mean six figures, Dick.
      Dodge says nothing, but makes his eyebrows fly.
                             ANDERSEN
               High six figures.
      Dodge flicks his eyebrows again:   More.

               You're only in trouble if someone
               can prove a connection.
                             DODGE
               Of course there's no connection.
               Olaf's just making a contribution
               as a patriotic citizen. And in
               return for it, he's getting --
                             TOMMY
               Good government.

                              DODGE
               Exactly.   A little access, that's
               all.

               I've got to do a drop-by. You

               Look. Whatever you think of me,
               just promise me one thing.
      She glares at him angrily.   But then she's surprised to

               Come to the Clean Air hearing

      He gives her an enigmatic smile and slips away.
      As he rejoins Dodge, Tommy SEES WARBURTON enter the room.
      Alarmed, TOmmy moves in on Dodge, steering him to avoid
      the EPA Administrator.

               Good to see you, sir.    By the way,
               I thought your opening   statement in
               committee yesterday was   brilliant.
      Dodge points out Warburton to Tommy.
                             DODGE
               Well. Look who's over there --
               Skeeter Warburton from the EPA.
               The very man we want to see.

               But -- but you don't want to bother
               him with this. Talk to one of his
               underlings --
      Dodge looks at Tommy with curiosity, not understanding his
      reluctance.

               Well, if the New York Times wants
               to be the only paper in town to

               up to y'all.

158   INT. TOMMY'S CAGE/CORRIDOR - DAY                             158
      Tommy has drawn Reinhardt into the cage.
                             TOMMY
               I want to do a little    something
               nice for Dodge. That     EPA thing --
               he's been good to me,    Reinhardt. Is
               there some way I can,    like, throw a
               bouquet to him at the    hearing today
               without having to sit    through
               that boring testimony    shit?
                             REINHARDT
               Why don't you ask him to give you
               the floor at the start?

                               TOMMY
               He's do that?
                             REINHARDT
               For some flattery? In a New York
               minute. Just tip him ahead of time.
                             TOMMY
               Good thinking.
      They return to the corridor.     Tommy looks at his watch.
                             TOMMY
               Say, Reinhardt, my Grandma's plane
               comes in at ten. You wouldn't mind
               picking her up and driving Miss
               Daisy around, would you?
                             REINHARDT
               Can't one of the others do it?

                             TOMMY
               No, I don't trust them the way I
               trust you.
      TOMMY pats him on the back and sends him on his way.

      Tommy, joined by his cronies and the Jubas.
                             TOMMY
               This is it, people.     Game time.   Let's
               get it right.
                             ARMANDO
               Tell me one thing, jefe. How do
               you know Andersen is going to bite?
                              TOMMY
               I don't.   You run a con, you run a risk.

      VAN DYKE escorts Hattie Rifkin and a busload of Silver
      Foxes.
      Loretta comes in with Ellen and Mickey Juba.

      COMMITTEE MEMBERS head for their seats at the dais.
      OLAF ANDERSEN is at the witness table, along with a couple

               You got that right.
      AT THE DAIS Tommy has a private word with Dodge.
                             TOMMY
               Dick, I thought it might be a nice
               way to open if I congratulated you
               on the fine work you been doin'
               on this committee. Really express
               our appreciation. Especially on
               behalf of the minority community.
                             DODGE
               Why, thank you, son.

      HOMER slips in next to Reinhardt, who is surprised to see
      him.

               No, Mrs. Johnson, you must be
               mistaken -- let me introduce you.
               This is Mr. Yancey of the EPA.

      DODGE GAVELS the meeting to order.
                             DODGE
               This meeting of the Power and
               Enterprise Committee to consider
               the reauthorization of the Clean

               other members of this committee,
               and on behalf of myself, I have a
               very personal statement to make.
               From the bottom of my heart, I want
               to thank you -- thank you for your
               leadership, for your insight, for
               your boldness...
      Dodge preens for the cameras, until:
                             TOMMY
               ... and for your courage.
               Especially your courage.

                             TOMMY
               Your courage in exposing the
               corruption that eats away at this
               institution. Your courage in
               taking on the special interests.
               Your courage in taking a major new
               step --
                             DODGE
               But I've... I've... I've done
               nothing new, nothing at all -- what
               are you talking about?
                                TOMMY
               You're    right -- integrity isn't new
               to you,    Mr. Chairman, it's second
               nature    to you. Still it's a rare
               public    servant who'll take on the
               special    interest money, take on the

                 Yes, courage, Mr. Chairman, is a
                 quality that you have in abundance --
                               DODGE
                 Well, yes, thank you, but we have to

                 Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, the
                 Chairman and I had a meeting in his
                 office with Olaf Andersen of Gulf
                 Coast Power, and his lobbyist,
                 Mr. Tommy O'Connor --
                        (indicating)
                 these gentlemen here. Chairman
                 Dodge and I listened in astonishment
                 as Olaf Andersen offered us seven
                 figures -- that's one million
                 dollars, ladies and gentlemen.

      A BUZZ in the room.   O'CONNOR leans forward to Andersen.
                               O'CONNOR
                 Dodge double-crossed us.
                                 ANDERSEN
                 You're fired.
      ON TOMMY
                               TOMMY
                 One million dollars, if we would
                 stop the EPA from investigating the
                 connection between power lines and
                 cancer clusters.

      HOMER and ARMANDO are delighted.
                             TOMMY
               Isn't that right, Mr. Andersen?
      Tommy flicks his eyebrows at Andersen, provocatively,
      imitating Dodge.
                             ANDERSEN
               That's a vicious lie.
      Dodge GAVELS sharply, turns to Tommy.
                             DODGE
               Will the gentleman yield?
                             ANDERSEN
               That's not possible! You can't
               give anyone that kind of money!
      Dodge continues GAVELING.
                             TOMMY
               Oh, yes, you can. As Mr. O'Connor
               said to you, quote: "If that's
               what you want, we can always find
               a loophole. No one will know."
               Remember saying that, Tommy?
                             O'CONNOR
               I do not!
                             DODGE
                      (standing)
               I insist that the gentlemen yield!

      Tommy also stands, and produces a video tape.
                             TOMMY
               You can't deny it, Mr. Andersen! We
               have the whole thing on this tape!
      The room erupts. THE PRESS loves it. Still cameras CLICK
      and WHIR. DODGE despairs. REINHARDT puts his hand over
      his face.
                             TOMMY
               Yesterday, at Chairman Dodge's
               courageous suggestion, I taped the
               whole conversation. It's all there.
               Mr. Chairman, I thank you. The
               people thank you. America thanks you.

      AUDIENCE APPLAUDS DODGE. The clapping is considerably
      sweetened by the Panthers and the rest of Tommy's claque.
      DODGE gauges their reaction, gets an inspiration. The
      storm leaves his face, and becomes a smile, which he
      beams on Tommy.
                             DODGE
               I thank the distinguished gentleman.
               And I thank my fellow citizens. Our
               methods in this investigation may
               have been unorthodox, but together --
                      (indignant, at Andersen)
               we have exposed a canker at the very
               heart of democracy.

      APPLAUSE. Tommy is amazed at Dodge's survival skills.
      REINHARDT, delighted at the turn, claps heartily.
      ANDERSEN, livid, leaps up and shouts at Dodge.
                               ANDERSEN
               You bastard!    You set me up!
                             DODGE
               Witness is out of order!
                             ANDERSEN
               You stood to make a million bucks
               off of me! Who offered you more?
               I want to know!
      A new BUZZ sweeps the room. O'Connor tries to restrain
      Andersen, who sloughs him off.
                             ANDERSEN
               You're as big a whore as he is!
      MICKEY JUBA catches Tommy's eye and mouths a question.
                               MICKEY
               Now?
      Tommy shakes his head:   no.

162   INT. POWER AND ENTERPRISE COMMITTEE - DAY                 162
                             ANDERSEN
               There's no loyalty any more, is
               there, Dick? What about the three
               hundred grand you squeezed from me
               for that goddam voter registration
               front of yours -- that just water
               under the bridge?
      O'Connor tries again to restrain him.
                             ANDERSEN
               Don't touch me, you scum!
      MICKEY JUBA mouths:

                             MICKEY
               Now?
      Tommy shakes his head again.    No.
                             ANDERSEN
               What about the two hundred k for
               your phony foundation, Dick?
               How about the ten thousand copies
               if your goddam autobiography you
               muscled me to buy -- what's all
               that, ancient history?
      Andersen advances toward the dais, pointing now to six or
      seven other Members of the Committee among the total of
      28.
                             ANDERSEN
               And you -- what about those bundled
               checks from my executives? I gave
               you my condo in Vail! I gave you my
               corporate jet to fly all over the
               world! I gave your kids summer jobs!
               I put up scholarships to put your
               kids through college! I hired your
               goddam wife to redecorate my office!
               You telling me none of that counts
               for anything?
      Andersen grabs Dodge by the throat.
                             ANDERSEN
               I thought you people were for sale!
               I was wrong -- you're just for rent!
      Dodge struggles free of Andersen, who is dragged away from
      Dodge by Capitol Police.

                             DODGE
               How dare you impugn my integrity!
               Everything I've done has been
               completely legal!
                             TOMMY
                      (acting astonished)
               Mr. Chairman! You mean to say you
               did all that stuff? You took all
               that money?
      Shock in the room. Some BOOS. IOWA does a nice HOG
      CALL. TJ sends a little wave and smile to Celia.
                             DODGE
               There's nothing I've done that --
                      (indicating other Members)
               -- that these gentlemen haven't done!
      Committee Members rush to dissociate themselves from
      Dodge.
                             MEMBERS
               No!... Not me!... Just him!... I
               never!... He crossed the line!
                             ANDERSEN
               They're whores! All of them!
      MICKEY JUBA tries again.
                               MICKEY
               Now?
      TJ nods yes.

                             MICKEY
               Throw the bums out!
      LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE.   She's touched a nerve.   TJ leaps
      into the moment.
                             TJ
               Damn straight! Throw the bums out!
               This place is an outhouse!
      ON THE PUBLIC. GASPS, WHOOPS, and APPLAUSE.    Reinhardt
      sinks lower and lower into his seat.

      Tommy, enjoying the triumph, can't help rubbing Dodge's nose
      in it.
                             TOMMY
               I owed you one.
      Dodge wheels on Tommy, exploding.
                             DODGE
               You lowlife hustler! Who are you
               to talk? You got into this House
               through fraud. You think I didn't
               check up on you?
      He pulls a piece of paper from the pile at his place.

                               DODGE
               Ladies and   gentlemen, I have here
               some rather   startling revelations
               about this   Mr. Johnson before you.
               This man is   nothing but a con man!
      A fresh BUZZ from the room.
                             DODGE
               A common grifter!
                      (consulting paper)
               He's wanted in three counties for
               bunco! He's a convicted swindler!
      Some BOOS.   REINHARDT emerges from his hole, encouraged.
                             DODGE (O.S.)
               A fugitive from justice for card
               sharping, bookmaking, confidence
               games --

      ON DODGE AND TOMMY
                             DODGE
               -- and other charges the FBI has
               only begun to investigate! I dare
               you to respond!
      A hush in the room.
                             TOMMY
               You know what? He's right!     But
               let me tell you something --   all
               that's nothing, compared to   what I
               pulled here in Washington...   and
               this shit's all legit!

      LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE.   Dodge BANGS the gavel repeatedly.
                             DODGE
               The gentleman is out of order! The
               gentleman is out of order! This
               committee is adjourned!
      GRANDMA leaps to her feet.
                             GRANDMA
               Stop banging! Stop banging!      That
               man has something to say!
      Massive APPLAUSE. Dodge is stunned by the enormity of
      the sentiment against him.

                             TOMMY
               Adjourned? Fine. Leave.
                      (indicating cameras)
               Turn your backs on the whole
               country. That what you want to
               do, gentlemen?
      The Members remain in place, paralyzed.
                             TOMMY
                      (to the room)
               I'm a con man. A small-time con
               man. Do you know what it was like
               for me to come to Congress? It
               was for like dying and going to
               heaven. If I did back home the
               kind of scams I've run in Congress,
               my ass would be in Sing Sing. But
               no, I'm not a crook -- up here,
               I'm a distinguished gentleman!

      Eli, watching on television.

               Now don't get me wrong. They're
               not all bums. But boy, do the
               rotten fish stink up the barrel.
      Marshall APPLAUDS.   The Man in the next bed joins in.

               I'll tell you who. Nobody! Nobody

               Association for Ordinary Assholes!
               Sure, everyone's against cancer, but
               "everyone" doesn't have an office

               Don't you folks get it? We're

               Congress is supposed to be America's
               political action committee.

      APPLAUSE and SHOUTS of support. Several Members on the
      dais join the applause, seeing a winning issue.
      CELIA shakes her head in wonder.
      Tommy goes to Mickey and stands her up on a chair.
                             TOMMY
               She's right. Throw the bums out --

               Why? I bought it this morning.
