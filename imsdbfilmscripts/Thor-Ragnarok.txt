     Dark and cramped. The soft red light of fire seeps through
     iron slats. Inside this cage is a man, bound by chains.

     It's THOR. His beard is long and his clothes are worn. That
     rough, grizzled look of a man who's spent years on the road.

     He awakens with a JOLT.   Looks around.

                           THOR
                 Now I know what you're thinking.
                 Oh no! Thor's in a cage. How did
                 this happen?
                     (then:)
                 Well, sometimes you have to get
                 captured just to get a straight
                 answer out of somebody. It's a long
                 story but basically I'm a bit of a
                 hero. See, I spent some time on
                 earth, fought some robots, saved
                 the planet a couple of times. Then
                 I went searching through the cosmos
                 for some magic, colorful Infinity
                 Stone things... didn't find any.
                 That's when I came across a path of
                 death and destruction which led me
                 all the way here into this cage...
                 where I met you.

                 be here?

     NOISE.    Sounds of metal gears TURNING.

     Chains CINCH and abruptly halt his descent. Thor dangles six
     feet off the ground. Pull back to reveal we are in-

3   INT. SURTUR'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS                                  3

    A cavernous space. The walls, floors, and ceilings are
    molten rock, which has creepy glimmers of fire within it.
    Stationed in the center is a volcanic rock throne, and
    sitting in that throne is a charred demonic skeleton.

                        SURTUR (O.S.)
              Thor, Son of Odin.

    Thor's chain turns to reveal-

    -SURTUR on his throne. Eighteen-feet-tall, flesh made of
    fire, and demonic spiked horns on his skull.

                         THOR
              Surtur. Son of a bitch...you're
              still alive! I thought my father
              killed you, like, half a million
              years ago.

                        SURTUR
              I cannot die. Not until I fulfill
              my destiny and lay waste to your
              home.

                        THOR
              You know, it's funny you should
              mention that because I've been
              having these terrible dreams of
              late. Asgard up in flames, falling
              to ruins, and you Surtur are at the
              center of all of them.

                        SURTUR
              Then you have seen Ragnarok, the
              fall of Asgard. The great prophecy--

                         THOR (O.S.)
              Hang on.   Hang on.

    Reveal that Thor's chain is turning VERY SLOWLY.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
              I'll be back around shortly. I
              really feel like we were connecting
              there.

    After a beat, Thor rotates around to face Surtur.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
              Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about
              that. Walk me through it.

                    SURTUR
          My time has come. When my crown is
          reunited with the Eternal Flame, I
          shall be restored to my full might.
          I will tower over the mountains and
          bury my sword deep in Asgard's--

                    THOR
          Oh, hang on. Give it a second.

Once again, Thor is turning VERY SLOWLY.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          I swear I'm not even moving, it's
          just doing this on its own. I'm
          really sorry.
              (then:)
          Okay, let me get this straight.
          You're going to put your crown into
          the Eternal Flame, and then you'll
          suddenly grow as big as a house--

                    SURTUR
          A mountain!

                    THOR
          The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps
          locked away on Asgard?

Surtur grins, evil.

                    SURTUR
          Odin is not on Asgard. And your
          absence has left the throne
          defenseless.

That elicits a concerned look from Thor.

                    THOR
          Okay, so where is it? This crown?

                    SURTUR
          This is my Crown, the source of my
          power.

Surtur points at the V-shaped horns on his head..

                    THOR
          Oh, that's a crown? I thought it
          was a big eyebrow.

                    SURTUR
          It's a crown.

                     THOR
           Anyway, it sounds like all I have
           to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that
           thing off your head.

Surtur stands up and approaches Thor, DRAGGING his sword.

                     SURTUR
           But Ragnarok has   already begun. You
           cannot stop it.    I am Asgard's
           doom, and so are   you. All will
           suffer, all will   burn.

Surtur steps forward and GRABS the chain above Thor's feet,
holding it so he and Thor are face to face.

                     THOR
           That's intense. To be honest,
           seeing you grow really big and set
           fire to a planet would be quite the
           spectacle. But it looks like I'm
           going to have to go with option B
           where I bust out of these chains,
           knock that tiara off your head, and
           stash it away in Asgard's vault.

                     SURTUR
           You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight
           it?

Behind his back, Thor opens his hand.    Sending out the SOS.

                     THOR
           Because that's what heroes do.

Nothing happens.   Thor appears annoyed at himself.

                     THOR (CONT'D)
           Wait, sorry. I didn't time that
           right.
               (pause)
           And, now!

BOOM!   Thor's hammer Mjolnir CRASHES through the wall!

Thor BREAKS FREE from his chains, GRABS Mjolnir, spins, and
flies a distance away. He FLINGS Mjolnir back at Surtur,
smashing the giant in the face. Mjolnir returns.

                     SURTUR
           You have made a grave mistake,
           Odinson.

    THE WALLS COME ALIVE! A seemingly infinite swarm of FIRE
    DEMONS rally to Surtur's aid.

                         THOR
               I make grave mistakes all the time.
               Everything seems to work out.

    In the shadows, a massive FIRE DRAGON ROARS.

    The fire demons SURGE FORWARD. Thor backs up, HAMMERING
    AWAY. He then leaps back, SPRINGBOARDS off the wall, and-

    -LANDS HARD, SLAMMING Mjolnir down. The resulting shockwave
    KNOCKS BACK THE LEGION OF FIRE DEMONS.

    The Fire Dragon STRAINS against a chain leash.

    Thor is now facing off with Surtur. Surtur thrusts his hands
    at Thor, generating a humongous PROJECTILE WALL OF FIRE!

    Thor SPINS Mjolnir so fast that it creates a kind of SHIELD.

    The God of Thunder and the Fire Giant engage in ferocious
    hand-to-hand combat. Each landing power shots, sending
    sparks of both fire and electricity into the air.

    Thor SLIPS behind Surtur and TAKES OUT his knees. Thor then
    LAUNCHES HIGH into the air and summons a HUGE LIGHTNING BOLT.
    Descending hard, he uses all his power to-

    -LOP SURTUR'S HEAD OFF OF HIS BODY! Surtur's body DEFLATES
    and COLLAPSES into a heap of charred bones.

    Thor straps the crowned skull to his back. He turns to find-

    -the army of Fire Demons regrouping as reinforcements flood
    in, filling the space to capacity. Recognizing the threat,
    Thor thrusts Mjolnir above his head.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               Heimdall. I know it's been a while,
               but I could use a fast exit!

    Nothing.   Thor just stands there as the Fire Demons advance.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               ...Heimdall?

              Heimdall was an idiot. This job
              should have made him rich. Now,
              the job ain't easy, but it does
              have its benefits. The Bi-Frost
              gives me access to everything the
              Nine Realms have to offer. I mean
              it's all mine for the taking.

              Behold...my stuff.

    Skurge has drawn their attention to a pile of weapons and
    treasures he has stashed off to the side.

    He hefts up two M-16 assault rifles, trying to play it cool.

                        SKURGE (CONT'D)
              I'm particularly fond of these. I
              pulled `em out of a place on
              Midgard called Texas. I even named
              them. Des and Troy. You see, when

    Disoriented and singed from the fire demon onslaught.

    Thor's cloak is on fire, and he frantically PATS OUT the
    flames. He picks up Mjolnir, holds it up once more. Nothing.

      Thor SPINS UP Mjolnir and takes off in a blur.   Skurge starts
      the loooong run down the Rainbow Bridge.

      THOR arrives with Surtur's skull.

      There's a small crowd making its way through a threshold over
      which stands a monumental statue of Loki, arms out-stretched
      in the `savior' pose.

      Confused, Thor turns to a theater patron.

      LOKI falls into frame, GASPING FOR BREATH... although it's
      not Loki. This is ACTOR LOKI and we're watching a STAGE PLAY.

      In the background, a single musician plays the haunting score
      from THOR: THE DARK WORLD on a pan flute.

      Suddenly, ACTOR THOR leans into shot, holding Actor Loki.

In the middle of the audience we reveal ODIN, sitting upon a
chaise lounge, sipping wine and thoroughly enjoying the show.
Unseen, Thor arrives behind the audience and watches.

          Sorry for all I've done.

                    ACTOR THOR
          I will tell Father what you did

Odin mouths Actor Loki's final line along with him.

          I didn't do it for him.

Actor Loki then "dies".

The brothers freeze in a TABLEAU as ACTOR ODIN steps forward.

                    ACTOR ODIN
          And so Loki died of his wounds,
          giving his life for ours. He
          fought back those disgusting dark
          elves. He brought peace to the
          realm.

He takes a 4-YEAR-OLD BOY, PAINTED BLUE, into his arms.

          Loki, my boy...`Twas many moons ago
          I found you on a frost-bitten

Thor watches, incredulous. He then notices that a woman next
to him is openly SOBBING at the play.

          On that day, I did not yet see in

          merely a little blue baby icicle...
          that melted this old fool's heart.

The crowd erupts in rapturous applause. The players bow. Odin
stands up, leading the crowd in this STANDING OVATION.

Odin sees Thor taking a knee.   Curses under his breath:

          Greetings my boy.

Odin goes through a weird internal transformation. His
fluidity is replaced by a rigid and regal posture. He bats
away his maiden and turns to Thor, who stands up.

                     THOR
          It's an interesting play.    What's
          it called?

          The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard. The

          Indeed they should.

          I like that statue. A lot better
          looking than he was when he was
          alive, though. A little less
          weasely. Less greasy maybe.

Odin sours, masking his agitation.    Thor holds up the skull.

Thor starts YO-YOing Mjolnir, turns back to Odin.

realms that may be a threat to this
world. Your adopted brother Loki
is one of these beings.

          THOR
He's a worthy inclusion.

          STRANGE
Then why bring him here?

          THOR
We're looking for my father.

          STRANGE
So. If you were to tell you where
Odin was, all parties concerned
would promptly return to Asgard?

            THOR
Promptly.

           DR. STRANGE
Great.   Then I'll help you.

          THOR
If you knew where he was, why
didn't you call me?

           DR. STRANGE
I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed. Your
father said he had chosen to remain
in exile.
    (beat)
And you don't have a phone.

          THOR
No, I don't have a phone, but you
could have sent an electronic
letter. It's called an email.

          STRANGE
Yeah, do you have a computer?

           THOR
No. What for?
    (beat)
Anyway, my father is no longer in
exile. So if you could tell me
where he is, I can take him home.

                           DR. STRANGE
                Gladly.   He's in Norway.

      Strange stands up and suddenly they are standing by a book-
      case. Strange takes down an ancient book, flips through it.

                          STRANGE
                I'm just seeing whether this
                incantation requires any Asgardian
                modifications.

      Thor reaches out to the bookcase to steady himself.

                           STRANGE (CONT'D)
                Nope.

      Suddenly they are both across the room at Strange's work
      station. Because Thor was touching the bookcase, he has
      magically brought it across the room as well.

                          STRANGE (CONT'D)
                Oh, we don't need that.

      Suddenly Thor is back across the room.   Books fall off the
      shelf and Thor's beer spills.

      He is queasy and unsteady from the teleporting.

                          THOR
                Will you stop doing that?

                          STRANGE
                I need just one strand of your
                hair.

                          THOR
                Let me explain something, my hair
                is not to be meddled wi-!

      Strange is behind Thor, he plucks a strand of hair.

      Strange extends the hair, infuses it with magic, does a few
      gestures that create a BRIGHT LIGHT and suddenly-

      Bottom of the stairs. Strange is standing. Thor is rolling
      down the stairs. A magic portal leading into a peaceful
      meadow has opened beside Strange.

                          THOR
                We could have just walked.

          He's waiting for you.

                       THOR
          All right.

                    STRANGE
          Don't forget your umbrella.

                       THOR
          Yes.

Thor extends his arm and holds out his hand.    Crashing noises
are heard. Lots of crashing noises.

                       THOR (CONT'D)
          Sorry

Finally the umbrella flies into his hand.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          I suppose I'll need my brother
          back.

                    DR. STRANGE
          Yeah, right.

Suddenly we hear SCREAMING.

From above, LOKI drops out of a portal. He LANDS HARD on the
floor and then STAGGERS to his feet. On edge, confused.

                    LOKI
          ...I have been falling...for thirty
          minutes!

                    DR. STRANGE
              (to Thor:)
          You can handle him from here.

                    THOR
          Yeah of course.
              (they shake hands)
          Thank you very much for your help.

                       STRANGE
          Good luck.

     Loki DRAWS a dagger, ready to attack Strange.

                            DR. STRANGE
                Bye-bye.

     Strange GESTURES with both hands and-

     -WHOOSH!   PULLS the magic portal over them.

     Just like that, Thor and Loki are gone.

     Beautiful, undisturbed nature.       We hear the ocean nearby.

     LOKI lands on the ground, portal closes behind them.

                            THOR
                Father?

     A lone figure stands at the other side of the meadow at the
     cliff's edge, waves CRASHING below.

     It is ODIN. He's dressed plainly in humble human clothes.
     The boys approach him quickly.

                          ODIN
                Look at this place. It's beautiful.

                          THOR
                Father, it's us.

                My sons.   I've been waiting for
                you.

     Loki is surprised to hear Odin call him his son.

                            THOR
                I know.    We've come to take you
                home.

                          ODIN
                Home, yes. Your mother, she calls
                me. Do you hear it?

     Thor fires a look at Loki, who holds up his hands in defense.

                    THOR
          Loki, lift your magic.

Odin turns to Loki, who stiffens.    But Odin smiles.

                    ODIN
          Took me quite a while to break free
          from your spell. Frigga would have
          been proud.

Loki is moved by this gesture. He looks over to see Thor
staring at him, anger building.

Odin puts a hand on Thor's shoulder, calming him.

                     ODIN (CONT'D)
          Come and sit with me. I don't have
          much time.

Odin sits, out of breath, weak.    His sons sit beside him.

                    THOR
          I know that we failed you, but we
          can make this right.

                     ODIN
          I failed you.

          It is upon us...Ragnarok.

                    THOR
          No, I've stopped Ragnarok.    I put
          an end to Surtur.

                    ODIN
          No. It has already begun. She's
          coming. My life was all that held
          her back, but my time has come. I
          cannot keep her away any longer.

          Your sister.

                     ODIN
           Her violent appetites grew beyond
           my control. I couldn't stop her,
           so I imprisoned her. Locked her
           away. She draws her strength from
           Asgard...and once she gets there,
           her powers will be limitless.

                     THOR
           Whatever she is, we can stop her.
           We can face her together.

                     ODIN
               (takes Thor's hand)
           No we won't. I'm on a different
           path now. This you must face
           alone.

Odin looks into Thor's eyes, struggling to breathe.

           I love you my sons.

For the briefest of instances, father and sons share a quiet
moment together. Tears well in Thor's eyes.

Ethereal sun-rays stream down upon the ocean.

A warm glow washes over Thor's face and he turns to see that-

-ODIN IS DISSIPATING INTO STARDUST.   THE ALLFATHER HAS DIED.

A moment as the brothers separately mourn for Odin.

The sky above DARKENS and THE WIND PICKS UP.

Thor stands and turns toward Loki, his eyes burning with
rage. Loki takes a step back.

                      LOKI
           Brother.

Thor faces Loki.   Electricity CRACKLES at Thor's hands.

                     THOR
           This was your doing.

CRACK!   Behind them a black portal SPLITS OPEN!

Thor SLAMS DOWN his umbrella, transforming into his Asgardian
armor (with Mjolnir). Loki changes into his armor as well.

A piercing scream cuts the air as a figure is hurtled out of
the portal, crashing out of this dimensional rift is HELA.

Hela takes a second to consider her surroundings.   Then:

                     HELA
          So he's gone?
              (beat)
          That's a shame. I would've liked
          to have seen that.

A tense moment as they stare each other down.

                    THOR
          You must be Hela.   I'm Thor, son of
          Odin.

                    HELA
          Really, you don't look like him.

          Perhaps we can reach an
          arrangement.

                    HELA
          You sound like him.

Loki shifts nervously.   Thor's grip tightens on Mjolnir.

                    HELA (CONT'D)
          Kneel.

Thor winds up and HURLS Mjolnir at Hela...

Hela's hand.

Thor is shocked. He stretches out his hands, trying to call
Mjolnir back to him.

     The hammer trembles in Hela's hand, like a mini game of tug-o-

                It's not possible.

     HELA SHATTERS THOR'S HAMMER.

     The blast of Mjolnir's destruction sends a wave of energy
     through Thor and Loki who brace themselves against the
     impact.

     Thor is stupefied. In shock. He looks up to see Hela is
     running her hands back over her head to create the terrifying
     battle headdress.

     Loki's reaction is more panic.   He stands and calls up:

Out across the OCEAN he notices A NIGHTMARE WORMHOLE - a
giant open cylinder of whirling smoke and lightning storms.

A loud noise draws Thor's attention to a HUGE RECTANGULAR
"SCRAPPER" SHIP hauling a crashed SPACE VESSEL out of the
water. Beneath the ship are various SCRAPPERS, masked
humanoids. The ship is BLASTING WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC.

solid metal projectile KNOCKS Thor flat on his back. More
Scrappers attack, throwing nets and firing more projectiles.

of the scrappers move in with iron bats and clubs.

sleek, and dangerous, deserving of its name: WARSONG. It is
also BLASTING DIFFERENT WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC.

The FRONT of Warsong FLIPS OPEN and a GANGPLANK extends down
to the ground. The scrappers stop and stare as we TRACK IN to
a HERO REVEAL of SCRAPPER #142 (S142 for short) - a beautiful
and ruthless asskicker.

S142 lifts a half-empty bottle to her lips and CHUGS it. She
finishes the bottle and smashes it on the side of her ship.

                       SCRAPPER #142
          He's MINE.

She walks down the gangplank... before veering off course and
FALLING straight off into a pile of TRASH. She's PLASTERED.

The Scrappers shrug and start hauling Thor away.

          Wait!

S142 staggers to her feet, takes a deep breath. She holds on
to a piece of junk as support - some dead beast. Thor
continues to struggle with his captors, tangled in nets.

                    SCRAPPER #142 (CONT'D)
          Wait! He's mine. So if you want
          him, you go through me.

The Scrappers start brandishing their weapons.

                    SCRAPPER
          But we've already got him.

S142 CLANGS her metal gauntlets together which activate.

          Alright then I guess I go through
          you.

          More food.

She holds out her fists as if she's operating machinery...

...Warsong WHIRS to life. S142 clenches her fists and we hear
a horrible SCREECHING NOISE as Warsong OPENS FIRE.

She sweeps her arms out in an arc, the spray of gunfire
lasting THREE SECONDS. She bangs her fists again, sending the
ship into IDLE MODE. The Scrappers are now little more than
tiny pieces of litter covering the beach.

Thor is fixated on this beautiful murderer approaching. One
final HUGE Scrapper comes at her with a bat. S142 casually
GRABS this Scrapper and HURLS him up into the air behind her.

                       THOR
          Thank you.

From her belt S142 FLICKS a small glowing disc which LODGES
into Thor's NECK. Far in the background, the Scrapper she
threw finally HITS the ground with a loud THUD.

She holds up a fob device and presses the button - the disc
blinks and Thor is filled with the pain of a thousand
screaming squirrels. He hits the ground, stunned.

S142 DRAGS Thor towards her ship.

     Thor is lying in a sort of small GLASS HOLDING CELL beneath

     Thor's eyes lock in on her belt, specifically the fob device
     she used to activate the Obedience Disk/debilitate him.

                         SCRAPPER #142
               This is Scrapper 142. I need
               clearance and an audience with the
               boss. I've got something special.

                          THOR
               Hey!   Where are you taking me?

     S142 ignores him, takes a swig from the bottle, and then
     nonchalantly UNCLIPS the fob from her belt.

                         THOR (CONT'D)

Grandmaster and Thor arrive at a space where A GROUP OF
MUSICIANS PLAY STRANGE INSTRUMENTS (the source of the music
thus far). Grandmaster joins them, still speaking to Thor.

Grandmaster begins PLAYING a strange piano-like contraption,
riffing a melody over the existing music.

                    GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
          My name is Grandmaster. I preside
          over a little harlequinade called
          the Contest of Champions. People
          come from far and wide to
          unwillingly participate in it. And
          you, my friend, might just be part
          of the new cast. What do you say
          to that?

Grandmaster really gets into his PLAYING. Grandmaster's
guards and VIP guests start MOVING TO THE MUSIC.

Thor takes a moment to look around at this bizarre spectacle
unfolding around him. In doing so, he zeroes in on one
particular group of VIPS, specifically...

...LOKI! He's lounging and dressed in Sakaarian garb.

Loki notices Thor. Blanches a little. Sidles closer so as
to speak to Thor without looking like he's speaking to Thor.

          What are you doing?    It's me.

Thor DODGES the first few attacks, but then Hulk SHATTERS his
shield and sends Thor FLYING.

Thor draws a sword and STABS it into the ground to slow his
momentum. Draws the other sword and faces off against Hulk.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          Banner, we're friends. This is
          crazy. I don't want to hurt you!

into the wall.

Thor jumps down just in time to avoid Hulk's warhammer, which
HITS so hard that it remains lodged in the wall.

With Hulk charging again, Thor RIPS the warhammer out of the
wall and WALLOPS Hulk with it.

Hulk goes CRASHING alongside the arena. He ends up sprawled
out in a pile of rubble, slightly dazed.

Thor advances on Hulk with all the swagger. He takes off his
helmet and CALLS OUT to Hulk, provoking him.

                    THOR
          Hey, big guy. The sun's getting
          real low.

          I won't hurt you anymore. No one

WHOOSH! Thor is suddenly dragged out of frame. Hulk has
Thor by the leg and is WHIPPING him against the arena floor.
Over and over and over again.

CLANG! The giant weapons CLASH! Now Thor and Hulk are
fighting warhammer versus battleaxe...

...and Thor is winning! He's getting the better of these
exchanges, using Hulk's aggression against him. Thor
continually KNOCKS and/or TRIPS Hulk off his feet while
evading all of Hulk's best attacks.

One particular vicious blow DISARMS Hulk, and Thor BREAKS
Hulk's axe with the warhammer. Thor then BASHES Hulk in the
chest, KNOCKING him to the ground.

GROWLING, Hulk stands up and HITS Thor with a straight jab
that sends Thor TUMBLING across the arena. Hulk immediately
LEAPS after him and LANDS ON Thor!

Hulk is now on top of Thor as they slide across the arena,
just PUMMELING him with punches. Left-right-left-right.
Thor's head snaps back and forth.

In the carnage, Thor sees VISIONS OF ODIN.   Then-

-his eyes GLOW WHITE WITH ELECTRICITY. Like an instinctual
defense mechanism, Thor suddenly KNOCKS HULK BACK WITH A
BURST OF LIGHTNING!

Seething with electricity, Thor springs to his feet and then
BLASTS HULK WITH A MASSIVE LIGHTNING PUNCH! Hulk is LAUNCHED
BACKWARDS and Thor hits the ground HARD.

IN THE VIP BOX: Grandmaster is pissed.   Loki is amazed.

Hulk and Thor stagger to their feet. Thor looks at himself,
a little surprised. There are still small charges of
lightning CRACKLING through his veins.

Meanwhile, Hulk RUMBLES towards Thor and they're at it again,
close-quarters boxing. Thor is winning the exchanges,
landing BRUTAL PUNCHES to Hulk's body. And then suddenly-

-BZZZ! The Grandmaster ZAPS him with the Obedience Disk fob!
Thor drops, totally caught off guard!

Hulk plants his feet and JUMPS! He ZOOMS UP, rocketing out
of the arena, up-up-up into the sky! At the apex of his jump
Hulk clenches his fist and begins a missile-like descent.

Val sees this from her ship and decides to take off, like
"This fight is over, time to beat traffic."

Down below, Thor groggily turns over. He does so just in
time to see Hulk coming at him like an atom bomb!

No time to avoid it. KA-BOOM!!! Right before impact Thor's
eyes go lightning white. Hulk HITS Thor like a meteor.

      Thor heads to the open entrance.      Hulk smiles, anticipating.

                             HULK
                  Thor go!

                  I am going.

      ZAP! Thor's jolted back by the obedience disk.       There are
      perimeter sensors in the doorway.

      Hulk CHUCKLES at Thor as he hits the floor.      Points.

      TIME CUT:

      Thor slumps against the wall, head sagging.

      Hulk grabs his giant battleaxe.       He's armored up.

                  Hulk trains.

                  That's great. Have fun.

      Hulk exits. Thor watches him go. Then, at the end of the
      hallway Hulk meets up with Valkyrie! They begin play-
      fighting, a clearly friendly rapport.

      Thor can't believe it. He runs to the entrance, but by the
      time he reaches the perimeter sensors they are gone.

      Thor sighs. Walks over to the window. Looks up through a
      wormhole, stars twinkling on the other end of it.

                            THOR (CONT'D)

AA57   INT. STREETS OF ASGARD - SAME                                    AA57

       Thor suddenly finds himself in Asgard. Disoriented at first,
       Thor turns to see Heimdall hiding in the shadows.

       Heimdall harshly SHUSHES Thor and gestures for him to get up
       against the wall. Thor complies. Sees the refugees.

       After a beat a roving patrol of Hela's Butchers creep by
       through the street. They don't spot our heroes. Pause.

       Heimdall turns to Thor, speaks only in hushed whispers.

                           HEIMDALL
                 I see you. But you are far away.

                           THOR
                 What's going on here?

                           HEIMDALL
                 Come see for yourself.

       Without warning, Heimdall leads the family out of the alley
       and DASHES down the street. Thor follows...

       ...but then stops. Looks around to see THE OCCUPIED CITY OF
       ASGARD, emitting a smoky aura of chaos. A chilling sight.

       Down the street, Heimdall gestures for the family to slow
       down. He sees something. Ushers them into an alcove.

       Thor joins them just in time to avoid being seen by another
       roving patrol of Hela's Butchers. Heimdall again motions for
       Thor to "shh" until the threat has passed. Then:

                           HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
                 I'm providing refuge in a
                 stronghold build by our ancestors.
                 But if the garrison falls our only
                 escape will is Bi-Frost.

                           THOR

                           HEIMDALL
                 We won't last long if we stay.

       Thor LOOKS OUT on a ravaged Asgard, heartsick.

       Hold on the devastated Realm as:

           She draws her power from Asgard and

Back to Thor and Heimdall.

                        HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
           Come on.

As Heimdall quickly leads refugees down a safe pathway:

                     HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Hela is ravenous. If I let her
           leave, she'll consume the Nine
           Realms and all the cosmos.

Turns back to Thor, approaches him.

                     HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
           We need you.

                     THOR
           I'm working on it, but I don't even
           really know where the hell I am.

Two packs of Butchers arrive simultaneously.        Spot Heimdall.

                     HEIMDALL
           You're on a planet surrounded by
           doorways. Go through one.

                        THOR
           Which one?

Heimdall RIPS into the attacking Butchers, CUTTING them down.

                     HEIMDALL
           The big one!

WHOOSH!   SUDDENLY THOR'S GONE!     BLACK.

After slashing through the Butchers, Heimdall moves towards
the house where he hid the family... and then abruptly stops.

Heimdall turns slightly.       He sees something.

BINOCULARS POV: Heimdall looking right at us, the Bi-Frost
sword visible in his hand.

Reveal Skurge on a palace tower balcony, surveilling the city
with Asgardian E-noculars. Skurge lowers the E-noculars.

There is conflict on his face. He knows that he should report
this to Hela immediately...yet he doesn't spring into action.

     Thor absentmindedly fidgets with his Obedience Disk.

     THUD! THUD! THUD! ...resonates around the room.   Hulk steps
     up to Thor, looking inquisitively down at him.

               THOR SAD!!!

     Thor hops up, YELLS in Hulk's face.    Paces around.

                         THOR
               I'm not sad, you idiot. I'm pissed
               off! Angry. I lost my father. I
               lost my hammer.

     THUD! THUD! He turns to see Hulk punching his pillow.

     Hulk stops. Stares.

               Whining and crying.   Cry like baby.

Hulk throws a shield that nearly decapitates Thor.

          What, are you crazy?

          Yes.

          You know what? Earth does hate you.

Hulk gets sad.   Wanders over to his bed to mope.

Thor realizes he went to far.    Joins Hulk on the bed.

          No.

          You just can't go around throwing

BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM!

We follow Two Palace Guards as they enter Hulk's Suite.

Hulk is throwing a LARGE BALL against the far wall. It's so
hard it makes dents in the wall. Hulk stops and turns.

Reveal that the guards are escorting Valkyrie. They leave...
Valkyrie and Hulk face off.

                      VALKYRIE
            What's going on? What do you...?

Hulk steps away, allowing Valkyrie to see Thor. Her smile
disappears. She stares at Hulk, so annoyed. Hulk mopes a
little. Like, "I done bad." Turns back to Thor:

                      VALKYRIE (CONT'D)
            You're so thick-headed that you
            can't tell when someone's hiding

            wants to be left alone?

            We need to talk.

            No, you want to talk to me.

Valkyrie turns to leave.

            I need her to stay.

Valkyrie is at the exit when the UPPER JAWBONE of Hulk's
massive skull bed CRASHES into frame, BLOCKING the doorway.

                      HULK
          Stay!    Please?

Valkyrie looks him up and down. Obedience Disks to the max.

Hulk begins BOUNCING his ball against the wall again.

Valkyrie walks over to Hulk's bar, picks up an UNOPENED
BOTTLE of liquor. Hulk snorts, disapprovingly. Val puts it
down and finds something cheaper, she pops the cork.

                    VALKYRIE
          All right. Here's the deal. I'll
          listen to you till this is empty.

She TIPS BACK the bottle and starts CHUGGING.

                    THOR
          Asgard is in danger and people are
          dying. We need to get back there. I
          need your help...wow.

          Finished. Bye.

She has indeed finished. She goes to leave.

                    THOR
          Odin is dead.

Valkyrie stops short (the BALL BANGING noise continues). Her
silence speaks volumes. Thor has a realization.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          Hela, the Goddess of Death has
          invaded Asgard.

          I think it's only you.

          Wait. Just listen. The Valkyrie
          are legend, elite warriors of
          Asgard. You are sworn to defend
          the throne.

          squabbles.

          Your sister. Her power comes from

Hulk's ball rolls into frame. An off screen GRUNT.   Val
picks it up and tosses it back to Hulk.

          When it grew beyond Odin's control,
          she massacred everyone in the

          her banishment, he sent the

          Look, I already faced her once back
          when I believed in the throne, and
          it cost me everything. THAT'S

          throne, the secrets, the whole
          golden sham.

Pause. Thor moves towards Valkyrie, goes to put a comforting
hand on her shoulder.

          I agree.

Val SNATCHES his hand.   They are close, face to face.

          the crown. This is about the

Val SHOVES him away.    Thor stumbles back.

     Never slowing down, Thor keeps the top of the arena in sight.

     A few blocks back: Hulk is in pursuit. He's BUMPING people,
     SWATTING vehicles out of the way, just being a menace.

Hulk CONVULSES. Drops to his hands and knees. His whole

head, trying to fight this back. But he can't help it...

...HE'S TRANSFORMING BACK INTO BRUCE BANNER! The transition
is rough and chaotic, it's as if Banner is fighting to get
out of the Hulk. Throughout the process, Hulk SMASHES back

In the past, I always felt like
Hulk and I each had a hand on the

had the keys and I was locked in
the trunk.

Alright, well, you're back now,
that's all that matters.

          BANNER
No, it's not what matters. What
I'm trying to tell you, is that if
I turn into the Hulk again, Banner
may never come back. And we're
stranded on a planet that is
designed to stress me out.

We're not stranded, I'm gonna

Okay, that is so wrong on so

No, she's an evil being.

      while throwing powdered paint at each other... in celebration
      of Hulk! Green EVERYWHERE!

      Inside the parade it is total chaos. Thor searches for Banner
      as he's PELTED with green powder. Pandemonium. In the crowd
      Thor sees a pack of SCRAPPERS on the hunt for the reward.

      Thor spots Banner. He surges forward, GRABS Banner, and
      pulls him into another alley, but sees-

      -Valkyrie is approaching from down the alley!

      Thor pulls Banner back into the crowd. Thor briefly turns to
      see that he is no longer holding Banner's - it's the arm of a
      SMALL ALIEN who squeals in fright.

      Thor sees Banner across the crowd.

      Thor MUSCLES his way through the madness, knocking rowdy fans
      aside. He reaches Banner and holds him protectively,
      awkwardly trying to rub his shoulders.

      One of the aliens Thor knocked aside turns out to be a
      MASSIVE SCRAPPER. He rears up, turning on Thor and Banner.

      WHAM! From out of nowhere, Valkyrie CLOCKS this Scrapper
      with a brass knuckle right cross. The Scrapper DROPS.

      Thor looks at Val while clutching Banner like a child.

           Want to come?

Heimdall is beyond confused, but then... a LOUD NOISE. Hela
looks down to see-

-EMERGING FROM THE THICK LOW-HANGING FOG IS LOKI! Resplendent
in horns, arms spread wide, seeming to float towards the
bridge like a mythical angel of mercy.

                     LOKI
           Your savior is here!

The fog dissipates around him, revealing that Loki's standing
on THE GRANDMASTER'S SUPERCRUISER! For reasons that will
become clear, we will henceforth call this ship THE ARK.

And Loki is not alone. He's brought along all the prisoners
from the Contest of Champions. Armed with gladiator weapons.
The Ark slows to a stop at the middle of bridge.

ABOVE: Even with Hela's hand on his throat, Thor can't help
but smile at the sight of Loki. Hela however sneers.

           Did you miss me?    Everybody on that
           ship, now.

The Asgardian refugees begin POURING onto the ark. The only
way onto the Ark is a narrow plankway, so there is an
immediate bottleneck effect - thousands of frightened people
all pushing for a chance at salvation. It's mayhem.

Loki walks through the crowd to Heimdall.

       bridge right where all the Butchers are coming to life.
       BLASTING AWAY the Butchers before they can get aboard.

       Behind Skurge, the Ark begins to LIFT OFF.

       Butchers, trying to make his way to her.

       Disappointed, Hela FIRES a blade through Skurge's heart.

       Skurge has been killed...

       Hela has Val in her clutches, but her focus is on the
       aftermath of Skurge's last stand and the Ark's subsequent
       escape. She's furious, about to unleash hell when-

                            THOR (O.S.)
                 HELA!   Enough!

       Hela turns to see Thor, having yanked out the harpoon...

       ...and it looks like he's laying down his sword!

                           THOR (CONT'D)
                 You want Asgard? It's yours.

                 No, but he can.

       KA-BOOM! EXPLODING through the roof of the palace is SURTUR!

       This is a different Surtur than the opening. He is slowly
       but steadily GROWING in size, and he carries with him a
       massive flaming sword, which GROWS as well.

       Surtur's arrival literally SHAKES the bedrock of Asgard,
       causing FISSURES to spiderweb all around him, and DISLODGING
       some of the foundation on the bridge and around the palace.

       Hela's eyes go wide. She wasn't expecting this.

       In the background the Ark continues its ascent, now high up
       above the city.

       Hela's attention is on Surtur as the palace COLLAPSES around
       him. So she is unprepared for-

       -SHLNK! Mustering up all her remaining strength, Val DRIVES
       Dragonfang through Hela's chest, effectively PINNING her to
       the bridge.

       Refocused on Val, Hela goes to deliver a death blow when-

       -Thor BOLTS forward!   He PULLS Val from Hela's clutches.

       Thor turns and FIRES LIGHTNING INTO DRAGONFANG, which
       DISLODGES the section of the bridge that Hela is pinned to!

       The ground beneath Hela BREAKS FREE and she goes FALLING down
       into the expanding fissure in Asgard's bedrock.

       Badly injured, Thor and Valkyrie look up to see-

       -Surtur INCREASING in size, now towering over the palace.

                           SURTUR
                 Tremble before me Asgard, for I am

                 So do I, but we have no choice.

       In the background, Hulk hops up onto the bridge.   Looks
       around, zeroing in on Surtur.

                           SURTUR

                No!

      HULK LEAPS UP AND LANDS ONTO SURTUR'S FACE and begins
      POUNDING the fire giant with furious punches!

                           THOR (CONT'D)
                Hulk no!   Stop it you moron!!

      It's not doing much damage, but the shock of it plus Hulk's
      impact makes Surtur take a destructive step back.

      Hulk is trying to rip out one of Surtur's horns when Surtur
      reaches up and GRABS HIM with a giant fiery hand.

      Surtur HURLS Hulk away from him.   Sends him CRASHING DOWN.

      Hulk stumbles to his feet, dazed and SMOKING. After gathering
      his bearings, Hulk gets REALLY ANGRY and heads back towards
      Surtur for round two, but-

                          THOR (CONT'D)
                Hulk, just for once in your life,

      Hulk stops. Looking between Surtur and Thor & Val. This is
      a real Sophie's Choice for Hulk. On the one hand, he really
      wants to kill that thing. On the other hand...

                Friends.

      Hulk PICKS UP Thor and Valkyrie.   He then squats down, and-

      -LEAPS WITH ALL HIS MIGHT! The trio SHOOTS UP into the night
      sky like a rocket blasting off. Their trajectory is heading
      right at the Ark as it reaches the lower orbit of Asgard.

       Thor steps out onto the main deck to see an assembly of both
       Asgardian and Sakaarian refugees awaiting their King.

       Thor looks over his people and begins to walk through the
       crowd. His subjects part, allowing him through.

       It is the antithesis of the opening coronation from the first
       THOR movie. The people aren't cheering and lauding him, but
       rather they are smiling. Humbly bowing. Grateful.

       And Thor isn't acting arrogant. Not trying to show off any
       swagger. He is stately. A contemplative and dignified king.
