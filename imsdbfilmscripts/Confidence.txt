BLACK:
                       JAKE (V.O.)
           So I'm dead...
FADE IN:
EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)
Dumpsters overflow with the day's garbage. A pillar of
steam rises from an underground grate. It's the dark
place between buildings that a reasonable person avoids.
We see JAKE VIG, a guy in his late 20's whose fashionable
suit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the
surroundings-- At first glance, you'd think he could run
for Congress some day.  At first glance.
Jake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees, execution
style. His face gives away nothing-- He could be kneeling
in a strawberry field.
                       JAKE (V.O.)
           And I think it's because of this
           redhead...
                       BUTCH (O.S.)
           Know who I am, Jake?
                       JAKE
           The Anti-Christ?
                       BUTCH (O.S.)
           No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the
           Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy
           looking for some answers.
There's the LOUD UNMISTAKABLE "CLICK" of a gun being
cocked. The barrel of a gun slides gently along Jake's
ear and comes to rest at the base of his skull.
The voice and the gun belong to BUTCH (40's). With his
suit and conservative looks, you'd make him out for a
"Steve" or "Roger" more than a "Butch".
                       BUTCH (cont' d)
           Things are probably going to end badly
           for you, Jake.
                       JAKE
           Gee... What makes you say that?
                       BUTCH
           Your life flashing before your eyes?
                       JAKE
           Just the last three weeks.

             That's not a bad place to start.

EXT . - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT
Title: Three Weeks Ago...
The same alley... The door of a building bursts open as
LIONEL DOLBY (late 40's), dressed in a cheap suit, stumbles
out breathing heavy. The dim light of a bare bulb glares
off the sweat on his forehead.
A moment later, Jake emerges from the same door carrying
a large black revolver.
                         JAKE
             I lost my head. I'm... Sorry.    I don't
             know what happened.
                         LIONEL
             Y-y-you fucking shot him!   That's what
             happened!
                        JAKE
             I had to! That motherfucker was about
             to welch! You saw what he was doing,
             right? You heard him!
Lionel starts shaking his head spastically.
                         LIONEL
             I can't be here! You understand?     I
             can' t--
                         JAKE
             Listen to me! It went to shit.     It
             happens sometimes.
In the distance, A POLICE SIREN WAILS, growing louder.
                         LIONEL
             Oh Jesus!
                         JAKE
             LISTEN to me! We don't have much time.
             We can still get through this but you
             have to keep your head and trust me!
Jake takes a tentative step forward.     Lionel sees a BLOOD
STAIN on Jake's shirt and recoils.
The SIREN GROWS LOUDER, Jake turning his head towards it.




                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                               3.
CONTINUED:
                         LIONEL
             What-- What do we do?
                            JAKE
             Help me.
Jake waves Lionel back through the door they came out of.
                                                           CUT TO:
INT. - THE EUCLID BAR
A dive furnished with a few mismatched chairs and a bar.
A single overweight PATRON sits at a corner table with
face buried in his hands as he WHIMPERS. Jake and, Lionel
Dolby pass him as they emerge from a back hallway.
MILES, late 20's, wipes blood off the bar. Placed at the
edge of the bar are two briefcases, both open, both filled
with neat stacks of blood splattered money.
A DEAD GUY lies face down on the floor in a pool of blood.
Jake grabs the Dead Guy's legs as Lionel watches in
disbelief.
                           JAKE
             Come on.    Grab his arms.
Lionel stands frozen.       Jake, drops the dead guy's legs
with a THUD.
                         JAKE
             Lionel... He's dead. Yeah, maybe you
             didn't pull the trigger, but you were
             standing right there and watched me do
             it. Help me. Grab his arms.
The POLICE SIRENS grow LOUDER.
                            MILES
             Tick-tock...
                         JAKE
             If you wanna help, then help.    If not,
             shut up.
                            MILES
             Your mess.
                         JAKE
             Then shut up.
                            MILES
             My place.



                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                             4.
CONTINUED:
Miles lets out a little chuckle; it's just enough to set
Jake off again.
Jake pulls the gun and points it at Miles.
                            MILES
             Oh please...
Miles non-chalantly pulls a sawed off shot gun frown under
the bar.
                         MILES (cont' d)
             You think this kinda shit hasn't happened
             here before? Given it's usually on
             Thursdays. And usually, I gotta tell
             the cops, "No, Officer... I didn't really
             get a good look at the shooters."
             Usually anyway.
                         PATRON
                 (without looking up)
             I didn't see nothing. And I swear if
             you let me go now, I won't say-
                         JAKE
             Relax, porkchop.
The POLICE SIRENS sound like they're right outside.
                         LIONEL
             I can't be here!
Jake cocks his gun, never taking his stare off Miles.
                            JAKE
             Then go.
Lionel looks at the briefcases of bloodied money.
                         LIONEL
             What about... The money?
                         JAKE
             What about this situation makes you
             think I can answer that question right
             now?
Lionel again looks at the briefcases; then the shotgun
leveled at Jake; then at the direction of the POLICE
SIRENS... He runs for the door without a second thought.
                                                         CUT T0:

                                                             5.


EXT.- THE EUCLID/CITY SIDEWALK- NIGHT
Lionel emerges up the stairs from the basement level bar
to street-level just as a POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a halt
in front of the bar, lights flashing, SIREN WAILING. On
the door is the emblem for the NEW YORK POLICE
DEPARTMENT.
Lionel does his best to look casual as TWO UNIFORMED
OFFICERS jump out of the car and rush the Euclid. One of
the Officers catches Lionel looking over his shoulder.
The last thing Lionel hears before he turns a corner--
                      OFFICER (O.S.)
          Everybody FREEZE!
As soon as he's turned the corner, Lionel breaks into a
full sprint down the street.
                                                         CUT TO:
INT.- THE EUCLID
OFFICER WALTER SOBOZINSKI, a middle aged cop with a couple
of spare tires, stands by the front door with his gun
drawn, in a dramatic stance.
                      SOBOZINSKI
              (yelling)
          I said, freeze you motherfucking,
          cocksucking, scumbags!
The second middle aged cop, OFFICER RICHARD ROTTOVICH
comes calmly down the stairs behind Sobozinski.
                         ROTTOVICH
          We're clear.
Rottovich closes the door and locks it behind him.
                      SOBOZINSKI
              (still yelling)
          Or I'll blow off every one of your
          fucking heads!
Sobozinski lets out a bellowing LAUGH.
We PAN OVER TO REVEAL Jake, Miles and BIG AL (the Patron)
sitting at the bar by the Dead Guy.
                      JAKE
          Stop waving that thing around.
                      MILES
          You sure we're clear?


                                           (CONTINUED)

                         ROTTOVICH
             Guy looked like he was trying not to
             shit himself.
                 (re: the Dead Guy)
             Nice.
                         DEAD GUY
             What took so fucking long?
The Dead Guy stirs-- GORDO, late 20's, dressed in a blood
soaked suit stands up; wiping blood off his face.
                         DEAD GUY/GORDO
             I've been lying in this shit like half
             the night.
                         MILES
             You guys were late.   We had to go to a
             Mexican stand-off.
                         JAKE
             And you know I hate guns.
Jake tosses the revolver on the bar.
                         SOBOZINSKI
             We were fighting crime.
                         MILES
             Keeping the city streets safe for drug
             dealers and pedophiles everywhere.
Jake starts taking    the money out of the briefcases. Gordo
strips out of the    jacket and shirt, revealing a THIN WHITE
VEST. A wire runs     from a battery pack on his belt, up
the center of the    vest, ending at a scorched, bloody,
explosive squib.
Gordo drops the vest along with a plastic bag containing
fake blood. A nasty bruise on his chest marks the spot
where the squib was.
                         GORDO
             Shit.
                         JAKE
             I told you, use less powder.
                         GORDO
             But you won't get that splatter effect.
Jake removes the blood stained bills from the top of the
pile.

                         JAKE
             Then these go into your cut.
Big Al moves over to the bar.
                         BIG AL
             Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to
             play the Inside?
                         JAKE
             Gordo plays the inside.   You're the
             Shill.
                         BIG AL
             Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is
             cry and get insulted.
                         JAKE
             What are you talking about? You should
             get a fucking Academy Award for the
             Shill work you do.
                 (off Al's smile)
             We got it down cold, Al. You don't
             want to jinx it by changing something
             up, do you?
                         BIG AL
             I' m gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want
             eggrolls?
Al slaps Jake on the back and exits.
Jake catches Gordo hawking over his shoulder.
                          JAKE
             What?   I can feel you looking at me.
                         GORDO
             That's a lot of cash. He came up with
             it pretty quick.
                         JAKE
             Probably some investment banker or
             convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did
             you see how fast he ran out of here?
             It's done. He's not coming back.
                         GORDO
             I guess. I gotta drop a dime.    Did
             anybody mess up the hoop?
                           MILES
             It's clean.
Gordo disappears dawn the back hallway.

Jake rubber bands two small wads of cash and hands them
to Rottovich and Sobozinski.
                            JAKE
             Ten percent.
                         SOBOZINSKI
             You guys got sack, I'll give you that
             much.
                            JAKE
             Confidence.     It's just confidence.
Sobozinski and Rottovich head for the door with their
newly padded pockets.
                         ROTTOVICH
                 (patting his pocket)
             Feels a little light, Jake.    Next time
             we're in for twenty.
                          MILES
             Twenty?   My ass!
                         JAKE
             What are you talking about?    Ten's
             standard.
                         ROTTOVICH
             Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
                         SOBOZINSKI
             Do you have any idea what those monks
             charge for that medieval torture?
                         JAKE
             We got a good thing going here. You
             want to blow it over an overbite?
                         ROTTOVICH
             Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you
             boys. You guys are the steadiest
             business in town. But what can I say?
             Twenty percent's still better than
             what we give to any of the other
             criminals.
                         JAKE
             All the shit we pulled with you and
             you're trying to shake us down? You
             guys got sack.
                         ROTTOVICH
             Was that a threat? Did I hear a
             threat?

             next time if we gotta stop and help a
             little old lady cross the street? Well,
             shit... Then we gotta pass the call to

Jake passes a group of well-dressed, well manicured people
waiting in line outside of a trendy bar called "Wax."
Among the hip and well dressed, he seems out of place at
the moment. An outsider.
An attractive blonde in her late twenties, LILY, bumps
into Jake.

She throws Jake a smile he can't but help return. They
stand for a second facing each other before she's whisked
away by an OLDER MAN, dressed in an expensive suit.

EXT.- THE BULLDOG GYM- NIGHT
A neon sign in the shape of a boxing glove tells you what
kind of gym it is.
A police car comes to a stop in front. Rottovich and
Sobozinski in the front seats. Jake gets out of the back.
                         SOBOZINSKI
             The King, huh? Nice going.
                         JAKE
             I try.
                         ROTTOVICH
             Don't dick around too long. And if he
             stabs you or shoots you or causes any
             other form of profuse bleeding, call a
             cab because you are not getting back in
             this car!
Jake nods and approaches the door where Harlin and Lupus
stand vigil. Lupus wears another loud sweatsuit.
                         HARLIN
             We appreciate your punctuality.   Mr.
             King is expecting you.
Jake takes a step towards the door, but is pushed up
against The wall by Lupus who begins to roughly pat Jake
down.
                         HARLIN
             Lupus!
                        LUPUS
             What? You said pat him down, I'm pattin'
             him down.
Harlin shakes his head and pushes Lupus out of the way.

Jake steps back and raises his arms.

A huge room filled with steam. Harlin and Lupus stand by
the door as Jake cautiously steps in. NEW AGE MUSIC is

Sitting in a lounge chair, wearing a white terry cloth
robe is THE KING PIN. His large body is less fat than
just big, constructed of circles and topped off with the
baldest head you've ever seen.
A MANICURIST sits next to the King Pin working on his
nails.

             You know, back in the day, grafting was

The King begins to gently trace between Jake's fingers
with the nail file.
Jake remains rigid against Lupus and Harlin as the nail
file scrapes along the soft, fleshy webbing between his
fingers.
Jake shuts his eyes... Then opens them to find the King
now gently stroking his hands-- Almost a loving caress.

             you carry around drugs for him. We're
             going to have to take them.
The Kid hesitates for a second before handing the knapsack
over. Rottovich opens it and pulls out TWO BRICKS OF
HEROIN, wrapped in plastic. He nods to Sobozinski.
The Kid stays rooted right where he is, looking up at the
Detectives like a lost puppy.
                         KID
             My Pops is going to be mad.

             Give the kid a twenty.
Sobozinski fishes in his pocket starts to peel off bills
for the kid who then sprints away.

             First thing about being on the grift....
             You're only as good as your Mark. The
             Roper's the guy who finds them.
Jake buys another round to the indifferent Slick.

             They all have money one way or

             There's that saying-- Show me an honest

             of bad no matter how much good. It's
             that little itch on the back of you

The Fat Texan MORPHS into a WALL STREET-type suit, who

             No one gets hurt. And here's the guy

Gordo approaches, dressed in a suit and looking slightly

             'you' re the suspicious type . So I

Gordo pulls an envelope out of his coat and gives it to
Dolby.

             Just enough that when I tell you we can
             make more off of it, you agree.
Jake speaks quickly to Dolby who nods emphatically.    He
hands the envelope back to Gordo.

          the job.
                      LILY
          Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find
          that bridge to jump off.
Jake catches up and blocks Lily's way.
                      JAKE
          We had to see what your deal was.      I'm
          just a little superstitious.
                      LILY
          Here's my deal-- Don't waste my time.
          What do you want me for anyway? You
          don't even know me.
                      JAKE
          I just have a good feeling about you.
          Haven't you ever had someone say they
          had a good feeling about you before?
Lily studies Jake's face for any hint of sarcasm.      None.
                         LILY
          No.
              (beat)
          What's my cut?
                      JAKE
          You get an equal cut.

          What do I have to do?
                      JAKE
          Just play a part.     A little acting.
Lily steps back and hails a cab.
                         LILY
          Make a wish.
She points to a large digital clock hanging in a store
window reading "11:11p".

          Eleven-eleven. If you're superstitious,
          make a wish.

             Gentlemen?   Special Agent Gunther Moonan.
Moonan quickly flashes a badge and his best Kodak smile.
                         ROTTOVICH
             Special Agent?
                         MOONAN
             You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And
             this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski.
             I'm looking for Jake Vig.
                          SOBOZINSKI
             Who?
                         MOONAN
             I've been looking for this Jake Vig for
             some time now. Problem is, the guy's
             the invisible man. A spook, a spectre,
             a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's
             good buddy and member of his crew,
             Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day
             with a hole in his head.

             Preliminary forensics suggests he was.
             Sitting there, bloated and purple in
             his egg foo young for at least seventy
             two hours. Alfonse was not a small man
             and there was a lot of food ordered, so
             you can imagine the smell. Bad for the
             neighbors, good for me because in all
             the time I've been looking for Jake,
             this is only the second time I've even
             gotten a whiff of him.
                         ROTTOVICH
             Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't
             know what you're talking about.
Moonan takes out a microcassette recorder and hits PLAY.
                         ROTTOVICH
                 (V.O. from tape)
             Don't be an idiot. How hard do you
             think it is to sell one drug dealer's
             drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's
             right, we might be looking at a
             hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand.
CLICK.   Moonan kills the recorder.
                         MOONAN
             Oh yeah, I almost forgot. The two
             serious looking gentlemen outside?
             Internal Affairs.
The Officers look out the window to see TWO SERIOUS LOOKING
MEN in suits.

             Do you want to know the first time I
             had a line on Vig? He sent me a
             birthday card.
                 (off their silence)
             Belated, but it's the thought, right?
             Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor.
             But, then again you guys probably know
             him better than I do. In fact, I've
             only met the guy once. But now, now I
             have you. The next best thing. His
             partners. His "Fix."

             You help me catch him. Whatever he's
             into next, I want you to be into. And
             what you're into, I'm into. If it all
             goes well, those two guys from IAD will
             never have to hear this tape. I'll
             clear you guys of anything you've ever
             done with Vig under the guise of some
             cross-departmental investigation. This
             prick's been on the wish list for so
             long, you'll probably get gold shields

             What do you get out of it?
                         MOONAN
             Peace of mind.

             That's it?

             Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
                         ROTTOVICH
             If you Feds are so hot for him, why
             don't we just bring him in right now?
                         MOONAN
             I want him for something big and to do
             that, we have to catch him in the act.
                         SOBOZINSKI
             This guy must have been a real pain in
             your dick.
                         MOONAN
             Literally. It's not a bad deal,
             gentleman. I get peace of mind. You
             get Detective Sheilds. But this is the
             best part, Walter... Walter, your
             daughter will get to keep her braces
             and have that winning smile. Capice?
Rottovich and Sobozinski remain silent.
                         MOONAN
             Good. One more thing... You gotta give
             up the booty. I can't have you guys

             Take a deep breath. You sound like you

Jake rolls his eyes as Lily glares at him.

King Pin eyes Jake suspiciously for a second.

A few of the BOXERS training around stop and turn.          The
King Pin lowers a glare at Jake.
                         KING PIN
             Take off your shirt.
Jake looks behind him to see Harlin looming.

A few more BOXERS stop and turn. Jake notices he's being

             Fine. You want me to take it off, I'll
             take it off.
Jake unbuttons his shirt and stands in front of the King
Pin, arms crossed. It's getting weird.
                         KING PIN
             Look at you, you skinny prick.

The King smiles and begins to take off his shirt.       Harlin
and Lupus share an uncomfortable glance.
The King strips down to the waist and reveals an incredibly
large, incredibly round stomach which he SLAPS loudly.
                          KING PIN
             Come here.   Feel this.

The King grabs Jake's hand and puts it on his stomach.
It just got weirder.
Now the whole gym has stopped, everyone focused on Jake

             Punch it.
                         JAKE
             I am not going--
The King starts to get that look again.
Jake winds up and punches the King in the stomach.           He
shakes his fist in pain.
                           KING PIN
             Come on.    Harder.
                         JAKE

                           KING PIN
             Harder.    Remember, I killed your buddy.
Jake's demeanor changes as he winds up and hits the King
as hard as he can. The King just smiles.
                           KING PIN (cont'd)
             All muscle.
The King then hits Jake back in the gut with surprising
speed. Jake falls to his knees, but the King's right
there. With one arm he pulls Jake up and starts to pummel
him in the stomach with an unbridled visciousness.
Jake spits up blood as the King hurls him face first into
the ring.

             Maybe it's true. Maybe you can't cheat

             fifty you're in the hole and consider
             the juice running. Now go make me proud.
Harlin and Lupus lift Jake up.        Lily looks at Jake with a
pained expression.

                         FRANKIE
             Last of the red hot grifters.
Suits grabs Jake with a hug.     It's a heartfelt one.

             running fight stores and the wire with
             a Fix so tight it was like a legit
             business. I never understood what the

Mr. Lewis seems to search for second, then extends his
hand more in an effort not to appear rude.

             Of course.   Jake. Nice to see you.

             You   know, this is kind of embarassing,
             but   my wallet was stolen yesterday and
             I'm   afraid the ticket was in it. But
             the   name's Pearson.
                         MR. LEWIS
             While you're back there, could you make
             sure that Carolyn is spelled with a
             "y"?
The Salesgirl nods and disappears again.
                         MR. LEWIS (cont'd)
             What brings you down from Boston, Jake?
             Taking advantage of the long weekend?
                         JAKE
             My wife and I are just taking a little
             vacation.
Behind his back, Jake discreetly waves Lily over.
                         MR. LEWTS
             Carolyn's down this weekend too.
Lily approaches. When she does, Jake pulls her close and
gives her a loving kiss on the lips. It throws Lily for
a second.
                         LILY
             Uh... Everything okay?
                         JAKE
             Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn
             Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my
             wife, Lily.
Lily and Mr. Lewis exchange handshakes.
                         JAKE
             I'm sorry, honey.    I'm almost done.
Jake taps Lily on the back with the hand wrapped around
her waist.
                           LILY
             It's okay.    I'll be looking for
             earrings.
Jake gives Lily another kiss before she leaves.
                         MR. LEWIS
             Attractive girl.

             Thank you.    Actually, it's our first
             anniversary   this weekend. She thinks
             I'm here to   pick up something for my
             mother, but   it's actually a gift for
             her. Think    I've fooled her?
                         MR. LEWIS
             Take it from me, you never do. But
             congratulations. Nice to be married,
             isn't it?
                         JAKE
             Very much so.
Jake smiles ear to ear, like the happy newlywed he's
pretending to be. The Salesgirl returns.
                         SALESGIRL
             We have Carolyn with a "y". I'm sorry,
             there's nothing under Pearson. If we
             had an invoice number--
Jake's smile dissolves as he grows a little anxious.
                         JAKE
             I told you. My wallet was stolen.
             Please... Check again.
Jake takes a nervous look over at Lily, who is drying on
earrings with another Salesperson.
                           MR. LEWIS
             Good luck.    Congratulations again.
He and Jake shake hands.
                         JAKE
             Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this
             isn't too much of an inconvenience, but
             if Carolyn is coming down for the
             weekend, perhaps I could give you
             something for her? It's a check. We
             split the cost on a few books and I
             haven't had the chance to pay her back
             yet. Could you..?
                           MR. LEWIS
             Sure.
Jake pulls out a checkbook and pen.
                         JAKE
                 (writing)
             That'd be a great help.

Jake quickley scans the jewelry in the glass case.
                         JAKE
             A ring for my wife. Alot like that
             one. In fact, it was that one.
                         SALESGIRL

Jake stops writing on the check and locks up.

             The thing is... It's our first

             the weekend. It's a very, very special
             night for my wife and I. This ring is
             my gift to her and I think she's going
             to really love it. I can give you

          You have no idea what you've done do
          you? No idea! What is this?
Jake points to her hair.
                      LILY
          You told me to change my hair!
                      JAKE
              (re: the shirt)
          What about this? Do you have any idea
          what this means? You've killed us.
          We're dead!
                      LILY
          Did I miss something?
                      GORDO
          The red hair... It's bad luck.
                      MILES
          It's not like she's a real redhead,
          Jake...
                      JAKE
          Like that matters! You can't fool bad
          luck! You can't get by on a
          technicality! You can't trick karma!
Lily grabs her jacket and starts out the door, then turns
back around to Jake.

Silence.   Jake can feel the eyes on him.
                         JAKE
             Anybody says a word I swear to God...
Jake takes off after her.

EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)
Butch cracks a big smile.
                         BUTCH
             She had you tempting fate.
                         JAKE
             My father used to play the same fucking
             lotto numbers with these other guys in
             the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday
             for sixteen years. One day he gets
             pissed off, tells them he's out and
             plays his own numbers. They hit the
             Lucky Seven for one point two million.
LILY steps out from behind Butch.
                         LILY
             Guess he passed on that unlucky-
             asshole gene.
Lily looks down at Jake and the gun pointed at his head.
There's not even a hint of sympathy.
                         LILY
             You should have trusted me Jake.

Jake turns and looks at the crew, Miles, Gordo, Lupus and
Lily behind him.
Grant Ashby sits alone at the crowded bar, doing his
crossword puzzle.
Jake a smile and saunters over to the bar.
                         GORDO
             She up for this?

ANGLE ON ASHBY AT THE BAR
Ashby sits finishing a drink. Snippets of CONVERSATION
and LAUGHTER from the cliques around him catch his
attention, but he remains alone.
                         BLONDE (O.S.)
             Is this seat taken?
Ashby turns to see an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE pointing to the
empty seat next to him.
                         ASHBY
                 (brightening)
             Uh, no. Please.
                           BLONDE
             Thanks.
The Blonde grabs the barstool and starts to walk off with
it. A rejected look from Ashby.
                         LILY (O.S.)
             Sorry I'm late.
Lily appears next to the Blonde.       Ashby looks around to
make sure she's talking to him.
                         LILY
             But I'm not that late.    You didn't have
             to give away my seat.
                         ASHBY
                 (getting it)
             I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
                         BLONDE
             Oh, I didn't know you... Here.    Sorry.
Lily takes the barstool back.
                           LILY
             No problem.
The blonde woman leaves as Lily sits down next to Ashby.
                         LILY
             Thanks for playing along.    I just have
             to sit for a while.
                           ASHBY
             Tough day?

             Brutal day. They say the streets are
             lined with money down here, but I guess
             you have to know the secret handshake.
             What are you drinking?
                         ASHBY
             Uh, Maker's Mark.      Rocks.
Lily signals the BARTENDER for two more drinks.
                         ASHBY
             My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
                        LILY
             Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude.
             Lily. Lily Finn.
They shake, Ashby's demeanor brightening again.
                         ASHBY
             So, what do you do?
                         LILY
             It's more like what aren't I doing.        My
             partners and I are trying to secure
             start up capital for a small tech
             company. We tried the venture
             capitalist route in the Valley, but
             then again who hasn't up there.
                         ASHBY
             Silicon Valley?
                         LILY
             That's right. So, brainiacs that we
             are, we thought we'd be innovative and
             relocate east. Try our luck with a
             straight corporate loan out here.
The drinks arrive.       Lily hands the bartender a twenty.
                            ASHBY
             I can---
                            LILY
             On me.     For the seat.   Cheers.
She flashes a trademark smile as they CLINK glasses.
                         LILY
             So we've been meeting with banks all
             day. It's amazing how many ways they
             can say "no" without ever using the
             word.

             Well, typically, corporate loans are
             relatively simple matters, but you do
             need to demonstrate a capacity for gross
             fund recovery.
Lily arches an eyebrow at Ashby.
                         LILY
             Don't tell me you started a tech firm
             here before us.
                          ASHBY
             No, no.   Nothing like that.   I work in
             a bank.
                          LILY
                  (leaning in)
             Really? Wish we had met eight hours
             ago.
Ashby nods and shyly looks away. He could be blushing.
Lily lets the moment play out for a beat before looking
over her shoulder.
                         LILY
                 (getting up)
             My partners are here.
Ashby reverts back to schlub mode.
                          ASHBY
             Oh.   Well, thanks for the drink.
                         LILY
             You're welcome. I was just going to

INT.- THE BULL AND THE BEAR PUB/TABLE- LATER
Ashby sits with the crew, a few empty glasses in front of
him. He looks remarkably relaxed, just another guy hanging
around with a group of friends.
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             She got one leg out from under him.
             Now we had to lean.

                      GORDO
          So then Miles walks straight into the
          Creative Director's office and says
          "The code's fine, the program's for
          shit" and throws down like a thousand
          pages of code on the guy's desk!
They all break out into LAUGHTER.
                      JAKE
          So this is our boss, right? He chases
          me and Miles out of his office and
          he's yelling and screaming, "You're
          fired! Your whole team's fired!" He
          starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo--
                      MILES
          But the best part was that he couldn't
          find Gordo! He was in the bathroom.
          So he finally goes in there, kicks in a
          stall door and starts yelling! And
          there's Gordo, pants at the ankles,
          holding a PC World Magazine!
More LAUGHS.
                      GORDO
          I haven't been able to use a public
          bathroom since.
                      LUPUS
          Especially with the thing!
Lupus's non-sequitur brings the whole rhythm of the
conversation to a grinding halt.
                      JAKE
          Uh, right... And that was it. That's
          when we decided to start our own
          business. No more shithead bosses.
                      ASHSY
          I envy you guys. Taking a chance like
          that.

Lupus casually punches Ashby in the arm. It's meant to
be a friendly tap, but it's hard enough to jerk Ashby's

             Right. The guys who started that did
             what a lot of companies in the Valley
             do. They get a good idea, shop it
             around, raise some capital, then sell
             it off to a bigger company. Microsoft,
             Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of
             it is, they've pretty much sold the
             company before they're even real. The
             bigger company is already set to buy
             it, all they want to do is make sure
             that the idea actually works. So they
             get some start up capital, make it work,
             then sell it for like five times the
             initial loan.

             Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you
             can't tell anyone about the offer,
             because if it's public, you could start
             a bidding war and that's considered a
             breach of etiquette. It could kill a
             deal. But, wait too long and you're

             cutting someone in on the action if
             it'd help.
Ashby considers for a moment.
                         ASHBY
             Should we get another round?
Jake and Lily share an almost imperceptible look.

TNT.- CITY STREET- NIGHT
Jake, Lupus, Miles, Gordo and Lily walking, still on a
celebratory high.
                      GORDO
          Poor bastard never knew what hit him.
          Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
                      MILES
          I gotta work off some of this
          adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn
          Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody
          want in?
                      LILY
          I' m going home
                      GORDO
          Let's go, Jake?
                      JAKE
          Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the
          way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar
          pay-off.
                       GORDO
          You sure?
Jake looks over at. Lily then nods.      Gordo, Miles and
Lupus start to head off.
                       JAKE
          Lupus!
Lupus turns and Jake moves closer.
                      JAKE (cont'd)
          When this is all over, you're going to
          tell me who the King put on Al.

          You going to have the time?
                      JAKE
          I'11 find the time.
Lupus nods and heads off.     Jake watches them go.
                      LILY
          Look at you... You want to go.
                       JAKE
          For what?   A couple hundred bucks?

             I think you'd do it for free. You' re

                         JAKE

             Not in that repressed anger sort of
             way.
                         LILY
             I'm your basic underachiever. Can't
             stand working and porn doesn't seem
             like a good option.
                         JAKE
             Good quality porn has it's place in the
             world.

             Whatever. But you... I get the feeling
             you could have bullshitted your way
             into anything. So why this?
                         JAKE
             I'm good at it. Lying, cheating.

Illuminated only by the light coming from the windows...
Jake runs a hand down the length of Lily's bare back.
She falls onto him, both of them hitting the bed locked
in a deep kiss.
Lily's hand moves down Jake's arm until it finds his hand.
                         LILY
             You have really soft hands.    Like a
             baby's.

                 (remembering the King)
             Don't ruin this for me.
They roll off the bed onto the floor, a naked tangle of
arms and legs, their hands still entwined.

Jake takes a deep breath, Butch and Lily behind him.

             Is that what it was, Jake?    Was it
             love?

             You know when the first con was ever

Lily looks away, her face softening for a moment.
                         JAKE
             Then she fucked him over with an apple.

INT . - LILY'S APARTMENT--DAY
Not even the soft morning light can diffuse the reality
of this slum-pit studio apartment.
Jake lies next to Lily, kissing her neck. A spoon
RATTLES in a glass from the growing RUMBLE of a passing
subway train. The RUMBLE rises to an almost deafening
volume.
Jake's a little alarmed.   Lily, oblivious.
                       JAKE
              (drowned out by the
               rumble)
          How do you deal with---
                      LILY
              (yelling)
          WHAT?

          SAID, HOW DO--
              (the subway passes)
          Deal with that?
Lily shrugs indifferently.
                      LILY
          Do you think we can do it?
Jake resumes kissing Lily's neck, trying to rekindle some
of last night's magic.
                     JAKE
          Maybe. Even if we don't, you'll be
          alright. You're not in the hole with
          the King.
Lily rolls away from Jake.   Undaunted, Jake starts kissing
her back.
                      LILY
          Who says you have to know the King to
          be in a whole? I actually did have a
          real job once. When I was in high
          school, I worked as a candy striper.
                      JAKE
          Sounds respectable.
                      LILY
          Not the way I did it. I was loaded
          half the time. I don't know how you
          could change bedpans sober.

             something.
                         JAKE
             You want to talk about an old
             boyfriend right now?
Jake, kissing up the length of Lily's neck.
                         LILY
             He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a
             boyfriend at the time... What was his
             name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty.
             I was only fifteen. But he was a nice
             guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We
             used to get loaded on pills from the
             nurses station and then listen to
             Morrisey or some stupid shit like
             that.
                         JAKE
             Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never
             worked for me.
                         LILY
             We were friends. I trusted him. I
             should have known it was weird. But,
             then again I was weird.
                         JAKE
             You guys got busted.   This is a great
             neck.
Jake still kissing...
                         LILY
             No, we never got busted. We were done
             with a shift one night, both a couple
             of Percocets down and I was telling
             Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we
             were thinking about doing it, you know?
             I was thinking about letting him be my
             first because I loved him.
                 (pause)
             What the hell was his name?
                         JAKE
             Glenn talked you out of it.
                         LILY
             Sort of. I was telling him about this
             great love of my life who's name I don't
             remember, and I could see... He was
             getting pissed. I thought it was just
             because he was worried about me, but...

             He told me that I was stupid because
             my boyfriend didn't really love me.
Jake grabs Lily and rolls her over onto her back.     He
climbs on top of her.
                         JAKE
             He was looking out for you.
                         LILY
             Then he grabbed me and threw me down
             on the floor, that really cold
             linoleum tiled hospital floor and
             started ripping my uniform off.
                 (pause)
             He said he was going to "fuck some
             sense into me."
Jake stops kissing Lily and looks up at her.
                         LILY
             Shit, what was that guy's name?   I really
             liked him.
                         JAKE
             Lily... Jesus Christ...
                         LILY
             After Glenn was finished, he gave me a
             couple of valiums and I went home. The
             next day, I finished my shift and met
             him around back, like we always did. I
             stuck a number eight scalpel into his
             chest. Three or four times.
Jake slides off Lily.
                         JAKE
             Did, uh... Did you kill him?
                         LILY
             I don't know. I packed up my shit and
             ran away. To this... So unlike you, I
             guess I do have something to prove, in
             a repressed anger sort of way.
Jake considers for a second.
                         JAKE
             No. You trusted him... You were just
             getting square.
                         LILY
             You know why I told you that, Jake?
                 (turning towards him)
             Because I trust you too.

They pass the glass partitioned conference room. Jake
looks inside to see Morgan Gillette holding court with a
bunch of SUITS. Butch stands behind Gillette.
For a second, Butch and Jake's eyes meet.

Jake, Lily, Miles, Gordo and Lupus... As they move through
the crowded sidewalk, Rottovich and Sobozinski appear
behind them.
                         ROTTOVICH
             Hey Jake.
Jake turns just in time to catch Rottovich's fist square
in the face.
Jake staggers back and Sobozinski pushes him into an
alley.
                         JAKE
             That tip not work-out for you fellas?
                         ROTTOVICH
             Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little
             more curious about the Fed.
                         JAKE
             Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay
             your taxes, that's your business.
Sobozinski punches Jake in the stomach.    Miles and Gordo
lurch forward--

                 (pulling his gun)
             Back up.

                         ROTTOVICH
             Ring it for him, Sobo.
Sobozinski punches Jake again.
                           JAKE
             Oh yeah.    Moonan.   I remember now.
             Thanks.
                           ROTTOVICH
             Well he's   in town and he sure as shit
             remembers   you. What are we going to do
             about this   Jake? We can't afford to
             have a Fed   onto us.
                         JAKE
             Wouldn't dream of it.
Rottovich punches Jake hard in the stomach, sending him
GASPING to the ground.
                         ROTTOVICH
             I don't know what you're into with the
             King Pin, but whatever it is we get a
             piece, understand? We get a big piece.
             If we find out you're keeping us out, I
             may suddenly develope a conscious and
             give you up to Moonan myself. Say
             something stupid if we got a deal,
             Jake.
                         JAKE
                 (gasping for breath)
             Something stupid.
                           ROTTOVICH
             Good boy.
                         SOBOZINSKI
             And don't leave town!
                 (to Rottovich)
             I always wanted to say that...
As the cops exit, Lily, Miles and Gordo rush to Jake.

In the back, Moonan sits reading the Travel section of

             Did he buy it?
                           ROTTOVICH
             I think so.    What'd he ever do to you
             anyway?
                         MOONAN
             Let's just say he burned me once.
Moonan calmly turns the page of the paper.
                         LUPUS (V.O.)

             About four years ago, we were working

             goon.

INT.-- RACETRACK- DAY
Gordo, Miles, Big A1 and Jake watch the race with
indifference, surrounded by excited SPECTATORS.
                      JAKE (V.O.)
          Turns out this local goon was being
          watched by the Feds, which means we
          were being watched by the Feds. One in
          particular.
Through the crowd, we catch a glimpse of Moonan, in
sunglasses, watching the guys.
                      JAKE (V.O.)
          Special Agent Gunther Moonan.
Jake turns and catches Moonan looking at him.

          He didn't really have anything on us,
          but I figure, maybe this guy's good
          for a Fix. So I ask him out to dinner.
Moonan pulls a piece of paper off the windshield that
reads: "La Scala 2night."

An elegant restaurant. Jake sits confidently in an
expensive suit speaking to the shabbily dressed Moonan
across from him.

          These guys we have now, sure, give
          them twenty bucks and they'll look the
          other way on a parking ticket. But a
          Fed... You get a guy like that as your
          Fix...
Jake nonchalantly slides a fat envelope over to Moonan.
Moonan picks it up and finds a wad of cash.
                      JAKE (V.O.)
          It was probably a stupid idea. There I

As Moonan stands, we see Big Al get up from the next table.
A1 "bumps" into Gordo, dressed in a waiter's white jacket.
Gordo "trips;" spilling scalding hot coffee into Moonan's

Jake casually gets up and leaves.
FREEZE FRAME ON MOONAN'S CONTORTED FACE.

Jake stops and levels a look at Lily.

             So there it is. You got that big itch
             you need to scratch. It's all about

             an apology?

             You, so take a deep breath and count to
             ten. There is no cut.
Lily levels a look of utter contempt at Jake.

             You're an asshole.
With that, she grabs her coat and leaves.

Lily frantically rumages through drawers. She pulls a

Lily moves to the door and looks out the peep hole.

Another KNOCK. Lily slowly reaches for the doorknob.
Then the door flies open with a CRASH. Harlin fills the
doorway.
                         HARLIN
             The King would like to have a word
             with you.

             Please.    I have a car waiting.
Lily takes a swing.      Harlin easily grabs the bat and
backhands Lily. She      goes flying back into the far wall,
bounces off and lands     with a THUD at Harlin's feet where
she finds the butter     knife.
Harlin reaches down and pulls Lily up by the hair.            The
egg SIZZLES in the pan.
Lily takes a stab at Harlin, but the knife just bounces
off his coat. Harlin slaps Lily again, sending her flying
into the stove. Smoke starts to rise from the burning
egg.
Harlin steps closer, but Lily throws her hands up in
surrender.
A spoon RATTLES in a cup as the RUMBLE of a subway train
grows LOUDER.

             No problem.
She grabs the smoking pan from the stove and WHACKS Harlin
across the head. The burned egg lands on the floor.
Lily watches as he sways and teeters on his feet, like a
drunk. She raises the pan again... But before she
delivers the final blow, Harlin steps on the egg, causing
his leg to shoot out from under him. He lands flat on
his back, out cold. The wood floor CREAKS with his weight.
Lily wipes the blood from her nose and turns the hot
plate off.

             Have a   little faith in him, honey.
             Butch,   see if you can get him to tell
             you how   he did it. Or almost did it.
             Sounds   like a good story.

A few TRAVELERS quickly move past the desk.    Gordo
approaches a CUSTOMS OFFICER.
Gordo lays the suitcase on the desk: The Customs Officer
looks nervously in both directions before waving Gordo

Lupus nods, satisfied.
                                                         CUT TO:
(FLASHBACK) INT.- CUSTOMS DESK
Gordo hoists the suitcase onto the desk. The Customs
Officer looks around nervously. We see he's looking at
Moonan in the B.G., who gives him a nod.
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             Like Suits said, sooner or later
             someone's going to start asking the
             right questions.
The Custom Officer waves Gordo through. Gordo reaches
down and picks up an IDENTICAL BLACK suitcase already
lying on the table next to his and leaves.
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             Rottovich and Sobozinski would ask how
             the drugs got in that suitcase. The
             King and Gillette would ask where the
             money really went.
Moonan walks over to the Customs Desk and takes the
original black suitcase. He nods to the Customs Officer.
Moonan turns and walks TOWARDS CAMERA, wheeling the
suitcase behind him.
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             And all of them would ask what agency
             Special Agent Gunther Moonan worked
             for.
We CLOSE-IN ON THE BADGE hanging from Moonan's neck.     On
it is a number and the single word, "CUSTOMS".
                                                         CUT TO:
EXT. BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)
RIPPING SOUNDS...
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             But what do I care? I'm dead...
A THIN, WHITE VEST, splattered with blood and wired with
squibs falls to the ground.
POLICE SIRENS WAIL just around the corner.
                                                         CUT TO:

Jake emerges from .the back alley, his shirt ripped and
splattered with fake blood.
                         JAKE (V.O.)
             No one's going to ask me:
A black car comes to a stop n front of him.    The tinted
glass slides down and Jake leans in.
                         JAKE
             Drop something?
Inside we see Moonan and Lily riding in the back, Miles
and Gordo up front.
                         LILY
                 (innocently)
             Oops.
She smiles that smile.
                           JAKE (V.O.)
             Redheads...
Jake gets in and the car pulls away, followed seconds
later by two Police Cars SCREECHING to a stop in front of
the Euclid.
                                               FADE TO BLACK:
                                    THE END.
