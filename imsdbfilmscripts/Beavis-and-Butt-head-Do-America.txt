	"BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA"
	
	by
	
	Mike Judge and Joe Stillman
	
	
	
	
		The movie begins with scenes of people screaming in horror 
	and running down the streets of a big city. The ground shakes from 
	what seems like giant footsteps. There are pieces of building 
	debris falling everywhere, people getting crushed, power lines 
	coming down, etc. - complete pandemonium. It all looks very much 
	like a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie. We hear the 
	footsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more 
	intense - more debris falling. Then we see a HUGE BLACK TENNIS 
	SHOE come into frame and smash a National Guard truck. As we pan 
	up, we see the white socks, then the red shorts, the AC/DC T-
	shirt, then we hear the familiar, "Huh huh huh." - only it's a 
	huge sound...this is a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT TALL BUTT-HEAD. "Butt-
	Kong" continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and 
	buildings and saying, "This is cool. Huh huh huh."
		Airplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong). 
	He looks irritated and says, "Cut it out butt-munch!" Butt-Head 
	swats at the planes, sending them crashing to the ground and 
	stomps on the tanks. Then, something catches his eye. Butt-Head 
	reaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a 
	lot like the one from the King Kong movie. He looks down at her in 
	his hand and goes wide-eyed, "Whoa! Huh huh huh." The woman 
	screams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few 
	lame pick up lines. "Uuuuh...Hey baby. I'm like, pretty tall. Huh 
	huh huh." He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head, 
	"Dammit, I'm trying to score!" The helicopter goes down in flames. 
	We CUT TO some guys sitting on a tank firing at him. They notice 
	giant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank 
	around. Through their binoculars we see a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT 
	BEAVIS coming from the horizon. The giant Beavis is even more 
	destructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire). 
	Beavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Head's woman. Butt-Head 
	puts the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it, leveling 
	the city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights.
		We CROSS-DISSOLVE from three-hundred foot Beavis shaking 
	Butt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking 
	him.
	
	
	INT.  B&B'S HOME - DAY
	
	
					BEAVIS (O.C.)
			Butt-Head! Butt-Head! Hey, Butt-Head!
	
	Butt-Head is dead asleep on the couch. Beavis shakes him.
	
					BEAVIS
			Butt-Head, wake up, wake up!
	
	Butt-Head comes around.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score.
			Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			What's gone?
	
					BEAVIS
			The TV.
	
	Beavis is making STRANGE NOISES, in a state of shock.
	
	Butt-Head rubs his eyes and looks at the empty space where the TV 
	was.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uuuuuuh, huh huh. Uuh,...
	
	Out the window, we see two YOUNG MEN carrying B&B's TV into their 
	van.
	
	Still on the couch, Butt-Head looks over at the broken window. We 
	see a CROWBAR lying on the floor, and the front door left open.
	
	Butt-Head looks at the BROKEN WINDOW, at the CROWBAR, the OPEN 
	DOOR, then back at the EMPTY SPACE where the TV was. He does this 
	a couple of times - piecing it all together.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
			Whoa! I think I just figured something
			out Beavis.
	
					BEAVIS
			What?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This sucks.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh.
	
	Beavis is still in shock. They both stare at the empty space where 
	the TV was for a beat, not quite sure what to do.
	
	Beavis is SHAKING AND MAKING WEIRD NOISES. He presses buttons on 
	the remote a few times, as if it might help somehow.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This sucks more than anything that
			has ever sucked before. We must find
			this butt-hole that took the TV.
	
	
	EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT
	
	Bad neighborhood. 70's music blares.
	
	A fast driving car drives right at us and stops. Punks run in 
	fear. Beavis hops out of the driver's seat, wearing bell-bottoms, 
	chain jewelry and a 70's afro. Into a dramatic CLOSE-UP, he takes 
	off his glasses.
	
	FREEZE ON BEAVIS
	
					ANNOUNCER
			Beavis!
	
	FRAME UNFREEZES. Beavis whips out a huge gun.
	
					BEAVIS
			Freeze, butt-wipe!
	
	An attacker comes from one side. Beavis uses Judo. Another tosses 
	a knife. Beavis ducks, then shoots with two hands, police style.
	
	
	INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Swinger's pad. Totally 70's. A group of bikini'd girls on a 
	waterbed. Butt-Head approaches them. He wears a leisure suit, 
	collar way open. He plops down in the bed.
	
	FREEZE ON BUTT-HEAD
	
					ANNOUNCER
			Butt-Head!
	
	FRAME UNFREEZES. The girls wrap their arms around him.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. Come to Butt-Head, baby.
	
					ANNOUNCER
			Star in...
	
	
	MAIN TITLE - FULL FRAME
	
	
	EXT.  CITY STREETS - DAY/NIGHT
	
	ACTION MONTAGE BEGINS. Styled like a 70's cop show opening.
	
	OPENING CREDITS to the movie appear just as cop show credits 
	would.
	
	Beavis does a Starsky and Hutch-style roll with a gun.
	
	Butt-Head slaps a pimp.
	
	Beavis drives, chasing a car.
	
	Butt-Head is slapped by a girl.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
	Beavis and Butt-Head are in a warehouse shoot-out.
	
	A black police chief rises from a desk to yell at B&B.
	
	B&B dive for cover just before a building explodes.
	
	In CLOSE-UP, Beavis smiles for an ID shot.
	
	Butt-Head does the same.
	
	Beavis, in a rooftop fight, kicks his opponent over the edge.
	
	A beautiful woman, back to us, takes off her dress for Butt-Head. 
	FINAL OPENING CREDIT APPEARS. Butt-Head and the woman fall into 
	bed. Suddenly...
	
	
	INT.  SCHOOL HALLWAY/DOOR TO A.V. ROOM - DAY
	
	From inside, SOUND of equipment crashing.
	
	B&B come out wheeling a TV on one of those carts. There are cables 
	attached to it still leading back into the A.V. room. As they push 
	the cart we hear more equipment falling.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Dammit, it's stuck.
	
	They give it one big push and it finally breaks free. We see that 
	the cables are tangled with cables from other TVs and VCRs, which 
	all come crashing to the ground.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this
			thing back to the house.
	
	
	INT.  SCHOOL/ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY
	
	MR. VAN DRIESSEN stops B&B.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			Ah, excuse me boys. What's going on
			here?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, someone stole our TV.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah. We're just gonna use this one.
			Get outta the way. Heh heh.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			I'm afraid that TV belongs to the school.
			Mmmkay? You know, this could be a positive
			experience for you guys. There's a
			wonderful world out there when we discover
			we don't need TV to entertain us.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
	
					BEAVIS
					(to himself)
			Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh 
			heh. Anus. Heh heh.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
					(frustrated)
			Have you guys heard a word I've said?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Yeah, "anus." Huh huh huh huh.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			Look, guys, just take the TV back to the
			A.V. room right now. And try to be a little
			more open-minded. Mmkay?
	
	Van Driessen leaves. B&B continue to wheel the cart home.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			What a dork. Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
	
	
	EXT.  SCHOOL/STAIRWAY - DAY
	
	B&B arrive with the cart at the top of a stairway. They lamely 
	attempt to let it slowly down the steps. The cart is too top-heavy 
	and goes tumbling to the bottom of the stairs, shattering the TV.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
					BEAVIS
			No it wasn't!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh,...Oh yeah.
	
	B&B stand at the top of the stairs looking down at the wrreckage. 
	PRINCIPAL McVICKER shows up by the TV.
	
					McVICKER
			Why.... You... You bastards... Ge...
			get out! You're suspended. One more
			screw up... and you're expelled.
	
	B&B walk off laughing.
	
	
	EXT.  THE ANDERSON'S DRIVEWAY - DUSK
	
	B&B walk up. There's a camper in the driveway.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't
			know Anderson had a Camper.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV.
			Heh heh. TV.
	
	B&B walk up to the camper and start to open the door just as MARCY 
	ANDERSON opens it. (As usual, she doesn't recognize them.)
	
					MARCY
			Oh, hello. Are you guys here to look
			at the refrigerator?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, no.
	
					BEAVIS
			We're here to look at the TV. Heh heh.
	
					MARCY
			Oh, I didn't realize it was broken.
			Come on in.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Cool. Huh huh huh.
	
	B&B walk into the camper. Marcy stays outside.
	
	
	EXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - SAME TIME
	
	Tom is adjusting the trailer-hitch. Marcy watches.
	
					TOM
			Well that oughtta hold her. Ya know,
			the most important thing you can have
			on a camper is a good propane regulator,
			and this here's the best one they make.
	
					MARCY
			I sure hope we can get the 'fridge fixed
			before we leave.
	
					TOM
			Now Marcy, we've been savin' for this trip
			our whole lives and we're gonna go come
			Hell or high water...
	
	Through the camper walls, we hear the faint sound of B&B 
	AIR/MOUTH-GUITARING "IRON MAN."
	
					TOM (CONT.)
			What the hell is that noise?
	
	
	INT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
	
	B&B watch a "Cops"-type show. Beavis gets up, goes to the 
	refrigerator and grabs a soda. The refrigerator is under the 
	counter on which the TV is sitting.
	
	Beavis takes a sip and then does a SPIT TAKE, SPRAYING SODA ALL 
	OVER THE TOP OF THE TV.
	
					BEAVIS
			AAAAAAGH!!! This crap is warm!
	
	ANGLE ON TV: The soda Beavis spit out drips into the inside of the 
	TV. We see smoke and hear SIZZLING AND SHORT CIRCUIT SFX. The TV 
	goes dead.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Beavis, you butt-hole! You broke it.
	
	
	EXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
	
	B&B come out. Tom notices them.		
	
					TOM
			Hey, what's goin' on here?
	
					MARCY
			They're here to fix the TV, Tom.
	
					TOM
			The TV ain't broken.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Yeah it is. Huh huh huh.
	
	Tom adjusts his glasses as he looks at B&B.
	
	TOM'S BLURRY P.O.V.: We see B&B out of focus.
	
					TOM
			Hey wait a minute. You two look kinda
			familiar. Ain't you them kids that've
			been whackin' off in my tool shed?
	
					BEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	ANGLE ON BEAVIS: looking particularly guilty, eyes shifting back 
	and forth.
	
	B&B walk off, leaving Tom wondering.
	
	
	EXT.  STREET IN A SEEDY PART OF TOWN - JUST BEFORE DAWN
	
	B&B are having TV withdrawal. Butt-Head is bug-eyed. Beavis has 
	the shakes bad, arms folded like Dustin Hoffman in "Midnight 
	Cowboy."
	
					BEAVIS
			Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			What's your problem Beavis?
	
					BEAVIS
			I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
	
	Butt-Head stops short. He looks up. His face is bathed in a 
	golden, throbbing light.
	
	BUTT-HEAD'S P.O.V.: We see a flashing neon sign that says, "TV". 
	Pull back to show B&B are standing outside the Elite Motel Lodge, 
	featuring "Color TV" and "Air-Cooled Rooms", with "Special Nap 
	Rates."
	
	B&B stare up, as if at a god.
	
					BEAVIS
					(crazed)
			Heh heh. TV. Heh Teee Veee.
	
	
	EXT.  MOTEL COURT - CONTINUOUS
	
	Butt-Head tries the first door. It's locked. He tries the second 
	door. It's locked. He tries the third door. It opens.
	
	B&B's eyes bulge. Inside, PRINCIPAL McVICKER is lying across the 
	legs of an obvious prostitute, his pants pulled down. She SPANKS 
	him.
	
					McVICKER
			Please mmm... may I have another?!
	
	B&B LAUGH. McVicker hears and looks up.
	
					McVICKER (CONT.)
			Beavis and Butt-Head! Y...y...you
			bastards.
	
					BEAVIS
			Can we watch your TV?
	
					McVICKER
			Y... Y... You're expelled! Get out!
	
	Butt-Head closes the door, laughing, and starts to walk towards 
	the next door. The muffled sound of a SPANK can be heard followed 
	by McVicker asking for another.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
					BEAVIS
			Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing
			everything!
	
	
	INT.  MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
	
	The only light in the room is a flickering TV. Sitting on the bed, 
	talking on the phone is MUDDY. He's a tough, mean looking red-neck 
	- a Jack Ruby type.
	
	On the nightstand next to him is a three-quarter drunk bottle of 
	bourbon and a manila envelope. On his lap is a big gun.
	
					MUDDY
			...Are you sure these guys can pull this
			off? It's gotta look like an accident...
	
	We hear a knock on the door and muffled B&B laughs.
	
					MUDDY (CONT.)
			Hold on a minute. That must be them now.
			I'll call you back. (Hangs up phone)...
			Come in!
	
	B&B walk in. Muddy turns on the light.
	
					BEAVIS
					(sounding suddenly sedated)
			Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
	
					MUDDY
			Yer late.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Why? Did we miss American Gladiators?
	
	MUDDY'S P.O.V.: B&B are a drunken blur.
	
					MUDDY
			Well, Earl said you guys were young, but
			jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get
			the job done. So what are your names?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, Butt-Head.
	
					BEAVIS
			Beavis.
	
					MUDDY
			That's alright. I'd rather not know your
			real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm
			gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you
			ten grand plus expenses, all payable after
			you do her...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(full of innuendo)
			Do her? Huh huh.
	
					MUDDY
			That's right. I'm offering you ten grand
			plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
	
	Butt-Head stares in shock.
	
					BEAVIS
			Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your
			wife.
	
					BEAVIS
					(trembling)
			Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
	
	Butt-Head SMACKS Beavis and pulls him aside.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us
			to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay
			us. We can buy a new TV.
	
					BEAVIS
			Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(to Muddy)
			Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
	
					MUDDY
			Okay, then let's get down to business.
	
	ANGLE ON THE BED. Muddy slaps down a picture of DALLAS, his wife. 
	Leather clad, biker, beautiful.
	
					MUDDY (CONT.)
			Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't
			as sweet as she looks. She stole everything
			from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll
			do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
	
	Muddy plunks down PLANE TICKETS.
	
					MUDDY
			She's holed up in a hotel room in Las
			Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of
			hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the
			airport.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
	
					BEAVIS
			Can we watch some TV first?
	
	Muddy picks up the gun and SHOOTS the TV.
	
					MUDDY
			No.
	
	
	EXT.  CITY STREETS - MORNING
	
	Muddy driving his loud four-by-four like a maniac, drunk with 
	bloodshot eyes. B&B are in the back seat. He eyes them through the 
	rearview. Meanwhile, a cat bounces off the windshield with a 
	SHRIEK.
	
					MUDDY
			One more thing. Mah wife's got this
			leather satchel. It's black, about this
			big. I need ya to bring it back. It's
			real important. Sentimental value... Any
			questions so far?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
	
					MUDDY
			She sure does.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
	
					MUDDY
			Just make sure it looks like an 
			accident...
	
					BEAVIS
					(spastic)
			Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an
			accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
	
					MUDDY
			Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have
			a drink on it.
	
	Muddy swigs the last swallow from his bottle of bourbon.
	
	
	EXT.  AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING
	
	In an overhead view, the four-by-four screeches up to the gate, 
	fishtails to a stop, throwing B&B onto the sidewalk, and peels 
	away.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			We're gonna get paid to score.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna
			get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Beavis, this is the greatest day of
			our lives. Huh huh huh.
	
	
	INT.  AIRPLANE - DAY
	
	B&B enter the plane. They sit down in the first two seats on the 
	right - in First Class. A flight attendant, DOLORIS approaches 
	them.
	
					DOLORIS
			Hi. Can I help you find your seats?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uuh, nah. These seats are OK.
	
					DOLORIS
			I think your tickets have you seated
			in row fourteen, coach. So why don't
			you just go ahead and move back, OK?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			That's OK. Someone else can have those.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, it's not that important to me,
			really. Those seats are too small anyways.
	
	Doloris yanks them out of their seats and leads them down the 
	aisle.
	
	ANGLE DOWN AISLE in coach. Doloris stops by a row where an elderly 
	woman, MARTHA, sits by the window. Next to her: Two empty seats.
	
					DOLORIS
			Here you are.
	
	She gestures to the seats and leaves. Beavis climbs in the middle, 
	Butt-Head in the aisle - still watching Doloris.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Hey Beavis. When she was leading us down
			here, huh huh, she touched my butt. Huh
			huh huh.
	
	Martha, her senses a bit dimmed from age, turns to B&B.
	
					MARTHA
			Hello there. Are you two heading for Las
			Vegas?
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, we're gonna score.
	
					MARTHA
			I hope to score big there myself. I'm
			mostly going to be doing the slots.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. 
			Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in
			Las Vegas?
	
					MARTHA
			Oh, there are so many slots you won't
			know where to begin.
	
					BEAVIS
			Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick
			is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be
			tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Cool. Huh huh huh.
	
					MARTHA
			It's so nice to meet young men who are so
			well mannered.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a
			big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
	
					MARTHA
			Oh, that's nice.
	
					CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
					(through P.A.)
			Good morning. This is your captain
			speaking. Welcome aboard flight 151
			non-stop to Las Vegas. We ask that you
			turn your attention to the front of the
			cabin for pre-flight safety instructions.
	
	B&B see Doloris, stepping nearby to demonstrate the seat belt.
	
					ATTENDANT'S VOICE
			To fasten your seat belt, insert the free
			end into the coupling.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Insert. Huh huh huh.
	
	Doloris demonstrates. B&B are dumbfounded. It's too complicated.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
			Uh...
	
	They struggle to make their seat belts fit, getting each other's 
	parts.
	
					TAMMY (O.C.)
			Hi, I'm Tammy? Can I help you with that?
	
	Butt-Head looks up.
	
	From his P.O.V. we see a beautiful woman, TAMMY, smiling, her 
	hands reaching down. FALLING IN LOVE/HARP MUSIC STING plays.
	
	CLOSE on Butt-Head's lap as two female hands reach down and pull 
	one strap from between Butt-Head's legs.
	
	Butt-Head looks down at his lap as Tammy leans over him. A loud 
	CLICKING can be heard. Butt-Head stares blankly.
	
					TAMMY (CONT.)
			There you go. You're all set.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(stunned)
			I love you.
	
	Suddenly Martha buckles Beavis' belt. Tammy goes.
	
					BEAVIS
			Wait, I wanted her to do it.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
	
					CAPTAIN'S VOICE
			Flight attendants, please prepare for
			take-off.
	
	The engines start to hum. The plane is rolling.
	
	Butt-Head struggles to get his seat belt off. He does everything 
	but pull the handle. Beavis goes white with fear.
	
	The plane starts to shake. The engines rumble. Beavis starts to 
	freak.
	
					BEAVIS
			Hey wait a minute. What's going on?!
	
	Butt-Head bangs away at his seat belt. Beavis looks out the window 
	and realizes they're in the air.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
					(screams)
			Aaaagh! We're gonna die!!!!!
	
	ANGLE ON COUPLE IN FRONT OF B&B:
	
					MAN
			D'ya hear that? Something must be wrong!
	
					WOMAN
			Oh my God!!!!!!!
	
	ANGLE ON CABIN, people start screaming. The plane quakes, lifting 
	up.
	
	ON BUTT-HEAD, furiously pulling:
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
	
					BEAVIS
			Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all
			gonna die!
	
	The plane arcs upward. Butt-Head finally gets the belt off as the 
	plane is in full thrust. He rises and goes tumbling backward down 
	the aisle.
	
	ON PEOPLE seeing Butt-Head flying, screaming in panic.
	
	In free fall:
	
	Butt-Head grabs the door to the hangable luggage. It all comes 
	tearing out.
	
	Butt-Head flies up, hitting several overhead luggage racks, which 
	open and spill their contents.
	
	Butt-Head lands in the galley, causing food to go flying and 
	coffee to pour freely.
	
	ON THE CABIN as the plane starts to level out. People stop their 
	screaming.
	
	ON BUTT-HEAD, underneath the rubble, poking his head out. He's 
	directly across from the flight attendant station where Tammy is 
	strapped in.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh... could you, like, do that
			thing with my belt again?
	
	
	INT.  PLANE - LATER
	
	All's in order. Flight attendants roll the beverage cart up the 
	aisle. People read, relaxed.
	
	ON BEAVIS AND MARTHA. Martha is showing pictures of her 
	grandchildren. Beavis is showing the picture of Dallas that Muddy 
	gave him.
	
					BEAVIS
			I'm probably going to make out with her
			first before we, you know, get down...
	
					MARTHA
			You'll have to speak up son. I have this
			ringing in my ears. My doctor says it
			could be related to my heart
			palpitations. I've had two operations on
			my heart.
	
					BEAVIS
			Really? I poop too much.
	
					MARTHA
			Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
	
					BEAVIS
			Uh... No, (louder) I poop too much. Then
			I get tired.
	
					MARTHA
			Well, if you find yourself getting tired,
			take a couple of these.
	
	She hands him a box of NoDrowz.
	
					MARTHA (CONT.)
			They perk me right up.
	
					BEAVIS
			Heh heh, thanks.
	
	He pours the contents into his hand and chews them like candy. 
	Then his eyes open wide.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
					(strange)
			Uh, tastes like crap. Heh heh. Mmmmm.
	
	Beavis starts wolfing them down.
	
	
	INT.  PLANE - A BIT LATER
	
	Tammy passes out meals from a rolling cart. She works with 
	Doloris. Butt-head stands behind Tammy, attempting to hit on her.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(to Tammy)
			So, uh huh huh, are you going to Las
			Vegas? Huh huh huh.
	
	Tammy ignores him and moves on, leaving Butt-Head there.
	
	ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD, looking down at something.
	
	PAN DOWN to reveal he's looking at a BEER on a fat guy's tray. The 
	guy's asleep.
	
	Butt-head picks up the beer.
	
	ANGLE ON BEAVIS, nearby. The NoDrowz is starting to take effect. 
	Beavis starts shaking, babbling, staring cross-eyed at his fist, 
	etc. (pre-Cornholio stuff)
	
	Tammy reaches her next passenger.
	
					TAMMY
			Hi, we're serving dinner. Our selections
			tonight are chicken piccata or seafood
			gumbo...
	
					BEAVIS (O.S.)
			Piccata? Piccata! Picattatta tatta!
	
	Tammy moves forward, leaving Butt-Head standing there. In the 
	background, we see Beavis starting to quake, on the verge of 
	Cornholio mode.
	
					PASSENGER
			Does the gumbo have corn in it?
	
	ANGLE ON BEAVIS: Turned, facing the cabin, T-shirt pulled over his 
	head in full Cornholio mode.
	
					BEAVIS
			I am Cornholio! I need picatta for
			my bunghole!
	
					TAMMY
			You'll have to wait your turn sir.
	
					BEAVIS
			Are you threatening me? My bunghole
			will not wait!
	
	Beavis starts to wander down the aisle.
	
	ANGLE ON CURTAIN TO FIRST CLASS CABIN. Beavis enters. From the 
	other side, SOUND of screams. We hear several CALL BUTTONS being 
	pressed.
	
	ON BUTT-HEAD. He approaches Tammy from behind. She ignores him.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, I got a beer. Want some? Huh huh.
	
	ANGLE INSIDE THE COCKPIT.
	
	The PILOTS are relaxed and settled in when the door to the cockpit 
	slams open. Beavis is in the doorway SCREAMING.
	
					BEAVIS
			Bargarajjjaaaahhh!!! I am Cornholio!!
	
	The pilots SCREAM. The copilot jumps up so fast he causes coffee 
	to spill everywhere, including on the captain's lap. The captain 
	then jumps up, hitting the controls and SENDING THE PLANE INTO A 
	NOSE-DIVE.
	
	ON BUTT-HEAD
	
	In the back of the plane standing next to Tammy. He starts to take 
	a sip of beer. The nose-dive of the plane causes Butt-Head to go 
	FLYING TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE PLANE.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			AAAAAHHH!!! Huh huh. AAAAHHH!!!
	
	Butt-Head bounces all overthe plane and then gets tangled up in 
	the curtain that separates first class and coach. It tears off, 
	and he continues to fly forward.
	
	COCKPIT
	
	The captain is desperately trying to regain control of the plane.
	
	Butt-Head slams into the cockpit, landing on the control panel 
	facing the captain.
	
					CAPTAIN
			Get the hell out of the cockpit!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh, you said...
	
					CAPTAIN
			NOW!!!
	
	The captain throws Butt-Head back behind him and pulls the plane 
	out of the dive.
	
	
	EXT.  LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - EARLY EVENING
	
	The plane lands.
	
	
	INT.  COCKPIT DOOR - EARLY EVENING
	
	The flight attendants, shaken, smile at a line of people 
	deplaning. The people are white with fear, some covered with 
	flecks of spilled food and other matter.
	
					ATTENDANTS
			Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
	
	They grow silent and still as B&B pass by. Beavis takes the T-
	shirt off his head, coming down from Cornholio.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
	
	INT.  TERMINAL/ARRIVAL GATE - DAY
	
	Arriving passengers are greeted. A family is reunited. Two 
	businessmen walk up to limo drivers holding cards with their 
	names. A reunited couple hugs.
	
	B&B look around in confusion.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be
			casinos and lights and stuff.
	
	People greet and walk away. The place starts to clear out.
	
	One limo driver is left standing. He wears sunglasses and holds a 
	sign that reads: Beavis and Butt-Head.
	
	B&B look around. Except for the driver, they're alone.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
			Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding
			a sign?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check
			this out.
	
	B&B go up to him. Butt-Head turns around, drops his pants and 
	hangs a "B.A." at the guy.
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					DRIVER
			Ah, excuse me. You wouldn't know where
			I can find these guys, would ya?
	
	He indicates the sign. Butt-Head turns around and pulls up his 
	pants. They look and try to read:
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(reads)
			Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
	
					BEAVIS
					(reads)
			Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(realizes)
			Huh huh. This says Beavis.
	
					BEAVIS
			And Boot-Head.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it,
			Beavis. These dudes have the same name as
			us.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, we should party.
	
	The limo driver rolls his eyes and walks away.
	
					DRIVER
			This way, sirs.
	
	B&B follow the driver away. Beavis looks around.
	
					BEAVIS
			So where's those guys?
	
	
	EXT.  MUDDY'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	HARLAN and ROSS, the two dumb-looking rough-necks that stole B&B's 
	TV are standing outside Muddy's motel room. Harlan knocks on the 
	door.
	
					ROSS
			Where the hell is he?
	
					HARLAN
			You sure this is the right place?
	
	Harlan looks through the window and sees the shattered TV. No 
	one's there.
	
	Muddy's four-by-four SQUEALS into the lot and skids to a stop next 
	to Harlan and Ross' van. Muddy gets out, looking really drunk now.
	
					HARLAN (CONT.)
			You Muddy?
	
					MUDDY
					(slurring)
			You the cops?
	
					ROSS
			Uh, no. Earl sent us. You know, to take
			care of your wife...
	
	Muddy grabs Ross by the collar.
	
					MUDDY
			What the hell?!... What about those other...
	
					ROSS
			Huh?
	
	Muddy tosses Ross to the sidewalk and starts back to they four-by-
	four.
	
					MUDDY
			Dammit!!! She did it to me again!!!
	
					HARLAN
			Hey, I noticed your TV was broken. You
			wanna buy a new one?
	
	Muddy gets in the four-by-four and starts it.
	
					MUDDY
			I'm gonna go to Vegas and kill all
			three a' them!
	
	Harlan and Ross seem momentarily confused.
	
	Muddy revs the engine, peels out backwards HITTING THE FRONT OF 
	THE VAN. This causes B&B's TV and some other loot to spill out the 
	back onto the sidewalk.
	
	Ross starts to pick it up.
	
					HARLAN
			Just leave it. Worthless piece o' crap.
	
					ROSS
			Yeah, really. We gotta start stealin'
			from rich people.
	
	
	EXT.  LAS VEGAS - DAY
	
	MONTAGE SONG BEGINS.
	
		Note: I would like this to be a well-known band (Red Hot 
		Chili Peppers) doing their best imitation of a modern Las 
		Vegas lounge act. I think a song like "What Am I Gonna Do 
		With You" by Barry White or something obnoxious like 
		"Bicostal" by Peter Allan would be cool. Or maybe Sinatra's 
		"You Make Me Feel So Young" would be best.
	
	The car passes by major hotels and tourist sights, finally pulling 
	up to a big luxurious hotel and casino.
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - DAY
	
	Establishing shots. Excitement. Gambling tables going on forever.
	
	ON THE LOUNGE BAND playing the song we've been hearing. They 
	should vaguely resemble the actual band doing the song.
	
	PAN DOWN rows of slot machines.
	
	PAN ACROSS DEALERS handling cards and chips.
	
	DOLLY RIGHT UP TO B&B, staring in utter awe.
	
	REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS: They're staring at a huge Roman statue of a 
	bare-chested woman.
	
	Their faces are blank. They're seeing God. Finally:
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Beavis. This is what it's all about.
	
					BEAVIS
					(speechless)
			Heh heh. Yeah.
	
	
	EXT.  VEGAS - DUSK
	
	Lights are popping on.
	
	Billboards and signs are lighting up.
	
	The whole strip is coming alive. Pure excitement.
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - DUSK
	
	ON B&B, still staring at the statue.
	
					B&B
					(in awe)
			Huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	A security guard comes and drags B&B away.
	
	ON THE LOUNGE BAND, continuing the song we've been hearing.
	
	
	INT.  B&B'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	The door is opened by a bellboy.
	
					BELLBOY
			I'm so sorry about that little
			misunderstanding. We didn't know you
			were registered guests. Here's some
			playing chips compliments of...
	
	Beavis rushes in and grabs the remote which is attached to the 
	night table. He tries to pull it up and can't.
	
					BEAVIS
			This remote's too heavy!
	
					BELLBOY
			Sir, it's attached to the...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Here, dumbass! Let me try!
	
	They both struggle to pull it up. Finally, they fall over 
	backwards.
	
	Annoyed, the bellboy leaves.
	
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR BANK/9TH FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	The elevator arrives. B&B get on. There's several sophisticated 
	people. From inside, a computerized FEMALE ELEVATOR VOICE:
	
					ELEVATOR VOICE
			Ninth floor, going down.
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Going down. Huh huh huh.
	
	The sophisticated people look repulsed. The doors close.
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - NIGHT
	
	MUSIC DIPS DOWN FOR DIALOGUE. B&B step off the elevator and walk 
	among the gambling tables.
	
	Beavis pulls one of the playing chips out of his pocket and bites 
	into it.
	
					BEAVIS
			Ow! These chips suck.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find
			that chick.
	
	Beavis tosses the chip on a roulette table.
	
	ANGLE ON THE WHEEL. The ball lands on 13.
	
	At the table, the DEALER...
	
					DEALER
			13. We have a winner. (to Beavis) Sir,
			your chips?
	
					BEAVIS
			I don't want 'em! Keep 'em.
	
					DEALER
			Let it ride!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(to dealer)
			Uh... could you help us find a chick?
	
					DEALER
					(uneasy)
			Sir, the casino does not partake in that
			kind of activity.
	
	The wheel stops.
	
					DEALER (CONT.)
					(amazed)
			13! Winner!
	
	People oooh and aaah. More gather to watch.
	
	Through the gathering throng comes CHERYL, a hooker.
	
					CHERYL
			Excuse me, boys. Did I hear you say 
			you're looking for a date?
	
	B&B freeze, shocked.
	
					CHERYL (CONT.)
			I'm Cheryl, and I can show you a real
			fine time.
	
	B&B don't move. The dealer rolls again.
	
					CHERYL (CONT.)
			A time you'll remember for the rest of
			your lives, if you know what I mean.
	
					DEALER
					(to Beavis)
			Sir, do you want your chips?
	
					BEAVIS
			No, Dammit! I don't want any chips!
	
					DEALER
			Let it ride.
	
	Cheryl puts her hands on their thighs.
	
					CHERYL
			What say we three go up to your room, 
			take off our clothes and just see what
			comes up.
	
	B&B's eyes open wide.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Uh... Uh...
	
	The wheel stops.
	
					DEALER
			14. No winners.
	
					CHERYL
			Hmmmm. Oh well.
	
	She leaves. People scatter. B&B are left alone. Staring.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That chick was talking
			about doing it.
	
					BEAVIS
			Heh heh. This is the best night of our
			lives.
	
	WIDE SHOT. B&B just stand, laughing.
	
	MUSIC FADES BACK UP...
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT
	
	ANGLE ON THE BAND, continuing the song.
	
	Tourists watch from tables - decidedly not rocking out.
	
	B&B dance alone near the stage, doing the "butt-knocker."
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	A WOMAN ATTENDANT answers the phone.
	
					WOMAN ATTENDANT
			Good evening. Room service. How may
			I help you?
	
	From the phone...
	
					B&B
					(on phone)
			Huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	The woman's disturbed.
	
					WOMAN ATTENDANT
			Hello... Hello...
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - NIGHT
	
	B&B try to climb up and grab the gigantic boobs of the statue. 
	Butt-Head falls, knocks Beavis off and they both hit the floor 
	hard.
	
	
	INT.  B&B'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Beavis is on the phone in the main room. Butt-Head sits on the 
	toilet and speaks from the phone in the bathroom.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh, I'd like to be serviced...
			in my room.
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT
	
	B&B keep dancing as the famous BAND plays the MONTAGE SONG which 
	ENDS.
	
	
	EXT.  VEGAS - DAWN
	
	Sunrise.
	
	The song rings out.
	
	
	INT.  B&B'S ROOM - MORNING
	
	BEavis is picking up the night table by the remote attached to it 
	and moving the whole thing.
	
	Butt-Head approaches a door next to the bed.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, I wonder where this door goes to.
	
	Beavis comes over to check it out. Butt-Head opens the door. It's 
	one of those double doors to the next room.
	
	Butt-Head tries to open the second door, jiggling it.
	
	Suddenly, the door opens. Someone reaches out and pulls B&B 
	inside. It's DALLAS, the girl Muddy sent them after.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
	
	She has them pinned against the wall. DALLAS is hot, clad in tight 
	leather, tattooed, pierced, sexy.
	
					BEAVIS
					(excited)
			Hey, Butt-Head, it's her! Heh heh.
	
					DALLAS
			All right, who are ya? C.I.A? F.B.I.?
			A.T.F.?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
	
					BEAVIS
			Me first?
	
					DALLAS
			You got two seconds!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
	
	Dallas grabs Butt-Head by the shirt.
	
					DALLAS
			Who sent ya?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we
			could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
	
					DALLAS
			Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he
			payin' ya?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, ten uh...
	
					DALLAS
			Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a
			better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll
			pay ya twenty if you go back there and do
			mah husband.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No
			way.
	
					BEAVIS
					(considering it)
			Umm,... I don't know Butt-Head. That is
			a lot of money... Maybe if we close our
			eyes and pretend he's a chick...
	
	Butt-Head SMACKS Beavis, bringing him to his senses.
	
	From outside, SOUND of a police siren. Dallas goes to the window. 
	The place is being surrounded by police and plain black cars.
	
					DALLAS
					(panics)
			Damn! You boys, you wait right there.
	
	Dallas goes into the next room and closes the door.
	
	B&B look at each other. They start to take their pants off.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
	
					BEAVIS
			Me first! Me first!
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
	
	Dallas gets binoculars from her bag and scouts outside.
	
	Her P.O.V. REVEALS dozens of police and A.T.F. cars. The hotel's 
	surrounded.
	
	As Dallas looks around, she spots a tour bus across the street. On 
	the side: "Dream America Tours." Dallas quickly dials the phone.
	
					DALLAS
					(to phone)
			Gimme the number for Dream America Tours.
			(pause) Right.
	
	Dallas dials again, crossing to the door to peek out at B&B - both 
	standing in their underwear, waiting. Beavis picks his nose. 
	Dallas closes the door again.
	
					DALLAS (CONT.)
					(to phone)
			Yeah, you got a bus leaving today? (pause)
			Five minutes? Where's it goin'? (listens)
			Washington, D.C.? (mulls it over) Perfect.
			(a look back to the other room) Gimme two
			tickets.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
	
	B&B are in their underwear. Butt-Head sits at the edge of the bed. 
	Beavis tries to pull the remote off the table.
	
	Dallas enters, sees this sight, and shuts off the TV. She looms 
	over Butt-Head.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
	
					BEAVIS
			Me first!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Forget it, bunghole!
	
	B&B start to wrestle. Dallas sees Beavis' pants.
	
					DALLAS
					(realizing)
			Score? You boys wanna...?
	
	Butt-Head grabs Beavis' neck.
	
					BEAVIS
			Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh.
	
	She picks up the pants, getting an idea.
	
					DALLAS
			You wait here.
	
	She takes the pants into the next room. B&B keep wrestling.
	
					BEAVIS
			Me first.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh. No way, dude.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
	
	TIGHT ON her black satchel. From it she lifts a delicate 
	electronic device, the X-5 unit, about the size of a credit card. 
	An LED light blinks.
	
	Using her switchbalde, she cuts a hole in the back seam of Beavis' 
	pants, creating a natural pocket. She carefully slides the unit 
	in.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
	
	B&B's fight escalates. Butt-Head picks up a LAMP and throws it at 
	Beavis. It hits the wall and SHATTERS. Beavis charges Butt-Head.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
	
	Dallas is licking a piece of thread. She quickly and expertly 
	threads a needle and then starts to sew the electronic device into 
	the inside back of Beavis' pants. She suddenly wrinkles her nose 
	as if she has smelled something.
	
	She holds the pants up to the light. Inside, the shadow of the 
	unit.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
	
	B&B fight wildly. Dallas enters and clears her throat. B&B freeze.
	
	FULL ON DALLAS, posed sexily, seductive.
	
					DALLAS
			Don't wear yourselves out, boys. Save
			some energy for me.
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're

			Heh heh. Thank God.
	
					DALLAS
			I'm gonna do it with both of ya.
	
					B&B

			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh

	Dallas clears her throat to get their attention. And again.
	
					DALLAS
			(sexy) Boys... (shouts) Boys!!!
	
	Silence.
	
					DALLAS (CONT.)
			But first, you hafta do a little job for
			me. (touches seductively) Would you like
			to do a job for me?
	
	Silence. They're in shock.
	
					DALLAS (CONT.)
			Here's what it is. I want ya to take a bus
			ta Washington, D.C. That's all. And when
			ya get there, I'll be waitin'. You're
			gonna make a whole lotta money. (In their
			faces) And I'm gonaa give you everything!
	
					B&B
					(near comatose)
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					DALLAS
			Until then... (tosses Beavis' pants in his

	She looks back to the window, now all business.
	
					DALLAS (CONT.)
			OK guys, time to move out.
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL LOBBY/FRONT DOOR - DAY
	
	A.T.F. agents enter and spread out. We see several agents go up

	INT.  DALLAS' ROOM/DOORWAY - DAY
	
					DALLAS
			Remember, Washington, D.C. You'll get
			more money than you ever dreamed of. And
			you'll get me.
	
	She kisses them both seductively.
	
					DALLAS (CONT.)
					(urgent)
			Your bus is downstairs. Get going.
	
	She shuts the door, leaving B&B outside. Nearby, a maid with her 
	cart passes by.
	
	B&B stare, frozen for a beat, then go running for the elevator.
	
	ANGLE AROUND THE CORNER, out of B&B's view. Just as the elevator 
	doors shut, dozens of federal agents with guns rush in and kick 
	open Dallas' door.
	
	
	EXT.  HOTEL/CASINO - DAY
	
	More Feds and police enter.
	
	ANGLE ON B&B, walking past, oblivious to all else. As he walks 
	away, Beavis rubs his butt.
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This is gonna be cool. Huh huh.
	
	They walk to the tour bus across the street.
	
	
	INT.  TOUR BUS - DAY
	
	B&B walk down the aisle, Beavis rubbing his butt. Most seats are 
	taken by senior citizens.
	
	Up ahead, two vacant seats. B&B fight to get in first.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			No way butt-hole! I want the window.
	
					BEAVIS
			Cut it out butt-hole!
	
					A VOICE
			Why don't you take turns?
	
	They turn. It's Martha, the woman from the plane, sitting across 
	the aisle.
	
					BEAVIS
			Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the
			plane!
	
					MARTHA
			Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
	
					BEAVIS
			Uh, we didn't score yet.

	We PAN back to the hotel as Muddy arrives in a cab.
	
	
	INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE DALLAS' ROOM - DAY
	
	DRAMATIC REVEAL of AGENT RYAN FLEMMING entering the hallway. He's 
	an A.T.F. honcho, powerful, hard-ass. Looks like an Oliver North-
	type. Sounds something like Fred Thompson. He walks with his 
	assistant, AGENT BORK and another agent.
	
	They find Dallas' room and enter.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Dallas sits calmly, confident, as agents tear apart the room.
	
					FLEMMING
			So, are you going to tell us where it is
			or am I going to have to have Agent Hurley
			over there give you another cavity search?
	
	ANGLE ON AGENT HURLEY, a tough, stocky woman.
	
					DALLAS
			Ooh is that a promise?
	
					FLEMMING
			Look Mrs. Scum, we know who you are. Tell
			her Bork.
	
					BORK
			Dallas Grimes. Married to Muddy Grimes.
			You run a mom and pop arms smuggling ring.
	
	He tosses her some photos of her and Muddy.
	
					DALLAS
			Oh, you got my bad side.
	
	Bork hands Flemming another file. Flemming checks it.
	
					FLEMMING
			Three days ago you pulled a job at the
			Army Research Facility in Hadley, Nevada -
			where you stole... (reads) The X-5 unit.
			Now we happen to know you had the unit
			with you when you checked in here, so why
			don't you be a good girl and tell us where
			it is.
	
					DALLAS
			You gonna charge me with anything? (pause)
			I didn't think so. You wanna let me go now
			or wait 'till my lawyer files a wrongful
			arrest.
	
					BORK
					(aside to Flemming)
			We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place
			apart. We can only legally hold her for

	B&B are the last in. Beavis rubs his aching butt. The guide is 
	already speaking.

			Chief, we found a witness that says he saw
			two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly
			before we arrived.
	
					FLEMMING
			Did you give him a full cavity search?
	
					BORK
					(confused)
			Ah, the witness?
	
					FLEMMING
			Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
	
					BORK
			Well sir, I didn't really think it was

			have a look.
	
	TIGHT ON PICTURE. A still of B&B laughing on the elevator.
	
					BORK (CONT.)
			They look like a couple of kids chief.

	Suddenly the lights blink on and off. All three men look up.
	
	
	INT.  HOOVER DAM/CONTROL ROOM - DUSK
	
	We see a bank of TV monitors, video of water, turbines, etc. 
	Beavis is rubbing his butt against a switch on the console, 
	causing the lights to blink on and off.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
	
					BEAVIS
			My butt's bothering me!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			You should kick your butt's ass. Huh huh

	Butt-Head looks at the bank of monitors - all showing water.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
			Dammit, all they have is shows about
			water.
	
					BEAVIS
			That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows
			about fire! Change the channel.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh...
	
	Butt-Head starts randomly hitting controls everywhere while Beavis 
	rubs his butt against a computer keypad.

			Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real

			What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
	
					BORK
			Well, sir it's not good. (to an assistant)
			Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new
			top-secret biological weapon, a manmade
			virus...
	
	ON MONITOR. The device that was put in back of Beavis' pants.
	
					BORK (CONT.)
			The deadliest known to man. It could wipe
			out five states in five days. It can be
			activated by simply entering the right
			code. Here's what happened when it was
			tested on a group of Army recruits...
	
	ON THE MONITOR. Army recruits coughing up black gunk, rolling 
	around in pain on stretchers, dying. Grotesque (but funny).
	
					FLEMMING
			Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to
			fall into the wrong hands...
	
					BORK
			It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished.
			It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard
			enough, it could break open, releasing the
			virus.
	
	A murmuring through the room. Flemming rises and holds up a 
	picture of B&B.
	
					FLEMMING
			Okay People, as of right now these are the

			Uh... I think you scared them off.
	
					BEAVIS
			This sucks. What are we doing here?
			Weren't we suppost'a go to Washington and

	From the car, a tourist couple heads into the building.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(to couple)
			Uh, do you know where Washington is?
	
					TOURIST MAN
			Yeah, 'bout 2000 miles that way.

			This desert is stupid. They need to put a

					BEAVIS
			Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or

					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, probably like, another five minutes or

	ANGLE FROM OVERHEAD. Lost, alone, B&B wobble like they haven't 
	long to live. Overhead, vultures circle.
	
	ANGLE ON B&B, exhausted, spent. Staring ahead, Butt-Head suddenly 
	sees something.

			Whoa! Check it out!
	
	Beavis clears his eyes and sees it too.

			Sir, we're looking for these two

			Why I'll be danged. It's those boys been

					AGENT
			You saw these two?
	
					ANDERSON
			I sure did. They were whackin' off in my

			I never seen so much whackin' off.
	
	The agent steps back and shouts into his walkie-talkie:
	
					AGENT
			Blue Den this is post nine! I have
			positive ID!! (to Tom) Sir, I'm gonna have
			to ask you and your wife to step out of

			Now wait right there. You're dealing with

	An A.T.F. agent smashes the micro on the ground and sifts through 
	the pieces.
	
	Nearby, Flemming and Hurley watch.
	
					FLEMMING
					(appalled)
			Masturbating in a man's camper! We're

	Agent Bork runs up to Flemming.
	
					BORK
			Chief - just came in! Two days ago,

	Agents rush down the business streets. People are in a panic. It's 
	like an invasion.

	knocking it over with a crash.
	
	
	INT.  VAN DRIESSEN'S CLASS - DAY
	
	Guitar in hand, Van Driessen sings:
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			She flies so gracefully,
			over rocks, trees and sand. Soaring over

			floating down to land.
			She proudly lifts her voice
			to sound her mating call.
			And soon her mate responds
			by singing... "Caw, Caw, Caw."
			Come with me, Lesbian Seagull.
			Settle down and rest with me...
	
	Suddenly dozens of A.T.F. agents crash into the room. The door 
	bashes in, knocking Van Driessen down hard and crushing his 
	guitar.
	
	Flemming enters. Behind him, McVicker.
	
					McVICKER
			Uh...uh...uh that's him. He's their
			teacher.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			What's going on here?
	
					FLEMMING
			I'll ask the questions. Are these your

	He shows a picture of B&B.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			I assume you're a government agent. I
			would think you would know there's
			something in this country called due
			process.
	
					FLEMMING
			That's about the kind of talk I'd expect
			from the guy who taught these two. Take
			this scum away.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			I believe I'm supposed to be read my
			Miranda Rights...
	
	An agent interrupts, punching Van Driessen in the gut. He's taken 
	away. Flemming turns menacingly to McVicker.
	
					McVICKER
			I...I...I always knew they were no good.
			I... I... I hate them!
	
					FLEMMING
					(to McVicker)
			You've been harboring two criminal

	Bork rushes up to Flemming with a paper.
	
					BORK
			Chief, you know that guy whose camper they

					FLEMMING
					(appalled)
			Bork! You are a federal agent. You

			Never end a sentence with a preposition.

			Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose

			That's better. Yes?

			We've run a sample through the National

	EXT.  DESERT - NIGHT
	
	B&B and the Dumn abd Dumber Guys are sitting around a campfire. 
	The Dumb Guy looks like an older, more stupid, version of Butt-
	Head. The Dumber Guy is a couple of evolutionary scales down from 
	Beavis. Their relationship is an exaggerated version of B&B's.
	
	Butt-Head is staring at the Dumb Guy in admiration. Beavis, like 
	the Dumber Guy, appears to be just staring at the fire, 
	hypnotized. Dumb Guy is eating spaghetti out of a can.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
	
					DUMB GUY
					(mouth full)
			Yup. Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Fire.
	
					DUMB GUY
			Here's another true story. About fifteen
			years ago, we stopped in this, uh, toilet,
			called Highland...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Really? That's where we're from.
	
					DUMB GUY
			Well, then you know what I'm talking
			about. Anyway, here's the story. I
			scored with these two chicks. True story.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			You scored with two chicks?!
	
					DUMB GUY
					(spaghetti dribbling from mouth)
			Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
	
					DUMBER GUY
			Ih hih hih hih hih hih.
	
	Dumb Guy punches Dumber Guy in the head with a closed fist.
	
					DUMB GUY
			Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I
			scored with both of them...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, do you think these two sluts still
			live in Highland? That would be cool.
	
					DUMB GUY
					(after taking another big bite)
			Hey, you wanna see something really cool?
			Huh huh huh.
	
	Dumb Guy gets up, turns his butt towards the fire and starts to 
	drop his pants.
	
	
	EXT.  DESERT/LONG SHOT - CONTINUOUS
	
	The campfire is in the distance, middle of nowhere. A flatulant 
	sound is heard. Suddenly, a big beautiful purple and orange 
	fireball erupts, lighting up the sky.
	
					B&B/DUMB GUY/DUMBER GUY (O.S.)
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS (O.S.)
			Fire.
	
	
	EXT.  DESERT - MORNING
	
	B&B wake up. The Dumb Guy and Dumber Guy are gone. The sun is 
	scorching.
	
	B&B inch forward - spent, dehydrated, near death.
	
	ANGLE ON GROUND as B&B collapse into frame. Butt-Head looks up at 
	the sun, squinting.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(barely alive)
			The sun sucks.
	
	A vulture picks at Beavis' shirt. Beavis SMACKS the vulture.
	
					BEAVIS
					(to the vulture)
			Cut it out butt-hole!
	
	The vulture moves revealing a PEYOTE CACTUS. Beavis looks at it.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
			Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be
			like, water in cactuses?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(semiconscious)
			Uh...
	
	Beavis takes a bite of the cactus, chews and then coughs.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
					(sees something)
			Hey Beavis, check it out.
	
	IN FRONT OF B&B: Two vultures start humping.

					MUDDY
			No, I can't say I've seen 'em. I sure hope
			it's safe to drive around here.
	
					COP
			Don't worry, sir. Just stick to the main
			roads. If they're around, they're probably
			hiding out in the desert.
	
					MUDDY
			That's good to know, Officer.
	
	Muddy takes off with a smile and turns off onto a side road.
	
	
	EXT.  DESERT - LATER
	
	B&B barely crawling forward. Butt-Head stops, then Beavis. They're 
	barely able to talk.
	
					BEAVIS
			Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my
			life is like, flashing in front of my
			eyes!
	
	BUTT-HEAD'S VISION. Through time-lapse dissolves we see him 
	sitting on his couch with Beavis, laughing like an idiot in the 
	exact same positions at age 2, 5, 7, 10, 13.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Whoa, my life is cool!
	
	TIGHT ON BEAVIS:
	
					BEAVIS
			Uh... I think I'm seeing something too.
			It's like a really long time ago...
	
	BEAVIS' VISION: Beavis as a sperm cell swimming through a uterus. 
	It's a sperm cell with the face of Beavis on it.
	
					BEAVIS/SPERM
			Yeah, heh heh. This is gonna be cool.
	
	Beavis/Sperm swims over to the egg.
	
	With its own tail the Beavis/Sperm starts picking its nose.
	
					BEAVIS/SPERM (CONT.)
			Hey, how's it goin'? Heh heh heh.
	
	Several other sperm charge in, knocking Beavis into the egg. His 
	conception looks like a dumb accident.
	
	BACK ON BEAVIS:
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh I scored.
	
	Animated bubbles appear around Beavis' head.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
			Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird.
			I think I'm freaking out.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh? Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like,
			everything looks all weird and...
	
	BEAVIS' P.O.V. OF BUTT-HEAD: His face starts to warp and colors 
	start shifting.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
			...and... Whoa!...and it's like there's
			all these weird shapes and it's sort of
			like,...it's like...like a MUSIC VIDEO!!!
	
	Tight on Beavis' face staring in wonder.
	
	THIS IS WHERE THE MUSIC VIDEO/HALLUCINATION SEQUENCE BEGINS. It 
	could even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the 
	lower left hand corner.
	
	I would like to have a band (White Zombie?) do a version of 
	something like, "Fire," by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. This 
	is the song that begins, "I am God of Hellfire and I bring you... 
	fire!"
	
	The concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get, but 
	I would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal. (If it's White 
	Zombie, we could incorporate some of Rob Zombie's artwork.)
	
	BEAVIS' P.O.V.:
	
	We see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire. 
	The ball of fire develops a face and speaks.
	
					FIRE
			I am God of Hellfire and I bring
			you...(music begins) Fire...
	
					BEAVIS
			Whoa!!! This kicks ass!!!
	
	THIS IS THE GREATEST VIDEO BEAVIS HAS EVER SEEN. Out of the ball 
	of fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini.
	
	At first the video is mostly the God of Hellfire, chicks in 
	bikinis and various images of B&B's TV in all its glory.
	
	As the video/hallucination continues, it becomes a psychotic mass 
	of naked people, fire, TVs, vultures, B&B head-banging, weird 
	stuff from my high school notebooks, etc.
	
	At one point we see the God of Hellfire in a Burger World uniform.
	
	As the song winds down, we incorporate Muddy's car into the 
	surreal imagery. (We should also incorporate their TV, as well as 
	maybe some of the characters from the show that aren't in the 
	movie.)
	
	Then, we REVEAL Muddy's car actually pulling up to B&B's near-dead 
	bodies.
	
	The SONG ENDS as Muddy tosses water on B&B. REVEAL they were not 
	far from the side of a road all along.
	
					B&B
			Ahhhhghhhhgh!
	
	B&B snap out of it. They rise and find Muddy hovering over them 
	with a shotgun.
	
					BEAVIS
			Aagh! I'm all wet!...(realizing) Oh, cool.
			Heh heh heh. Water.
	
	Muddy aims his shotgun at B&B.
	
					MUDDY
			Ah'm gonna enjoy this. Any last words
			b'fore ah kill ya?
	
	B&B think.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt
			cheeks, huh huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say
			that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
	
					MUDDY
			Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Cool, huh huh. (realizing) Hey Beavis
			that's that dude that's paying us to do
			his wife.
	
					BEAVIS
			Oh yeah. Can you just take us to
			Washington? We're gonna meet her there
			and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
	
					MUDDY
			Washington! That's where she was gonna
			meet up with ya? (realizes) Damn, she's
			goin' all the way!
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	Muddy lowers the gun a bit.
	
					MUDDY
			You know, I just might need you after all.
			Aw right, in the trunk. You're gonna help
			me get mah unit back.
	
	Muddy pops it open. B&B climb in. Muddy closes the trunk on them 
	and walks to the front of the car. HOLD ON THE TRUNK.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (O.S.)
			Boy, it sure is hard to score. Huh huh

			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	Pumping up the jack, they cause the lid of the trunk to start to

	Suddenly, it pops open. B&B are a sweaty mess. They gasp.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This sucks. Let's get outta here.

			C'mon, Beavis, just start running really

	Beavis stands, T-shirt still over his head. Suddenly, dozens of 
	agents surround him, pointing guns at him. Beavis seems oblivious 
	to the danger.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			I am the great Cornholio! I will lay waste
			to your bunghole! Heh heh.
	
	BEHIND THE AGENTS, Flemming approaches and gives orders.
	
					FLEMMING
			OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the
			unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't
			wanna take a chance on hitting it.
	
					BORK
			Where are his pants?
	
					FLEMMING
			Who knows?
	
	Beavis reaches to scratch his butt. Agents step back, cautious.
	
	Flemming picks up a bullhorn and addresses Beavis.
	
					FLEMMING (CONT.)
			This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't
			hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us
			where the unit is.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
	
					FLEMMING
			We'll get you whatever you want. (to
			agents) Get that other kid. We might need
			him.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
	
					BORK
					(on a radio)
			This is Bork. We need some T.P. and
			some...(to Flemming) What's he say?
	
	ANGLE BEHIND AGENTS. Butt-Head is brought in by two agents.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Whoa, this rules! Can I have a gun too?
			Huh huh huh.
	
	ON BEAVIS. He continues to babble, making the agents nervous.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			You must bow down to the Almighty
			Bunghole. (Beavis) Heh heh, this is cool.
			(Cornholio, chanting) Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
	
					FLEMMING
					(to Bork)
			He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna
			have to take him out. Get ready to fire on
			my orders... (on bullhorn) This is your
			last chance. Give us the unit now...
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			(Beavis) Why does everyone wanna see my
			schlong? (Cornholio, chanting) I am the
			one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
	
					FLEMMING
					(to agents)
			OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of
			three. (on bullhorn) I'm gonna give you
			three seconds...
	
	ANGLE ON AGENTS taking aim, cocking their guns.
	
					FLEMMING (CONT.)
					(on bullhorn)
			One...
	
	ANGLE ON BEAVIS, chanting.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			Cornholio-o-o-o-o...
	
	ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh huh.
	
					FLEMMING
					(on bullhorn)
			...Two...
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
	
					FLEMMING
					(on bullhorn)
			Thrr...
	
	Suddenly Tom Anderson throws open his camper door, holding Beavis' 
	pants.
	
					TOM
			And take yer damn pants with ya...!
			(noticing) What in the hell...?
	
					BORK
					(pointing)
			THE PANTS!!! He's got the unit!
	
	Suddenly all guns are on Anderson.
	
					FLEMMING
					(through bullhorn)
			Drop the pants! Now!
	
					TOM
			Wait a minute. I ain't the one...
	
	IN SLOW MOTION:
	
	A S.W.A.T. TEAM GUY lunges at Tom, grabbing the pants.
	
	Tom pulls away, causing the pants to RIP. THE UNIT GOES FLYING.
	
	A FROZEN MOMENT. SLOW MOTION.
	
	TIGHT ON THE UNIT.
	
	TIGHT ON FACES IN THE CROWD.
	
	TIGHT ON THE UNIT.
	
	TIGHT ON FLEMMING.
	
	TIGHT ON BUTT-HEAD, LAUGHING IN SLOW MOTION - OBLIVIOUS.
	
	TIGHT ON THE UNIT, FALLING, FALLING.
	
	IT HITS BUTT-HEAD'S HEAD, BOUNCES AND FALLS INTO HIS HANDS.
	
	The agents all stare at Butt-Head - quiet, not sure what to do.
	
	Butt-Head hands it to Flemming, nonchalant.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, here ya go. Huh huh huh.
	
	The crowd CHEERS.
	
	ON ANDERSON'S CAMPER.
	
	Tom is handcuffed roughly.
	
					TOM
			Now wait just a minute...
	
	An agent comes out of the camper with the picture of Dallas. Bork 
	grabs it and shows it to Tom.
	
					BORK
			How do you explain this?
	
	Flemming approaches Tom.
	
					FLEMMING
			Sooo, using two innocent teenagers as
			pawns in your sick game, huh?
	
					TOM
			I don't know what the hell...
	
					FLEMMING
					(disgusted)
			Take him away.
	
	Anderson is dragged away past a group of young, boy-scout types 
	who shake their heads in shame.
	
	ANGLE ON Beavis and Butt-head being interviewed by a reporter. 
	Beavis is in his underwear. Tom is being dragged away in the 
	background.
	
					BEAVIS
			I always thought there was something wrong
			with him. Heh heh heh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh
			huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(leaning towards camera)
			Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	
	EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY
	
	Later. Establish. Most A.T.F. cars are pulling out.
	
	
	INT.  WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE - DAY
	
	B&B sit as Flemming paces in front of them. Beavis is no longer 
	Cornholio.
	
					FLEMMING
			I gotta admit, I didn't believe it. I
			thought you were scum. But you saved more
			lives today than you'll ever know. You led
			us to one of the sickest criminals in our
			history. This country owes you a debt.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, does that mean, like, we're gonna get
			money and stuff?
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, and chicks! We were supposed to
			score.
	
					FLEMMING
			For security reasons, your actions will
			have to remain top secret. But someone
			very special wants to give his thanks.
	
	Flemming motions to the big chair. The PRESIDENT swivels around 
	and rises to shake hands with B&B.
	
					PRESIDENT
			Beavis and Butt-Head. On behalf of all
			your fellow Americans, I extend my deepest
			thanks. You exemplify a fine new crop of
			young Americans who will grow into the
			leaders of this great country.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. He said crap. Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Heh heh. This guy's cool.
	
					PRESIDENT
			In recognition for your great service, I'm
			appointing you honorary agents in the
			Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Whoa, huh huh!!!
	
	The President hands them citations.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
			You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get
			alcohol, tobacco and guns!
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.
	
	B&B leave the office, muttering.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes
			and chicks! We're gonna score!
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	
	EXT.  AIRPORT NEAR B&B'S HOMETOWN - DAY
	
	A plane lands.
	
	
	INT.  PLANE/DOOR - DAY
	
	As before, the flight crew stares in horror and silence as B&B 
	deplane.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... bye-bye.
	
					BEAVIS
			Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
	
	
	EXT.  ELITE MOTEL LODGE BAR - DAY
	
	Walking home, B&B pass the motel. They notice the sign for big 
	screen TV. They stop and look at it.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			You know what else sucks? We never even
			got a TV.
	
	ON BEAVIS, seeing something, amazed, ecstatic.
	
					BEAVIS
			Heh mmm, hey mmm Butt-Head! Look!
	
	Heavenly MUSIC. B&B stare at the wonder before them.
	
	ANGLE ON THEIR TV, mangled, partly-crushed junk.
	
					B&B
			Yes! Yes! Yes! Huh huh huh.
	
	B&B run up to the set like it was their lost and found dog.
	
	
	EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
	
	B&B walk off into the distance with the TV.
	
					BEAVIS
			Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever
			gonna score?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're
			too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Shut up, dill-hole.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Butt-dumpling...
	
					BEAVIS
			Turd-burglar...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Dill-wad...
	
					BEAVIS
			Bunghole...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Butt-snatch...
	
					BEAVIS
			Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... dill, um, face...
	
					BEAVIS
			Um... ass... head...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... butt-snatch...
	
					BEAVIS
			You already said that, Butt-Head.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh...
	
	B&B head off into the sunset, trading lame insults as we FADE OUT.
