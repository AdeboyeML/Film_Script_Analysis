          EXT JERSEY CITY- DAY
          
          Dec 21st. Clear sky, snow on the ground. Cold as fuck. With
          the sounds of laughter and music, we MOVE IN ON:
          
          
          INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY
          
          An office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy
          receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced
          reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners...
          
          MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH THE PARTY TO AN OPEN OFFICE DOOR.
          Arriving just in time for the door to SLAM in our face.
          
          
          INT OFFICE- DAY
          
          A woman stomps back over to her desk and picks up her pen.
          MEET CASSIDY DALEY (dirty blond, striking, manic energy). Ink-
          stained fingers, notepads in every pocket: Cass doesn't have
          time for office parties, she's working.
          
          Her door cracks open and STEWART (almost as good looking as
          he thinks he is) appears, holding a Kahlua bottle.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm working, Stewart.
          
                              STEWART
                    Come on, take a break. (enticing)
                    I've got Kahlua...
          
          Cass picks up a stapler and LAUNCHES it at Stewart's head.
          Stewart DUCKS OUT just in time. The phone rings. Answering:
          
                              CASS
                    Cassidy Daley. Talk to me.
          
                              JIMMY (O.S.)
                    It's Jimmy. Tell me you love me.
          
                              CASS
                    Depends on what you got.
          
                              JIMMY (O.S.)
                    I've got a confirmed place and
                    time.
          
          Cass is on her feet, excited.
          
                              CASS
                    I love you! So, when? Where?
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.S.)
                    You think I'm gonna say this shit
                    over the phone? I could get killed.
                    Just meet me at the usual place.
                    Oh, and Cass? This one's gonna cost
                    an extra hundred.
          
          CLICK. He hangs up. Cass drops the phone, grabs her stuff.
          
          
          INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY
          
          Cass races for the elevator, Stewart hot on her heels:
          
                              STEWART
                    Where ya going?
          
                              CASS
                    Hooters. I go there for the hot
                    wings.
          
                              STEWART
                    Please. Nobody goes there for the
                    hot wings. You got a tip.
          
                              CASS
                    You got a hundred bucks on you?
          
          Stewart considers this, then hands her 5 20's.
          
                              STEWART
                    Now are you gonna let me in on it?
          
                               CASS
                    Sorry. No can do. I have to protect
                    my source.
          
                              STEWART
                    You know what? We need to talk
                    about our relationship.
          
                              CASS
                    We don't have a relationship. We
                    made out 3 years ago in the copy
                    room. I was drunk. I was broken-
                    hearted. I would have made out with
                    the xerox machine.
          
                              STEWART
                    Yes, but you made out with me.
          
                              CASS
                    I have to go.
          
                                                                   3.
          
          
          She exits. He shouts after her:
          
                              STEWART
                    I want in on that story!
          
          
          EXT STREET/JERSEY CITY- DAY
          
          Cass driving like a maniac, doing the one thing she loves:
          TRACKING A STORY...
          
          
          EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY
          
          MOVING IN ON- A BEAT-UP HONDA CIVIC (JIMMY'S CAR) IN THE BACK
          CORNER OF THE LOT...
          
          INT JIMMY'S CAR- DAY
          
          JIMMY (20's, goatee, Mets baseball hat, nervous) sits in his
          car, rolling a cigarette while he waits for Cass.
          
          Jimmy puts the cigarette in his mouth and pulls out a
          lighter. Just as he flips the lighter open, HIS FRONT
          WINDSHIELD EXPLODES. A MAN HOLDING A TIRE IRON (MAHLER,
          heavyset, crew-cut, rarely speaks, all business) reaches
          through the broken window, AND DRAGS JIMMY OUT OF THE CAR...
          
          
          EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY
          
          Cass drives into the lot and pulls up next to Jimmy's car.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey, Jimmy, I...
          
          She realizes he is not in the car. THEN SHE SEES THE BROKEN
          GLASS ALL OVER THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
          
                                 CASS
                    Jimmy?
          
          SCREECHING TIRES behind her. Cass glances up and sees JIMMY'S
          BASEBALL HAT IN THE BACK WINDOW OF A GREY CHEVY. The Chevy is
          racing out into traffic. Cass throws her car into reverse...
          
          
          INT CASS' CAR- DAY
          
          Cass tries to follow the grey Chevy, but GETS STUCK AT A RED
          LIGHT. Shit. She looks around, decides fuck it, and HITS THE
          GAS. Her car leaps into the intersection. SIRENS.
          
                                                                   4.
          
          
          Cass looks into her rearview mirror: A PATROL CAR IS RIGHT
          BEHIND HER, signalling for her to pull over. Up ahead, the
          Chevy is getting away.
          
          Cass debates: pull over? Or follow the story? No contest. SHE
          SLAMS ON THE GAS AND HER CAR SURGES OUT OF FRAME...
          
          
          EXT STREET- DAY
          
          Cass' car SPEEDS down the street, A COP CAR IN CLOSE
          PURSUIT...
          
          
          INT CASS' CAR- DAY
          
          Cass is losing sight of the Chevy. She races around traffic
          and is suddenly HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE SIDE OF A MOVING VAN.
          She panics, WRENCHING the wheel to the right...
          
          
          EXT STREET- DAY
          
          CASS' CAR JUMPS THE CURB, CROSSES A LAWN, AND SKIDS TO A HALT
          ON THE FRONT STEPS OF A CHURCH. THE COP CAR RACES UP AND
          BLOCKS HER IN.
          
          
          EXT CHURCH- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Cass is out of her car now, arguing with a cop who has her by
          the arm:
          
                              CASS
                    Let go of me, I'm a reporter, I'm
                    warning you...
          
          The cop pulls her towards his squad car. Cass leans over and
          SINKS HER TEETH INTO THE COP'S HAND. The cop screams.
          
          FREEZE FRAME.
          
          CHIRON: "24 HOURS LATER"
          
          CLOSE ON- A NEWSPAPER COLUMN WITH CASS' PHOTO: windswept
          hair, head tilted coyly, smile that says "I'm on top of the
          world. Beneath the photo, the byline: "CASSIDY DALEY".
          
          Someone whistles "We Wish You a Merry Xmas" as a MARKER
          improves on the photo: MOUSTACHE, BUCK-TEETH, PIMPLES. Then a
          MATCH enters frame, and SETS THE PHOTO ON FIRE.
          
                               VOICE
                    Milo!

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
          
          INT CRYSTAL'S BAR/JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Holding the flaming photo, MEET MILO: rumpled shirt, messy
          hair, looks like he slept on the floor. The bartender
          (CRYSTAL, 50's, Eastern European) scowls at him:
          
                              CRYSTAL
                    What did I say about the fires?
          
                              MILO
                    You said "please set fires in my
                    bar". Wait, no, that's not right.
                    "Please don't set fires in my bar".
                    (off her look) Ok, jeez, you try to
                    get in the holiday spirit...
          
          He drops the flaming photo to the floor, pours his drink on
          it, then GRINDS IT TO PIECES WITH HIS SHOE.
          
                              CRYSTAL
                    Shouldn't you be working?
          
                              MILO
                    That's the beauty of my job,
                    Crystal. Tracking down idiots is
                    something you can do pretty much
                    anywhere. See, there's one...
          
          He points to A DRUNK DRAPED OVER THE JUKEBOX, MOURNFULLY
          SINGING ALONG TO CHRISTINA AQUILLERA'S "I AM BEAUTIFUL".
          
                              MILO
                    And there's another one...
          
          Pointing to A WOMAN TRYING TO RIP A PAY PHONE FROM THE WALL.
          
                              MILO
                    And there's...
          
          Glances at the TV, which is showing LIVE FOOTAGE OF AN XMAS
          PARADE. Looks closer, recognizes someone, groans:
          
                              MILO
                    I don't believe it. That idiot. (to
                    Crystal) Save my seat.
          
          Tosses back his drink and SPLITS.
          
                                                                      6.

          Milo climbs into a Cadillac: dents, patches of rust, cracked
          windshield, bumper askew.
          
          RACK TO: half a block away, A DARK SEDAN IDLES AT THE CURB.
          
          
          INT DARK SEDAN- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The man behind the wheel (DWIGHT, large, babyfaced, Metallica
          t-shirt) eats a hoagie as he watches Milo get into his car.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    There you are, you dipshit.
          
          He takes a last bite then tosses the sandwich and pulls away
          from the curb, tailing the Cadillac.
          
          
          EXT JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          MOVE IN ON- the parade we just saw on TV. Baton twirlers in
          Santa Hats. Men dressed like reindeer, pulling a sleigh. A
          boys choir singing "Joy to the World", the kids dressed like
          orphans that escaped a Broadway musical.
          
          A beautiful scene, if you like that sort of thing.
          
          RACK TO- the Cadillac, half a block away, cruising sideways
          into a spot just beneath a "TEMPORARY TOW-AWAY" sign. MILO
          climbs out of the car. Shoves his way through the crowd to
          the curb, cracking open a can of Pabst.
          
          Milo does not like this sort of thing. He scans the crowd
          impatiently.
          
          Meanwhile, THE CAR THAT WAS FOLLOWING HIM parks half a block
          away. DWIGHT emerges and heads for:
          
          MILO, who has just found what he's looking for. The reindeer
          are passing him and he makes eye contact with RUDOLPH, who
          does a double-take.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, you. Rudolph. Come here, you
                    fucking ding-dong.
          
          Milo takes a step towards Rudolph and DWIGHT APPEARS IN
          MILO'S PATH, BLOCKING HIM.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    We have to stop meeting this way.
          
                                                                      7.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Not now, Dwight.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    You owe my boss money.
          
                              MILO
                        (LAUGHING)
                    Hey, I owe everybody money.
          
          Suddenly, DWIGHT PUNCHES MILO IN THE GUT. Milo doubles-up,
          gasping, then BRINGS HIS HEAD UP QUICK, CATCHING DWIGHT ON
          THE CHIN. Dwight goes flying sideways and MEETS A POLICE
          BARRIER FACE-FIRST. Ouch.
          
          The barrier tips over, knocking over the one next to it. THE
          REST GO LIKE DOMINOS. Milo turns to see that RUDOLPH HAS
          DISAPPEARED. Then he catches sight of the ANTLERS, working
          their way through the crowd. Milo lunges after him and
          Rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid
          Milo. THE SLEIGH FLIPS. Santa tumbles from the sled. PACKAGES
          RAIN DOWN ON REINDEER LIKE SHRAPNEL.
          
          All of a sudden, IT'S THE XMAS FROM HELL: BLOODY REINDEER
          STUMBLING AROUND, SANTA UNCONSCIOUS IN THE GUTTER, KIDS
          SCREAMING, PARENTS PANICKING. Meanwhile, MILO IS GAINING ON
          RUDOLPH, who picks up one of the packages and throws it. IT
          CRACKS MILO IN THE HEAD. Just what Milo has been waiting for:
          
                              MILO
                        (BEAMING)
                    I am so happy you did that.
          
          Milo TACKLES RUDOLPH TO THE GROUND. Around them, people
          scream and scatter. One boy bursts into tears:
          
                              BOY
                    That man is killing Rudolph!
          
          SIRENS. Uh-oh. Cops SWARM the scene, surrounding Milo and
          Rudolph, GUNS DRAWN. The LEAD COP (GELMAN, short, over-
          zealous) steps forward:
          
                              GELMAN
                    Release the reindeer!
          
          Release the reindeer? Milo looks around. He's got 8 or so
          guns pointed his way and Rudolph gasping at his feet. MILO
          STARTS TO LAUGH. Gelman bristles:
          
                              GELMAN
                    Hands behind your head, asshole!
          
                                                                     8.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Take it easy, skippy, I'm just
                    doing my job.
          
          Milo flashes his ID. Gelman inspects it, rolls his eyes.
          
                              GELMAN
                    Bounty hunter. Figures. Why don't
                    you get a real job?
          
                              MILO
                    So I can be like you patrol boys
                    and sit around all day with my
                    thumb up my ass?
          
          Gelman turns bright red.
          
                              GELMAN
                    What did you just say?
          
          Suddenly, a sergeant (BOBBY, late 30's, obnoxious but
          likeable, Milo's ex-partner) marches onto the scene, takes
          one look at Milo and laughs.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Milo Boyd. I shoulda known.
          
                              GELMAN
                    Sarg, you know this asshole?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Yeah. I know this asshole. Guy used
                    to be one of us.

          EXT STREET- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Milo drags Rudolph through the crowd towards his car. Bobby
          follows, shaking his head, bemused expression on his face.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Look, Milo, I know this is a tough
                    time of year for you...
          
                              MILO
                    This isn't a tough time of year for
                    me. It's Christmas. Who doesn't
                    love Christmas?
          
                              BOBBY
                    ...and I try to be sensitive to
                    your situation...
          
                                                                    9.
          
          
                              MILO
                    What situation? Being a man who
                    works his own hours and has his
                    freedom and lives the high life?
          
                              BOBBY
                    ...because I realize you're
                    unhappy.
          
                              MILO
                    Unhappy? Are you kidding me, Bob?
                    Look at me: I'm the happiest man
                    alive.
          
          Just then, they come to where Milo left his car. IT'S GONE.
          Bobby squints at the huge "TOW-AWAY" sign:
          
                              BOBBY
                    That sign is pretty hard to see.
          
          And with that, Milo loses it:
          
                              MILO
                    AAAHHH!
          
          He rips the sign off the pole. Stomps on it. Kicks it. Tries
          to shred it with his teeth. Hmm. He doesn't really seem like
          the happiest man alive. Rudolph, to Bobby:
          
                              RUDOLPH
                    Take me to jail. Please?
          
          
          INT BOBBY'S CAR- EARLY EVENING
          
          Bobby's car is decorated with photos of his many children,
          all of whom look exactly like him, even the girls, poor kids.
          
          Milo's in front by Bobby, Rudolph's handcuffed in the back.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok, I got one for ya: why doesn't
                    Santa have any children? Cause he
                    only comes once a year and when he
                    does, it's down a chimney.
          
          Rudolph snickers. Milo does not. Bobby glances at Milo.
          
                              BOBBY
                    So. Have you talked to her lately?
          
                              MILO
                    Talked to who?
          
                                                                  10.
          
          
                               BOBBY
                    Katie Couric, motherfucker, who do
                    you think?
          
                              MILO
                    I haven't talked to her in three
                    years, why would I talk to her now?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Well, for one thing, so you can
                    stop taking out your rage on
                    innocent bystanders.
          
                              RUDOLPH
                        (piping up from the back)
                    Talk to her, man. For real.
          
          Milo reaches back, gags Rudolph with his own scarf.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Do what you want. But this kind of
                    shit will eat a hole in your
                    intestines, you don't deal with it.
          
          
          EXT POLICE STATION/JERSEY CITY- EARLY EVENING
          
          They pull up. Milo exits the car, pulls Rudolph from the
          back. Bobby leans out.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Hey, why don't you come by the
                    precinct tomorrow for our Xmas
                    bash?
          
                              MILO
                    I'm not invited. I'm not a cop
                    anymore, remember?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Fuck that, I'm inviting you.
          
                              MILO
                    I don't know, Bob. I'm sorta busy.
          
                              BOBBY
                    That's what I'm worried about.
                    (sighing) Just...take it easy, Ok?
          
          Bobby really seems worried, but Milo waves him off. Bobby
          drives over, parks by other cop cars. Gets out, mingles with
          some cops. Laughter, inside jokes. Milo watches from afar.
          
                                                                   11.

                              MILO
                    Do I look like I need advice from a
                    grown man in antlers?
          
          Milo gags Rudolph and drags him into the station.

          INT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING
          
          Hazy pieces: a tilting clock on the wall. A battered metal
          desk. Filing cabinets, spitting up papers. A man, SID (wound
          sorta tight, Milo's best friend) peers down at us:
          
                              SID
                    You're drooling on my sofa.
          
          Milo unsticks his face from the leather couch, wobbles
          upright. Are the walls throbbing, or is it just him?
          
                              SID
                    You do have an apartment, don't
                    you? With a bed of some kind?
          
          Milo grunts. Sid hands him a coffee.
          
                              SID
                    Heard you shut down 5th Street
                    yesterday. Gave every kid in the
                    county the gift of nightmares.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, I'm a giving kind of guy.
                    Anyway, what do you care? I brought
                    your guy in, right?
          
          Milo holds out his hand, palm up. Sid COUNTS MONEY INTO HIS
          PALM.
          
          
          EXT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING
          
          Swearing under his breath, Sid is trying to stuff a Xmas tree
          into the back of a station wagon. At least half of the tree
          is hanging out of the back. Milo drinks a beer and watches.
          
                                                                 12.
          
          
                              SID
                    You gonna give me a hand, or just
                    stand there killing your liver?
          
                              MILO
                    Is that a trick question?
          
          Sid glares at him. Milo sighs, puts down his beer, and grabs
          part of the tree.
          
                              SID
                    So I told her, fine, I'd handle
                    Xmas this year. I mean, what's to
                    handle? You buy a tree, some gifts,
                    cook a ham, hang some lights. An
                    idiot could do it.
          
                              MILO
                    Well, we'll soon find out.
          
          Sid checks him out.
          
                              SID
                    You have plans for the holiday?
          
                                 MILO
                    The usual.
          
                              SID
                    Gonna drink some cheap whiskey and
                    put your fist through a wall?
          
                                 MILO
                    Jealous?
          
          The tree is definitely not going to fit. They let it go, and
          Sid pulls out a small hand saw.
          
                              SID
                    Then forget it.
          
                              MILO
                    Forget what?
          
                              SID
                    I've got an open bond, but your
                    thing sounds like more fun. I'll
                    give it to Doug instead.
          
          Sid starts hacking away at the tree.
          
                                                                 13.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Whoa. Hold up, Heidi. What the
                    fuck. I want the job, I'm in the
                    hole.
          
                              SID
                    You're always in the hole.
          
                              MILO
                    What's your point?
          
                              SID
                        (SIGHING)
                    The truth is, I'm not sure you're
                    the right person for this job. It
                    could be a total disaster. On the
                    other hand, when one friend sees
                    another friend stagnating in his
                    own filth, he has to do something,
                    right?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. I just woke up. I was gonna
                    shower.
          
          Sid drops the saw. With one final shove, the tree is in.
          Phew. Sid slams the back shut.
          
                              SID
                    Ok. But remember: you asked for it.
          
          He reaches into his pocket and extracts A FOLDED PIECE OF
          PAPER. Hands it to Milo. Milo unfolds it, gives it a quick
          look. A second look. A third.

                    I'm gonna have to kill you.

                    She got arrested? And then she
                    jumped bail?
          
                              SID
                    Apparently the whole thing started
                    with some reckless driving, and
                    ended with her assaulting a police
                    officer.

                    Yeah. That sounds like her.
                    But here's my question: why the
                    hell did you post her bail?

                              MILO
                    No, not "whatever". I dumped her.
          
                              SID
                    The point is, I'm aware you guys
                    have issues, but I'm running a
                    business here. A person needs bail,
                    I don't have time to check with you
                    first.
          
                              MILO
                    Well, had you checked with me
                    first, you wouldn't be out of a
                    bond right now.

                    pick her up. It's five grand to
                    bring her back by 9am, Xmas day.

          Milo takes a deep, calming breath. Then he EXPLODES into
          whoops and hollers. He throws himself into a snow bank and
          thrashes around. He does a Fred Astaire around a lamp post.

                    I take it you're interested.
          
          Milo grabs Sid and pulls him into a crushing bear hug.
          
                              MILO
                    I love you! You're the best friend
                    a guy could ever have!

                    Ok, take it easy...
          
          TERESA (mid 40's, overly made-up, popping gum) pokes her head
          out the front door:
          
                              TERESA
                    Sid, you got a DUI on line one.
                    (off their looks) What's going on?
          
          Milo drops Sid, grabs Teresa, and gives HER A LONG, INTENSE
          KISS. He releases her. She stumbles back a bit.
          
                              TERESA
                    Ok. (beat) Can I have my gum back?
          
                              MILO
                    Right. Sorry.
          
          He reaches into his mouth, extracts her gum and hands it to
          her. She retreats back inside. Milo beams at Sid.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what this is, don't you?
                    Karma! Payback! You know how they
                    say "What goes around comes

                    over a stupid article.
          
                              MILO
                    We didn't break up over a stupid
                    article. We broke up because she is
                    a cheating, manipulative liar.
          
                              SID
                    Are you sure you can handle this?
          
                              MILO
                    Why wouldn't I be able to handle
                    this?
          
                              SID
                    Let's face it: you're not exactly
                    rational around her. I mean, if I
                    was a cop working a case and some
                    reporter came snooping around, I'd
                    say "no comment". Not "no comment,
                    but care for a cocktail"? And then
                    a month later, running off to some
                    love shack called "Caveman's Cabin"
                    and tying the knot? Who does that?
          
                              MILO
                    That's not even close to what
                    happened. For one thing, it was
                    called "Cupid's Cabin". And for
                    another, that was before I knew how
                    conniving she was. Now I know. So
                    all I have to do is track her down,
                    cuff her up, and bring her in.
                    (checking his watch) And I've got,
                    what, two days? Shit, man. Easy as

          sheet and inspects it. CASS' CELL PHONE NUMBER IS LISTED.
          Pulls out his cell phone, then hesitates. He glances around
          and sees a PAY PHONE ACROSS THE WAY.

          for them to pass, when her phone rings.
          
          She checks it ("PAY PHONE") and answers:

          crosses Milo's face. Cass goes pale.
          
          Milo takes a step forward. Cass takes a step back. Milo

          PHOTOS OF CASS WITH VARIOUS PUBLIC FIGURES: the home of a
          successful and dedicated journalist.

          Milo is halfway across the room when he realizes he has left
          a set of MUDDY PRINTS across the formerly pristine white rug.

          NOW THERE ARE FOOTPRINTS CRISS-CROSSING THE FLOOR, RUNNING UP
          OVER THE COUCH, ETC. Looks like Milo had a little field day
          here. He is taking a closer look at the shelves: no photos of
          a boyfriend, family, pets: IT'S ALL WORK.
          
          He picks up one of the framed articles with the headline
          "LOCAL REPORTER WINS AWARD FOR BREAKING UP 13TH STREET DRUG

          IMPORTANT-LOOKING OFFICIAL.

          as he replaces the frame and draws his gun. A couple careful

                    ...and this loser she's dating
                    looks like he buys his clothes from

          Sid is at home, trying to get the hacked up Xmas tree to
          stand up straight. His 5 and 6 year old sons beat on each
          other in the background.
          
                              SID
                    Why do you care?
          
                              MILO
                    I don't. I just think it's funny.
          
                              SID
                    Hilarious. Listen to me: you guys
                    made a terrible couple.
          
                              MILO
                    I know that. You don't have to tell
                    me that.

                    Relationships aren't about
                    competition, they're about
                    compromise.
          
                              MILO
                    You mean like when your wife wants
                    to do one thing, and you want to do
                    another, and you compromise by
                    doing what she wants?
          
                              SID
                    Exactly. Now just get her here.
                    Cause I can't afford to lose this
                    bond.
          
                              MILO
                    No worries. In fact, I already know
                    where she is and I'm gonna go pick
                    her up right now.

          Milo exits his car and heads inside. STEWART, feeling super
          sly, pulls up to a space near Milo's car, but another car
          slips into the spot.

          mother) opens the door, takes one look at Milo, SLAMS the
          door shut. Milo waits. After a moment, Lois opens it again.
          
                              MILO
                    Happy to see you, too.

          recovered Lois sits by a make-up mirror, adjusting a wig.
          Stuck to her mirror is a PHOTO OF MILO AND CASS, ARMS AROUND
          EACH OTHER, SMILING. Milo gives the photo a dirty look.

                    impersonator.

                    me with this.
          
          She stands and wiggles into an evening gown. Milo struggles
          with the zipper.

                    Oh, Milo, where did it all go
                    wrong? Do you have any idea what it
                    means to waste a woman's child-
                    bearing years? It's criminal. Every
                    month her eggs are jumping out of
                    her ovaries like sailors abandoning
                    a sinking ship. I mean, I know you
                    were mad about that article...
          
                              MILO

                    just a girl who wants to be
                    protected and loved by her man.
                    What happened between the two of
                    you devastated her.

                              LOIS (cont'd)
                    I must admit, it makes me proud to
                    think that my little girl, whose
                    only friend growing up was an
                    imaginary orphan with a tin leg
                    named Leslie, now gets invited to
                    tour the White House...
          
          Milo's jaw hits the floor.

                    She got to tour the White House?
          
          Now he really wants to take Cass to jail.
          
                              MILO
                    Tell me where she is, Lois.
          
                              LOIS
                    Oh, who knows. She was running
                    around like a chicken with its head
                    cut off, said she was on the
                    biggest story of her career. Said
                    she was going somewhere to think.
          
          Milo thinks this over, then a grin breaks out on his face.

                              CASS
                    Congratulations. Move your leg.
          
          Milo doesn't budge. Spelling it out for her:
          
                              MILO
                    What I do is, I track down
                    criminals. People who jumped bail.
                    Idiots who decided to go on the run
                    after biting police officers. I
                    find them, and I take them to jail.
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          Cass stares at him, eyes wide:
          
                              CASS
                    Now, hold on just a second, Milo...
          
                              MILO
                    Tell you what: I'll give you more
                    than a second. I'll give you 10.
                    For old times sake.
          
          Milo moves his leg, kicks back, starts to count.
          
                              MILO
                    10...9...8...
          
          Cass stares at him, her jaw working, trying to decide what to
          do. Then, all of a sudden, she BOLTS. Milo smiles. THE
          LOUDSPEAKERS ANNOUNCE: "AND THEY'RE OFF!"
          
          
          EXT RACETRACK PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass jumps into her car and turns the key. NOTHING. She tries
          again, then hears soft laughter. MILO IS SEVERAL YARDS AWAY,
          HER BATTERY IN HIS HAND.
          
                              MILO
                    Strike one.
          
          Cass leaps from the car and runs.
          
          
          INT STADIUM- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass runs for the elevator. It opens and people exit,
          REVEALING MILO:
          
                              MILO
                    Strike two.
          
          Cass turns heel and bolts.
          
          
          EXT STADIUM- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass races out, flagging a taxi. Milo pulls up:
          
                              MILO
                    Strike three. Get in.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not going to jail, Milo.
          
                                                                     34.
          
          
                              MILO
                    I beg to differ.
          
          She heads for the cabs. Milo exits his car, GUN IN HAND.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh please. Like you're gonna shoot
                    me.
          
                              MILO
                    Nope. (loudly) I'm gonna shoot a
                    cab driver.
          
          Head whip around in his direction. THEN EVERY CAB IN THE
          PLACE GOES OFF-DUTY. Cass stomps her foot, furious.
          
                              CASS
                    Chicken shits.
          
          Cass marches back over to Milo.
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, look: let's talk about this.
          
                               MILO
                    Ok.
          
          With that, Milo sweeps her up into his arms. AND THEY FIND
          THEMSELVES FACE TO FACE. BREATHING ON EACH OTHER. THEIR LIPS
          INCHES APART.
          
          Cass stares at Milo. Is he gonna kiss her? Again, she feels
          weird. Confused.
          
                              CASS
                        (UNCOMFORTABLE)
                    Listen, Milo, I'm not sure we
                    should...
          
          Suddenly, MILO DUMPS HER IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey, wait a minute!
          
          He smiles at her, waves, then SLAMS down the lid.
          
          CUT TO BLACK. Well, now she knows exactly how she feels:
          FURIOUS:
          
                               CASS (O.S.)
                    Bastard.
          
          CHIRON: "2:00 PM. ROUTE 9 NORTH. 43 HOURS TO GO".

          And immediately: A PHONE RINGS.
          
                              CASS (O.S.)
                    Great. Perfect timing.
          
          A match is struck, illuminating the trunk as Cass scrambles
          for her phone. Trying to sound professional:
          
                              CASS
                    Cassidy Daley.
          
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          CLOSE ON- JIMMY, head tilted back, tense smile on his face.
          PULL BACK a little to reveal the GUN MAHLER IS HOLDING UNDER
          HIS CHIN.
          
                              JIMMY
                    It's me. Jimmy.
          
                              CASS
                        (exhaling with relief)
                    Shit, Jimmy, I thought you were
                    dead.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Don't be silly. (hurrying on)
                    Listen: you didn't happen to go to
                    my place and find that envelope I
                    left, did you?
          
                              CASS
                    I did, but I don't really get it,
                    what's "Sparrow"?
          
                              JIMMY
                    It doesn't matter. Did you tell
                    anyone else about this story?
          
                              CASS
                    Are you kidding? You think I want
                    to share a story like this?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Ok. Good. Cause the truth is, there
                    is no story. I made the whole thing
                    up. So you should just drop it...
          
                              CASS
                    Uh-uh, no way are you backing out
                    on me now, Jimmy. This story is way
                    too good...
          
                                                                 36.
          
          
          Mahler nudges Jimmy.
          
                              JIMMY
                        (QUICKLY)
                    Where are you?
          
                              CASS
                    I'm at the Atlantic City Boardwalk.
                    Actually, I'm in the trunk of my ex-
                    husband's car. Long story. More
                    importantly, where are you?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    I'm...
          
          CLICK. MAHLER DISCONNECTS THE PHONE.
          
          ON CASS- she stares at her phone. Uh-oh:
          
                              CASS
                    Jimmy? Hello?
          
          Suddenly, MUSIC KICKS IN and we hear MILO SINGING AT THE TOP
          OF HIS LUNGS:
          
                              MILO (O.S.)
                    Deck the halls with boughs of

          Now Milo really is the happiest man alive. He pulls out his
          cell phone, dials:
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          Teresa removes her gum, sticks it on her mouse-pad, answers:

                              MILO
                    Guess who's in my trunk?
          
                              TERESA
                    Is that some sort of perverted
                    innuendo? Who is this?
          
                              MILO
                    Aw, come on, Teresa, you know it's
                    me. Put Sid on.
          
                                                                 37.

                    thinks he can handle Xmas.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, just tell him I got her and
                    I'll be back in 2 hours. I want a
                    bonus for bringing her in so quick.
          
                              TERESA
                    Yeah? I want a bonus for getting
                    through the holidays without
                    stabbing anyone with a fork.
          
                              MILO
                    Don't be such a pessimist. You
                    still have time.
          
          His phone beeps. IT'S CASS CALLING FROM THE TRUNK.
          
                              MILO
                    Gotta go. I got another call.
          
          He clicks over.
          
                              MILO
                    Tina's Thai massage! Where every
                    ending is a happy one!

          Cass rolls her eyes.
          
                               CASS
                    You're disgusting. Let me out of
                    the trunk.
          
                              MILO
                    Hmm. Nope. By the way, your
                    boyfriend Stewart's been following
                    me. Unfortunately, I had to ditch
                    him at the track.
          
                              CASS
                    Why is Stewart..? (realizing) And
                    wait: who said he's my boyfriend?
          
                              MILO
                    Aw, don't be embarrassed. These
                    things happen. You were drunk when
                    you guys hooked up, right?
          
          Cass turns bright red. She was drunk when they hooked up.
          Changing tactics, she tries to flatter him:
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
                              CASS
                    You know what, Milo? I shouldn't
                    have run from you like that. I
                    was...I don't know. You caught me
                    off-guard. The truth is, I'm kind
                    of in some trouble and I could
                    really use your help.
          
                              MILO
                    Bad news for you, then. I wouldn't
                    help you if you were the very last
                    baby sea turtle in the world,
                    dragging its tiny weak body across
                    the burning hot sand while sea
                    gulls circled overhead. I'd just
                    pull up a chair, sip a pina colada,
                    and let nature take its course.
          
          Long beat. Suddenly, CASS STARTS TO SOB. LOUD, HYSTERICAL
          SOBS. Milo listens for a moment, out of a purely clinical
          interest, then:
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, I used to be a sucker, but no
                    more. You can cry til the cows come
                    home, for all I care.
          
          Cass instantly stops crying and slams her phone shut.
          
          CUT TO BLACK. Then, the sound of a trunk opening, and WE ARE
          INSIDE A CAR TRUNK, LOOKING UP AT: MAHLER.
          
          
          EXT TRUMP CASINO PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON
          
          Mahler reaches into his trunk and REMOVES HIS HANDGUN. Checks
          the cartridge, pockets the gun. Slams the trunk shut.
          
          He climbs into his front seat, and as he pulls out of the
          lot, we see CASS' NEWSPAPER PHOTO THAT HAS BEEN RIPPED FROM
          THE PAPER, on the passenger seat.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          Milo drives along happily humming when, suddenly, A SMALL
          TRAIL OF SMOKE drifts over his shoulder. What the hell...? He
          glances into the rearview mirror and:
          
          SMOKE IS POURING OUT OF THE TRUNK!
          
                              MILO
                    Holy shit! (calling out) Hey, um,
                    Cass? (no response) Cassidy?
          
                                                                  39.
          
          
          Still nothing. Milo jerks the car to the right, and SLAMS on
          the brakes.
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          The car screeches to a halt on the embankment. Milo leaps out
          of the driver's door and races to back, fumbling with his
          keys. SMOKE CONTINUES TO POUR OUT OF THE TRUNK.
          
                              MILO
                    It's Ok, hang on, I'm coming...
          
          Gets the key in, pops the lid and sees: CASS, HANDKERCHIEF
          OVER HER NOSE, PACK OF FLAMING MATCHES IN HAND. Cass tosses
          the matches and handkerchief, AND PUNCHES MILO IN THE BALLS.
          
          Milo groans and crumbles to the ground. Cass jumps out of the
          trunk and stands over him:
          
                              CASS
                    You know something, Milo? You're
                    one of the most gullible...
          
          BAM, Milo grabs her ankle and JERKS and Cass hits the ground.
          Next thing you know, IT'S WWF TIME, THE TWO OF THEM ROLLING
          IN THE DIRT.
          
          Milo gets her pinned, but Cass grabs his ear and TWISTS:
          
                                 MILO
                    AAAAHHH...
          
          He pulls her arm behind her back...
          
                              CASS
                    Ow ow ow...
          
          ...and she jerks her head back, SMACKING him in the nose.
          
                              MILO
                    Son of a...
          
          He gets her in a BEAR HUG...
          
                                 CASS
                    AAGH...
          
          ...and she BITES him.
          
                                 MILO
                    OW...
          
                                                                  40.
          
          
          Finally, he has her on her back, TRAPPED. He gets his face
          right over hers and STARTS TO LET A GLOB OF SALIVA FALL FROM
          HIS MOUTH TOWARDS HER FACE.
          
                              CASS
                    NOOOO! Uncle, uncle, uncle!
          
          Milo collapses onto the ground next to her, laughing. She
          looks at him and she starts laughing too.
          
                              CASS
                    Dirty fighter.
          
                              MILO
                    Me? I'm the dirty fighter?
          
          They both laugh harder. Then Milo stands and offers her a
          hand. She takes it, and he helps her up. Awkward pause as
          they look at each other.
          
                               CASS
                    Should we...I don't know...hug, or
                    something?
          
                              MILO
                    Sure. What the hell.
          
          He opens his arms. She moves closer. They hug. Milo feels her
          hands moving towards the gun in his belt. He smirks. CLICK.
          HE SNAPS SOME HANDCUFFS ONTO HER WRISTS.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey. I had to try, right?
          
                              MILO
                    Get in the car.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          They are driving along, both a little dishevelled, ONE OF
          CASS' HANDS CUFFED TO THE PASSENGER DOOR. They pass casinos
          as they head out of Atlantic City.
          
                              CASS
                    Your windshield's cracked.
          
                              MILO
                    Thanks, Captain Obvious.
          
          Cass turns to inspect him more closely.
          
                                                                  41.
          
          
                               CASS
                    And you look like shit, Milo. What
                    have you been doing, sleeping on
                    the floor?
          
          Milo has been sleeping on the floor.
          
                              MILO
                    I enjoy sleeping on the floor.
                    Matter of fact, I love sleeping on
                    the floor. I love everything about
                    my life. Great job, good friends,
                    hot girlfriend...
          
                              CASS
                    You have a girlfriend?
          
                              MILO
                        (he does not)
                    Yes I do.
          
          Cass is skeptical:
          
                              CASS
                    Really? What's her name?
          
                              MILO
                        (the first name that pops
                         into his head:)
                    Teresa. Rocking hot body. Likes to
                    cook pasta for me and perform strip-
                    teases.
          
                              CASS
                    Wow. Is she missing a chromosome?
          
                              MILO
                    Oh, she has all her chromosomes,
                    believe you me.
          
          Cass thinks this over, then counters:
          
                              CASS
                    Well, my life is great, too.
          
                              MILO
                    I can tell. You and Stewart make a
                    great couple, by the way. You and
                    me made a terrible couple. But you
                    two? Like peas in a pod.
          
          About to deny that she and Stewart are a couple, it occurs to
          Cass: Milo seems a little JEALOUS. She jumps on this:
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              CASS
                    You know what I like about Stewart?
          
                              MILO
                    I can't imagine.
          
                              CASS
                    He's not you.
          
                              MILO
                    Not even on his best day.
          
                              CASS
                    Or his worst.
          
                              MILO
                    I'll bet he has a lot of those.
          
                              CASS
                    Still betting, huh?
          
                              MILO
                    You can't win if you don't play.
          
                              CASS
                    Or, in your case, even if you do.
          
          He shoots her a sharp look. She stares back, waiting.
          
                              MILO
                    I win all the time.
          
                              CASS
                    Really? I hadn't noticed.
          
          Ok. That is definitely a challenge.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what? Seeing as how I'm
                    about to come into five grand...
          
          Milo makes a SUDDEN TURN OFF THE HIGHWAY and pulls into the
          parking lot of BALLY'S CASINO.
          
                               MILO
                    I think I'll do a little betting
                    right now.
          
                              CASS
                    Don't you have to take me back?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. I have two days. A monkey
                    could get you back in two days.
          
                                                                 43.
          
          
          Again: famous last words. Milo exits the car. Cass smiles to
          herself. This is obviously what she hoped would happen. She
          glances around, spots THE DUFFLE in the back seat. PEEKING
          OUT OF THE TOP OF THE DUFFLE IS THE TASER GUN. Hmm...
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          Milo opens her door.
          
                              CASS
                    Aren't you afraid I'll get away?
          
                                 MILO
                    Nope.
          
          He uncuffs her from the door, CUFFS HER TO HIS OWN WRIST.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- AFTERNOON
          
          Stewart is heading back to the city, cursing his bad luck,
          when he happens to glance over and see MILO AND CASS HEADING
          INTO BALLY'S CASINO.
          
                              STEWART
                    Damn, I'm good!
          
          He makes a quick turn off the highway and into the Bally's
          parking lot.
          
          
          INT BALLY'S CASINO- AFTERNOON
          
          The clerk at the chips cage recognizes Milo as he and Cass
          APPROACH:
          
                              CLERK
                    Merry Xmas, Mr Boyd!
          
          Behind the clerk, a FEMALE CLERK perks up at this name...
          
                              CLERK
                    What a nice surprise! Let's hope
                    your luck is better today.
          
          Milo glances at Cass.
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)

                    better than great, which is how my
                    luck has been lately. Great.

          Lorraine on the phone, listening intently. Then she hangs up,

          Milo sits at a blackjack table, pulling Cass into a seat next
          to him.
          
                              MILO
                    Prepare to observe the master.
          
          He bets while Cass sits next to him, scheming:
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, how about this:
          
          She uses her free hand to pull out her wallet:
          
                              CASS
                    If I give you all the cash in my
                    wallet, will you let me go?
          
                              MILO
                    Hmm. Lemme see...
          
                                                                 45.
          
          
          He takes the cash from her and thinks for a moment.
          
                              MILO
                    Nope. Guess not.
          
          Milo adds her cash to his bet on the table.

                    Nice going, master.
          
          Milo quickly lays out some more money. A WAITRESS (smells
          like an ashtray) appears:
          
                              WAITRESS
                    And for the couple over here?
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    We're not a couple.
          
                              CASS
                        (just as quick)
                    Why would you think we were a
                    couple?
          
                              MILO
                    We used to be together. Back when I
                    was young and foolish.
          
                              CASS
                    And I was confused.
          
                              MILO
                    And I was slumming.
          
                              CASS
                    And I was drunk.
          
          The waitress looks back and forth between them.
          
                                                                 46.
          
          
                              WAITRESS
                        (BORED)
                    Great story. I have to get back to
                    work now.
          
                              MILO
                    Wait. Champagne! I'm celebrating.
          
          The waitress rolls her eyes and leaves. Milo turns to see he
          has lost more money.
          
                              MILO
                        (under his breath)
                    Son of a bitch.
          
          Ok. Cass has had enough of this. She leans closer:
          
                              CASS
                    Look, Milo, the truth is...my Mom
                    is in the hospital.
          
          Milo perks up.
          
                              MILO
                    Oh? Old Lois not feeling up to par?
          
                              CASS
                    She might be really sick. That's
                    why I had to jump bail.
          
                              MILO
                        (overly sincere)
                    Taking care of her, huh? Putting
                    aside your career for a loved one?
                    Golly, that's so you.
          
          "Golly"? Cass stares at him, realizing:
          
                              CASS
                    You've already been to see her.
          
                              MILO
                    Impressive. No wonder you got all
                    those awards. So lemme guess: the
                    real reason you jumped bail is
                    cause you're on a story.
          
          Cass narrows her eyes:
          
                              CASS
                    Stewart. Stewart told you.
          
                                                                 47.
          
          
                              MILO
                        (CAUGHT)
                    I would have figured it out on my
                    own, trust me.
          
                              CASS
                    I wouldn't trust you if you were
                    the last man alive.
          
                              MILO
                    You think about that much? Me being
                    the last man alive? Am I naked in
                    this fantasy?
          
          Cass takes a deep breath. This is getting her nowhere. But
          she is clearly hesitant to give him the real story.
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, you're right. I'm on a story.
                    A very important story. It just so
                    happens that I'm possibly about to
                    uncover a whole ring of dirty cops.
          
          Milo snorts.
          
                                CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. Isn't the whole "dirty cop"
                    thing kind of old? Maybe you should
                    do a story about something people
                    are interested in. Like internet
                    porn. Or lesbians.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm serious, Milo. This is gonna be
                    big. And here's what I'm willing to
                    do (magnanimous): I'm willing to
                    credit you in the article.
          
                              MILO
                    Oh, sure, like you credited me in
                    the 13th Street Article?
          
          Cass stares at him.
          
                              CASS
                    Why on earth would I have credited
                    you? I worked my ass off for that
                    story.
          
                              MILO
                    That's one way of putting it.
          
                                                                48.
          
          
                              CASS
                    What's that supposed to mean?
          
                              MILO
                    Forget it. I don't want to be in
                    your article. In fact, I would
                    rather eat a bowl of broken glass
                    than have my name in any way
                    associated with one of your lousy
                    articles...
          
                              CASS
                    Fine. Forget I mentioned it.
          
                              MILO
                    I already have.
          
                              CASS
                    I mean, you're not a cop anymore,
                    right? What do you care if people
                    were murdered?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. Nobody was murdered.
          
                              CASS
                    Just my source.

                    Oh yeah? How? Bullet to the back of
                    the head?
          
                              CASS
                    Well...

                    Dumped in a reservoir?
          
                              CASS
                        (FLUSTERED)
                    I don't know.
          
                              MILO
                    Car accident?
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, ok, maybe he wasn't murdered
                    yet. But I wouldn't be surprised
                    if...
          
          Milo breaks out into loud guffaws. Cass is furious.
          
                                                                   49.
          
          
                              CASS
                    Maybe this whole thing sounds like
                    no big deal to you...
          
                              MILO
                    You know what it sounds like? It
                    sounds like you're going to jail.
          
          Cass can't believe this.
          
                              CASS
                    Milo, listen, you have to believe
                    me, come on, you know me...
          
                              MILO
                        (getting red)
                    Exactly! I do know you. Which means
                    I know you are a deceptive, cold-
                    hearted bitch who is going to jail
                    where she belongs.
          
          Wow. That was pretty harsh. Cass looks at him, stunned. They
          stare at each other in silence.
          
          The waitress arrives with the drinks:
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Champagne. So. What are we
                    celebrating?
          
                              CASS
                        (GRIMLY)
                    I have to use the bathroom.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Alrightee, then. Cheers.
          
          
          EXT BALLY'S CASINO PARKING LOT- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Stewart taps his steering wheel restlessly, watching the door
          of the casino for signs of Cass and Milo. Waiting in this
          parking lot is boring. Finally, he exits his car. Sidles over
          to Milo's car. Checks the door handle.
          
          IT'S UNLOCKED. Stewart glances around, then climbs in.
          
          
          INT BALLY'S CASINO BATHROOM- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Cass enters and Milo follows:
          
                              CASS
                    Can I have some privacy, please?
          
                                                                  50.
          
          
          Milo checks the room. Looks like there is no escape from
          here. He UNCUFFS HER, but then:
          
                              MILO
                    I'm gonna have to frisk you.
          
                              CASS
                    Get it over with, then.
          
          Milo checks her pockets. Her ankles. Her legs. He goes behind
          her and checks her shoulders. Her back. He reaches around and
          checks her belly.
          
                              MILO
                    You gain a little weight?
          
                              CASS
                        (snapping back)
                    You lose a little hair?
          
          Milo reaches higher and:
          
                              CASS
                    Yeah. Right. I'm hiding a weapon in
                    my breasts.
          
          Milo backs off, turning red.
          
                              MILO
                    Make it quick.
          
          He exits. As soon as he is gone, CASS PULLS MILO'S TASER GUN
          FROM HER CLEAVAGE.

          up and sees: RAY, standing there, smiling at him.
          
                              STEWART
                    Shit, man, you startled me. (beat)
                    Can I help you?
          
                              RAY
                    Night-night.
          
          Suddenly, Ray GRABS STEWART'S HEAD AND SMASHES IT INTO THE
          STEERING WHEEL, KNOCKING HIM OUT COLD.

          Cass squints at the taser gun, trying to read the tiny
          instruction label on the side:

                    coming in...
          
          He comes in and SHE JAMS THE TASER GUN INTO HIS NECK AND HITS
          THE BUTTON. HE SCREAMS AND HITS THE FLOOR. SHE SCREAMS, DROPS
          THE TASER GUN, AND FLEES.

                    Sorry...
          
          ...and keeps going. She hurries to the curb and tries to flag
          down a ride.
          
          RACK TO- SEVERAL YARDS AWAY, THE PERSON SHE BUMPED INTO IS
          STARING AFTER HER. IT'S MAHLER. Mahler compares her to the
          newspaper photo he is holding. Yup: THAT'S HER.
          
          Cass glances around, keeping an eye out for Milo, and SPOTS
          MAHLER STARING AT HER. Suddenly, he starts heading towards
          her. Cass backs up slightly, nervous. WHO IS THAT GUY?
          
                              VOICE
                    Need a lift?
          
          Cass looks around. A trucker has pulled up next to her.
          Relieved, she quickly climbs on board.
          
          RACK TO- MAHLER, WATCHING THE TRUCK PULL AWAY. He doesn't
          seem worried. He turns and heads for his car.
          
          
          INT TRUCK- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Cass is fixing her hair, pulling herself together.
          
                                                                  52.
          
          
                              CASS
                    He says we made a terrible couple.
                    Which is true. I know that. I'm the
                    one who thought that first. I'm the
                    one who came up with that. The fact
                    is, I don't want to be with someone
                    who can't admit he was wrong.
          
                              DRIVER
                    So you're available.
          
          Cass looks at him. He smiles coyly.
          
                              CASS
                    Available for what?
          
                              DRIVER
                    I have a waterbed in my trailer.
          
                              CASS
                    I hope you don't think you're
                    telling me something that interests
                    me.
          
                              DRIVER
                    You know what I want for Xmas?
          
          The driver mouths something at her we can't see. Cass leans
          over and SMACKS HIM AS HARD AS SHE CAN.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The truck SCREECHES to a halt by the side of the road. Cass
          gets booted out the passenger door. The door is slammed shut
          behind her. Cass gives the guy the finger as he drives off.
          
          She turns to see a car headed her way. She starts flagging it
          down. But wait... Yup, IT'S MILO. Shit. She looks around, but
          where's she gonna go? Meanwhile, as Milo nears, HE SEEMS TO
          BE SPEEDING UP. Cass stares. He keeps coming, an evil look on
          his face. IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS GOING TO RUN HER OVER.
          
          She turns and STARTS TO RUN.

                    You better run.

          Cass runs into a field. Milo drives off the road and follows.
          He gets her cornered by a pen. He looks triumphant. She
          scowls. Then she throws open the pen, REVEALING A HUGE BULL.
          Now she looks triumphant. He scowls.
          
          CUT TO- BULL RAMS INTO MILO'S CAR, SLAMMING MILO'S FACE INTO
          THE STEERING WHEEL. CASS LAUGHS. THE BULL TURNS AND NOTICES
          CASS FOR THE FIRST TIME.
          
          CUT TO- BULL CHASES CASS. MILO LAUGHS. CASS RUNS FOR THE CAR.
          MILO LOCKS THE DOORS.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey, it's locked!
          
                              MILO
                        (GRINNING)
                    I know.
          
          THE BULL IS SPEEDING THEIR WAY:
          
                              CASS
                    Open the door, you son of a bitch!
          
          Finally, Milo opens it. She DIVES INTO THE CAR AND SLAMS THE
          DOOR just before the BULL RAMS INTO THE SIDE OF THE CAR.
          
          Cass and Milo watch, stunned, as the bull looks at them for a
          moment, THEN TOPPLES OVER, UNCONSCIOUS. Milo and Cass hear a
          strange sound, and look over to see A SMALL HERD OF BULLS,
          GETTING READY TO CHARGE.
          
                               CASS
                    Uh-oh...
          
          MILO HITS THE GAS AND THEY FLEE THE SCENE, THE HERD OF BULLS
          IN MAD PURSUIT. CASS AND MILO ARE BOTH NOW LAUGHING
          HYSTERICALLY...

          Ray THROWS open the bathroom door to reveal: A VERY
          DISGRUNTLED STEWART, HANDCUFFED TO THE TOILET. Stewart blinks
          up at them, disoriented.
          
          Lorraine hands Dwight THE GOLF CLUB.

                    have time for this shit.

          Milo and Cass are back on the highway, both looking a little
          worse for wear. Milo's nose is swollen, Cass' clothes are
          muddy.
          
                                                                 55.
          
          
          Milo MOVES HIS WEAPONS FROM THE DUFFLE INTO HIS OWN JACKET
          WHILE HE DRIVES. He smirks at Cass.
          
                              CASS
                    Clever. (noting all the weapons)
                    Wow. You were gonna use all that
                    stuff on me?
          
                              MILO
                    A guy can dream, can't he?
          
          NOW HIS JACKET IS FULL OF WEAPONS. He turns his attention
          back to the road. Cass studies his profile.
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, look, Milo, let's just clear
                    the air, Ok? So maybe it was a
                    mistake, thinking we could be
                    involved while working on the same
                    case...
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, I know it was a mistake. Don't
                    think you're telling me something I
                    don't know, cause you're not.
          
                              CASS
                        (deep breath)
                    Ok. Fine. But can we just put aside
                    our differences for two seconds?
                    Because back at the casino, I think
                    I saw someone following me.
          
                              MILO
                    Sure that wasn't me?
          
                              CASS
                    I don't think so. This guy was
                    lacking your trademark smell of
                    booze and KFC.
          
                              MILO
                    Ha ha.
          
          Milo surreptitiously sniffs himself.
          
                              CASS
                    Anywho. If these dirty cops have my
                    source hostage somewhere...
          
          Milo starts to laugh. Cass flushes:
          
                              CASS
                    What's so funny?
          
                                                                  56.
          
          
                              MILO
                    You think dirty cops are trying to
                    kill you? Look, I know you think
                    you're hot shit and everything, but
                    I'm pretty sure the only one around
                    here who might want to kill you is
                    me.
          
          Cass SEES A DARK CHEVY in the rearview mirror, gets a look at
          the driver and goes pale.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh no.
          
                              MILO
                    What?
          
                              CASS
                    Behind us. It's him. The guy I saw
                    back at the casino.
          
          Milo glances into the mirror, checking the guy out.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah? He doesn't look like a cop to
                    me.
          
                              CASS

                              CASS
                    NO!!
          
          Cass kicks a leg over and SLAMS HER FOOT ONTO THE GAS. The

          and frightened at the same time.
          
          Mahler pulls alongside them again and Milo WRENCHES the wheel
          to the left, SLAMMING THE CADILLAC INTO MAHLER'S CAR.
          Mahler's car goes skidding across the road, hits a ditch and
          FLIPS ONTO ITS SIDE.

                    I told you they were trying to kill
                    me!
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, well, no one's killing you
                    until I get you to jail.
          
          Cass whips her head around to look at him:
          
                              CASS
                    You're still taking me to jail? But
                    it's the cops who are after me.
          
                              MILO
                    First of all: that guy was not a
                    cop. Second of all, we just left
                    him unconscious in a ditch. You'll
                    be fine.
          
                              CASS
                    But...this is important! This is my
                    job!
          
                               MILO
                    And this...(pointing between them)
                    is my job.
          
                              CASS
                    Milo, you don't understand what's
                    going on!
          
          Milo rolls his eyes and straightens up.
          
                              MILO
                    I'll lay it out for you: some loser
                    with a minor sheet calls you up and
                    says, hey, I've got a big story for
                    you, you interested? It'll only
                    cost you a couple hundred bucks,
                    and I'll tip you onto some criminal
                    activity, it's your chance to
                    expose some bad guys and write the
                    story of your life. Then the moron
                    gets himself caught, he's probably
                    in cold storage somewhere, and now
                    you think the bad guys are after
                    you. (beat) See? I get it. I just
                    don't care.
          
          Milo finishes with the tire, throws the jack in the back, and
          heads back around to the driver's seat.
          
                                                                 59.
          
          
          Cass watches him closely, getting an idea. She reaches into
          her pocket and pulls out the paper from Jimmy.
          
                               CASS
                         (CASUALLY)
                    If only I knew exactly when and
                    where this deal was going down.
                    Course, if I can't figure out that
                    part, then you definitely can't
                    figure out that part, because we
                    both know I'm much smarter than
                    you.
          
          Milo flinches, then forces a laugh.
          
                              MILO
                    Please. My brain can dance circles
                    around your brain.
          
                              CASS
                    I don't even know what that means.
          
                              MILO
                    Case closed.
          
                              CASS
                        (SHRUGGING)
                    Fine. Guess we'll never know.
          
          Milo hesitates. Then decides: fuck it. He strides around the
          car and SNATCHES the paper from her hand. He reads:
          
                              MILO
                    "Atlantic City. Xmas Eve. Sparrow."
                    What's "Sparrow"?
          
                              CASS
                    I knew you couldn't figure it out.
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    It's a business.
          
                                CASS
                    No.
          
                                MILO
                    Casino.
          
                                CASS
                    Nope.
          
                                MILO
                    Stripper?
          
                                                                 60.
          
          
                              CASS
                    I don't think so. What kind of
                    strip bars have you been going to,
                    anyway?
          
          Milo stares at the paper, wracking his brain. Cass sighs
          loudly and SNATCHES the paper back.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, well, forget it, I knew you
                    couldn't do it.
          
                              MILO
                    Please. I could crack that story
                    and still get you to jail on time.
          
                                 CASS
                    Oh yeah?
          
          Cass stares him in the eye and says the magic words:
          
                                 CASS
                    Wanna bet?
          
          Milo stares at her. She stares back. Long beat. Milo's face
          is red. He clenches his fists. He unclenches them. Fuck. He
          thrusts out his hand:
          
                                 MILO
                    You're on.
          
          They shake.
          
                              MILO
                    I have to make a call.
          
          He starts to walk away.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey. Aren't you going to uncuff me?
          
                              MILO
                    Why? You going somewhere?
          
                                 CASS
                    Um...no.
          
                              MILO
                    Then you don't need to be uncuffed.
          
                                                                  61.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Cass sits in the passenger seat and watches in the rearview
          mirror while Milo paces behind the car, on the phone.
          
                              CASS
                        (to herself)
                    Asshole.
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          Milo is talking to Sid:
          
                              MILO
                    So there's just gonna be a little
                    delay...
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          INT MALL- EARLY EVENING
          
          Sid's at the mall. On Dec 23rd. With all the other desperate,
          last-minute shoppers. In other words, HE'S IN HELL.
          
                              SID
                    I don't get it. Why are you helping
                    her?
          
                              MILO
                    But that's the beauty of it, Sid,
                    I'm not helping her, she only
                    thinks I'm helping her.
          
                              SID
                    Yeah? If you're not helping her,
                    what are you doing?
          
          Milo notices Cass watching him and turns his back slightly.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          Cass narrows her eyes:
          
                              CASS
                        (to herself)
                    What is he up to?
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          Milo is making this up as he goes along:
          
                                                                  62.
          
          
                              MILO
                    I'll tell you what I'm doing: I'm
                    gonna crack this case first, and
                    I'm gonna take all the credit. Who
                    knows, maybe I'll even get my job
                    back....
          
                              SID
                    You are so full of shit. You don't
                    want your job back. You just want
                    to prove you're smarter than she
                    is.
          
                              MILO
                        (instantly heated)
                    I am smarter than she is. I would
                    have cracked that 13th Street case
                    way before she did if she hadn't...
          
                              SID
                    ...cheated, right, I know, you've
                    told me a million times. Did it
                    ever occur to you that a normal
                    couple wouldn't compete the way you
                    guys do in the first place?
          
          Sid spots what he is looking for. So does another last-minute
          shopper. They both reach for the toy.
          
                              MILO
                    This from the man currently trying
                    to prove to his wife he can handle
                    Xmas.
          
                              SID
                        (instantly heated)
                    I can handle Xmas!
          
          Sid WRENCHES the toy from the other shopper.
          
                              MILO
                    Just..trust me, Ok?
          
                              SID
                    Do I have a choice?
          
                              MILO
                    Nope.
          
          Milo hangs up and gets in the car.
          
                                                                 63.
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          The cadillac pulls a U-turn and HEADS BACK TOWARDS ATLANTIC
          CITY.
          
          CHIRON: "6:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 39 HOURS TO GO."
          
                              MILO (O.S.)
                    So. Atlantic City. Xmas Eve...
          
          
          EXT HOTDOG STAND- EVENING
          
          Milo buys a chili dog while talking to Cass who stands next
          to him, handcuffed.
          
                              MILO
                    ...so what exactly are these dirty
                    cops supposed to be doing?
          
                              CASS
                    Stealing evidence from property
                    rooms. Then destroying it, for the
                    right price.
          
          Milo stares.
          
                              CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    Nothing. It's just...it's a good
                    idea. If it weren't, you know.
                    Wrong. (continuing) So. Your plan
                    is to catch them red-handed before
                    they can destroy the evidence, then
                    write an expose for the paper and
                    win yourself another big award.
          
                              CASS
                    Something like that.
          
                              MILO
                    Only, you don't know what Sparrow
                    is. (thinking) Could be a nickname.
                    Or the place where the evidence is
                    stashed. Or a code word of some
                    kind. But the guy who knows has
                    gone missing, and you think the
                    dirty cops got a hold of him.
          
                                                                  64.

                        (NODDING)
                    When Jimmy called earlier, someone
                    else was there. And they
                    disconnected the call.
          
          Milo is staring at her.

                    dirty cops. Gimme your phone.
          
          She hands it to him. Milo checks the record of incoming calls
          and smiles.
          
                                CASS
                    What?

          Bobby talks into his cell phone while supervising a parade of
          hookers being loaded into a van:

                    Here's one: why did the snowman
                    pull down his pants? Cause he heard
                    the snowblower was coming!
          
                              MILO
                    Funny. Listen, Bob, I need a favor.

                    Anything.

                    I need an address to go with a
                    phone number. But I need it ASAP.
                    Kinda got a guy on my tail...
          
          
          EXT GARAGE- EVENING
          
          A tow truck is pulling up, towing Mahler's car. The tow truck
          driver turns to Mahler, who is in the passenger seat:
          
                              TOW TRUCK DRIVER
                    The garage is closed for the night.
                    Guess you'll have to wait til
                    tomorrow.
          
                                                                 65.
          
          
          Mahler thinks this over, then SMACKS THE DRIVER ACROSS THE
          FACE WITH THE BUTT OF HIS GUN. The driver crumples in his
          seat.
          
                                 MAHLER
                    Guess not.
          
          Mahler leans across him, opens the driver's side door, and
          BOOTS him out of the cab.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EVENING
          
          The tow truck is driving away from the garage.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EVENING
          
          Milo climbs back into the car, holding a piece of paper with
          the words "Trump Casino, room 2504" on it. He grins at Cass.
          
                              CASS
                    Pretty proud of yourself, ey?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. You're a reporter. Great. But
                    I used to be a cop. Let's face it:
                    I'm naturally gonna be one step
                    ahead of you.
          
                              CASS
                        (under her breath)
                    You weren't last time.
          
          Milo whips his head around:
          
                              MILO
                    What did you say?
          
                              CASS
                    I said you're doing a great job.

          The Trump Casino on the strip, coming into view...
          
          
          EXT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          Milo pulls into the crowded parking lot and checks the
          cartridge of his gun. Beside him, Cass is bubbling over with
          excited energy:
          
                                                                  66.
          
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, here's what I think we should
                    do: I'll go up first, Jimmy knows
                    me, so if anything's wrong I'm sure
                    he'll give me a sign...
          
                              MILO
                    Excellent plan. Oh, except you're
                    staying in the car.
          
          Milo exits the car.
          
                              CASS
                        (shouting after him)
                    But...it's my story!
          
          But he is already headed for the casino entrance. He waves at
          her and disappears inside.
          
                                CASS
                    Asshole.
          
          
          INT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          Milo glides through the casino, past the blinking lights of
          the slot machines, headed for the elevators. A DRUNK GUY in a
          Hawaiian shirt is coming towards him and HE AND MILO
          COLLIDE...
          
                              MILO
                        (steadying the guy)
                    You Ok? My bad.
          
                              DRUNK GUY
                    Watch where you're going. (under
                    his breath) Prick.
          
          The drunk guy continues past. Milo holds up THE ROOM CARD KEY
          HE HAS JUST SWIPED FROM THE GUY:
          
                              MILO
                        (calling after him)
                    Merry Xmas to you, too!
          
          
          INT TRUMP CASINO 25TH FLOOR- EVENING
          
          The elevator dings and Milo exits. He turns a corner and
          heads down the hall. Another elevator DINGS behind him.
          
          Milo continues down the hall. Suddenly, he STOPS and looks
          behind him. No one is there.
          
                                                                    67.
          
          
          He turns another corner and FINDS 2504. There is a "DO NOT
          DISTURB" sign on the door. HE GOES PAST IT AND TAPS LIGHTLY
          ON 2505.
          
                              MILO
                    Room service.
          
          No answer. He glances down the hall and sees a slight
          movement. SOMEONE IS WATCHING HIM. He moves away from the
          door, continues down the hall, THEN SLIPS INTO THE ICE
          MACHINE ROOM...
          
          
          INT ICE MACHINE ROOM- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo hits the light switch off and waits just inside the
          door. Someone steps in, and MILO GRABS THEM AND THROWS THEM
          AGAINST THE WALL. The person SCREAMS. Milo slaps a hand
          across the person's mouth and switches on the light. And
          finds himself face to face with:
          
          CASS.
          
                              MILO
                    What the...?
          
          He looks at the handcuff dangling from her wrist, STILL
          ATTACHED TO THE CAR DOOR ARM REST.
          
                              MILO
                        (loud whisper)
                    What the hell are you doing?
          
                               CASS
                        (SAME)
                    It's my story, I don't break
                    stories by staying in the car!
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, well, (re: the armrest)
                    you're paying for that.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, ok. Here's a nickle.
          
          Suddenly, Milo goes still. THERE IS A CREAKING SOUND as
          someone creeps down the hall. Milo puts a finger to Cass'
          lips.
          
          Then he peeks out the door.
          
          MILO'S POV- THE CLEANING CART BEING SLOWLY WHEELED DOWN THE
          HALL BY THE MAID. The maid stops by a room and enters.
          
                                                                  68.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Perfect. (to Cass) Play along.
          
          
          INT HALLWAY- EVENING
          
          Milo passes the maid's cart, glancing at her ROOM RECORD
          SHEET, then continues on to room 2505. He uses the CARD HE
          SWIPED on the door. Of course, IT DOESN'T WORK.
          
                               MILO
                        (LOUD)
                    Godammit. Son of a bitch.
          
          The maid peeks out into the hall.
          
                              MILO
                        (to Cass)
                    This is like the third card they've
                    given me...
          
                              CASS
                        (playing along)
                    Take it easy, honey...
          
                              MILO
                    Don't tell me to take it easy, now
                    we have to go all the way
                    downstairs again...
          
          Cass looks pleadingly at the maid.
          
                              MAID
                    What's the name?
          
                              MILO
                    Davenport. Room 2505.
          
          The maid checks her chart, then crosses the hall and USES HER
          PASS KEY TO OPEN THE DOOR.
          
                              MILO
                    You're an angel.
          
          Milo and Cass go inside.
          
          
          INT ROOM 2505- EVENING
          
          Milo closes the door carefully behind them, then tiptoes
          across the room to the connecting door, Cass close on his
          heels. All is silent.
          
                                                                    69.
          
          
                              CASS
                        (WHISPERING)
                    Wait a second: where's my gun?
          
                               MILO
                        (SAME)
                    I don't know. Where is your gun?
          
                              CASS
                    I don't have one.
          
                              MILO
                    Then you've answered your own
                    question.
          
          Milo tiptoes closer to the door. Cass pulls on his sleeve.
          
                              CASS
                    Come on, give me something. You've
                    got, like, a million weapons in the
                    jacket.
          
          She reaches for his jacket, and Milo pulls away.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. These are not toys. You can't
                    just give them to someone and have
                    them know how to use them.
          
                              CASS
                    I seem to remember doing just fine
                    with your taser gun.
          
          They are at the door. Milo puts a finger to his lips and
          tries the doorknob: LOCKED. He is about to work the lock when
          THEY HEAR SCREAMS COMING FROM THE LOCKED ROOM.
          
          No time to do this quietly. MILO TAKES A STEP BACK, THEN
          KICKS THE DOOR IN...
          
          
          INT HALLWAY- EVENING
          
          Halfway down the hallway, THE MAID HEARS THE DOOR BEING
          KICKED IN. Nervous, she backs away, headed for the
          elevators...
          
          
          INT ROOM 2504- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo QUICKLY ENTERS THE ROOM, GUN RAISED. THE SCREAMING IS
          COMING FROM THE TV. Milo clicks it off and checks the room.
          The place appears to be deserted. He crosses to the bathroom
          and peers in: EMPTY.
          
                                                                 70.
          
          
          Meanwhile, Cass has cautiously entered the room and sees
          spots on the rug:
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, god, is that blood?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. Columbo. Wait by the door.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm just trying to...
          
                              MILO
                    This could be a crime scene. There
                    are clues all over this room that
                    only a trained eye can find. And as
                    I seem to recall, you were the one
                    who was unable to figure this out
                    by herself.
          
          Oooh. Cass grits her teeth.
          
                              CASS
                        (under her breath)
                    He is unbelievable.

                    Who are you talking to, your
                    imaginary friend Leslie?

                    Hey. Lots of kids have imaginary
                    friends, despite what my mother
                    believes.
          
                              MILO
                    Whatever. You wait by the door. And
                    I'll handle this.
          
                              CASS
                        (PISSED)
                    Fine.
          
          She moves back to the door. As she does, she notices a
          matchbook on the floor: IT'S A GREEN MATCHBOOK WITH A BLACK
          SILHOUETTE OF A HORSE.
          
                              CASS
                    So you're saying you don't want my
                    help.
          
                              MILO
                    I'm saying I don't need your help.
          
                                                                 71.
          
          
                                CASS
                          (SHRUGGING)
                    Ok.
          
          As he turns away, SHE SLIPS THE MATCHBOOK INTO HER PURSE.
          Milo catches this movement out of the corner of his eye and
          glances back:
          
                              MILO
                    What was that?
          
                              CASS
                        (INNOCENTLY)
                    What was what?
          
                              MILO
                    Did you find something?
          
                              CASS
                    How could I find anything? I'm not
                    the detective.
          
                              MILO
                    Lemme see your purse...
          
          Milo takes a step closer to her, but:
          
                                VOICE
                    FREEZE!
          
          Cass and Milo turn to see A HOTEL SECURITY GUARD IN THE
          DOORWAY, EXCITEDLY POINTING HIS GUN AT THEM. Milo rolls his
          eyes.
          
                              GUARD
                    Hotel security! Stay where you are!
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, Ok, no problem. You're probably
                    gonna want this.
          
          Milo holds up HIS GUN.
          
                              GUARD
                        (PANICKED)
                    DROP THE WEAPON, NOW!
          
                              MILO
                    Take it easy. I'm just gonna unload
                    it.
          
          Milo drops the cartridge, then TOSSES THE GUN RIGHT AT THE
          GUARD'S FACE.
          
                                                                   72.
          
          
          The guard instinctively raises his hands and Milo CHARGES
          him, tackling him to the ground, then handcuffing him to the
          table.
          
          Milo GRABS Cass hand and races from the room.
          
          
          INT HALLWAY- EVENING
          
          Cass and Milo run up to the elevators. ALL CARS ARE RISING:
          BACK-UP IS ON THE WAY. Milo hits the fire alarm and pulls
          Cass into the stairwell...
          
          
          INT STAIRWELL- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass are almost to the bottom, WHEN SECURITY APPEARS
          IN THE STAIRWELL BENEATH THEM. Milo looks up. SECURITY IS
          COMING FROM ABOVE, AS WELL. Shit. Milo cracks the stairwell
          window and peers out: THEY ARE 4 STORIES UP.
          
                              MILO
                    You're gonna have to jump.
          
                                 CASS
                    I can't.
          
          Milo considers this, then picks her up and TOSSES HER OUT THE
          WINDOW.
          
          
          EXT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          Cass screams as she falls. Milo falls next to her. They fall
          and fall and BOOSH: THEY LAND IN A SNOW BANK AND TUMBLE TO
          THE GROUND.
          
          Seconds later, they are on their feet, RUNNING FOR THE CAR.
          
                              BOBBY (O.S.)
                    Ok, so some guy you're looking for
                    has disappeared. You want me to put
                    out an all-points on him?
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass are speeding away from the Trump Casino.
          
                              MILO
                        (into phone)
                    The thing is, Bob: Cass thinks
                    dirty cops might be involved.
          
                                                                 73.

          INT POLICE STATION- EVENING
          
          Bobby is in his office. His door opens onto the squad room,
          busy with police activity. Bobby sits up straighter in his
          chair.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're with
                    Cassidy? Shit, Milo, you know when
                    you're around her your brain turns
                    to mush.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, well, that doesn't change the
                    fact that someone took a couple
                    shots at us.
          
          Beat.
          
                              BOBBY
                    You get a plate number?
          
                              MILO
                    Happened too quick. But it was a
                    dark 4-door Chevy, blue or grey,
                    New Jersey plates, and the car was
                    wrecked, I know that.
          
          Bobby thinks this over.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok. Lemme look into it. See what I
                    can find. Just hold tight, Ok?
          
          Milo checks his watch.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. But we're kinda on a clock
                    here.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Milo, don't fuck around with this.
                    If there are dirty cops in the
                    house, we all have a problem. So do
                    me a favor: get off the strip, find
                    somewhere to lie low and wait for
                    my call.
          
                                                                   74.
          
          
          EXT BACK OF TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          The scene has calmed down a little. A DARK SEDAN appears and
          RAY AND DWIGHT exit the car, looking like a an ugly,
          dangerous Odd Couple.
          
          An employee slips out the back door and hands Ray a PHOTO
          FROM SECURITY OF MILO AND CASS IN THE CASINO PARKING LOT.
          Dwight snatches the photo from Ray.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Yeah, that's him.
          
                              RAY
                    Who's the chick?
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Who gives a fuck? Anyway, they
                    can't be far.
          
          It's true. They aren't too far. They are:
          
          
          EXT OFF ROUTE 9- EVENING
          
          A LUXURIOUS, ROMANTIC B&B. Xmas lights winking on the trees,
          "Come All Ye Faithful" gently wafting out the oak front door.
          
          CHIRON: "9:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 36 HOURS TO GO."
          
          The whole scene looks beautiful, peaceful, romantic...
          
                              CASS (O.S.)
                    Ok. Kill me now.
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL MILO AND CASS, parked in front. REVEAL
          THE SIGN NEXT TO THEM: "WELCOME TO CUPID'S CABIN". Yup. The
          place Milo and Cass ran off to and got married 3 years ago.
          
                              MILO
                    I'm sorry, it's the only place I
                    know off the strip.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not going in. What if they
                    remember us?
          
                              MILO
                    They won't remember us. Why would
                    they remember us? Just...try to act
                    normal.
          
                                                                    75.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B- EVENING
          
          A small, family-run, luxury bed and breakfast. The kind of
          place that prides itself on its service. DAWN (long, graying
          hair, glasses, moccasins) greets them with a smile:
          
                              DAWN
                    Can I help you? (realizing) Wait,
                    it can't be...
          
          She looks behind her at a bulletin board. At photos of all
          the happy couples who have passed through her. And finds: A
          PHOTO OF MILO AND CASS, ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER, DRINKING
          CHAMPAGNE, CASS SHOWING OFF AN ENGAGEMENT RING.

          A balding man in flannel comes out, takes one look, and
          clasps both hands to his chest.
          
                              EDMUND
                    Be still my beating heart.

                    What a lovely surprise. It's been,
                    what, 3 years?
          
          Milo and Cass both try to downplay:
          
                                 MILO
                    Has it?
          
                              CASS
                    I don't really remember...

                    Actually, we're not...
          
                               DAWN
                    You know what? In light of this
                    special special occasion: it's on
                    the house!
          
          Before Cass can protest more, MILO GRABS HER ARM.
          
                              MILO
                    Honey? Can I talk to you?
          
          He pulls her slightly aside.
          
                              MILO
                        (LOW)
                    You have any money?
          
                               CASS
                        (SAME)
                    No, as you recall, I gave you all
                    my money at the blackjack table...
                    (realizing) You blew all the money!
          
                              MILO
                    Hey! I would have won it back if
                    someone hadn't tasered me in the
                    bathroom!
          
                              CASS
                    So. Use a credit card.
          
                              MILO
                    Mine's max'd. Lemme have yours.
          
                              CASS
                    Mine's max'd too. (off his look)
                    What, I like to shop.
          
          They give each other a horrified look as they both realize
          what this means. Then they turn back to the couple, put their
          arms around each other, and smile:
          
                              MILO/CASS
                    It's our third anniversary!

                                                                  77.
          
          
                                 MILO/CASS
                    Thanks!
          
          Milo and Cass snuggle closer. He surreptitiously squeezes her
          ass. She surreptitiously STOMPS on his foot.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B DINING-ROOM- EVENING
          
          Full of couples in love. Young couples, old couples, gay
          couples, straight couples. Even a dog couple snuggled up by
          the fire.
          
          And then there's Milo and Cass, bruised and dishevelled,
          being served an elaborate romantic meal. They smile
          uncomfortably as Edmund arrives with a tray of oysters:
          
                              EDMUND
                    To begin: a little aphrodisiac!
          
          He gives them both a broad wink.
          
                                 MILO
                           (GRIMLY)
                    Wow.
          
                                 CASS
                        (SAME)
                    Great.
          
                              EDMUND
                    So tell me: how have you managed to
                    keep the romance alive all this
                    time?
          
                              MILO
                    Well, I'll tell you, Edmund.
                    The secret to our success is that
                    the little woman here knows her
                    place. She cleans for me, cooks for
                    me, and every night when I come
                    home she gets down on her knees and
                    massages my feet.
          
          He beams at Cass. Cass grins through her teeth.
          
                              CASS
                    Yes, Edmund, it's true. I massage
                    his feet to help him feel like a
                    man. It's important, especially
                    when your husband has such a teeny
                    tiny...
          
          Just then, Dawn hustles over, interrupting:
          
                                                                 78.

                    How is everything? Is it like that
                    magical night 3 years ago?
          
                              CASS
                    Uh-huh.
          
                              MILO
                    Yup. You betcha.

                    This calls for a toast!
          
          She raises a glass, tapping it with a spoon. Milo and Cass
          both groan under their breath.

                    May I have your attention please?
                    Edmund and I would like to share
                    with you the most romantic moment
                    we have ever seen. It was three
                    years ago today, in this very
                    restaurant, when this lovely young
                    man here, right in the middle of
                    the meal, threw down his napkin,
                    got down on one knee, and said
                    marry me, right now, right this
                    second, I want to go to sleep
                    tonight knowing you're my wife!
          
                              EDMUND
                        (jumping in)
                    And she said yes, with tears in her
                    eyes and a tremble in her hand,
                    let's get married, and they ran out
                    to the all night chapel and came
                    back an hour later, man and wife!
          
          The whole restaurant starts clapping. Milo turns to Edmund:
          
                              MILO
                    Can I get a whiskey?
          
                              CASS
                    Make that two.

          Milo and Cass stumble down the hall, laughing hysterically,
          falling down drunk.
          
                                                                  79.
          
          
                              MILO
                    After we broke up, I was so mad at
                    you, I told everyone I know you
                    have herpes.
          
                               CASS
                    I told everyone you flunked out of
                    3rd grade.
          
                               MILO
                    I told everyone you have a
                    moustache.
          
                              CASS
                    I told everyone you like to wear my
                    panties.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey!
          
          This one is obviously true. Both laugh harder.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT
          
          Milo and Cass stagger in, blinking hazily at their new
          surroundings. A heart-shaped bed. Champagne. A bubble bath. A
          fireplace. The works. Like Cupid threw up in here.
          
          The laughter slowly fades. Long beat. Then:
          
                              CASS
                    Wow. This would be really awkward
                    if we still had feelings for each
                    other. Which we don't...
          
                              MILO
                    That's right. Luckily, we're
                    different people now. We don't feel
                    the way we used to.
          
                              CASS
                    Right. We've moved on.
          
                              MILO
                    We have no feelings about each
                    other whatsoever.
          
                              MILO
                    Just two people who used to know
                    each other.
          
                              CASS
                    Two casual acquaintances.
          
                                                                 80.
          
          
                                 MILO
                       Feels good, doesn't it?
          
                                 CASS
                       Feels fantastic.
          
                                 MILO
                       A platonic relationship. Working
                       together.
          
                                 CASS
                       Helping each other.
          
                                 MILO
                       Trusting each other.
          
          Which reminds them: THEY DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER. Awkward
          pause. Then:
          
                                 CASS
                       Well. Mind if I shower?
          
                                 MILO
                       Ladies first.
          
          Cass disappears into the bathroom, closing the door behind
          her. Beat. Then MILO HURRIES OVER TO THE DOOR AND LISTENS.

          As soon as Milo hears the water, HE HURRIES OVER TO THE BED
          WHERE CASS LEFT HER PURSE. HE STARTS DIGGING THROUGH IT.

                       No. You're not gonna believe this,
                       but: I'm at Cupid's Cabin with

          SOMETHING FROM HIM AT THE CASINO. While searching through her
          wallet, he suddenly stumbles across A WEDDING PHOTO OF
          HIMSELF AND CASS.
          
          Huh. He glances at the bathroom door. She carries their
          wedding photo around?

                    in this romantic place, you have a

                              CASS
                    Why should I have to win him back?
                    He should have to win me back! And
                    who says I want him back, anyway?

                        (losing her patience)
                    Look, the reason I called: I
                    remember you worked at this one
                    place where they had these bright
                    green matches with, like, this
                    silhouette of a horse on them?

                        (immediately defensive)
                    That was a long time ago! And all I
                    did was serve drinks...
          
                              CASS
                    I just need to know the name of the

                    Charley's. And Ok, I admit, maybe I
                    did a little dancing, but how often
                    do you make 200 an hour in tips?
          
                              CASS
                    I gotta go.

                    I want grandkids!
          
          Cass hangs up. She sits for a moment, staring at her phone.
          Is her mother right? Is she making a mistake right now? She
          looks around the bathroom. Candles, flowers, thick robes.
          
          A bottle of champagne chilling by the heart-shaped tub. She
          slowly stands and checks herself out in the mirror, brushing
          back her hair with her hands.
          
          Suddenly, on impulse, she grabs the bottle of champagne and
          two glasses. WHAT THE HELL, WHY NOT?
          
                                                                    83.
          
          
          They're here, maybe they should seize the moment. She peeks

          Milo hears the water go off. HE POCKETS THE MATCHES, tosses
          the purse away and lies on the bed, striking a casual pose.
          
          Cass emerges.
          
                              MILO
                    Good shower?
          
                                CASS
                    The best.
          
                                MILO
                    Great.
          
                              CASS
                    You know what's great? Trusting
                    each other.
          
                                MILO
                    I agree.
          
          He holds up the handcuffs:

          SNOW IS FALLING OUTSIDE. PAN FROM THE WINDOW, ACROSS THE ROOM
          TO THE BED, ACROSS A SNORING MILO TO CASS, EYES CLOSED, HAND
          CUFFED TO THE HEADBOARD.
          
          Suddenly, CASS' EYES SNAP OPEN. She sits up a little and
          glances over at MILO'S NIGHT TABLE WHERE HE LEFT THE KEYS AND
          GUN IN PLAIN VIEW. She smiles...
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B SUITE- TEN MINUTES LATER
          
          Cass is doing a slow, careful, ACROBATIC CLIMB ACROSS MILO'S
          BODY in an attempt to reach the gun without waking Milo up.
          She puts a hand on the headboard. She is lifting her knee
          over him, when he stirs.
          
          She freezes, waiting for him to settle. It's like playing
          Twister, only if the person you're playing with finds out,
          HE'S GOING TO KILL YOU.
          
          She manages to get herself STRADDLING HIM, arms stretched,
          THE GUN ALMOST WITHIN REACH, when:
          
                                 MILO
                    Excuse me.
          
          Cass FREEZES.
          
                              MILO
                    What are you doing?
          
          She looks down. Milo is watching her, wide awake. Hmm. This
          is going to be a tough one to explain.
          
                                 CASS
                    Um...
          
                              MILO
                    Are you trying to seduce me?

                    Yes. Yes I am.
          
          She tries to reach for the gun while they talk.
          
                              MILO
                        (INNOCENTLY)
                    I didn't know you were still so
                    attracted to me. I mean, I remember
                    how you used to like to greet me at
                    the door in nothing but a...

                              CASS
                        (INTERRUPTING)
                    Yes, it's true, I'm still attracted
                    to you.
          
          Her hand is groping around blindly, where the fuck is it? She
          stretches more, bringing her face even closer to Milo's.
          
                               MILO
                    Really? Wow. That's great news. You
                    know what would be really sexy
                    right now?

                              MILO
                    No. If you talked dirty to me.
          
          The gun seems to be getting father away. THEIR LIPS ARE
          ALMOST TOUCHING NOW...

                    attraction to me.
          
                              CASS
                    Um...I can't stop thinking about
                    you.
          
                              MILO
                    Really? What part of me?
          
                              CASS
                    Just...all of you.
          
                              MILO
                    Be specific.
          
          Cass blushes fiercely. If she didn't want that gun so bad...
          
                              MILO
                        (HELPFULLY)

          THE GUN IS IN HIS HAND. That's why she couldn't reach it. HE
          KNEW WHAT SHE WAS UP TO THIS WHOLE TIME. She flips off him
          and back onto her side. Milo sits up, flipping on the lights.
          
                              MILO

                    have no intention of helping me
                    with my story?

                    get to come out on top! Karma,

                    Oh my god, would you get over it
                    already! So I cracked the case
                    before you did, it was 3 years ago,
                    it happened, stop being such a baby
                    and move on!
          
                               MILO
                    Oh I'm moving on. You know how I'm
                    moving on? By cracking this case
                    before you, then taking you in so
                    you can spend this Xmas in jail,
                    all alone.
          
          He rolls over, turning his back to her. Cass stares at the
          ceiling, fuming.

                              CASS
                    Nothing. I had her add mayo to your
                    burger. I remember you like that.
          
          Milo glances at Dawn and she nods in confirmation.

                    Oh. (surprised) Thanks.
          
          Milo takes a bite from his burger and considers Cass.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, look: I know you're probably
                    upset that you're not gonna get the
                    story. But a person can't win every
                    time, right?
          
                              CASS
                    Depends on the person.

                    Well, if the person you're
                    referring to is you, I agree: you
                    can't win every time.
          
          Suddenly, MILO GETS A FUNNY LOOK ON HIS FACE.

                    Yeah, I had her add that with the
                    mayo. Is that bad? Oh wait, you're
                    violently allergic to sesame.
                    Whoops. My bad.
          
          MILO'S FACE IS TURNING BRIGHT RED. HE GASPS FOR AIR. HE
          SLOWLY SLIDES OFF HIS CHAIR ONTO THE FLOOR. Cass calmly
          reaches across the table, taking his keys and unhandcuffing
          herself.
          
          Car keys in hand, she bends down to whisper in his ear:

          Next to an ambulance, Milo is unconscious on a stretcher. An
          EMT prepares a HUGE SYRINGE, picks a spot on Milo's chest,
          then PLUNGES THE NEEDLE INTO IT.
          
                                                                  91.

                    Relax. That was an adrenaline shot.
          
                              MILO
                    I don't believe it. She tried to
                    kill me.
          
          The EMT exchanges a look with the ambulance driver, then
          helps Milo off the stretcher.
          
                              EMT
                    No one tried to kill you, buddy.
                    You just need to be more careful
                    about what you eat.

          He checks his watch, then pulls out the GREEN MATCHBOOK:
          
                              MILO
                    Know where this place is?

                    Sure. Charley's, on the boardwalk.
                    And just FYI: when they say "don't
                    touch" the dancers, they mean with
                    with any part of your body, not
                    just your hands.
          
          The EMT folds the stretcher, loads it into the ambulance, and
          THEY DRIVE AWAY, leaving Milo in the parking lot.

          a burger place and a souvenir shop. She slips out of the car,
          takes a careful look around, then works her way towards the
          club.

          looking for a window to climb into, when she spots JIMMY'S
          METS' HAT ON THE GROUND.
          
          Shit. Cass stares at the hat: JIMMY IS HERE SOMEWHERE. She
          presses her ear up against the back door:

          Suddenly, SHE HEARS GROANING COMING FROM INSIDE. Or grunting.
          LIKE SOMEONE TRYING TO CALL OUT THROUGH A GAG. She looks
          around. There is a window higher up on the wall. Cass drags a
          trash can beneath the window, stacks another one on top of
          it, and cautiously climbs up.
          
          The window is locked and she can't see through it. Hmm. Fuck
          it. She takes her purse and SMASHES a pane of glass.
          
          She wobbles on trash cans and GRABS THE WINDOWSILL JUST AS
          THE CANS FALL AWAY, LEAVING HER DANGLING.

          see hands and can hear someone cursing under their breath.
          The top of a head appears, then a face: IT'S CASS.
          
          Relieved, Jimmy starts gesturing excitedly for her to come
          in. Cass climbs in, drops to the floor, hurries over to Jimmy
          and ungags him.

                    sesame and almost killing me!
          
          Beat.
          
                                                               96.
          
          
                              CASS
                    Ok. Maybe that was not the best...
          
                              MILO
                    Say you were wrong.
          
                              CASS
                    I could have found a more mature...
          
                              MILO
                    Say you were wrong.
          
                              CASS
                    I was possibly out of line...
          
                              MILO
                    Say you were wrong.
          
                              CASS
                        (blurting out)
                    Ok, ok, I was wrong!
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. Now. Admit that the only reason
                    you were able to crack that case
                    three years ago was because you
                    looked through my files.
          
          Long pause.
          
                                CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    I think I'll hang up now...
          
                              CASS
                        (QUICKLY)
                    Ok, Ok. I looked through your
                    files. Are you happy?
          
                              MILO
                    Thrilled. Now tell them I'll be
                    there in 20 minutes. Meanwhile,
                    stop shifting in your seat like
                    that and just tell them you have to
                    use the bathroom.
          
          Cass sits up straighter. Wait a second, he's here?
          
                              MILO
                    Don't look around. Just do it.
          
          CLICK. He hangs up.
          
                                                                    97.
          
          
          CLOSE ON- THE BOOTH.
          
                              CASS
                    You boys mind if I use the ladies
                    room?
          
          
          INT BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Cass enters. Milo is behind the door. He SLAMS the door
          closed after she is in, and blocks her escape.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what my mistake was? I
                    never should have let you out of
                    the trunk. I'm fine, by the way.
                    The doctor said I may have been
                    technically dead for a few seconds,
                    but I'm fine now.
          
          Cass is not impressed. She stares at him coldly.
          
                              CASS
                    So that's what you really think?
                    That I stole information from you?
          
                              MILO
                    It's not what I think, it's what I
                    know. How else did you beat me?
          
                              CASS
                        (as though to a 5 yr old)
                    Did it ever occur to you that I
                    just might be good at my job?
          
          Milo stares at her. Huh. It actually didn't occur to him...
          
                              CASS
                    That's what I thought. You know
                    what, Milo? You're an even bigger
                    asshole than I previously
                    suspected, and you deserve
                    everything that's happened to you.
                    (beat) And everything that's about
                    to happen to you.
          
          "About to happen"? Milo is just starting to realize...
          
                              MILO
                    You wouldn't...
          
                              CASS
                        (SCREAMING)
                    MILO BOYD IS IN HERE!
          
                                                                  98.
          
          
          Son of a bitch. The bathroom door SHOOTS open and DWIGHT AND
          RAY ENTER. They back Milo into a corner. Cass smiles at Milo,
          waves, and exits.
          
          
          EXT CHARLEY'S- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass comes flying out of the club and runs right into:
          MAHLER. HE TAKES ONE LOOKS AT HER AND PUSHES HER BACK INSIDE.
          
          
          INT BATHROOM- AFTERNOON
          
          Dwight and Ray are frisking Milo, taking away his array of
          weapons.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Wow. You always carry this much
                    gear?
          
                              MILO
                    Only during the holidays.
          
          
          INT CHARLEY'S- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo is pushed out of the bathroom, and comes face to face
          with CASS. MAHLER APPEARS FROM BEHIND HER, TAKES ONE LOOK AT
          MILO AND POINTS HIS GUN AT MILO'S HEAD.
          
                              MAHLER
                    Remember me?
          
                              DWIGHT
                    What the fuck?
          
          Dwight steps forward from behind Milo, AND POINTS HIS GUN AT
          MAHLER. MAHLER REACTS, SHIFTING THE GUN TO DWIGHT. RAY STEPS
          UP, GUN POINTED AT MAHLER.
          
          Momentary stand-off. Stuck between the bad guys, MILO AND
          CASS GIVE EACH OTHER EVIL LOOKS.
          
          A half-naked dancer appears:
          
                                DANCER
                    Lapdance?
          
          Everyone looks at her. She is just realizing...
          
                              DANCER
                    Maybe I should come back later...
          
                                                                    99.
          
          
          ...WHEN MILO AND CASS SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKE THEIR MOVES, CASS
          STOMPING ON MAHLER'S FOOT, CAUSING HIM TO LOOSEN HIS HOLD ON
          HER, MILO SLAMMING HIS ELBOW BACK ONTO RAY'S ABDOMEN.
          
          RAY'S GUN GOES OFF AS CASS AND MILO BOTH HIT THE FLOOR.
          MAHLER REACTS, FIRING AT RAY. DWIGHT FIRES AT MAHLER...
          
          TOTAL PANDEMONIUM. Girls screaming, patrons running for the
          exit.
          
          MAHLER AND DWIGHT BOTH GET HIT. Milo crawls over to a moaning
          Dwight and recovers his gun. He looks up in time to see CASS
          DISAPPEARING OUT THE FRONT DOOR.
          
          
          EXT BOARDWALK- AFTERNOON
          
          Milo comes out. THE BOARDWALK IS PACKED, CASS IS LOST IN THE
          CROWD. Milo raises his gun in the air and FIRES. People duck
          and scatter REVEALING CASS, climbing into the Cadillac.
          
          SIRENS...
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass jumps into the car and hits the gas. She is pulling
          away, victorious, WHEN THERE IS A SOUND ON THE ROOF.
          
          MILO'S FACE APPEARS, UPSIDE-DOWN, IN THE WINDSHIELD,
          GRINNING.
          
                                CASS
                      Get off the car, Milo.
          
          He gives her the finger.
          
                                CASS
                      Get off the car, you psychopath.
          
                                MILO
                      Oh, I am a psychopath, and you know
                      why? Cause you made me that way.
                      And if I'm going crazy, I'm taking
                      you with me.
          
          He reaches a hand through the driver's window, grabbing at
          her. Cass SCREAMS, squeezes her eyes shut and HITS THE GAS.
          
          MORE SIRENS, RAPIDLY APPROACHING...
          
                                                                    100.

          THE CAR IS WEAVING CRAZILY, MILO SLIDING BACK AND FORTH
          ACROSS THE ROOF...
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass opens her eyes. MILO IS HALFWAY IN THE PASSENGER WINDOW.
          
                                 CASS
                     AAHHH!!
          
                                 MILO
                     AAHHH!!
          
          Milo falls into the car, grabbing at the wheel. They fight
          for control of the car as it goes spinning off the road...
          
          
          EXT TREES- AFTERNOON

          Silence.
          
          
          EXT BOARDWALK- EARLY EVENING
          
          Cops everywhere, Dwight and Ray leaning over the hood of a
          squad car, being handcuffed, MAHLER UNCONSCIOUS ON A
          STRETCHER.
          
          A BYSTANDER IS TALKING TO A COP, DESCRIBING:

                    It was an old Cadillac, this crazy
                    girl driving, and the guy was like,

          CHIRON: "6:00 PM. ABOVE THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. 13 HOURS TO GO".
          
          Cass and Milo both just sit there breathing for a moment.
          Then Milo turns and glares at Cass, and THE LOOK ON HER FACE
          SAYS SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT'S COMING NEXT:
          
          
          EXT TRUNK- EARLY EVENING
          
          CASS IS BACK IN THE TRUNK. Milo waves goodbye and SLAMS shut
          the lid.
          
          IMMEDIATELY, HIS CELL PHONE RINGS. Milo glances at it, then
          reluctantly answers:
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah?
          
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          Bobby, ocean in the background, furious:

                    What the fuck are you doing? I
                    thought I told you to lie low.
          
                              MILO
                    I was lying low...
          
                              BOBBY

                    It's a long story.

                    me, I'll protect you til we figure
                    this out. Can you get to Pier 19?
          
          Milo looks around. He can just make out Pier 19 in the
          distance, a mile or two away.
          
                                                                 102.

          Milo and Cass drive up in the Cadillac and park out of sight.
          They exit the car and look around. The pier seems to be
          deserted. Then they hear a soft motor, and BOBBY APPEARS IN A
          MOTORBOAT.
          
                                 BOBBY

          Bobby is at the back of the boat, steering. Cass and Milo are

                                 CASS
                       So, these guys have a bunch of
                       stolen evidence stashed somewhere
                       in Atlantic City...
          
                                 MILO
                       And we think they're ditching it
                       tonight.
          
          A SMALL YACHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON. Bobby steers the
          motorboat towards it. MILO AND CASS TURN TO LOOK AS THE YACHT
          COMES INTO VIEW. AND AT THE SAME MOMENT, CASS AND MILO MAKE
          OUT THE NAME ON THE SIDE OF THE BOAT:
          
          "SPARROW".
          
                                 BOBBY
                           (CASUALLY)
                       You know, if I was them, I'd store
                       the evidence on a boat, drive the
                       boat about 30 miles out, and blow
                       the whole thing up.
          
          Cass and Milo both slowly turn to find BOBBY POINTING A GUN
          AT THE TWO OF THEM. Off Milo's disappointed look:
          
                                 BOBBY
                       Hey, man. I got mouths to feed.
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Aw. That's what all the dirty cops
                    say.
          
          Bobby quickly frisks Cass, and frisks and disarms Milo. He
          steers the boat one-handed up next to the yacht and cuts the
          motorboats engine.
          
          Milo makes a sudden LUNGE for Bobby and BOBBY CRACKS HIM OVER
          THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF THE GUN, SENDING MILO
          SPRAWLING TO THE BACK OF THE BOAT, RIGHT ON TOP OF THE MOTOR.
          
          Milo struggles back up to a seated position.
          
                              BOBBY
                    You've always been such a stubborn
                    asshole, Milo. You just don't
                    listen. All you had to do was stay
                    where I told you and none of this
                    would have happen. Now the two of
                    you are gonna have to go down with
                    the boat.
          
          
          INT HULL OF YACHT- EVENING
          
          CHIRON: "11:00 PM. ATLANTIC OCEAN. 10 HOURS TO GO".
          
          PAN PAST PILES OF EVIDENCE BOXES FULL OF EVERYTHING
          IMAGINABLE: GUNS, VIDEOTAPES, DRUGS, ETC...
          
          PAN PAST A PILE OF EXPLOSIVES WRAPPED WITH CABLE AND ATTACHED
          TO A TIMER, COUNTING DOWN: "1:59, 1:58, 1:57..."
          
          PAN TO MILO AND CASS SEATED ON THE FLOOR, TIED TOGETHER, BACK
          TO BACK, ARMS STRAPPED TO THEIR SIDES.
          
          PAN TO THE DOORWAY, where Bobby stands, inspecting the room.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok. Guess that's it. Gotta go.
                    (checking them out) You know what?
                    You guys make a great couple.
          
          Bobby exits and Cass and Milo are alone.
          
          Suddenly, CASS STARTS GIGGLING.
          
                              MILO
                    What's so funny?
          
                              CASS
                    My mom was worried I wouldn't have
                    plans for Xmas Eve.
          
                                                                    104.
          
          
          Cass is laughing harder and harder until MILO REALIZES:
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, are you crying?
          
                              CASS
                        (SOBBING)
                    No. I'm not...
          
          Milo doesn't know what to do. His hands are trapped in front
          of him, he can't even pat her on the shoulder.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, just don't...
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not crying.
          
                              MILO
                    I know you're not.
          
                              CASS
                    I just...(miserable) I can't
                    believe I going to die by being
                    blown up and sinking to the bottom
                    of the ocean with someone who
                    thinks I'm a total liar.
          
                              MILO
                    We're not gonna die.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh yeah? What's the plan?
          
                              MILO
                        (THINKING)
                    Well...
          
          Milo looks around. There is a SMALL PORTHOLE IN ONE WALL.
          Milo assumes a take-charge manner:
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. Here's what we do. We're going
                    to synchronize our efforts in order
                    to cross the room and manipulate
                    the bomb out of the room and into
                    the water in order to diffuse the
                    explosive impact.
          
          Beat.
          
                              CASS
                    You mean we're going to throw the
                    bomb out the window?
          
                                                                105.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Uh, yeah. Or we can just wait to
                    get blown up.
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER: "1:19, 1:18, 1:17..."
          
                              CASS
                        (QUICKLY)
                    I'm with you. Go, team, go.
          
                              MILO
                    That's the spirit. Ok, first we're
                    going sideways: to the left...
          
          Milo leans one way, Cass leans the other: THEY DON'T MOVE.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. My left this time...
          
          They both lean to the left and topple over. Milo is facing
          the direction of the bomb.
          
                              MILO
                    Now we're gonna work our way over
                    to the bomb.
          
          They start moving like a sideways inchworm, creeping along.
          
                              MILO
                    And I don't think you're a total
                    liar, but in my own defense, I was
                    one of the top detectives in my
                    division, I had been working that
                    case for months, and then you just
                    waltzed in and solved it.
          
                              CASS
                    I didn't just "waltz in". You know
                    I had been working it for months,
                    too. Isn't it possible that we're
                    both good at our jobs, and I just
                    happened to come out ahead?
          
          Beat.
          
                              MILO
                        (FUMBLING)
                    Oh. Well, I...(blurting out) Look,
                    I was confused, I had never been in
                    love before!
          
                              CASS
                    Well, neither had I!
          
                                                                    106.
          
          
          Milo seems surprised to hear this. But before he can respond,
          THE BOAT ROCKS ON A WAVE AND THEY ARE SENT ROLLING IN CASS'
          DIRECTION. AS THEY ROLL:
          
                                CASS
                    Ow...
          
                                MILO
                    Shit..
          
                                CASS
                    Dammit...
          
          They are stopped when MILO'S FACE IS SLAMMED INTO THE SIDE OF
          THE BOAT. Milo lets out a grunt. Beat.
          
                                CASS
                    Milo?
          
                              MILO
                        (MUFFLED)
                    I'm Ok. Ok, we need to turn to the
                    right, and wait for the next wave.
          
          They both start turning separate ways:
          
                                MILO
                    My right.
          
          They turn to the right and wait. After a moment:
          
                              MILO
                    So. You were in love with me?
          
                              CASS
                    Of course I was in love with you,
                    why do you think I married you?
          
          No response. Behind her back, Milo looks sheepish. Cass
          REALIZES:
          
                              CASS
                    Oh. My. God. You think I married
                    you so I could get info on the
                    case? Who am I, Mata Hari?
          
          Milo looks confused. He is trying to figure out...
          
                              CASS
                    She's a spy, Milo.
          
          Aaah.
          
                                                                 107.
          
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    I know that. Everybody knows that.
                    Mata Hari the spy.
          
          Beat. Milo clears his throat.
          
                              MILO
                    Well. It might be a little late for
                    this. But...nice job on the
                    article.
          
                              CASS
                    You know, if I had something sharp
                    right now, I would stab you.
          
                              MILO
                    No, really, I mean, it was well-
                    written and...
          
                              CASS
                    Can you just get us out of here,
                    please?
          
          Suddenly, A WAVE HITS THE BOAT, AND THEY GO ROLLING TOWARDS
          THE BOMB. AS THEY ROLL:
          
                              CASS
                    Umph...
          
                              MILO
                    Ughh...
          
                              CASS
                    Son of a...
          
                              MILO
                    Ow...
          
          And they come to a stop, MILO'S FACE PRESSED RIGHT UP TO THE
          BOMB. He watches the timer: "00:44, 00:43, 00:42..."
          
                              CASS
                    Can you see the bomb?
          
                               MILO
                    Uh, yeah. I can see the bomb. Now
                    we get up.
          
          MILO GRABS THE BOMB AND HOLDS IT AGAINST HIS BELLY. Cass and
          Milo push against each other, and struggle up to a standing
          position.
          
          Great. So far, so good.
          
                                                                 108.
          
          
          Only, MILO CAN'T RAISE HIS ARMS. AND THE PORTHOLE IS SIX FEET
          ABOVE THE GROUND. NOW WHAT?
          
                              CASS
                    Did you throw it?
          
                              MILO
                    Not exactly.
          
                              CASS
                    Well, what are you waiting for?
          
                              MILO
                    I'm waiting for a pig to fly in
                    here and grab it.
          
                              CASS
                        (starting to panic again)
                    Milo...
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, Ok. Um, on 3, I need you to
                    jump.

                              MILO
                    No. I'm fucking with you. For fun.
                    Just for my own personal
                    enjoyment...
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, Ok.

          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:03, 00:02, 00:01..."
          
          And finally, MILO IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT HE CAN THRUST THE BOMB

          Milo and Cass, both a little out of breath, stand still,
          listening. Silence.
          
                              CASS
                    Think the water defused it?
          
                              MILO
                    Lemme ask you this? Has anything
                    gone our way yet?
          
          SUDDENLY, A LOW ROAR FROM BENEATH GROWS AND RISES UP BENEATH
          THE BOAT, ROCKING IT WILDLY AS WATER EXPLODES ON ALL SIDES.
          
          Cass and Milo get drenched, BUT ARE SAFE.
          
                                CASS
                    Nice job.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. You, too.
          
                                CASS
                    Thanks.
          
                              MILO
                    Now lets find something to cut
                    these ropes off...
          
                              CASS
                    Think we can catch that cop?
          
                              MILO
                    Trust me: we can definitely catch
                    that cop.
          
          Because at this very moment...
          
                                                                    110.

          ...Bobby is paddling frantically, pausing every once in a
          while to curse the motor, WHICH FOR SOME REASON REFUSES TO
          START. He see the lights of another boat coming up behind
          him, and he paddles faster.
          
          
          EXT DECK OF YACHT- NIGHT
          
          Milo steers the yacht right up behind Bobby, dwarfing the
          motorboat. Calling out:
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, Bobby. I got one for ya...
          
          Bobby looks up to see MILO POINTING AN ASSAULT RIFLE HE
          GRABBED FROM THE EVIDENCE BOXES:
          
                              MILO
                    What's the difference between a
                    snowman and a snowwoman? (holding
                    something up) The spark plug.
          
          Bobby checks the motor: SO THAT'S WHY IT WON'T RUN. MILO
          GRABBED THE SPARK PLUG. Milo and Cass grin down at Bobby
          while he kicks the motor and swears.
          
          
          EXT PIER 19- DAWN
          
          CHIRON: "6:00 AM. PIER 19. 3 HOURS TO GO."
          
          Cops are everywhere. Cass and Milo are seated on a bench,
          exhausted, watching as THE COPS UNLOAD BOXES OF STOLEN
          EVIDENCE FROM THE YACHT. Bobby is cuffed in the back of a
          squad car.
          
          After a moment:
          
                              MILO
                    Merry Xmas. I got you this.
          
          Milo hands Cass some seaweed.
          
                              CASS
                    You shouldn't have.
          
          Milo checks his watch.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. I've still got three hours to
                    get you to jail. Looks like I'm
                    gonna win that bet after all.
          
                                                                  111.
          
          
          Cass' eyes go wide. Suddenly, she JUMPS UP and BOLTS.
          
                              MILO
                        (to himself)
                    You have got to be kidding me.
          
          
          EXT BEACH- DAWN
          
          Like an action sequence in slo-mo, Cass stumbles across the
          sand, exhausted, Milo at her heels. Finally, he makes one
          last effort, LUNGES for her, brings her down and SNAPS on the
          cuffs.
          
                               CASS
                        (muffled, face in the
                         SAND)
                    I'm not going without a fight.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah. I'm getting that.
          
          He pulls her to her feet.
          
          INT JERSEY CITY POLICE STATION- MORNING
          
          Milo leads Cass up to the clerk, both of them looking like a
          mess. He checks his watch:
          
                              MILO
                    9am. See? Easy as pie.(nudging
                    Cass) Go on, say it.
          
                              CASS
                        (to the clerk)
                    I'd like to turn myself in. (can't
                    resist) Though I didn't do anything
                    wrong...
          
                              MILO
                    Stop talking.
          
                              CASS
                    ...and I was unjustly arrested...
          
          To shut her up, Milo GRABS HER AND KISSES HER. THEN SHE IS
          KISSING HIM BACK. TIME STOPS FOR A MOMENT.
          
          Then Milo hands her over to the clerk.
          
                              MILO
                        (to Cass)

                    Oh. Ok.
          
          The clerk leads her into the jail.

          Milo exits. He passes some cops on their way in. ONE GELMAN,
          THE COP HE INSULTED IN THE BEGINNING.
          
                              GELMAN
                    Hey. It's that jerk-off bounty
                    hunter.
          
          Milo stops in his tracks. Mentally weighs the pros and cons.
          DECIDES:
          
                              MILO
                    Ah, what the hell.
          
          He turns around, walks back to Gelman, AND SMASHES HIM IN THE
          FACE WITH HIS FIST.

                              MILO
                    Hey. I couldn't let you spend Xmas
                    alone. Besides, I didn't really
                    have any plans other than drinking
                    some cheap whiskey and putting my
                    fist through a wall.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm touched that you would give
                    that up for me.
          
                              MILO

                     were just stuck together long
