               FADE IN

               RAIN

               Falls from low grey clouds. Down below we see...

               THE RIVER

               Muddy, slow and powerful, overflowing its banks. In the near 
               distance is...

               THE RESERVOIR

               Filled to the maximum, water thundering out of two open gates. 
               We close in on...

               THE DAM

               There's a Dam Control Office in the middle of the dam. We 
               MOVE OFF the reservoir and head out over...

               THE TOWN OF HUNTINGBURG

               We see "NO FEAR" spelled out in stones on one man's roof. We 
               go down and into...

               EXT. STREETS OF HUNTINGBURG - DUSK

               Storefronts are sandbagged and closed. A sign on one store 
               reads: GONE FISHING. A sign on another: HEY LOOTER. NOTHING 
               OF VALUE HERE. TRY NEXT DOOR. And on the next store: HE'S 
               LYING.

               A CHURCH

               Beautiful, old, ringed with a five-foot-high wall of sandbags. 
               The floodwater is up to the first level of sandbags.

               CARS AND PICKUP TRUCKS

               Loaded down, are heading out of town on streets covered in 
               the first water of the flood.

               A STATUE

               On an island in the middle of the street. It's Civil War-
               era, of a general on a horse, sword held high. The floodwater 
               is over the curb, lapping at the base of statue's pedestal. 
               Near the statue stands...

               THE SHERIFF

               50s, with soft edges and friendly eyes. He's talking into 
               his radio mike.

                                     SHERIFF
                         So, are we all going to die?

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               HANK, the dam control officer, is on the radio with the 
               Sheriff.

                                     HANK
                         Not right now. But I'm gonna have to 
                         let out a little more.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               WAYNE and PHIL, two deputies, 30s, are near the Sheriff, 
               shoring up a sandbag wall that has partially collapsed.

                                     PHIL
                         I think my best was when I turned 
                         twelve. My Dad set up a treasure 
                         hunt. It was really cool.
                              (off Wayne's disdainful 
                              look)
                         Well, it was.

               Wayne shrugs a "whatever" and pulls a sandbag up out of the 
               water. There's unpleasant-looking muck all over his arms. He 
               drops the sandbag back into the water and shakes off the 
               crud with disgust.

                                     WAYNE
                         This blows.

                                     PHIL
                         My most awful birthday was sweet 
                         sixteen. I had mono. How about you? 
                         What was your worst?

                                     WAYNE
                         You kidding? You think I could've 
                         possibly had a birthday worse than 
                         this? What kind of loser do you think 
                         I am?

                                     SHERIFF (O.S.)
                         Don't answer that, Phil.

               The Sheriff walks over.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank says he's gonna open another 
                         gate. We're gonna get another rise.

               They turn at the sound of honking. The MAYOR drives up.

                                     MAYOR
                         Gentlemen. Hey -- happy birthday, 
                         Wayne.

               Wayne nods. Phil stiffens. They do not like this guy.

                                     MAYOR
                              (to the Sheriff)
                         Mike, I gotta say, what you're 
                         doing... I don't know if I'd be here, 
                         considering.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (good-natured)
                         Well, you would be if you wanted to 
                         get the last couple of paychecks 
                         some bastard owed you.

                                     MAYOR
                              (grins, then:)
                         I just want you to know I think the 
                         people 'round here made a big mistake.

               Phil grumbles to himself.

                                     PHIL
                         "The people"? You're the one who 
                         screwed him.

                                     MAYOR
                         Sorry, Phil?

                                     PHIL
                              (blushes)
                         I, uh --

                                     SHERIFF
                              (to Mayor, saving 
                              Phil)
                         You know, Bob, as much as I'd love 
                         to stand here all day talking about 
                         how great I am, if you don't get 
                         moving I'm gonna have to haul your 
                         sorry ass off to jail.

                                     MAYOR
                              (laughs)
                         Okay, okay, I'm going. Keep up the 
                         good work, boys. It's appreciated.

               The Mayor rolls up his window and heads off.

                                     WAYNE
                         Whaddya say we go torch the fucker's 
                         house and blame it on looters. Or 
                         how about we put a dead cow in his 
                         living room. He comes back after 
                         it's been in the water a couple of 
                         days. Hello!

                                     SHERIFF
                              (shakes head)
                         You wanna know how to get the best 
                         revenge on the Mayor and his boys? 
                         You do exactly what we're doing. You 
                         protect the town. You protect it 
                         better than they would. Better than 
                         they ever could.

                                     WAYNE
                              (thinks, shrugs)
                         I think the dead cow's better.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (ignores Wayne)
                         Any looter that comes in here is in 
                         for a big surprise, cause as long as 
                         I'm still wearing this pointy thing...
                              (indicates badge)
                         ...nobody's taking anything from 
                         this town.

               INT. BANK VAULT

               Nervous assistant bank manager WELLMAN is hurriedly tossing 
               stacks of money into two canvas bags.

               A MAN'S SHADOW

               Washes up on Wellman.

                                     CHARLIE (O.S.)
                         Do you think you could go a little 
                         faster, pal?

                                     WELLMAN
                         I -- I'm going as fast as I can.

               SECOND SHADOW COMES UP

                                     TOM (O.S.)
                         Well, it's not fast enough.

               Wellman is about to speak, then sees something, gulps.

               A SHOTGUN

               Is held by one of the men, pointed at the floor.

               WELLMAN

               Sweeps the money off the shelves and into the bags.

                                     SECOND MAN (O.S.)
                         That it?

                                     WELLMAN
                         Yes. We don't keep any of our --

               THE TWO MEN

               Ignore Wellman, grab the canvas bags and stride off.

               EXT. BANK - DAY

               CLOSE ON the lower half of the front doors as they fly open. 
               Out come TWO MEN in long dark raincoats.

               WELLMAN

               Runs up, stopping in the open door.

                                     WELLMAN
                         Hey, wait!

               VERY CLOSE ON THE TWO MEN

               As they slowly turn to face Wellman. We just see their faces, 
               shielded from the rain by hat brims. Meet...

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Tom, 30, handsome, with an easy smile. Charlie, 50, with a 
               tough, red face.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Excuse me?

               WELLMAN

               Looks nervous for a second, then holds up a clipboard.

                                     WELLMAN
                         You forgot to sign.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               We see, for the first time, by their hats and uniforms, that 
               they are armored car drivers. There's an armored car parked 
               at the curb, on the other side of a low wall of sandbags.

               Charlie sighs, goes back to Wellman and perfunctorily signs 
               the form. Then he and Tom go to the sandbag wall. Tom holds 
               both bags in one hand and the shotgun in the other. Charlie 
               doesn't want to get wet.

               He steps from the sandbag wall onto the rear bumper of the 
               truck, then keys open the doors.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Okay.

               Charlie reaches out for the money bags. Tom jumps off the 
               sandbag wall and lands in the water, splashing Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         For Christsakes!

                                     TOM
                         It's a flood, Charlie. You're gonna 
                         get wet.

               Charlie takes the bags, tosses them in then shuts the back. 
               He moves toward the front, still trying to keep out of the 
               water. Tom splashes him some more.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey! Do you know what kind of crap 
                         is in that water?

                                     TOM
                              (of course he knows)
                         Well, yeah.

               Tom kicks some more water at Charlie. Charlie gives Tom a 
               withering look and climbs in the truck.

               INT. ARMORED TRUCK

               Charlie gets into the driver's seat; Tom climbs into the 
               shotgun seat. They shut and bolt the doors. Charlie gets on 
               the radio.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dispatch, this is 31.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                         Go ahead, 31.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're leaving Huntingburg. We'll be 
                         back in an hour.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                         Ten-four. Get out of there.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're gone. Over and out.

               Charlie hangs up the radio. He starts writing on a clipboard. 
               Silence for a few moments, and then Charlie notices Tom 
               staring at him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What?

                                     TOM
                         Your ear.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What about my ear?

                                     TOM
                         You've got a major hair growth going 
                         on.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Shut up.

                                     TOM
                         I'm serious. You're gonna need 
                         somebody to go in there with a weed 
                         whacker.

               Charlie grabs a donut bag off the seat and tosses it to Tom.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Here.

                                     TOM
                         You're offering me one of your donuts? 
                         I don't know what to say. I'm getting 
                         all misty.

                                     CHARLIE
                         If it'll shut your mouth you can 
                         have the whole bag.

               Charlie starts the truck. Tom thinks about it, then tosses 
               the bag back.

                                     TOM
                         Nah. I start eating donuts and I'll 
                         never get out of this truck.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (disgusted)
                         I love how you think you're better 
                         than this.

                                     TOM
                         Don't get me wrong, Charlie. There's 
                         a lot to like about this job -- and 
                         I don't just mean the dashing 
                         polyester ensemble and the solid 
                         three-figure income.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (angry)
                         You ungrateful shit! I don't believe 
                         you!

                                     TOM
                              (surprised)
                         Charlie, relax! I was kidding!

                                     CHARLIE
                         You don't wanna do this? Fine. Go 
                         back to selling hot construction 
                         machinery. That's a helluva career.

                                     TOM
                         It had better hours.

               Charlie slams the clipboard down on the seat.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You think this is a joke? This is 
                         funny? Jesus Christ! You know how 
                         lucky you are you could get in here? 
                         Thirty years old and all the crap 
                         you pulled and you never got caught?

                                     TOM
                              (angry)
                         That wasn't luck, old man. That was 
                         skill. I was good at it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, yeah, it takes a lot of skill to 
                         fence bulldozers. That's goddamn 
                         genius time.

                                     TOM
                         About as much skill as it takes to 
                         sit in a truck and get fat eating 
                         donuts.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, so that's all I've been doing, 
                         huh? Just wasting my life away.

                                     TOM
                         I didn't say that.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yeah, building a home, raising a 
                         family -- that's just stupid.

                                     TOM
                         I didn't say that!

                                     CHARLIE
                         You know what, Tom? I really don't 
                         give a shit what you said.

               Tom doesn't reply. Charlie puts the truck in gear; starts 
               off. Tom looks at Charlie, shakes his head -- what was that 
               about?

               Writing letters in a crossword puzzle. Holding the pen is...

               JIM

               Late 50s, with a creased face and piercing eyes. He's sitting 
               at the bar, drinking coffee. Rain sheets down outside. The 
               BARTENDER watches TV, sound off. Next to Jim at the bar are...

               RAY, KENNY AND MR. MEHLOR

               Ray, 40s, has lank hair, rheumy eyes and a glass of Irish 
               whisky in front of him. Kenny, 20s, long hair, has the energy 
               of a puppy -- unfortunately he has about as much smarts as a 
               puppy. Mr. Mehlor. 40s, looks like -- and was -- a high school 
               teacher.

               ON TV

               Sound off, a MAN is crying about what he has lost in the 
               flood.

                                     RAY
                         "Thus saith the Lord; Behold, waters 
                         shall rise up out of the north and 
                         be an overflowing flood and all the 
                         inhabitants of the land shall howl." 
                         Jeremiah 47:2.

               Ray takes a drink. Kenny leans over to Ray, sotto.

                                     KENNY
                         You're gonna be able to buy a helluva 
                         lot of bibles, huh, Ray? Me? First 
                         thing I'm gonna do is get my brother 
                         a lawyer. Best that money can buy.

               A thought comes to Jim -- an answer to a clue in the crossword -- 
               and he starts filling in words as Ray and Kenny talk.

                                     RAY
                         What's he facing?

                                     KENNY
                         Thirty in.

                                     RAY
                         He cap a cop or something...?

                                     KENNY
                         Security guard. "In the commission..." 
                         All he's got is a piece of shit P.D. 
                         Now I'm gonna be able to afford him 
                         a good lawyer -- a guy with a haircut.

               Jim leans over to Kenny.

                                     JIM
                         'Scuse me a second. Take a look at 
                         thirty-one across.

               Jim slides the newspaper in front of Kenny.

                                     KENNY
                         Shit, Jim. I don't do crossword 
                         puzzles.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         I'll take a look, Jim.

                                     JIM
                         Kenny can read.
                              (to Kenny)
                         Just look at it. You know when you 
                         write down a word and suddenly it 
                         looks all wrong? Maybe it's right, 
                         but it doesn't look right?

               Jim points at the newspaper.

                                     JIM
                         Thirty-one across.

               Kenny shrugs and looks down at the newspaper.

                                     KENNY
                              (mumbles as he reads)
                         Mention money again and...

               His eyes go wide.

               ECU CROSSWORD PUZZLE

               In an uncompleted part of the puzzle, Jim has written a 
               message in the boxes. It reads: MENTION MONEY AND I'LL KILL 
               YOU.

               JIM AND KENNY

               Kenny looks up at Jim. Jim glances over at the bartender 
               then back at Kenny. Understand?

                                     JIM
                         Did I get it right?

                                     KENNY
                         Yeah, Jim. You got it right.

               INT. ARMORED TRUCK - DUSK

               Charlie and Tom continue to drive in silence. They both sneak 
               looks at each other. Their eyes meet for a second, then they 
               look away. A moment's pause then...

                                     TOM
                         Jerk.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Jack-ass.

               A hint of a smile on both of them. Tom reaches for Charlie.

                                     TOM
                         Give us a kiss. Come on.

               Charlie goes red in the face, pushes Tom away.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Get out of here.

                                     TOM
                              (laughs, beat)
                         You really are a cranky old fart, 
                         you know that?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     TOM
                         What was that about? I mean, I'm 
                         just sitting here and all of a sudden 
                         you go postal on me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't know, I... It's just this 
                         weather. I... I want to get back.

                                     TOM
                         You know, I really do appreciate 
                         what you've done for me. This is a 
                         good job.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, it's not. It stinks. It's putting 
                         your life on the line for someone 
                         else's money.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - DUSK

               Looking away from town, the HIGH SCHOOL is on the left. On 
               the right is the CEMETERY. Farther on, on the left, is a CAR 
               AND BOAT DEALERSHIP. The road is covered in water.

               THE ARMORED TRUCK

               Goes by the entrance to the high school, water shooting up 
               from the wheels, pushing out in a wide wake.

               INT. TRUCK

               Tom glances ahead and sees that the road is covered in water.

                                     TOM
                         Jesus. Where's the road?

               THEIR POV

               Stretching out ahead of them are reflector bars on the 
               telephone poles, a few feet above the rippling surface of 
               the floodwater.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's there.
                              (beat)
                         Somewhere. I hope.
                              (beat)
                         Look, Tom, I don't care what it is 
                         you end up doing.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, God, here we go again.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is the last time, I swear.

               Tom sees something ahead. He doesn't understand at first.

               HIS POV

               The reflector bar on the pole two poles ahead is lower than 
               the others. No reflector bars for a hundred yards, then they 
               resume.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (looks at Tom)
                         I just think, whatever it is you do, 
                         it's time you did some heavy lifting.

               Tom figures out what's going on with the reflector bars.

                                     TOM
                         Stop!

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, you gotta hear this. You're better 
                         than --

                                     TOM
                         Stop the truck! We're going down!

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

               The water rises fast up the grille as the truck angles down.

               INSIDE THE TRUCK

                                     CHARLIE
                         Jesus!

               Charlie stands on the brakes.

               THEIR POV

               A wave of water rushes forward from the truck, then comes 
               back and washes over the hood, splashing up on the windshield.

                                     TOM
                         Back up!

               Charlie throws the truck into reverse but gives it too much 
               power. They hear the rear wheels spinning underwater. Charlie 
               eases off, the tires start to catch, they start moving 
               backwards.

               Charlie and Tom exchange a quick look of relief... and then 
               the engine dies. Charlie tries to restart it, but there's 
               nothing.

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

               It's stopped on a downgrade -- it's a dip in the road.

               The water is up to the top of the front tires: up to the 
               hubcaps on the rear wheels. The headlights are underwater, 
               spots of yellow glowing. They've stopped next to a lighted 
               sign.

               CLOSE ON SIGN

                                 WELCOME TO HUNTINGBURG.

                        HOME OF THE 1987 STATE CHAMPION WARRIORS.

               IN THE TRUCK

                                     CHARLIE
                         Goddammit!

                                     TOM
                         It's a little dip in the road or 
                         something. You can see the reflectors 
                         come up the other side.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (curses to himself)
                         I knew this would happen.
                              (grabs radio mike)

                                     TOM
                         I'll see if there's anyone coming. 
                         Maybe we can get pulled out.

               Tom opens the door. Charlie adjusts the radio frequency 
               selection button; clicks on.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dispatch, this is 31. 31 calling 
                         dispatch.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                              (over radio)
                         31, this is dispatch.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (into radio)
                         Dispatch, we're stuck outside of 
                         Huntingburg. Truck's dead.

                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                         Where are you?

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're on 231, headed for the 
                         Interstate. Right by a sign saying 
                         "Welcome to Huntingburg."

               Tom climbs out and up on top of the truck.

               OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

               Tom stands on top of the truck. In one direction, nothing 
               but blackness. The other way he can see the lights of the 
               town. But there are no cars coming.

               IN THE TRUCK

               Charlie looks over as Tom appears, upside-down, in the 
               doorway.

                                     TOM
                         The town's been evacuated. We won't 
                         get any help from there.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dispatch can't get anyone out.

                                     TOM
                         They are aware we're carrying a 
                         shitload of money...?

                                     CHARLIE
                         They called the National Guard. 
                         They're gonna be here in about ninety 
                         minutes.

                                     TOM
                         Ninety minutes? Jesus.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (nods; into radio)
                         Dispatch, we're gonna need help a 
                         little sooner than --

               There's a sudden sparking sound and the radio cuts out and 
               interior lights and the headlights go out.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, shit.

               INT. HOUSE - DUSK POV THROUGH WINDOW

               Looking out as the Sheriff's car rolls past on the water-
               covered street. A HAND lets go of a curtain and it swings 
               across the window.

               EXT. STREET - DUSK IN THE SHERIFF'S CAR

               The Sheriff motions Wayne to stop the car, then he grabs the 
               radio mike and clicks it on as a megaphone.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (into mike)
                         Henry, I saw you. Come on out.

               No one comes out of the house.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Henry, I'm not leaving until you 
                         come out.

               A few moments pass and then...

               HENRY AND DOREEN SWERZKY

               Late 70s, step out onto their porch.

                                     DOREEN
                         Jesus H. Christ, Henry, I told you 
                         to stay away from the damn window.

               THE SHERIFF

               Gets out of the car.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What are you still doing here?

                                     HENRY
                         We're just --

                                     DOREEN
                         We're setting traps.

                                     SHERIFF
                         That's illegal, Doreen.

                                     DOREEN
                         You gonna arrest us, Sheriff? Hell, 
                         are you even sheriff anymore, Sheriff? 
                         Didn't you lose an election? I sure 
                         as hell know I didn't vote for you, 
                         and neither did Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         Doreen...

                                     SHERIFF
                         You don't need to set traps.

                                     DOREEN
                         That's what they said in '73. When 
                         we got back, anything the bastards 
                         didn't steal they broke, just for 
                         the hell of it.

                                     SHERIFF
                         That's not happening this time.

                                     DOREEN
                         Damn right it's not.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You can't stay, you know that.

                                     HENRY
                         We're going to my sister's.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Good.

                                     DOREEN
                         Soon as we finish setting the traps.

               The Sheriff wants to say something more, but he's not about 
               to argue with Doreen. He just nods and gets back into the 
               car.

               IN THE CAR

               The Sheriff climbs back in. He and Wayne watch Henry and 
               Doreen go back into the house, Doreen still nagging at Henry.

                                     SHERIFF
                         God'll understand if you have to 
                         drown her in the basement, Henry.

               The Sheriff sighs, nods to Wayne. Wayne puts the car in gear.

               EXT. ARMORED TRUCK - NIGHT

               The water is creeping up the sloping hood of the truck.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We gotta get out of here.

                                     TOM
                         What about the money?

                                     CHARLIE
                         The money's safe; we're not. Water 
                         rose about a foot in the last twenty 
                         minutes. The National Guard isn't 
                         going to be here for another hour. 
                         You do the math.

               Tom shrugs -- Charlie's right. They're about to get out when 
               light washes up on them. They look out to see...

               THE HEADLIGHTS OF A GMC SUBURBAN

               Approaching on the other side of the dip, a quarter-mile 
               away.

               CHARLIE AND TOM

               Look at each other then get out of the truck.

               THE SUBURBAN

               Stops on the far side of the dip -- a hundred yards away. 
               The headlights shine across the water. Doors open and MEN 
               get out.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Come around the front of the truck. They can't see through 
               the glare of the Suburban's bright headlights.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hello!

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         You okay? You stuck?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes!

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         We'll see if we can get you out! 
                         We'll be right over!

               Charlie looks at Tom, relieved.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Looks like we might just --

               THE SUBURBAN

               Headlights go on high beam.

               CHARLIE AND TOM

               Squint, blinded by the high beams.

                                     TOM
                         Why'd they do that?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Probably so they can see better.

                                     TOM
                         Or so we can't see at all.

               Charlie looks at him -- what does he mean? Tom puts his hand 
               on his pistol.

               IN THE WATER

               Assembled by the Suburban are...

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               All holding guns. He speaks to them quietly.

                                     JIM
                         This is my retirement fund, boys, 
                         and if any one of you screws up, I 
                         swear to God I'll kill you. Let's 
                         go.

               They start wading down into the dip in the road. Kenny carries 
               a rifle.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Tom squints through the bright light.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Company dispatch and the National 
                         Guard are the only ones who know 
                         we're here.

                                     TOM
                         Anyone with a scanner from Radio 
                         Shack could've intercepted your call, 
                         Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (realizes)
                         Jesus.

                                     TOM
                              (to Jim and men)
                         Could you turn down your lights?!

                                     JIM
                         We're bringing a rope!

                                     TOM
                         Turn down your lights!

                                     JIM
                         We'll be right there!

               Tom starts to pull his gun.

               KENNY

               is fired up on adrenalin. He has his rifle up and is aiming 
               it.

               HIS POV

               Tom with his hand on his pistol, starting to pull it out.

               TOM AND CHARLIE

               Charlie sees Tom going for his gun. He moves close to Tom, 
               half in front of him, putting his hand on Tom's.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Take it easy, Tom.

               KENNY

               Stiffens.

               KENNY'S FINGER

               Squeezes the trigger of his rifle.

               TOM

               Jumps at the sound of the rifle crack.

               CHARLIE

               Is knocked back.

               TOM

               Yanks out his gun and starts shooting back.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Duck down in the water.

               TOM

               Shooting blindly, looks over and sees...

               CHARLIE

               A horrible look on his face, blood coming out of his neck. 
               He sinks into the water.

               KENNY

               Shoots off another few quick rounds.

               TOM

               Drops into the water, bullets plugging in around him. Just 
               his hand and pistol are visible, shooting blindly back toward 
               Jim and his men. THE SUBURBAN

               Is hit by Tom's fire.

               TOM

               Runs out of bullets. A beat later we see Charlie start moving 
               through the water -- Tom is pulling him.

                                     JIM
                         STOP SHOOTING!

               KENNY

               Doesn't hear Jim and keeps firing.

               JIM

               Aims his pistol at Kenny's head.

                                     JIM
                         Stop.

               Kenny stops.

               BEHIND THE ARMORED TRUCK

               Tom comes up in the water behind the truck, gasping, holding 
               Charlie. Tom rests his gun on the truck bumper.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm sorry, Tom.

               Charlie's gone.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim glares at Kenny, his eyes on fire.

                                     KENNY
                         He was going for his gun!

                                     JIM
                         He wasn't gonna shoot, Kenny. 
                         Goddamnit!
                              (shakes head, calls 
                              to Tom)
                         We just want the money! Get away and 
                         we won't have to kill you!

               TOM

               Shuts his eyes, thinking, scared.

                                     JIM (O.S.)
                         Now!

               Tom opens his eyes. He looks down at...

               CHARLIE

               Floating in the water.

               TOM

               What the hell is he going to do?

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim's men look at him. Jim motions them to wait some more.

                                     JIM
                         You got thirty seconds to get the 
                         hell away!

               Jim and the others wait, but there's no answer from Tom.

                                     JIM
                         The clock's running! Go!

               Still no response from Tom.

               THEIR POV

               All they can see is the front of the truck, in the light of 
               the "Welcome" sign. They can't see the back.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim nods to his men. They head for the truck, down into the 
               deeper water at the bottom of the dip in the road. All have 
               guns up and ready.

               Jim sends Mr. Mehlor and Ray out to circle around. They all 
               move quietly. The only sound is the rain.

               JIM

               Gets to the truck and moves along its side, Kenny right behind 
               him. Jim gets to the back of the truck, nods for Kenny to 
               cover him, then steps out behind the truck, gun up.

               JIM'S POV

               Tom is gone.

               CHARLIE

               Is floating in the water, eyes of glass.

               KENNY, MR. MEHLOR AND RAY

               Step into the circle of light thrown by the "Welcome" sign.

                                     JIM
                              (eyes Charlie)
                         Ah, Jesus.
                              (to Kenny)
                         Your dad'd be real proud of you, 
                         Kenny.

                                     KENNY
                         He was going for his gun!

                                     JIM
                         Mr. Mehlor, I believe we're gonna 
                         need your science project.

               Mr. Mehlor nods and digs into his pack. Ray looks down at 
               Charlie in the water.

                                     RAY
                         "I shall bring floodwaters upon the 
                         earth to destroy all that lives under 
                         the heavens and every creature that 
                         has the breath of life in it shall 
                         perish." Genesis 6:17.

                                     KENNY
                         Were you a preacher or something?

               Ray laughs.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         Ray did five years in the hole at 
                         Joliet. The only thing you get to 
                         read in the hole is the Bible.

                                     KENNY
                              (to Ray)
                         You got religion?

                                     RAY
                         Obviously.

               Mr. Mehlor laughs as he pulls something out of his pack. 
               It's...

               SMALL EXPLOSIVE DEVICE

               A half-stick of dynamite with a timer, mounted on a magnet.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         When you hit the switch you've got 
                         thirty seconds.

                                     RAY
                         You teach your students how to make 
                         things like that?

               Mr. Mehlor puts the device on the back door.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         You been to a high school recently, 
                         Ray? My students taught me how to 
                         make things like that. Ready?

                                     JIM
                         Hold on.

               Something's wrong. Jim touches the handle on the door. It 
               moves. Uh-oh. He raises his pistol, grabs the door handle 
               and pulls. The door swings open. We don't need to see what 
               he sees -- we can tell from the expression on his face.

               EXT. ON THE ROAD

               Tom is running hard through the knee-deep water, pulling a 
               string of canvas money bags buckled together. The truck and 
               "Welcome" sign are two hundred yards behind him. Tom hears 
               an angry yell.

               EXT. BY THE ARMORED TRUCK

               Kenny is the one yelling.

                                     JIM
                         Shut up. Everyone.

               They quiet. The patter of the rain is too loud -- they can't 
               hear anything. Jim scans the horizon, but sees nothing.

                                     RAY
                         Now why'd he have to go and do a 
                         thing like that?

                                     JIM
                         To stay alive.
                              (off their looks)
                         He thinks we'll kill him -- unless 
                         he knows where the money is and we 
                         don't.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         There is another possibility.
                              (off their looks)
                         He's thinking of keeping it for 
                         himself.

                                     JIM
                         There's always that. Either way, we 
                         got ourselves a sharp one.

                                     KENNY
                         What do we do?

               Jim is looking at something in the distance.

                                     JIM
                         Pretty soon the water'll be too deep 
                         for him to run. But for us it'll be 
                         just deep enough.

                                     KENNY
                              (unclear)
                         Deep enough for what?

               INT. CAR AND BOAT DEALERSHIP - SHOWROOM

               A glass window is smashed and water floods into the boat 
               showroom. Jim and his men stride in. Kenny ogles a 
               particularly nice cruiser. Jim stops at a smallish ski-boat.

                                     JIM
                         Here we go.

                                     KENNY
                              (re: cruiser)
                         What about this monster?

                                     JIM
                              (re: ski-boat)
                         This is all we need.

                                     RAY
                         Shit, Jim, we're stealing. Can't we 
                         take anything we want?

                                     JIM
                         The water isn't very deep yet. We 
                         need something with a low draft. Mr. 
                         Mehlor -- find us some gasoline.

               Mr. Mehlor heads off.

               KENNY

               Sees something else he likes. We don't see what it is.

                                     KENNY
                         Oh, Jim...?

               EXT. CEMETERY

               The name WILLIAM PORTMAN is chiseled into a crypt. Tom appears 
               from underwater, gasping for breath. He gets to his feet and 
               trudges off through the water.

               EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE CEMETERY

               Tom comes out through the gates of the cemetery, splashing 
               through the knee-deep water. He's running when he hears, 
               from behind him, boat engines firing up. He turns to see...

               LIGHTS

               Racing toward him over the water, a hundred and fifty yards 
               back.

               TOM

               Sprints off.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Jim is steering the ski-boat. Mr. Mellor hunkers down beside 
               him. We PULL BACK to see...

               TWO JET-SKIS

               Flanking the ski-boat, piloted by Kenny and Ray.

               ON THE ROAD

               Tom is running as fast as he can. He looks back, sees the 
               ski-boat and jet-skis closing. They'll get him before he 
               gets to town. He suddenly veers off the road toward...

               THE HIGH SCHOOL

               The sign out front reads: GO WARRIORS!

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Tom runs around the side of the high school.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Ride up on the ski-boat and jet-skis and round the corner.

               THEIR POV

               No sign of Tom.

                                     JIM
                         Cut your engines!

               The engines are shut down. They all drift. Jim shines a 
               flashlight over onto...

               WINDOWS

               There's a hole in a window large enough to climb through.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM

               Tom wades through the classroom, pushing floating desks aside. 
               Flashlight beams stab into the room. Tom hurries to the hall.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Jim turns to his men.

                                     JIM
                         Let's get him out. But for Godsake, 
                         whatever you do...
                              (with a hard look at 
                              Kenny)
                         ...don't kill him. Not until we find 
                         out where he hid that money.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY

               Tom makes his way past banks of lockers, trying to get as 
               far as he can from the probing flashlight beams.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - FRONT DOORS

               Kenny drifts up to the front doors. He pulls on them. Locked.

                                     JIM
                         Mr. Mehlor?

               MR. MEHLOR

               Reaches into his pack.

               INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

               Tom tries lockers, looking for a place to hide.

               EXT. FRONT DOORS

               Kenny rides his jet-ski fast away from the front doors and 
               the doors explode.

               INT. SCHOOL FRONT LOBBY

               Tom ducks down as...

               A FIREBALL

               Shoots over him.

               KENNY AND RAY

               Ride the jet-skis into the flooded school.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom is swimming as hard as he can, out of breath. KENNY AND 
               RAY

               Ray goes off down a hall while Kenny idles in the lobby.

               TOM

               Surfaces, gasping.

               KENNY

               Hears the gasp, turns, grinning.

                                     KENNY
                         Enemy sub off the port bow!

               TOM

               Gets to his feet runs as fast as he can down the hall. He 
               rounds a corner and keeps going.

               KENNY

               Guns his engine and takes off after Tom.

               TOM

               Runs another thirty feet, then trips on something and goes 
               down.

               KENNY

               Comes around the corner, grinning when he sees...

               TOM

               Halfway down the hall, standing frozen, caught in Kenny's 
               light.

               KENNY

               Guns it, racing forward down the hall toward Tom.

                                     KENNY
                         Full steam ahead!

               THE JET-SKI

               Hits something underwater and stops.

               KENNY

               Keeps going. He flies through the air, slams headfirst into 
               a trophy case and drops into the water.

               TOM

               Stands up -- he was kneeling.

                                     TOM
                         Low tide, sailor.

               A HANDRAIL

               On the wall, angles down into the water. Underwater there 
               are a couple of steps leading up to a change in level in the 
               hall -- that's what the jet-ski grounded on.

               HALLWAY

               Ray motors down the hallway toward the corner.

                                     RAY
                         Kenny?

               HIS POV

               Around the corner comes a jet-ski. Ray assumes it's Kenny.

                                     RAY
                         See him?

               Then the jet-ski speeds up and shoots by him. Ray sees it's...

               TOM

               Wearing Kenny's hat and jacket.

               RAY

               Gives chase.

               SCHOOL HALLWAYS

               Ray races after Tom along the flooded hallways, taking the 
               turns fast. Ray pulls a gun, starts shooting.

               TOM'S POV

               Tearing through the halls, flashlight lighting the way. 
               Bullets hit the walls, ceiling, water around him.

               TOM

               Comes around a corner, sees the open front doors ahead of 
               him.

               JIM AND MR. MEHLOR

               Come into view in the ski-boat, blocking the exit.

               TOM

               Turns hard and speeds down a side hall.

               TOM'S POV

               A wall of windows at the end. No way out. Trapped. Then...

               KENNY

               Rises out of the water, blood running down his face, pistol 
               up.

               TOM

               Looks back.

               RAY

               Is on his tail.

               TOM

               Makes his choice and guns the jet-ski straight at Kenny.

                                     TOM
                         Yee-hah!

               KENNY

               Fires, misses and is knocked to the side as...

               TOM

               Hunches down on the jet-ski and crashes through the windows.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Jim and Mr. Mehlor are moving right outside the windows just 
               as Tom blasts out of the school and races off into the dark.

               EXT. OPEN WATER

               Tom moves fast over the water. He yanks off his clip-on tie.

               JIM AND THE OTHERS

               Chase Tom's light, behind by fifty yards, heading out into 
               farm fields. They get closer and closer and then watch as...

               TOM'S JET-SKI

               Runs straight into a tree and explodes.

               JIM AND THE OTHERS

               Race up to find the burning, flaming wreckage of the jet-
               ski. Ray circles on the other jet-ski. Kenny, still bleeding 
               from the head, is in the boat with Jim and Mr. Mehlor.

                                     KENNY
                              (laughing)
                         Nice driving, buttwipe!

                                     RAY
                         I'm glad you're enjoying this, Kenny, 
                         but if he's dead, how do we find the 
                         money?

               Kenny reacts -- oh, right.

                                     JIM
                         Oh, he's still alive.

               We see what Jim sees.

               ECU THROTTLE OF JET-SKI

               Tom used his tie to wrap the throttle open.

               HUNDRED YARDS AWAY

               Tom is hiding in the branches of a floating tree, watching 
               the distant lights of Jim and his men. The current carries 
               Tom away.

               WITH JIM AND HIS MEN

               Jim scans the horizon; sees nothing.

                                     JIM
                         Ray, I'm in need of a little 
                         inspiration.

                                     RAY
                         "With a raging flood he makes an end 
                         of those who oppose him, and pursues 
                         his enemies into darkness." From one 
                         of the more obscure --

                                     KENNY
                         Sorry to interrupt Bible study and 
                         all, but has no one but me noticed 
                         how completely screwed we are? We 
                         should be back in the motel room, 
                         counting out the money. Instead --

               Jim lashes out with a fist, hard and fast, hitting Kenny in 
               the chest, knocking him out of the ski-boat, into the water. 
               Kenny comes up in the thigh-deep water, sputtering.

                                     JIM
                         No one likes this particular turn of 
                         events, Kenny, but we have a choice -- 
                         we can can either deal with it or we 
                         can walk away. There's a lot of money 
                         out there, so I choose to deal with 
                         it. If you want to go, that's fine -- 
                         start swimming. You want to stay, 
                         that's fine, too -- just stop your 
                         damn whining.

               Jim pushes the throttle forward and the ski-boat takes off, 
               leaving Ray on the jet-ski, with Kenny in the water.

                                     KENNY
                         What the hell's his problem? All the 
                         money in the world ain't worth a 
                         goddamn nickel if you get caught. 
                         It's not like there won't be other 
                         jobs.

                                     RAY
                         You may have more of these in you, 
                         Kenny, but Jim doesn't.

               Ray pulls Kenny up onto the jet-ski and takes off after Jim.

               EXT. BACK OF CHURCH - SANDBAG WALL

               The water level is creeping up a five-foot-high wall of 
               sandbags.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               Looking out over the top of the sandbag wall. A tree floats 
               by on the water.

               HANDS

               Suddenly appear on the top of the wall and...

               TOM

               Pulls himself into view. He climbs over the wall, exhausted.

               BEHIND THE SANDBAG WALL

               Gasoline-powered pumps are sucking up any rainwater. The 
               sandbags have kept the floodwater at bay.

               TOM

               He hurries up the back steps and goes into the church.

               INT. CHURCH - BACK ROOM

               Tom walks through a small room lined with closed cupboards. 
               He goes through a door.

               INT. CHURCH - MAIN HALL

               Tom comes out into the altar. He looks around, impressed. 
               It's a beautiful church. Scaffolding goes up one wall -- the 
               church is being restored. Tom is startled by a sound from 
               above. He grabs a heavy silver candlestick as a weapon and 
               looks up to see...

               BIRDS

               Fluttering up in the rafters.

               TOM

               Takes a breath. Just as he relaxes, he hears a whooshing 
               sound from behind him and turns to see...

               A LARGE CRUCIFIX

               Being swung at his head. Thunk and...

               THE SCREEN GOES BLACK

               FADE IN:

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom slowly regains consciousness, blinking his eyes. He 
               hears...

                                     SHERIFF (O.S.)
                         What are you doing here?

               But the Sheriff isn't asking Tom, he's asking...

               KAREN

               30, pretty, even in head-to-toe rain gear.

                                     KAREN
                         I was setting up pumps.

                                     WAYNE
                         I sure as hell don't get what you 
                         see in that church.

                                     KAREN
                         I wouldn't expect you to, Wayne.

                                     WAYNE
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Karen, did you think the order was 
                         for everyone but you to evacuate?

                                     KAREN
                         I was gonna go as soon as I filled 
                         the pumps, but the next thing I know, 
                         I've got a looter on my hands. Now, 
                         maybe I'm crazy, but I was expecting 
                         a little gratitude?

                                     PHIL
                         I think it's great what you did.

                                     WAYNE
                         That's it, Phil. That'll finally get 
                         you into her pants.

                                     PHIL
                         Shut up.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What if he'd had a gun, Karen? A lot 
                         of these looters carry guns.

                                     TOM (O.S.)
                         I'm not a looter.

               TOM

               Sits up on a cot, behind bars in the holding cell, woozy.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL

               Jim and his men are searching the school for the money.

                                     RAY
                         Jim, it could be anywhere. It might 
                         not even be in the school.

                                     JIM
                         Keep looking.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               The rain sheets down hard. A lightning flash reveals...

               THE STATUE

               The water is up to the horse's knees. The lightning passes 
               and a second later thunder rolls.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The Sheriff, Phil, Wayne and Karen stand outside the cell. 
               Tom is inside, on the cot. He touches the cut on his forehead.

                                     WAYNE
                         What were you doing at the church?

                                     KAREN
                         I told you -- he was looting it.

                                     TOM
                         I just said I'm not a looter!
                              (to Karen)
                         You're the one who nailed me?
                              (Karen nods)
                         You got a better arm than my ex-wife. 
                         What the hell did you hit me with -- 
                         a statue? I saw a flash of some guy 
                         coming at me.

                                     KAREN
                              (mumbles, embarrassed)
                         It was a crucifix.
                              (to others)
                         It was the only thing there!

                                     TOM
                         Oh, great. Now I'm gonna have people 
                         coming from around the world to see 
                         the face of Jesus on my forehead.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Look, son, what were you doing in 
                         the church?

                                     TOM
                         Looking for a place to hide out.

                                     WAYNE
                         From who -- Swamp Thing?

                                     TOM
                         The bastards who killed my partner.

               That stops the room.

                                     TOM
                         We were driving an armored truck. 
                         The truck got stuck out past the 
                         high school. They must've picked up 
                         our call to dispatch, 'cause they 
                         knew where we were. Charlie and I 
                         were just standing there and all 
                         hell broke loose.

                                     SHERIFF
                         How much money did you have?

                                     TOM
                         A little over three million.

               They all exchange a look -- that's a lot of money.

                                     TOM
                         The bank was afraid of looters. They 
                         had us cleaning out their branches 
                         up and down the river.

                                     WAYNE
                         They stole three million dollars?

                                     SHERIFF
                         No, I don't think so.

               They all look at the Sheriff. He looks at Tom.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You took the money, didn't you.

                                     TOM
                         I hid it in the cemetery. Tied it to 
                         a crypt for a guy named Portman.

                                     WAYNE
                         What the hell'd you do that for?

                                     TOM
                         I don't like to carry around that 
                         much cash.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Jesus, Wayne, use your head. If he 
                         hadn't hidden it, they woulda killed 
                         him, too.

               The Sheriff looks at Tom -- is that it? Tom nods.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You got any ID?

                                     TOM
                         No, it was in my jacket and I --

                                     WAYNE
                         Color me surprised.

               The Sheriff thinks for a beat, then tosses some keys to Phil.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Get out two rifles and a shotgun.

               Phil nods and goes to it. The Sheriff opens a desk drawer, 
               pulls out an ankle holster.

                                     WAYNE
                         You believe him?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Well, yes, Wayne, I do. And even if 
                         I didn't, I'd say we sure as hell 
                         had an obligation to check it out, 
                         don't you think?

               The Sheriff starts strapping on the ankle holster.

                                     TOM
                         I'll go with you. I can show you 
                         where --

                                     SHERIFF
                         No, I think you better stay put. But 
                         that was --

                                     WAYNE
                         Yeah, all we need is an armored car 
                         guy helping us out.

               The Sheriff thwacks Wayne in the ear.

                                     WAYNE
                         Ow!

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne, what's the worst that's ever 
                         happened to you? When old Mrs. Dugan 
                         went after you with a knife? This 
                         guy just got shot at!
                              (dismisses Wayne; to 
                              Tom)
                         Smart move with the money.

               Phil comes over with the guns.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (to Phil)
                         Wayne and I'll check out the cemetery. 
                         You escort Slugger...
                              (nods at Karen)
                         ...out of town. Get her to some high 
                         ground, then come on back.

               The Sheriff jams a small pistol into his ankle holster.

                                     KAREN
                         I have to fill the pumps --

                                     SHERIFF
                              (pulling her out)
                         Not any more you don't.

               The Sheriff straightens up, grabs a rifle from Phil and pulls 
               Karen to the door. Wayne goes to Tom's cell door and pulls 
               it shut with a click.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne...

                                     WAYNE
                         He could still be lying!

               The Sheriff rolls his eyes and gestures for Wayne to come 
               along. He opens the door for Karen, Wayne and Phil to go 
               through.

                                     TOM
                         Sheriff -- they killed my partner 
                         without any warning.

                                     SHERIFF
                         And they're gonna regret that, I 
                         guarantee you. They're gonna regret 
                         coming anywhere near this town 
                         tonight. And out he goes.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Water is halfway up the four-foot high wall of sandbags around 
               the station. There are three outboard motorboats moored to 
               the sandbags.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Phil, take Karen's boat.

               The Sheriff and Wayne climb toward their boats.

                                     WAYNE
                         You can do it, Phil. The men of 
                         Huntingburg are counting on you.

                                     PHIL
                         Just bite me.

               Wayne laughs as he and the Sheriff fire up their boat engines.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom hears boat engines start up and move away. He lays back 
               down on the cot, listening to the rain.

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               Empty. Light comes out from under the door to the bathroom.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Hank is on the can reading a copy of "American Survivalist" 
               magazine. An odd reaction comes over his face. He feels 
               something weird. He looks down.

               ON THE FLOOR

               Water is seeping in under the door.

                                     HANK
                         Holy shit!

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               The bathroom door flies open and Hank waddles out, pants 
               around his feet. He shuffles fast to the control wheels and 
               starts spinning them.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               Two gates open fast, all the way, and water thunders out.

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               Hank pulls up his pants as he gets on the radio.

                                     HANK
                         Sheriff! Sheriff!

               EXT. PARK AREA

               The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring in their boats, zooming 
               through the trees, engine noise obliterating anything coming 
               in over the radio.

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

                                     HANK
                              (on the radio)
                         Sheriff, come in!

               EXT. MAIN STREET - MOVING BOAT

               Phil steers Karen's small boat down Main Street, past the 
               statue. The water is up to the rider's stirrups.

                                     KAREN
                              (pleading)
                         Did you see the stained glass windows, 
                         Phil? Did you see what a good job 
                         they did? I can't let anything happen 
                         to the church, not after all I've 
                         put into it.

                                     PHIL
                         Karen, you know I'd do anything for 
                         you, but the Sheriff told me to get 
                         you out of town. I'm sorry. It's for 
                         your own good.

               Karen stands up.

                                     PHIL
                         What're you doing?

                                     KAREN
                         If you're not going to take me back 
                         to the church, then I'll swim.

               Karen moves to get out of the boat.

                                     PHIL
                         No. Hey, hold on.

               Phil lets go of the throttle and stands, moving toward Karen.

                                     KAREN
                         What am I saying?

               Karen suddenly turns on Phil and pushes him out of the boat.

                                     KAREN
                         This is my boat. You swim.

               Karen guns the engine and shoots off down a side street. 
               Phil stands in the waist-deep water and watches her go, 
               flabbergasted.

               EXT. CHURCH

               Karen comes around a corner and drives her boat up to the 
               church. The water is swirling quietly, still a good three 
               feet below the top of the wall.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - WELCOME SIGN

               Close on the lighted "Welcome to Huntingburg" sign. There's 
               a rushing sound and a two-foot-high wall of water hits the 
               sign. The lights explode in geysers of sparks and the water 
               rushes on.

               EXT. PARK AREA

               The Sheriff and Wayne are racing through a grove of half-
               submerged trees. There's a rushing sound above the sound of 
               the engines. WHAM! and they're hit by the wall of water. 
               Wayne falls out of his boat and is lost in the swirling water.

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Jim and his men are motoring down an alleyway when...

               THE WALL OF WATER

               Rushes down the alley.

               RAY

               The water hits him hard, knocking him off the jet-ski. He's 
               swept away by the water.

               CLOSE ON A FENCE LACED WITH CONCERTINA WIRE

               The surge water shoots through it. And suddenly there's...

               RAY

               Slammed up against the fence, pinned to it, water rushing 
               over and around and by him. He yells as the wire cuts into 
               him.

               EXT. CHURCH

               Karen is pouring gasoline into the pumps.

               She hears the rushing and looks up as the surge hits. Water 
               shoots over the top.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom hears the sound and opens his eyes -- what the hell is 
               that?

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The wall of water slams in hard, cascading over the sandbag 
               wall.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               TOM SITS UP, SWINGING HIS LEGS OVER THE SIDE OF THE COT. HE 
               REACTS, LOOKS DOWN. HIS POV

               There's two feet of water in the station.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The building is like a rock in a stream, with the water 
               rushing up high against one wall, roiling and swirling around 
               the sides.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom looks over, stunned, to see... THE DOOR

               As a fine stream spits in through the keyhole.

               THE WINDOWS

               Are heaving as the water rises up against them.

               TOM

               Gets to his feet, woozy and goes to get out of the cell. He 
               remembers -- uh-oh: the cell door is locked.

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Jim pulls Ray, coughing, choking, bleeding, into the ski-
               boat.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               The water level inside is rising fast. It hits the wall 
               sockets and there's a spit of sparks, then all the desk lamps 
               go dark. Light still comes from overhead fluorescent panels. 
               Tom sees...

               TWO KEYS ON A KEY RING

               Laying on the Sheriff's wooden desk. They're four feet away -- 
               too far to reach.

               EXT. CHURCH

               Karen suddenly has a horrible thought and stops. She shakes 
               it off -- doesn't want to think about it -- and mutters to 
               herself.

                                     KAREN
                         They'll get him out.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Phil is clinging to the statue as the water surges by below 
               him.

               EXT. PARK AREA

               Wayne gets back into his boat. The Sheriff realizes something.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne... You locked him in.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom looks through the cell bars at wooden chairs bobbing in 
               the water. The Sheriff's desk lifts up, starts floating. Tom 
               gets an idea. He takes his belt off.

               EXT. NEAR SHERIFF'S STATION

               A telephone pole is half-submerged, being pulled along fast 
               by the current.

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Tom holds one end of the belt and tosses the rest of it at...

               THE DESK

               Bobbing in the rising water. He misses the keys.

               TOM AND THE DESK

               Tom tries again. The belt lands on the desk top.

               Tom very gently starts pulling. Too hard; the belt starts 
               slipping off the desk. He gets it just right and the desk 
               starts moving toward Tom. He reaches out with his hand, 
               stretching.

               HIS FINGERS

               Touch the top of the desk, start pulling it toward him, and 
               he just gets a firm grip on the desk when...

               THE TELEPHONE POLE

               Smashes into a window, bending in the bars on the window, 
               shattering the glass, letting a torrent of water into the 
               room.

               THE DESK

               Is moved by the rush of water, but not before Tom grabs...

               THE KEYS

               And grips them tight.

               TOM

               Tries the keys in the lock. They don't fit. He looks at them.

               CU KEYS

               The tag is emblazoned with the Ford logo.

                                     TOM
                         Great! I can drive out of here!

               Tom tosses the keys into the water and looks around at...

               THE WATER LEVEL

               Rising very fast. A foot in ten seconds.

               TOM

               Climbs up the cell bars, the water rising with him. He's 
               running out of room between himself and the ceiling. Three 
               feet. Two feet. He's being pushed up by the water toward...

               FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE

               On the ceiling, caged in a wire cover.

               TOM

               Is terrified, about to die. The water rises up past his face.

               TOM'S HANDS

               Pull his Maglite flashlight from his belt. He takes off the 
               lens and the battery cap, then shakes the batteries out.

               TOM

               Sticks the flashlight tube up through the wire grate over 
               the light fixture.

               He blows out the water -- like clearing a snorkel -- then 
               breathes. Reprieve for a few moments and then...

               THE WATER

               Reaches the top of the flashlight tube and starts to trickle 
               in when...

               THE FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE

               Goes dark. In the darkness, there's the sound of tubes 
               breaking and metal being wrenched.

               TOM

               Looks up, astonished, to see...

               THE FLUORESCENT FIXTURE

               Being lifted up and away from above. Streetlight comes in, 
               silhouetting...

               A FIGURE

               Standing on the roof. The figure leans down and starts tugging 
               at the wire cage over the inside of the fixture. In the light, 
               Tom sees that it's...

               KAREN

               And she's pulling as hard as she can, but the wire cage isn't 
               budging. She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, unfolds a small 
               knife and starts taking out the screws holding the cage in 
               place. She gets two screws out.

               TOM

               Pulls on the cage and it swings down. He climbs up it.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION ROOF

               Tom surfaces in a hole in the roof. There's a vent duct laying 
               on the roof -- Karen must've kicked that over to get to the 
               light fixture. Karen helps Tom up. She sits and he lays down 
               on the roof, catching his breath.

                                     TOM
                         Thank you.

                                     KAREN
                         I owed you -- for hitting you and 
                         all. But we're even now, okay?

                                     TOM
                         Even.
                              (beat, looks around)
                         What happened?

                                     KAREN
                         I don't know.

               They get up.

                                     KAREN
                         Maybe another levee broke upriver. 
                         They've been --

               Just then...

               A PROPANE TANK

               Explodes. The fireball rips across the dark sky, illuminating 
               everything, showing...

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Fifty feet away -- Jim, Mr. Mehlor and Ray in the ski-boat 
               and Kenny on the jet-ski -- guns aimed at Tom and Karen.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, God.

               DARKNESS

               As the lightning passes, and in the darkness, the thunder 
               rolls.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Switch on their lights and move forward. They pass...

               CARS

               Floating down the street with other debris. The cars have 
               been damaged by the flood -- one is missing a door.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               When they get closer to the Sheriff's station, what they see -- 
               or don't see -- makes them stop.

               THEIR POV

               Tom and Karen have disappeared. Karen's boat is still moored 
               to the Sheriff's station roof, empty.

                                     JIM
                         They're in the water! Kenny, cut 
                         your engine!

               Kenny shuts off the engine of the one remaining jet-ski. Jim 
               shuts down the boat engine. They float in silence, scanning 
               the water with their flashlights. There's no sign of Tom and 
               Karen.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom motions Karen to follow him. She's freaked and hesitates. 
               Tom grabs her hand and pulls her.

               THEIR POV

               The ski-boat and jet-ski are right above them, flashlights 
               playing over the water.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Reach the roof of the Sheriff's station. Jim looks around.

                                     JIM
                         Kenny, go that way. We'll go down 
                         here.

               LONG SHOT POV THROUGH CAR WINDSHIELD

               Of Kenny and Jim heading off in different directions.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Rise into view in a car. They gasp for air and keep low.

                                     KAREN
                         Tell them where the money is.

                                     TOM
                         I can't.

                                     KAREN
                         Well, I can.

               She's about to call out. Tom grabs her hard.

                                     TOM
                         If they know where the money is, 
                         they will kill us.

               Before Karen can say anything, a flashlight beam comes 
               swinging toward them and they have to duck underwater.

               JIM

               Watches as his flashlight beam washes over the car. Nothing 
               there. He guns his engine and heads off down the street.

               THE CAR

               Floats off around a corner.

               IN THE CAR

               Tom and Karen surface, catch their breath. Quiet for a few 
               moments as they both look around to see that Jim and his men 
               are gone.

                                     KAREN
                         So what do we do?

                                     TOM
                         I guess just drive around until we 
                         run out of gas.

                                     KAREN
                              (pissed)
                         Look, I've spent the last eight months 
                         of my life restoring that church, 
                         and I just left it to come save your 
                         ass, so spare me, okay?

                                     TOM
                              (beat)
                         When we get down here a little further 
                         we'll find a place for you to hide.
                              (off her look)
                         I'm gonna get back to the truck and 
                         wait for the National Guard.
                              (checks watch)
                         They should be there pretty soon.

               Karen nods. Tom looks at her. She's shivering.

                                     TOM
                         Cold?

                                     KAREN
                         No, I'm fine. The heater just kicked 
                         in.

               Tom looks at her, gives a little grin. Their eyes meet for a 
               second, then they look away.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Phil climbs up onto the roof, exhausted. He sees the hole in 
               the roof and goes to look at it. As he's looking down...

                                     SHERIFF (O.S.)
                         Is he dead?

               Phil turns to see...

               THE SHERIFF AND WAYNE

               Coasting up in their boats.

                                     PHIL
                         No. Someone got him out.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Who?

                                     PHIL
                              (hesitates)
                         Maybe Karen.

                                     WAYNE
                         Karen? How could she get him out? 
                         You took her out of town.

                                     PHIL
                         I -- It --

                                     SHERIFF
                         Let's hear it, Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         It happened real fast, okay?

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Tom and Karen float down the alley in the car.

                                     KAREN
                         You ever been robbed before?

                                     TOM
                         No. The scariest thing that ever 
                         happened before was Charlie running 
                         out of donuts.
                              (off her look)
                         I've only been doing this for a couple 
                         months.

                                     KAREN
                              (not what she wanted 
                              to hear)
                         Oh.

               Silence for a few moments.

                                     KAREN
                         What'd you do before this?

                                     TOM
                         I, uh... I sold construction 
                         machinery.
                              (off her look)
                         I was making good money, it just... 
                         I don't know. It just didn't seem 
                         right for me anymore.

                                     KAREN
                         How'd you end up in this?

                                     TOM
                         My uncle did me a favor; got me in.

                                     KAREN
                         Nice favor. How's he gonna feel after 
                         tonight?

                                     TOM
                         My uncle was Charlie -- my partner 
                         in the truck.

                                     KAREN
                         Oh, God. I'm sorry.

               Tom nods -- so is he.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

               Phil climbs into the Sheriff's boat.

                                     WAYNE
                         She know karate or something, Phil? 
                         Maybe kung fu? I mean, I can't see 
                         how else she could overpower the 
                         likes of you.

                                     PHIL
                         Shut up, Wayne.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Shut up, both of you. Let's go find 
                         Karen; see if she's got him.

               The Sheriff fires up his engine and heads off, Wayne 
               following.

               EXT. ALLEYWAY

               Karen and Tom are still in the car. They freeze at the sound 
               of engines in the distance. The sounds fade. Tom looks around.

                                     TOM
                         God, I wonder whose car this is.

               Karen plucks some cassette tapes out of the water.

                                     KAREN
                         Well, whoever it is, he listens to 
                         Pat Benatar, Eddie Money and the 
                         soundtrack to "Footloose."

                                     TOM
                         Really?
                              (looks at tapes)
                         Hold on...
                              (looks around car)
                         ...I think this is my car from high 
                         school.

               Karen laughs. Just then...

               THE CAR

               Gets caught on something and stops.

                                     TOM
                         Looks like we get out here.
                              (Karen hesitates)
                         Come on -- I told your father I'd 
                         have you home by ten.

               Karen grins. Just then...

               A TRANSFORMER

               down the street explodes.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Hear a sparking sound and look over to see...

               A TRANSFORMER

               On a telephone/power pole close to them. Rain hits it, causing 
               the sparking sound. The floodwater is inching up the pole 
               toward it.

               The water will reach the transformer in a matter of seconds. 
               And while they're staring at that...

               ANOTHER TRANSFORMER

               At the end of the street explodes as water hits it.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Look around -- what to do? Tom points.

                                     TOM
                         There!

               They climb out of the car and start swimming toward a house.

               THE TRANSFORMER

               Water is three inches from the transformer; two inches...

               TOM AND KAREN

               Swimming as hard as they can.

               THE TRANSFORMER

               One inch from the water...

               TOM AND KAREN

               Reach the house. They pull themselves up onto a television 
               antenna/ladder running up the side of the house. Karen's 
               feet are still in the water.

                                     TOM
                         Get your feet up!

               THE TRANSFORMER

               The water is about to touch. There's a sizzling sound.

               TOM AND KAREN

               They heave a huge sigh of relief -- but then Tom realizes...

                                     TOM
                         Oh, shit!

                                     KAREN
                         What?

                                     TOM
                              (re: antenna/ladder)
                         It's metal!

               Tom pushes Karen over onto a window ledge. Then, just as 
               Tom's about to step over...

               KENNY

               Comes screaming in on the jet-ski. He dives off the jetski, 
               gets a hold of Tom and pulls him under.

               KENNY AND TOM

               Surface. Kenny is stronger and he has Tom in a tight grip. 
               One problem -- Kenny doesn't know the danger they're in.

                                     TOM
                         We've gotta --!

               Kenny shoves Tom underwater.

                                     KENNY
                         HEY! I GOT HIM!

               Tom comes up, looks over at...

               THE TRANSFORMER

               The sizzling is getting louder.

                                     TOM
                         We have to --!

               Kenny dunks Tom again.

                                     KENNY
                         I GOT HIM!

               UNDERWATER

               Tom grabs Kenny's arms and pulls himself up fast.

               KENNY AND TOM

               Tom's head comes out of the water and slams into Kenny's 
               chin. Kenny is stunned. Tom gets free of his grasp.

                                     KAREN
                         Hurry!

               Tom does the backstroke, pulling hard toward Karen.

               KENNY

               Still stunned, finally hears the sizzling and looks over 
               at...

               THE TRANSFORMER

               The water touches the outer casing of the transformer.

               KENNY

               Starts swimming fast toward...

               TOM AND KAREN

               Karen grabs Tom's arm and Tom gets a hold of the windowsill 
               and pulls himself up.

               KENNY

               Grabs onto...

               THE TV ANTENNA

               And starts pulling himself out of the water.

               THE TRANSFORMER

               Explodes.

               KENNY

               Feels pretty pleased with himself until...

               THE TV ANTENNA

               Starts dancing with electricity and...

               KENNY

               Is hit by the voltage and his teeth clamp shut and his body 
               goes rigid and his clothes explode in flames.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Look away.

               THE WATER

               Dead fish start floating to the surface.

               KENNY

               Is fried, smoking. He falls off the TV antenna and hits the 
               water with a loud and ugly hiss. He floats away, his body 
               shaking spasmodically.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Tom hears an engine approaching. He looks around, then smashes 
               the window with his elbow.

               INT. HOUSE

               The window glass tumbles in. Tom reaches in, undoes the latch 
               and slides up the window. He climbs in, straddling the window 
               sill. The camera moves down Tom's leg to show...

               A WOLF TRAP

               Laying on the floor, just below the window.

               TOM

               Is oblivious. He starts to put his foot down into the trap. 
               Just then he knocks...

               A POTTED CACTUS

               Off the windowsill. It falls straight down into...

               THE WOLF TRAP

               Hitting the trigger. The jaws snap, obliterating the cactus.

                                     TOM
                         Jesus Christ!

               A SHOTGUN BARREL

               Snaps into view, pointing right at Tom's head.

                                     WOMAN (O.S.)
                         You so much as breathe funny and 
                         your head is going back out that 
                         window without you.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

               Jim drives the boat down the street. Mr. Mehlor is scanning 
               the water with a flashlight.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         Jim! Over there!

               Jim looks over to see...

               THE JET-SKI

               Floating in the water. And not far from it is...

               KENNY

               Still twitching.

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM

               Doreen holds the shotgun on Tom and Karen as they move away 
               from the window, hands raised.

                                     DOREEN
                         Real slow now. Like you were in a 
                         big jar of molasses. That's it.

               They hear footsteps coming down old wood stairs.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         Doreen? You haven't killed anybody, 
                         have you?

                                     DOREEN
                         I've got everything under control, 
                         Henry. You go back up.

               Henry enters.

                                     HENRY
                         Jesus, Doreen, you caught a whole 
                         gang.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

               Jim and Mr. Mehlor pull Kenny into the ski-boat. Kenny is 
               shivering. Part of his hair has been burned away.

                                     KENNY
                         Jesus, God, it hurts!

                                     JIM
                         You're gonna be okay, Ken. Mr. Mehlor 
                         knows these things and he thinks 
                         you're gonna be okay.

               Mr. Mehlor looks at Jim. Mr. Mehlor knows these things and 
               he thinks Kenny is going to die.

                                     KENNY
                         It hurts!

                                     JIM
                         Don't you, Mr. Mehlor? Don't you 
                         think Kenny's gonna be okay?

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         Yeah, Kenny. You're gonna be fine.

                                     KENNY
                         Jesus, I can't stop shivering.

               Mr. Mehlor moves aside. Jim puts his arms around Kenny.

                                     KENNY
                         I know you didn't want me to come.

                                     JIM
                         You kidding? We couldn't've done 
                         anything without you.

                                     KENNY
                         My dad'd sure be pissed off, huh?

                                     JIM
                         Your dad'd just want you to lay still 
                         while we got you some help.

                                     KENNY
                         Hey -- hey the pain's goin'.
                              (relief)
                         Oh, man.

               He looks up at Jim and grins.

                                     KENNY
                         When you said I was gonna be okay, I 
                         thought you were just shittin' me.

                                     JIM
                         See? You gotta trust me.

               Kenny's shivering stops. It stops because he's dead. Jim 
               slowly lets go.

               INT. HENRY AND DOREEN'S ATTIC

               Henry and Doreen have brought everything into their attic -- 
               a TV, some silver and china, bowling trophies. A Coleman 
               lantern lights the room.

                                     DOREEN
                              (sarcastic)
                         Well, isn't that just wonderful! Now 
                         these bastards are gonna want to 
                         kill us, too! Why the hell did you 
                         have to come to this house?

                                     KAREN
                         We thought it was empty.

                                     DOREEN
                         You know what? The house next door 
                         is empty. So whaddya say we go back 
                         downstairs and you two keep moving?

                                     HENRY
                         We are not going to send these people 
                         out to the wolves.

                                     DOREEN
                         Oh, we're not, are we? Then what's 
                         your plan, General Schwartzkopf?

                                     HENRY
                         I -- I just don't think --

                                     TOM
                         It's okay. I have to go anyway.

               They look at him, surprised.

                                     TOM
                         The National Guard'll be at the truck 
                         in about fifteen minutes. I'm gonna 
                         go wait for them.

                                     DOREEN
                         You can't swim that far in fifteen 
                         minutes.

                                     HENRY
                         He could take our boat.

                                     DOREEN
                         Henry!

                                     HENRY
                              (to Tom)
                         I'll go get it ready for you.

                                     DOREEN
                         Henry, he is not taking our boat.

               Henry ignores Doreen. He pushes the attic stairs down, heads 
               down them.

                                     DOREEN
                              (grabs TV; to Tom)
                         Here. You want a TV too? How about 
                         some china? Maybe our silver?
                              (sets TV down)
                         Henry! Henry, you leave the boat 
                         where it is!

               Doreen heads off down the stairs. Tom starts down the stairs, 
               stops.

                                     TOM
                         Karen?
                              (she looks at him)
                         I'm Tom.

               They shake hands.

                                     KAREN
                         Watch yourself, Tom. I really don't 
                         wanna have to save your life again.

               Tom nods and goes down the stairs.

               EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE

               Henry stands on the roof of the back porch, steadying a small 
               rowboat as Tom gets in. Doreen nags from the window.

                                     DOREEN
                         You give away our only boat in the 
                         middle of a flood. You are a genius, 
                         Henry. A goddamn genius.

                                     TOM
                              (whispers to Henry, 
                              re: Doreen)
                         You wanna come with me?

               Henry looks at Tom, entertaining the notion...

                                     DOREEN
                         Jesus, Henry, what are you waiting 
                         for -- a kiss goodbye? Get back in 
                         here.

               Henry sighs and lets go of the boat. Tom rows off.

               LONG SHOT OF TOM

               We see him in silhouette, crossing the gap between two houses.

               JIM AND HIS MEN

               Are watching, from the shadows on the dark side of the street.

                                     RAY
                         Why don't we just get him?

                                     JIM
                         If our resourceful young friend hears 
                         us coming, he'll electrocute us or 
                         sink us or one of you'll shoot him. 
                         Besides...
                              (glances at watch)
                         ...I know where he's going. What I'd 
                         like to know is where he came from.

               EXT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff sits in his boat, moored to the wall of sandbags 
               around the church. Wayne's boat is tied up next to it. The 
               floodwater is trickling over the top of the wall. The gas-
               powered pumps inside the wall are keeping the waters at bay.

               WAYNE AND PHIL

               Come out of the front doors of the church.

                                     WAYNE
                         They're not here.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - WELCOME SIGN

               Tom rows up to the truck and "Welcome" sign. His flashlight 
               shows just the top of the truck and sign. Tom looks at his 
               watch, ties the rowboat to the sign, jumps into the water.

               A few moments pass, then Tom surfaces, holding a shotgun. 
               Then he senses something behind him and turns to see...

               A COW

               Floating in the water, tongue out, eyes glassy.

               TOM

               Kicks away, horrified. And then he hears an engine. He looks.

               TOM'S POV

               Jim's ski-boat is coming over the water. The engine cuts out 
               and the ski-boat drifts, a hundred feet from Tom.

                                     JIM
                              (yelling)
                         Son, before you go underwater and do 
                         something tricky, there's something 
                         I'd like you to see!

               A flashlight comes on, the beam swivels, illuminating...

               HENRY AND DOREEN

               Standing in the ski-boat, blinking in the light.

               TOM

               Slumps.

                                     JIM
                         Now, I know it's your job to protect 
                         that money, and maybe you'd even be 
                         foolish enough to give your life for 
                         it. The question is, are you willing 
                         to give their lives for it?

               Jim puts a pistol to Doreen's head.

                                     JIM
                         Drop the gun and get into the boat.

               TOM

               Thinks for a second, then throws the shotgun away and pulls 
               himself into the rowboat.

                                     JIM
                         Excellent choice.

               TOM, JIM, HENRY AND DOREEN

               As Tom and Jim call to each other across the water, Doreen 
               goes at Henry.

                                     TOM
                         I'll take you to the money, but you 
                         gotta let them go.

                                     DOREEN
                         I hope you're proud of yourself, 
                         Henry Sears.

                                     HENRY
                         Shh.

                                     JIM
                         I think it'd be best if --

                                     DOREEN
                         I told you not to give him the goddamn 
                         boat.

                                     HENRY
                         Doreen, please.

                                     JIM
                         I think it'd be best if we all stayed 
                         together.

                                     TOM
                         You say all you want is the money? 
                         Prove it. Let them go.

                                     JIM
                         I don't know if that's --

                                     DOREEN
                         We could be safe in our home instead 
                         of out here in a boat with these low-
                         life scumbags!

                                     JIM
                              (after a look at 
                              Doreen, nods to Mr. 
                              Mehlor)
                         Let 'em go.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil motor past the statue. Wayne is 
               driving his boat; Phil is with the Sheriff. The water is up 
               to the General's neck.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN

               Tom helps Henry and Doreen over into the rowboat. As he does, 
               his face comes close to Henry's for a second.

                                     TOM
                              (whisper)
                         Karen?

                                     HENRY
                              (shakes head, whispers)
                         In the attic. They never saw her.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

               Karen swims down the center of the street.

               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN

               Tom is in the ski-boat with Jim. He looks out at...

               HENRY AND DOREEN

               As Henry rows them off into the darkness.

                                     DOREEN
                              (disappearing in dark)
                         Faster, Henry! The bastards might 
                         change their minds! Stop lily- dipping 
                         and move it!

               Henry starts to turn the boat around.

                                     DOREEN
                         What're you doing?

                                     HENRY
                         I'm gonna row back there and see if 
                         he'll shoot you. Or me. Fine either 
                         way.

                                     DOREEN
                         Henry...?

                                     HENRY
                         Do you want me to get us out of here?

                                     DOREEN
                         Yes, of course, I --

                                     HENRY
                         Then shut the fuck up.

               Henry turns the boat around and rows off. Doreen is silent.

               JIM'S SKI-BOAT

               Jim shakes his head. Tom looks at Ray, coughing and at Kenny, 
               dead. Tom doesn't know what to say.

                                     TOM
                         I...

                                     JIM
                         The only thing I want to hear from 
                         you is where the money is.

               EXT. STREET

               The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring fast down a street, the 
               Sheriff leading. The Sheriff sees something in the water in 
               front of him. He curses and throttles down fast.

               KAREN

               Is in the water, exhausted and cold.

               EXT. CEMETERY

               Jim pilots the ski-boat into the cemetery. All are aghast.

               A DOZEN CASKETS

               Are floating in the water. Half of them have drifted up 
               against the fence; the others are headed that way.

                                     JIM
                         I wonder where they think they're 
                         going.

                                     RAY
                         What the hell's going on?

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         This happened in a flood in Georgia. 
                         The ground gets soggy, and the caskets 
                         are air-tight -- anyone who hasn't 
                         been planted too long just pops up.

                                     RAY
                         You teach your students stuff like 
                         that? No wonder they kicked you out.

                                     MR. MEHLOR
                         I didn't teach my students anything 
                         at all.

                                     JIM
                              (to Tom)
                         Where is it?

                                     TOM
                         It's hard to tell now with the water 
                         so deep.

               Jim cocks the hammer on his pistol. Tom gets the hint.

                                     TOM
                         It's down there a little further.

               Jim nods, gives the engine some juice and they move on.

               TOM

               Takes a quick look at his watch.

               JIM

               Sees Tom looking at his watch.

               EXT. STREET

               Karen is in the Sheriff's boat, wearing Phil's jacket, trying 
               to warm up.

                                     KAREN
                         Tom went off in their rowboat.

                                     WAYNE
                              (to Phil)
                         It's Tom now. Looks like you lost 
                         out, pal.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Where was he going?

                                     KAREN
                         Back to the armored truck.

               EXT. CEMETERY

               Jim throttles down the ski-boat engine.

                                     JIM
                         Here?

                                     TOM
                         Uh... no. A little farther --

                                     JIM
                         They're not coming, son.

               Tom looks over at Jim, pretending to be confused.

                                     TOM
                         What?

                                     JIM
                         The National Guard. They're not 
                         coming.

                                     TOM
                         I don't --

                                     JIM
                         I know you've been trying to stall 
                         until they show up, but they're not 
                         coming.

                                     TOM
                              (pause as he realizes)
                         Oh, God. You intercepted Charlie's 
                         call, then you called them off.

                                     JIM
                         No, son, I didn't call them off. 
                         They never were coming. We didn't 
                         "intercept" Charlie's call. He called 
                         us direct.

               And on Tom's look of disbelief...

               INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

               Hank is on the radio.

                                     HANK
                         I'd love to help you, Sheriff, but I 
                         can't leave! If the water goes over 
                         the top again it's bye-bye, dam! Bye-
                         bye, town! In fact, I could use a 
                         little help up here myself.

               EXT. PARK AREA

               The Sheriff is in his boat; Wayne is back in his own. The 
               Sheriff is on the radio.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank, remember when Mike Crane holed 
                         up in Jack Finch's barn and said he 
                         was gonna burn it down?

               CROSSCUT WITH HANK

                                     HANK
                         Hey, I was the one who got the dumb 
                         son-of-a-bitch to come out.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Right. And before you went in, I 
                         deputized you, you dumb son-of-a-
                         bitch! So when I say get down here, 
                         it's not a request, it's an order. 
                         So get down here! Now! I won't need 
                         you for long. And bring your gun.

               EXT. CEMETERY

                                     JIM
                         We were gonna hit you just before 
                         you got on the Interstate, but then 
                         you got stuck so we had to change 
                         our plans and take you --

                                     TOM
                         Bullshit. This is all bullshit.

                                     JIM
                         I knew Charlie when we were both 
                         working construction for the Johnstown 
                         company. His middle name was McCarthy 
                         because his parents loved Charlie 
                         McCarthy on the radio. His wife's 
                         name was Mary. She died of a heart-
                         attack last year. He has a daughter 
                         and a son, both grown with children 
                         of their own. I'm afraid I don't 
                         know the names of the grandchildren.

               Tom looks down, not wanting to believe.

                                     JIM
                         What else do I know...? Oh, yes. I 
                         know Uncle Charlie was trying to 
                         steer his favorite nephew away from 
                         a life of crime.

               Tom suddenly lunges for Jim. Ray yanks Tom back.

                                     TOM
                         Why'd you shoot him? Kill Charlie 
                         and you get to keep another share?

                                     JIM
                         No, That was an accident. Ken shot 
                         him.
                              (eyes Kenny sadly)
                         I never told him Charlie was on my 
                         side. Ken liked to talk.
                              (shakes head)
                         He shouldn't've been here. But his 
                         dad asked me to watch over him. I 
                         guess I didn't do the best job.

                                     RAY
                         Excuse me, Jim. I hate to interrupt 
                         and all, but could we just get the 
                         money and get the hell out of here?

                                     JIM
                              (nods; to Tom)
                         I'm gonna ask you one more time. And 
                         before you think of bullshitting me 
                         again, keep in mind I have had a 
                         very frustrating night. And while I 
                         know I'll never get the money if I 
                         kill you, it's getting to the point 
                         where I just don't care.

               Jim casually aims his gun at Tom.

                                     TOM
                         I'll tell you where it is. But it's 
                         not going to do you any good.

               Jim arches an eyebrow.

                                     TOM
                         The Guard may not be coming, but 
                         someone else sure as hell is.

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN THE SHERIFF

               At the controls of his boat, moving fast, sprayed by rain. 
               Karen and Phil are in the back of the boat. Wayne is close 
               behind in his boat.

               EXT. CEMETERY

                                     JIM
                         I'll take my chances.

               Tom pauses, looks over to...

               THE CRYPT

               Just the top of it is visible. Two more COFFINS float nearby.

                                     TOM
                         There.

               Jim steers the ski-boat over, hands Tom a flashlight.

                                     JIM
                         Well, go get it.

               Tom climbs over the edge of the ski-boat and into the water. 
               He turns on the flashlight and drops below the surface.

                                     RAY
                              (eyeing Tom in water)
                         "At night we'd go down to the river 
                         and into the river we'd dive."
                              (off Jim and Mehlor's 
                              looks)
                         Springsteen, "The River." I'm all 
                         out of bible quotes.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom shines his light on...

               THE CRYPT

               One end of a rope is tied to the crypt. The other end, cut 
               and frayed, is suspended in the water, waving in the current.

               ON THE WATER

               Jim watches Tom's light rise. Tom comes up fast, takes a 
               breath.

                                     TOM
                         It's gone.

                                     JIM
                         What?

                                     TOM
                              (smug)
                         Looks like somebody beat you to it.

                                     RAY
                         Oh for Christs -- I'm gonna shoot 
                         him, Jim.

               Ray grabs pistol in his belt. Before he can pull it out, 
               holes puff out of his chest, followed by blood and then the 
               sound of the rifle-shots. Ray tumbles into the water. A half-
               second later there's...

               HAIL OF BULLETS

               Ripping into the ski-boat, water, trees, crypt.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT, WAYNE'S BOAT

               Are outside the fence, a hundred feet from the crypt. PUSH 
               IN FAST on...

               THE SHERIFF

               To the rescue. He and Wayne and Phil fire their guns.

               TOM

               Ducks underwater.

               JIM

               Pulls his pistol, returns fire.

               MR. MEHLOR

               Opens fire with a shotgun, shooting wild, yelling. Then he's 
               hit and knocked out of the boat, dead.

               IN THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     KAREN
                         Stop! You'll hit Tom!

               The Sheriff stops shooting, yells at the others.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hold your fire!

               Wayne and Phil stop shooting.

               BY THE CRYPT

               Tom is holding onto a coffin, out of view of the Sheriff. He 
               hears a rush of bubbles and turns as...

               JIM

               Comes to the surface, breathing deep.

               JIM'S GUN

               Comes out of the water fast and the barrel goes to Tom's 
               forehead.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

               There's an adrenal fire in the Sheriff's eyes. He starts his 
               boat forward, Wayne following. Their lights find...

               JIM'S BOAT

               No sign of life. Then there's a sound and the lights sweep 
               over to find...

               JIM AND TOM

               Climbing up on top of the mostly-submerged crypt. Jim is 
               behind Tom with his gun to Tom's head.

               THE SHERIFF

               Stops his boat. Wayne stops, too. They are thirty yards from 
               Jim and Tom.

               KAREN AND TOM

               A look passes between them.

                                     JIM
                              (to Sheriff)
                         Now, sir, I can imagine you'd love 
                         nothing more than to shoot me, but I 
                         caution you -- in order to do that, 
                         you're gonna have to shoot through 
                         young Tom here.

               THE SHERIFF

               Thinks for a second, then shrugs.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Okay.

               He raises his rifle.

               KAREN

               Realizes what is about to happen.

               TOM AND JIM

               Also clue in, but before they can move...

               THE SHERIFF

               Squeezes the trigger as...

               KAREN

               Hits the gun with her arm.

               THE RIFLE

               Fires.

               TOM

               is grazed in the arm by the bullet.

               THE SHERIFF

               Smacks Karen hard with his rifle and she tumbles out of the 
               boat, unconscious.

               TOM AND JIM

               Throw themselves back off the crypt as...

               THE SHERIFF AND WAYNE

               Empty their guns in their direction.

               JIM

               Returns fire, shooting blindly over the top of the crypt.

               PHIL

               Reaches for Karen, floating limp in the water, but...

               WAYNE

               Is closer. He grabs Karen and pulls her into his boat, then 
               grins at Phil.

               TOM AND JIM

               Are behind the crypt. Tom holds his bleeding arm. Jim reloads.

                                     TOM
                         Well, that was unexpected.

                                     JIM
                         Is he the one you thought was coming 
                         to your rescue?

               No answer from Tom, but the answer is clear.

               WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               The Sheriff and Wayne reload.

                                     HANK (O.S.)
                         Anyone mind telling me what the hell 
                         is going on?

               The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil turn to see...

               HANK

               In his boat, right behind them, all dressed up in hunting 
               gear, rifle at the ready.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hey, Hank. That money I told you 
                         about? From the armored car? We're 
                         gonna keep it. Three million dollars. 
                         Four ways.
                              (shoots at crypt)
                         Seven fifty apiece. You okay with 
                         that?

               Hank is stunned. He doesn't answer.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank? You okay with that?

                                     HANK
                         Seven hundred and fifty thousand 
                         dollars?
                              (beat, grins)
                         Damn straight I'm okay with that.

                                     WAYNE
                              (grumbling, re: Hank)
                         Don't see what we needed him for.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Then I guess you've never been hunting 
                         with Hank.
                              (to Hank)
                         We got two behind that crypt. Get 
                         'em.

               Hank nods. He motions for Wayne to go one way; he'll go the 
               other. They start off. A blind shot comes from Jim behind 
               the crypt. The Sheriff shoots back. Phil finally musters up 
               the courage to say something.

                                     PHIL
                         Maybe I'm not okay with it.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Come on now, Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         You're gonna kill people?

                                     SHERIFF
                         They're looters, Phil! They come and 
                         steal from an armored truck in our 
                         town -- they're looters.
                              (fires two shots)

                                     PHIL
                         What about Tom? What about Karen? 
                         They're not looters.

                                     SHERIFF
                         No, they're witnesses.

               The Sheriff fires off a flurry of bullets.

               TOM AND JIM

               Behind the crypt, bullets winging by. Jim looks over, sees...

               HANK

               Motor into view.

               JIM

               Opens fire.

               HANK

               Shoots back.

               TOM

               Flattens against the crypt, then turns to see...

               WAYNE

               Coming into view on the other side.

               TOM

               Looks at Jim, sees he's occupied in the fight with Hank. 
               Then he sees...

               RAY

               Floating in the water, dead, pistol still jammed in his pants.

               TOM

               Thinks, decides, and reaches out for Ray.

               CLOSE ON JIM

               Shooting at Hank. He hears gunfire from Wayne and is about 
               to swivel to shoot in that direction when he hears a gun 
               firing from right next to him. He turns to see...

               TOM

               Shooting back at Wayne with Ray's gun.

               WAYNE

               Pulls back out of the line of fire.

               HANK

               Curses and pulls back, too.

               TOM AND JIM

               Exchange a look.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     PHIL
                         How can you do this?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Jeez, Phil, I always thought Wayne 
                         was the stupid one. Read my lips.
                              (slowly)
                         Three million dollars. Look at it!

               The Sheriff reaches down into a forward storage area of the 
               boat and pulls back a tarp revealing the bags of money.

                                     SHERIFF
                         A couple of those bags are gonna be 
                         yours, Phil.

                                     PHIL
                         But -- but -- you're the Sheriff!

               The Sheriff rips his badge off and throws it away.

                                     SHERIFF
                         I'm the what?

               TOM AND JIM

               Jim looks at Tom, then hands Tom his pistol. Tom doesn't 
               know what Jim's doing. Jim slips beneath the water.

               HANK

               Whistles and gets Wayne's attention. He motions Wayne to try 
               it again.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     PHIL
                         For twenty years you've been --

                                     SHERIFF
                         For twenty years I've been eating 
                         shit, breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
                         Well, tonight I'm changing the menu! 
                         From now on everything I eat is gonna 
                         be shit-free!

               BEHIND THE CRYPT

               Tom is looking for Jim, to see what he's doing. And then...

               WAYNE AND HANK

               Come around on both sides.

               TOM

               Starts shooting at them with the two pistols.

               WAYNE AND HANK

               Pull back. As they go...

               TOM

               Sees...

               KAREN'S ARM

               Draped over the side of Wayne's boat.

               TOM

               Takes another shot at Hank but stops firing at Wayne.

               CLOSE ON JIM'S SKI-BOAT

               Jim's hand appears over the gunwale. He reaches in and 
               grabs...

               MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

               And pulls it out of the boat.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

                                     SHERIFF
                         Can I make it any clearer, Phil? Do 
                         you want me to draw pictures?

               Phil pulls out his revolver and points it at the Sheriff.

                                     PHIL
                         I can't let you do it.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Oh for --
                              (beat)
                         Okay, Phil. But here's how it's gonna 
                         go. I'm gonna hear one of two things 
                         out of you. Either I'm gonna hear 
                         you say you're in with us, or...
                              (moves close to Phil's 
                              gun)
                         ...I'm gonna hear a bullet come out 
                         of that gun and go into me.

               Phil is incredulous. The Sheriff weighs his hands like scales.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (one hand)
                         Seven hundred and fifty thousand 
                         dollars or...
                              (other hand)
                         ...you kill me. Your choice.

               The Sheriff weighs the hands a couple more times. Phil slumps, 
               lowers the gun.

                                     SHERIFF
                         There we go.

               SOMETHING

               Flies through the air; lands in the water by the Sheriff. 
               It's...

               MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

               And it starts sinking in the water.

               BEHIND THE CRYPT

               Tom sees...

               JIM

               Haul himself into the ski-boat.

                                     WAYNE (O.S.)
                         In the boat!

               THE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK

               Start shooting at Jim in the ski-boat.

               JIM

               Sticks the shotgun over the gunwale and returns fire.

               TOM

               Starts swimming for the boat.

               THE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK

               See Tom and start shooting at both he and Jim when...

               MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

               Explodes and...

               THE WATER

               Erupts in a huge geyser.

               THE SHERIFF, WAYNE, PHIL AND HANK

               Are knocked off their feet. The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are 
               thrown into the water. Their boats are rocked up and back 
               and swamped with falling water.

               JIM

               Fires up his engine.

               TOM

               Is almost to the boat.

               WAYNE

               Gets to his knees in his boat and starts shooting.

               TOM

               Gets to Jim's boat and grabs onto it.

               JIM

               Cranks the throttle, and, dragging Tom, tears off under the 
               hail of Wayne's bullets.

               TOM'S POV

               As Jim races through the tombstones, barely missing 
               halfsubmerged stone crosses and crypt roofs.

               TOM

               Rams into one cross.

               HIS HANDS

               Start to slip from the boat.

               JIM

               Grabs Tom's hand and holds on as they shoot off across the 
               water.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               Get back in the boats.

               EXT. ON THE WATER - MOVING

               Jim hauls Tom into the boat. Tom lays on the bottom, catching 
               his breath. Blood is dripping down from his arm.

                                     TOM
                              (beat, looks up at 
                              Jim)
                         You really want that money?

               Jim gives Tom a look -- of course he wants that money.

                                     TOM
                         'Cause the only way you're ever gonna 
                         see it is if you help me get Karen.

               Before Jim can answer, gunshots ring out behind them. They 
               look back to see...

               THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               Coming after them in the three boats, shooting, closing.

                                     TOM
                         We're too slow.

                                     JIM
                              (thinks, then:)
                         Here.

               Jim moves away from the wheel, giving it to Tom. Tom gets up 
               and takes over. Jim bends and picks up...

               KENNY

               Lifeless and limp.

               JIM

               Looks at Kenny for a moment, then pushes his body overboard.

               WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               Flying over the water.

               THEIR POV

               They see a body tumble out of the ski-boat.

               WITH JIM AND TOM

               Jim looks back, following Kenny with his eyes.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Jim and Tom make the turn onto Main Street. They look back 
               as...

               THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

               Come around the corner, two hundred yards back.

                                     TOM
                         They're not going to catch us now.

               LOW ANGLE

               Of the ski-boat, racing toward camera. As it gets closer, 
               the camera BOOMS DOWN underwater to reveal...

               THE STATUE

               The sword tip just below the surface. THE SKI-BOAT

               There's a jarring metal on metal clank as the sword tip slams 
               into the propeller.

               JIM AND TOM

               Are thrown forward.

               JIM

               Slams head-first into the dash.

               UNDERWATER

               The propeller has stopped.

               TOM

               Looks back to see that...

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Has almost been ripped from its moorings.

                                     TOM
                         Okay, so maybe they are gonna catch 
                         us now.

               No answer from Jim. Tom looks down.

               JIM

               Is laying on the deck, unconscious. Just then... BAM! BAM! 
               BAM!

               HANK

               Has his rifle resting on his boat's windshield and is firing 
               off a clip on automatic as he, Wayne and the Sheriff close 
               in.

               TOM

               Ducks down and tries to start the engine. No go. Again. It 
               catches on the third try. Tom guns it and the boat tears 
               off.

               THE OUTBOARD ENGINE

               Is wobbling, vibrating.

               HANK

               Keeps up his stream of gunfire.

               TOM

               Stays down, driving blind, as the bullets fly in, blowing 
               holes in the windshield. He looks at Jim, at the engine and 
               curses. He steers the boat toward...

               THE CHURCH

               All lit-up, brilliant white in the darkness, a quarter-mile 
               away.

               EXT. THE CHURCH

               The water is now over the sandbag wall. The first several 
               feet of the church are flooded.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Comes up fast. Tom grounds it on top of the sandbag wall. 
               Tom hesitates for a half second before grabbing Jim and 
               pushing him out of the boat and into the water.

               JIM

               Hits the cold water and comes to, sputtering.

               TOM

               Grabs guns and ammo and jumps out of the boat and into the 
               water. He lays a rifle on the top of the sandbag wall and 
               fires off a clip.

               THE SHERIFF, HANK AND WAYNE

               Jim's bullets plug into their boats. They circle back.

               AT THE CHURCH

               Tom pushes Jim, still groggy, into the flooded church.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom shuts the door. He piles the weapons on a shelf. He sees 
               Jim touch his head.

                                     TOM
                         That hurt?

                                     JIM
                         Yeah.

                                     TOM
                         Good.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Wayne and Hank are alongside the Sheriff, engines idling as 
               they look at the church.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (nods, to Hank)
                         Then go get some bottles.

               Hank nods, guns his engine.

                                     PHIL
                              (to Hank)
                         Wait -- what about the dam?

                                     SHERIFF
                         It'll be fine.

                                     PHIL
                         You said if it goes it'll wipe out 
                         the town.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Fuck the town.

               Hank nods in agreement and takes off.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim and Tom are by one of the stained glass windows, looking 
               out through a pale-colored pane at the Sheriff and his men 
               across the street. They watch Hank race off.

                                     JIM
                         Does he have the girl?

                                     TOM
                              (shakes head)
                         She's in the small boat.

               Tom touches the wound on his head.

                                     TOM
                         Jesus, I'm gonna get hepatitis.

                                     JIM
                         Hepatitis, hell. You probably already 
                         got cholera.

               Tom gives Jim a look then starts for the back of the church.

                                     JIM
                         What're you doing?

                                     TOM
                         There's a back room.
                              (touches wound)
                         Maybe they've got something I can 
                         use on this.

                                     JIM
                         You been in here before?

                                     TOM
                              (bad memory)
                         Oh, yeah.

                                     JIM
                         What happened?

                                     TOM
                         I saw Jesus.

               EXT. DAM

               Water is starting to go over the top again. It pours down in 
               sheets over the face of the dam.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim is by the window, looking out at the Sheriff and Wayne 
               across the street in the shadows. He turns as...

               TOM

               Enters from the back. He's got a bottle of rubbing alcohol 
               and a towel. He splashes some of the alcohol on the towel, 
               then touches it to his wound. It hurts like a sonofabitch. 
               After a beat...

                                     TOM
                         So, has this all gone pretty much 
                         how you thought it would?

               Jim turns on Tom.

                                     JIM
                         Everything would have gone fine if 
                         you'd've just walked away from the 
                         truck.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, yeah? Well, everything would've 
                         gone even better if you hadn't decided 
                         to rob the damn truck in the first 
                         place!

               Jim looks away. After another silence...

                                     TOM
                         Did Charlie have cancer or something?

                                     JIM
                         You mean why was he doing this?
                              (thinks, shrugs)
                         No cancer.
                              (beat)
                         Didn't you ever think about taking 
                         the money?

                                     TOM
                         No.

                                     JIM
                         Come now. A man who used to make his 
                         living fencing hot jackhammers never 
                         thought about what he'd do with three 
                         million dollars?

                                     TOM
                         Sorry to disappoint you.
                              (beat)
                         What are you gonna do with it?

                                     JIM
                         As little as possible.

               Silence for a few moments, then...

                                     TOM
                         Belize.

               Jim looks at him.

                                     TOM
                         It's this small country in Central 
                         America, on the Atlantic side.

                                     JIM
                         I know where Belize is. What about 
                         it?

                                     TOM
                         They speak English and the dollar 
                         goes a long way. Beautiful beaches; 
                         friendly people. And they've got 
                         liberal banking laws. Very liberal.

                                     JIM
                         No, you didn't think about taking 
                         that money at all.

                                     TOM
                              (busted)
                         You can't ride in the truck and not 
                         think about it.

                                     JIM
                         I'm sure. And I guess that's pretty 
                         much how it started with Charlie.

               Tom thinks, nods and presses the towel to his wound again.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Wayne is thinking about something. He makes a decision and 
               flicks on his engine.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What're you doing?

                                     WAYNE
                         We got too many bodies with bullets 
                         in 'em.
                              (nods at Karen)
                         I'm gonna put her in her house, make 
                         it look like she fell down the stairs 
                         and drowned.

                                     PHIL
                         Don't you touch her!

                                     WAYNE
                         Saving her life... Hmm... You know, 
                         that might have actually gotten you 
                         laid.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Oh, for Christsakes, just dump her 
                         here.

                                     WAYNE
                         We got a few minutes before Hank 
                         gets back.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Just dump her here!

               Wayne ignores the Sheriff and motors off.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Wayne! Goddamnit, we've gotta get 
                         them outta there! Wayne!

               But Wayne keeps going.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom watches Wayne drive off with Karen.

                                     TOM
                         Shit. Where's he going?

               Tom grabs a rifle, frustrated and angry.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Hank motors up to the Sheriff and Phil.

                                     HANK
                         Where's Wayne going?

                                     SHERIFF
                         On a date. You all set?

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, but --

                                     SHERIFF
                         Then let's go.

                                     HANK
                         Aren't we gonna wait for Wayne?

                                     SHERIFF
                         We can get started without him, the 
                         dumb shit. He won't be long. Besides, 
                         we got Phil. Phil's gonna earn his 
                         money on this, aren't you Phil?

               Phil looks scared shitless.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               Water continues to pour over the top. CLOSE ON CONCRETE

               Chunks of cement are starting to wash away.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom finishes reloading a gun.

                                     JIM
                         What -- you're gonna swim after her?

               Tom doesn't answer. He moves toward the front door. Jim cuts 
               him off.

                                     JIM
                         You ain't gonna help her by getting 
                         shot. He's gone and you don't know 
                         where.

                                     TOM
                         The Sheriff knows. I think maybe 
                         I'll go ask him.

                                     JIM
                         You'll be dead before you get over 
                         the sandbags.
                              (beat)
                         Look, he'll be coming for us. You 
                         can ask him then.

               Jim sees something out the window.

                                     TOM
                         What if he doesn't come?

                                     JIM
                         I wouldn't worry about that.

               Tom sees what Jim sees.

               THEIR POV

               The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are heading toward the church, 
               flaming Molotov cocktails in their hands.

               EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH

               The Sheriff, Phil and Hank heave the flaming Molotov 
               cocktails.

               THE ROOF

               The bottles hit, explode. Sheets of fire rain down the roof.

               ONE BOTTLE

               Smashes through a window.

               INT. CHURCH

               Tom and Jim duck down as...

               THE BOTTLE

               Flies across the inside of the church and smashes against a 
               wall, sending sheets of fire down the wall.

               EXT. CHURCH

               The roof is on fire.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Modest, two-story, on a side street. The front door is open; 
               the boat tied up outside. There's a light on in the front 
               hall.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen is unconscious. Wayne has her laying on the stairs 
               leading up from the entry area to the second floor. There's 
               three feet of water in the house. Karen's legs are in the 
               water. Her hands are handcuffed to a railing attached to the 
               wall, running up the stairs. Wayne stands over Karen, pats 
               her face.

                                     WAYNE
                         Wakey-wakey.

               Karen stirs, then starts slipping back into unconsciousness, 
               so Wayne splashes her face with water. Karen comes to, 
               sputtering. Her eyes focus. She looks up at Wayne. Wayne 
               grins.

                                     WAYNE
                         Dear Penthouse: I always thought 
                         your letters were fake, until the 
                         wildest thing happened to me. I'm a 
                         policeman in a small town. In the 
                         middle of the big flood last year, I 
                         was patrolling the streets in a boat, 
                         feeling kind of sorry for myself -- 
                         'cause it was my birthday and all -- 
                         when I saw the front door to a house 
                         was open. I pulled my gun -- afraid 
                         it might be looters. Imagine my 
                         surprise when, instead of a looter, 
                         I find a young woman handcuffed to 
                         the railing of her stairs. Her name 
                         was Karen, and ever since she came 
                         back from college she'd made it clear 
                         she was too good for any of us local 
                         folk. Now here she was, in handcuffs! 
                         I said, "What the heck is going on 
                         here, ma'am?" And she said...

               Karen says nothing. Wayne leans in close.

                                     WAYNE
                         And she said...

                                     KAREN
                         Sorry, Wayne, but I'm not playing a 
                         part in your sick little play.

               Wayne pulls his gun, puts it to Karen's head.

                                     WAYNE
                         You're perfect for the role. I suggest 
                         you reconsider.

                                     KAREN
                         Or what? You'll kill me? You're gonna 
                         do that anyway.

                                     WAYNE
                         I might get clumsy. It might take a 
                         while.

                                     KAREN
                         I'm sure you can hurt me. But it's 
                         all going to be the same when I'm 
                         dead.

               Wayne straightens up, looks at her, then launches back into 
               it.

                                     WAYNE
                         And she said, "Happy Birthday, Wayne. 
                         I've got something for you." Well, 
                         I'm not stupid. I knew what she wanted 
                         to give me and I knew she wanted to 
                         give it bad, so I --

               THE OVERHEAD LIGHT

               Sparks and goes out.

                                     WAYNE
                              (looks up at light)
                         That won't do. Man's gotta see what 
                         he's doing. 'Scuse me.

               Wayne heads off for the kitchen. The second he's gone...

               KAREN

               Raises her hips and digs a hand into her pocket and pulls 
               out her Swiss Army knife. She pries open the big blade. She 
               hears Wayne sloshing back toward her. She gets back into the 
               position Wayne left her in as...

               WAYNE

               Re-enters carrying two burning candles in candle-holders.

                                     WAYNE
                         I got the candles. All's we need is 
                         a cake.

               He sets the candles down on a dry step above Karen's head. 
               He leans in close.

                                     WAYNE
                         Mood lighting. You in the mood yet?
                              (no answer from Karen; 
                              back into Penthouse 
                              letter)
                         And then she said, "My present's 
                         ready and waiting. All's you gotta 
                         do is unwrap it."

               Wayne reaches into the water, undoes Karen's rain pants, 
               yanks off her shoes, then pulls off her pants. He throws 
               them over the banister. Karen remains passive, blank. Wayne 
               takes off his holster; hangs it on the banister. Then he 
               pushes his pants down to his ankles. His shirttail is long 
               enough so that we don't have to see his wretched little 
               pecker. He climbs on top of Karen in the water, brings his 
               face close to hers.

                                     WAYNE
                         It was cold and rainy that birthday 
                         night, and all I wanted was to get 
                         someplace warm and dry. As it turned 
                         out, what I really wanted was 
                         something warm and wet. Wayne grins 
                         and closes for a kiss and...

               KAREN'S HAND

               Moves fast with the knife and...

               WAYNE'S EYES

               Pop open wide.

               WAYNE

               His head jerks back. He tries to shout, but all that comes 
               out is an awful gurgle. He tries to push off Karen, but...

               KAREN

               Wraps her legs around him, holds him close, pinning him.

               WAYNE

               Finally breaks free. He tries to stop the bleeding with a 
               hand, but the blood spurts through his fingers. He reaches 
               for his gun in his holster on the banister, but just as he 
               grabs it...

               KAREN

               Lashes out of the water with her legs, kicking Wayne in the 
               groin, pushing him back.

               WAYNE

               Tries to get his balance, but his feet can't move -- his 
               pants are around his ankles. He falls back into the water, 
               firing his pistol.

               BULLETS

               Blow chunks out of the wall next to Karen, hit the ceiling 
               and...

               WAYNE

               Is floating on his back, trying to lift the pistol, but his 
               strength is fading fast. He gets off one last shot and...

               THE CANDLE

               Nearest Karen is blown to pieces.

               WAYNE

               The gun drops into the water. No more shots. No more life. 
               He floats, pants around his ankles, covered in blood, dead.

                                     KAREN
                         Happy Birthday, Wayne.

               EXT. STREET AND CHURCH

               The church roof is on fire.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               Are across the street.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim and Tom hear a creaking and look up.

               THE CEILING

               The fire has eaten holes in the roof. Embers come down.

               EXT. CHURCH AND STREET

               The Sheriff is getting very agitated.

                                     SHERIFF
                         They're not coming out, Hank!

                                     HANK
                         The fire's not catching. The rain's 
                         too --

                                     SHERIFF
                         We have to get them! We have to kill 
                         them! Do you understand? If they're 
                         not dead, we got jack shit!

               INT. CHURCH

               A small chunk of burning ceiling drops down. Jim and Tom 
               look up. Just then...

               BRIGHT LIGHT

               Floods into the church through...

               THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS

               Filling the church with a kaleidoscope of colors.

               TOM AND JIM

               Look out the windows.

                                     TOM
                         My God they're beautiful.

               THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS

               Remain beautiful for a few more seconds until they shatter 
               and blow inwards as...

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT AND HANK'S BOAT

               Come crashing through.

               THE BOATS

               Land, stop fast. The Sheriff's boat lands closer to the 
               pulpit; Hank's boat closer to the balcony.

               THE SHERIFF, HANK AND PHIL

               Look around. It's quiet for a moment. There's no sign of Tom 
               and Jim.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen has her pants back on. She reaches out with one foot 
               and hooks Wayne's holster off the banister. She flips it 
               through the air and catches it with her hands. She opens 
               little leather pockets -- mace, more bullets. No keys. Karen 
               starts to panic.

                                     KAREN
                         There have to be keys. There --

               She sees...

               WAYNE

               Still floating on his back, still dead. She looks closer 
               at...

               WAYNE'S PANTS

               Bunched around his ankles. And there, hanging from a belt-
               loop is a ring of keys.

               KAREN

               Reaches out with her foot for Wayne's pants. She can't reach.

               WAYNE

               Is slowly drifting out the open door. Beyond the door, in 
               the light of the streetlamp, the water is riffling, moving, 
               and Wayne is heading toward it.

               KAREN

               Slides down further on the stairs, into the water, then stops.

               CLOSE ON HANDCUFFS AND RAILING

               There are metal supports going from the railing to the wall, 
               every three feet. Karen is prevented from going any further 
               down the stairs by one of these supports.

               KAREN

               Reaches out with a foot, straining, stretching her body, 
               almost dislocating her shoulder and...

               HER FOOT

               Just barely touches one of Wayne's feet, but then Wayne's 
               foot slips away and...

               KAREN

               Can only watch as...

               WAYNE

               Drifts out the door and is pulled away by the current.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               Water is cascading over the top of the dam. Chunks of concrete 
               are washing away.

               INT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff, Phil and Wayne scan the water, looking for 
               movement.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Where are they?! Jesus!

               UNDERWATER POV

               Looking up through a tangle of floating pews at the wavering 
               silhouettes of the boats and the men in them against the 
               burning timbers above.

               TWO PISTOLS

               Come into view, pointed up through the water.

               ON THE WATER

               The Sheriff, Phil and Hank have let down their guard for a 
               second when there's a series of dull, muted clacks from 
               underwater as...

               BULLETS

               Come streaking out of the water, winging by them, plugging 
               into the boats.

               UNDERWATER

               Jim fires the pistols, the bullets' bubble streaks knifing 
               up through the water.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               hit the deck in their boats, returning fire over the gunwales.

               TOM

               Surfaces over by the stairs up to the balcony, gasping for 
               air. He runs for the stairs.

               BLAZING TIMBERS

               Start to fall from the burning roof frame, hitting the water 
               with loud sizzling hisses.

               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

               Turn to shoot at tom through the dropping flaming debris.

               TOM

               Disappears up the stairs, the bullets just missing him.

               UNDERWATER

               Jim runs out of bullets. He's long since run out of air. He 
               drops his guns and swims under the pews.

               HANK

               Looks up, realizing that Tom will be able to shoot down on 
               him. He reverses his boat fast under the balcony as...

               TOM

               Shoots down from the balcony, blowing a chunk out of the 
               prow of Hank's boat.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The water is up to Karen's chin. Her hands are working 
               frantically beneath the water.

               UNDERWATER

               She's using the tip of the knife blade to unscrew the screws 
               holding the support to the railing. She's on the last one. 
               The blade slips, misses, gets a quarter turn, another quarter 
               turn...

               KAREN

               Spits out the water that spills into her mouth.

               UNDERWATER

               Another quarter-turn and the screw is loose enough to turn 
               by hand.

               KAREN

               Holds her breath with the water touching her nose. She gets 
               the screw loose, pulls up on the railing and pulls the 
               handcuff through the gap between the support and the railing.

               INT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff turns to Phil and nods re: Jim.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You take care of him!

               The Sheriff aims at the balcony as Phil scans the water, 
               looking for Jim.

               UNDERWATER

               Jim pulls an electrical cord out of a wall socket.

               ON THE BALCONY

               Tom ducks down as the Sheriff's bullets start plugging through 
               the wood front of the balcony. Tom moves away from the bullet 
               strikes, splashing through the water in the balcony.

               CLOSE ON BALCONY FLOOR

               As BANG BANG BANG -- bullets start shooting up from below.

               HANK

               Is firing up at Tom through the floor of the balcony.

               TOM

               Jumps back, startled, looking down at...

               THE BALCONY FLOOR

               Holes explode in the floor, sending up small geysers of water. 
               The water then starts whirlpooling down through the holes.

               TOM

               Moves back from hank's advancing bullet holes.

               THE SHERIFF

               Keeps firing.

               TOM

               Is caught between Hank's bullets and the Sheriff's bullets. 
               So he racks a load in the shotgun and dives backwards off 
               the balcony.

               HANK

               Is still shooting up as...

               TOM

               Arcs off the balcony, firing the shotgun under the balcony 
               at Hank.

               HANK

               Dives to the floor of his boat as Tom's shotgun blasts blow 
               plate-sized holes in the church doors.

               TOM

               Lands in the water and goes under.

               THE SHERIFF AND PHIL

               Look for Tom in the water.

               HANK

               Starts to get up from the bottom of his boat, searching for 
               a clip for his gun.

               THE SHERIFF

               Sees Tom's shape in the water and is about to shoot when...

               JIM

               Jumps up out of the water with the electrical cord. He tosses 
               a loop of the cord around the Sheriff's neck and pulls, 
               yanking the Sheriff out of the boat.

               TOM

               Comes out of the water, aiming his shotgun at...

               PHIL

               Who is aiming his pistol at Tom. Phil freezes.

               THE SHERIFF AND JIM

               Struggle in the water. Jim pulls the cord tightly around the 
               Sheriff's neck as the Sheriff tries to get a shot off at Jim -- 
               he can't get the barrel pointed at Jim.

               HANK

               Fumbles with the bullet clip.

                                     HANK
                              (to Phil)
                         Kill him!

               TOM

               Turns his shotgun on Hank and pulls the trigger -- click. Uh-
               oh.

                                     HANK
                         Kill him!

               TOM AND PHIL

               Exchange a look.

               HANK

               Slams the clip into his gun and levels it at Tom.

               PHIL

               Points his gun at Hank.

                                     PHIL
                         No! We can't --

               BANG! and hank shoots Phil. Phil pitches back out of the 
               Sheriff's boat.

               PHIL

               Lands between Jim and the Sheriff, knocking them apart.

               THE SHERIFF

               Is free of Jim's grasp. He shakes off the electrical cord 
               and turns to shoot...

               JIM

               Who moves a little faster. He grabs Phil's pistol and puts 
               it to the Sheriff's head before the Sheriff can bring his 
               gun around.

               HANK

               Draws a bead on Jim and is about to shoot when...

               TOM

               Comes out of the water on the other side of Hank's boat. Tom 
               pushes down hard on the side of the boat.

               HANK

               Is rocked back, thrown off balance. He starts to spin and 
               bring his gun around when...

               TOM

               Swings with the shotgun, catching...

               HANK

               In the side of the head. Hank crumples and falls into the 
               water, taking his rifle with him.

               JIM AND THE SHERIFF

               Jim nods at the Sheriff's rifle.

                                     JIM
                         In the boat.

               THE SHERIFF

               Hesitates, then tosses his rifle into the boat.

               TOM

               Grabs Hank's rifle and aims it at the Sheriff.

                                     TOM
                         Where's Karen?

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen undoes a last screw in a metal support.

               She pulls the handcuff through the gap between the support 
               and railing. She's at the top of the stairs.

               THE END OF THE RAILING

               Curves and goes into the wall.

               KAREN

               Tugs at the railing, tries rocking it up and down. It doesn't 
               budge. She starts chipping at the plaster with the knife.

                                     KAREN
                         God, I am really beginning to hate 
                         fine craftsmanship.

               THE WATER

               It's up to her chest.

               INT. CHURCH

               The Sheriff hesitates.

                                     TOM
                         Where is she?

                                     SHERIFF
                         They went back to her house.

                                     TOM
                         Where's her house?

                                     SHERIFF
                         It's --

               And just then they all hear something truly ominous -- a 
               siren pierces the night.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               She reacts to the siren -- uh-oh.

               INT. CHURCH

               The siren wails.

                                     JIM
                         What in God's name is that?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hank?

                                     HANK
                              (woozy but okay)
                         It's topped out.

                                     SHERIFF
                         How much time we got?

                                     HANK
                         How should I know?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Guess!

                                     HANK
                         It's an old dam! Not long.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (to Tom)
                         Then I'd say you boys better drop 
                         your guns.

                                     TOM
                         What?

                                     SHERIFF
                         That's the deal! You let me and Hank 
                         go -- with a few of these bags -- 
                         and I'll tell you where to find Karen.

                                     JIM
                              (to the Sheriff)
                         Get out of the boat.

                                     TOM
                         Hold on.

               Jim turns to look at Tom.

                                     JIM
                         Hold on?

                                     SHERIFF
                         It's the only way you're gonna find 
                         her!

                                     TOM
                         It's only a couple of bags.

                                     JIM
                         No.

                                     TOM
                         But I thought --

                                     JIM
                         Look, I don't know what you thought 
                         but I told you, I'm here for the 
                         money; that's all.

               Tom doesn't know what to do. The Sheriff looks pretty pleased 
               with himself. He might just get out of this. And then...

                                     PHIL (O.S.)
                         She lives on Boyd Street.

               They all look over at...

               PHIL

               Alive, but barely.

                                     PHIL
                         Three over. Two-story, blue shutters.

               TOM

               Looks at Jim, disappointed, angry, then hurries to Hank's 
               boat.

               JIM

               Climbs into the Sheriff's boat.

               TOM

               Climbs into Hank's boat. He starts the engine, looks down 
               at...

               PHIL

               Floating in the water, dying. A brief look between them, 
               then...

               TOM

               Drives the boat out through a shattered window.

               JIM

               Pushes the Sheriff out of the boat.

               EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

               A large V is being cut in the top of the dam by the raging 
               water.

               A QUARTER-MILE AWAY

               Looking back at the dam. The line of lights on top of the 
               dam start to fall over, then go dark, snuffed out by an unseen 
               force.

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim keeps his gun leveled at the Sheriff and Hank, standing 
               in the water, as he pulls the money bags up from the forward 
               hold.

                                     SHERIFF
                         So, you just gonna kill me?

                                     JIM
                         Lord knows I should.

               Jim opens a money bag and smiles at what he sees.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen tilts her head back to keep her lips and nose above 
               water. And then she hears a window smash. She turns as...

               TOM

               Wades in along the upper hall.

                                     TOM
                         I'm guessing you can't get up.

                                     KAREN
                         I'm handcuffed.

               Tom reaches into the water for the railing.

                                     KAREN
                         The railing's bolted to the wall.

               He looks at her.

                                     KAREN
                         I've got a saw.

                                     TOM
                         Where?

                                     KAREN
                         In the kitchen. In the tall cupboard 
                         beside the --

               And then they hear a sound more ominous than the siren -- 
               they hear the siren stop.

                                     TOM
                         Is that good or bad?

               INT. CHURCH

               Jim, the Sheriff and Hank react to the silence. Jim looks 
               off.

               THE SHERIFF

               Drops underwater.

               JIM

               Turns back at the sound of the Sheriff going under.

               UNDERWATER

               The Sheriff pulls up his pant leg.

               JIM

               Is aiming his gun at the water and is about to fire as...

               THE SHERIFF'S HAND

               Comes out of the water shooting a pistol.

               JIM

               Is shot in the gut and the thigh and high on the chest and 
               he stumbles back, bellowing, and falls out of the Sheriff's 
               boat and into the water.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You should've just killed me.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

                                     KAREN
                         You gotta go!

               Tom starts hyperventilating.

                                     KAREN
                         The dam's gone! You gotta go!

                                     TOM
                              (shakes head)
                         I owe you one.

               Tom breathes deep then ducks underwater.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom flicks on his flashlight and starts swimming down the 
               stairs.

               KAREN

               Watches Tom and his light get swallowed up in the murky water.

               INT. CHURCH

               Phil is grabbing for the Sheriff's boat as the Sheriff and 
               Hank zoom out of the church, leaving him behind.

                                     PHIL
                         NOOOO!

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               The Sheriff's boat comes onto Main Street, moving fast.

               IN THE BOAT

               Hank is looking back, in the direction the flood will come.

                                     HANK
                         We gotta go faster!

                                     SHERIFF
                         Yeah, you're right.

               The Sheriff pushes Hank out of the boat.

               HANK

               Goes skipping over the water and slams into a streetlight 
               post.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Tom swims down into the living room. His light shows a couch, 
               chairs, TV set. Books and newspapers are suspended in the 
               water.

               EXT. THE CHURCH

               The damaged ski-boat that Jim and Tom took to the church has 
               slipped off the sandbag wall and is drifting. A peaceful 
               scene. But then, from the distance, comes a rushing roar.

               INT. CHURCH

               Phil hears the roar. He looks around, lost.

               EXT. STREET

               Hank, groggy in the water, also hears the distant roar.

               INT. CHURCH

               The roar is building, getting louder. Phil sees something in 
               the water and reaches for it, frantically. He gets it. It's...

               A BIBLE

               And he clutches it to his chest as...

               THE FLOOD

               Hits the church.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

               Tom swims into the kitchen. He looks for the tall cupboard 
               by the fridge. He opens it.

               INSIDE THE CUPBOARD

               Hanging on a hook on the back wall is a saw. Tom grabs it.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               Hank unwraps himself from around the lamp post. He looks 
               back.

               HIS POV

               Streetlights in the distance, winking out one by one, marking 
               the advance of the wall of water.

                                     HANK
                         Oh my God.

               Hank looks around for safety. He sees it.

               HIS POV

               There's an alleyway.

               HANK

               Swims for the alley.

               EXT. THE ADVANCING FLOOD

               Roars through the town, pushing a rolling wave of debris, 
               obliterating anything in its path.

               EXT. ALLEY

               Hank swims into the alley. Hank looks for something to climb 
               up on, to hold onto. There's...

               FIRE ESCAPE LADDER

               At the end of the alley.

               HANK

               Swims for it. He hears the rushing roar of the advancing 
               flood. He expects the flood to blow by the end of the alley. 
               Wrong.

               WALL OF WATER

               Comes into the alley, banking high on the far wall before 
               coming down and barreling toward Hank. And what makes it 
               worse for Hank is that there's...

               A CAR

               At the front of the wave, being pushed by the water.

               HANK

               Dives clear just as...

               THE CAR

               Smashes into the wall, right where Hank had just been.

               HANK

               Relief in his eyes. He gets to the fire escape and is climbing 
               to safety when...

               PROPANE TANK

               Comes into the alley, rolling in the flood, spraying propane 
               from a torn hose. It explodes.

               HANK

               Barely has time to scream.

               INT. KAREN'S KITCHEN - BREAK OF DAWN

               Tom is threading his belt through the handle of the saw to 
               secure it. He gets it done and starts to swim out of the 
               kitchen.

               BACK TO KAREN

               Just Karen's lips and nose are above water.

               IN THE KITCHEN

               Tom is about to leave when everything starts to move -- 
               rocking, from side to side, as if in a slow motion earthquake. 
               Cupboards and the fridge open and bottles and food and plates 
               tumble out.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The house has been hit by the flood. It's being pulled by 
               the massive current, stretching overhead phone and power 
               lines.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen hears the groaning, ripping as the house tears free 
               from water and sewer lines. She's looking down for Tom when 
               there's a snap and the light above her goes out.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The house is carried on the current, turning in the water.

               IN THE KITCHEN

               Tom watches, astounded, as the room starts to turn around 
               him. He kicks fast for the door to...

               THE LIVING ROOM

               Tom swims in, fast, toward the stairs when...

               A WINDOW

               Caves in and...

               HUGE TREE BRANCH

               Smashes in, filling the room, blocking Tom's route to the 
               stairs.

               TOM

               Tries to get through the tangle of branches and leaves, but 
               can't. He swims over to another window and slides it up.

               KAREN

               Keeps looking down for Tom.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               The house is impaled on a tree, the current sluicing around 
               it.

               TOM

               Surfaces near the side of the house, gasping. The current 
               starts ripping him past the house. He swims as hard as he 
               can back to the house, reaches out and grabs onto a gutter.

               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Karen doesn't have much time left. The water is washing over 
               her mouth and nose. And just as she's about to go under...

               TOM

               Swims in with the saw. He starts sawing on the handrail. 
               Everything's going fine. And then...

               THE SAWBLADE

               Snaps.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Look at each other. Oh no. Karen's going under.

               TOM

               Sees something. He dives into the water.

               KAREN

               Can only watch and wait. What's he doing? Oh, Jesus. And 
               then...

               TOM

               Surfaces, holding Wayne's pistol. He puts the mouth of the 
               barrel to the handcuff chain, shields Karen's face, looks 
               away and pulls the trigger.

               EXT. A TREE IN WATER

               The water swirls through the branches of a half-submerged 
               tree.

               HENRY AND DOREEN

               Are in the tree. Henry is either unconscious or dead. Doreen 
               cradles him.

                                     DOREEN
                         Come on, Henry. Forget that "Go to 
                         the light" crap. Come back to me. 
                         You're all I've got.

               And Henry starts to come to.

                                     DOREEN
                         Oh, Henry. Thank God.

               Henry opens his eyes.

                                     HENRY
                         Next time, when I say "Let's 
                         evacuate," we're gonna evacuate.

                                     DOREEN
                         Whatever you say, honey.

               She hugs him tight and after a beat he hugs her back.

               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

               Tom and Karen swim out of a second floor window, grab the 
               rain gutter. Tom pulls himself onto the roof then grabs Karen 
               and helps her up. They crawl until they're clear of the edge. 
               Only the sloped roof of the house is visible in the swirling 
               water. They are just catching their breath when they are hit 
               by...

               BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT

               And they look to see...

               THE SHERIFF

               In his boat, shining a searchlight on them with one hand, a 
               gun in the other. He starts shooting.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Tom pushes Karen toward the peak of the roof as the bullets 
               plug in around them. Tom pushes Karen over the top then turns 
               and dives off the roof and into the water.

               KAREN

               Hears an engine behind her and turns.

               A BOAT

               Racing toward the house. It's...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               And at the controls is...

               JIM

               Barely alive.

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Is wobbling, vibrating at the back of the boat, almost loose 
               from its moorings.

               JIM'S POV

               He sees Karen, crouched below the peak of the house, a bright 
               light coming from the other side along with gunshots.

               JIM

               Pushes the throttle all the way forward.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Shoots forward.

               UNDERWATER

               Tom swims hard toward the Sheriff's boat.

               THE SHERIFF

               Is shooting down into the water at Tom's moving shape.

               THE SKI-BOAT

               With Jim at the wheel, comes racing straight toward the house.

               KAREN

               Thinks he's going to turn.

                                     KAREN
                         No! No!

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Doesn't turn.

               KAREN

               Rolls to the side, just getting clear as...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Hits the sloping roof of Karen's house and ramps up it.

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Digs into the shingles of the roof and tears free from the 
               back of the boat.

               THE SHERIFF

               Hears the sound and looks up as...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Comes over the peak of the roof.

               TOM

               Surfaces to see...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Fly right over him, heading straight for...

               THE SHERIFF

               Who ducks down, just in time as...

               THE SKI-BOAT

               Misses him, landing just past him in the water.

               THE SHERIFF

               Straightens up, grinning with glee that the boat missed him. 
               And then he hears a piercing whine coming from behind him. 
               He turns, just in time to see...

               THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

               Flipping end over end, propeller whirring, heading straight 
               for him.

               THE SHERIFF

               Starts to scream.

               CLOSE ON KAREN

               Looking over the peak of the roof in horror. She hears the 
               Sheriff's scream and the scream of the propeller and then a 
               horrible ugly ripping and both screams stop.

               THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

               The Sheriff is gone. The side has been smashed out of the 
               boat and the boat is flooding with water.

               THE SHERIFF

               Is just some misshapen thing trailing red, floating in the 
               water.

               JIM

               Tries to restart the ski-boat but it's dead. He slumps 
               forward.

               TOM

               Sees Jim slump against the side of the boat.

                                     TOM
                         You okay?

                                     JIM
                         Fine.

               Tom can tell Jim's anything but. Tom swims for the boat.

               THE BOAT

               Tom swims up, pulls himself in. He pulls Jim back off the 
               controls, sees the blood.

                                     TOM
                         Oh, God. We gotta get you to --

               Jim looks at Tom. Tom understands -- Jim's not going anywhere.

                                     TOM
                         Thanks.

                                     JIM
                         For what?

                                     TOM
                         You just saved our lives.

                                     JIM
                         I did? I just came for the money.

               Tom looks at Jim -- he knows Jim's lying.

                                     KAREN (O.S.)
                         Do you need any help?

                                     JIM
                              (grabs Tom's arm)
                         No. Tell her to stay back.

                                     TOM
                              (to Karen)
                         It's okay!

               Jim lets go of Tom.

                                     JIM
                         You're going to turn it in?

                                     TOM
                         Sorry to disappoint you.

                                     JIM
                         Well, hell, then I guess I better 
                         take it after all. I figure the 
                         river'll carry me down to the Gulf 
                         of Mexico. If I catch the right 
                         currents, maybe I'll end up in... 
                         Belize?
                              (Tom nods)
                         You come look me up. I'll buy you a 
                         drink.

                                     TOM
                         I'll do that.

               Jim grimaces as he's hit by a wave of pain. He looks away.

                                     JIM
                         Go.

               Tom hesitates for a second.

                                     JIM
                         Please.

               Tom turns and slides into the water and swims away.

                                     JIM
                         Son, don't think too badly of your 
                         Uncle Charlie. He always said you 
                         were capable of remarkable things.
                              (beat)
                         He was right.

               There's a last look between Jim and Tom, then Tom swims away.

                                     JIM
                              (smiles)
                         The rain's stopped.
                              (breathes deep)
                         The air after a rain...

               Jim slowly topples forward and is still.

               TOM

               Swims through the swirling current toward Karen's roof.

               JIM'S BOAT

               Sinks below the surface and is gone.

               TOM AND KAREN

               Karen is down at the water's edge with her arm extended to 
               Tom. Tom grabs it, and as Karen pulls...

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               EXT. CHURCH - SUNSET

               Karen pulls Tom up onto scaffolding running along the edge 
               of the new roof under construction. Tom holds a paper bag. 
               He's wearing work gear -- tool belt, work boots, etc. Tom 
               looks at the work being done on the roof.

                                     TOM
                         They got a lot done today.

                                     KAREN
                         It's coming along.
                              (re: bag)
                         What'd you get?

                                     TOM
                         Barbecue chicken from Lilly's.

                                     KAREN
                         Yum.

                                     TOM
                         You want some? I wish you'd told me. 
                         I woulda got more.

                                     KAREN
                         Ha ha.

               And as they sit down and start to eat, the camera begins to 
               PULL BACK.

                                     TOM
                         I talked to Mikey. He says the 
                         flooring should be in by Friday.

                                     KAREN
                         That's what he said last week.

                                     TOM
                         I said if it wasn't here by Friday 
                         at six that you were going to go 
                         over and beat the crap out of him.

                                     KAREN
                         And I will.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
