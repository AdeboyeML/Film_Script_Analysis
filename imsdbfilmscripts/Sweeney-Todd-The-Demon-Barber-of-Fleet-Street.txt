1   INT. DARK CHAMBER -- NIGHT                                     1

    Foreboding organ music is heard...

    We are looking down at a rough brick floor ... is it an
    alley? ... a cobblestone street? ... a warehouse? a factory?
    ... we're not sure...

    The flickering glow of flame is the only illumination...

    The ominous organ music continues as...

    From the bottom of the frame...

    A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up
    the frame, defying gravity ... the flickering flame reflected
    in the blood...

    Finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame.

    SUDDENLY--

    A shrill factory whistle blows--

    ENORMOUSLY LOUD -- blood-chilling and spine-shattering --
    the whistle is a bizarre combination of sound: a factory
    whistle; a hog being slaughtered; a dog snarling; a roaring
    inferno; a human scream--

    And a man's face appears, upside down, reflected in the pool
    of blood.

    He is THE GENTLEMAN, a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and
    matching waistcoat. A cold and superior aristocrat.

    The camera slowly revolves -- the Gentleman becoming right
    side up as--

                           GENTLEMAN
                 Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd.
                 His skin was pale and his eye was odd.
                 He shaved the faces of gentlemen
                 Who never thereafter were heard of again.
                 He trod a path that few have trod,
                 Did Sweeney Todd,
                 The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

    We cut from the blood to see the Gentleman standing before
    us. Strangely impassive.

    We are in an eerie dark chamber, unclear, a low ceiling, a
    world of silhouettes and shadows.

    Another figure emerges from the miasma of shadows, into the
    hellish flickering of flame: THE BANKER. He is large, rotund
    and sleek. Impressive muttonchops.

                           BANKER
                 He kept a shop in London town,
                 Of fancy clients and good renown,
                 And what if none of their souls were saved?
                 They went to their maker impeccably shaved...

    Gentleman and the Banker as...

                 Who moralize!

    SWEENEY TODD. Standing before us. An unclear figure,

    On this note, we push in tight on the figure of Todd...

    Music and the clanging of a clock tower bell are heard as we
    slowly begin pulling back and are imperceptibly transported
    to...

2   EXT. SHIP -- THAMES -- ALMOST DAWN                             2

    ANTHONY, a young sailor of about 20, is standing at the rail
    of a ship. We see the obscure shape of rigging and sails
    behind him. The cries of sailors echo.

    Behind him stand the GENTLEMAN and the BANKER. They are
    looking past Anthony, looking at something. They move away as
    Anthony peers through the fog, straining to see...

    London.

    Gradually, as the ship approaches, the towering spires and
    mountainous rooftops of the city begin to stand out in
    relief, to emerge through the fog like a tiger creeping
    toward its prey.

    Music continues as Anthony takes in the dreadful and
    magnificent spectacle of the 19th Century metropolis. The
    gnarl of rooftops. The labyrinth of streets and alleys. The
    black trails of smoke reaching up like skeletal fingers from
    a thousand chimneys.

    London. Sulfurous London.

    Anthony is awestruck.

              I have sailed the world, beheld its wonders

    approaching city.

    Music continues as Todd stands very still and takes in the
    shadowy figures on the docks.

    Anthony seems almost lost at his side, overwhelmed by the
    scale and aura of the city.

                 Lord ... takes your breath away,

                 There's a hole in the world

                 And the vermin of the world

                 And its morals aren't worth
                 What a pig could spit
                 And it goes by the name Of London.
                 At the top of the hole
                 Sit the privileged few
                 Making mock of the vermin
                 In the lower zoo,
                 Turning beauty into filth and greed.

    to the city.

    Todd walks with his beautiful wife LUCY through a crowded
    flower market, a colorful explosion of blossoms. Lucy carries
    their one-year-old baby, JOHANNA.

    Todd is almost unrecognizable to us, content and smiling.

    During the above, JUDGE TURPIN, an elderly man with a
    saturnine demeanor, eyes Lucy through the luxurious bunches
    of flowers. He stalks her, desiring her.

    With the Judge is his nefarious creature, BEADLE BAMFORD. The
    Beadle is a large man, his florid nature and pink, powdered
    face never quite disguising his lethality.

    Beadle and several policemen sweep in and drag Todd off. The

8   EXT. THE PIE SHOP -- DAY                                       8

    Fleet Street.

    We see the exterior of Mrs. Lovett's pie shop. It is tatty
    and unloved by all. Yet it has a strange, ghostly presence to
    it. Imposing and dead at the same time.

    There is an exterior staircase leading up to a darkened
    second floor room with a window overlooking the street.

    The music slows and continues as we see Todd, standing in
    front of the shop, considering it deeply.
    The GENERAL we saw before passes, glancing at Todd. Here and
    then gone.

    Todd finally strides to the shop and enters...

9   INT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                           9

    Behind the dusty counter is...

    MRS. LOVETT, a venal, vigorous and slatternly woman in her
    40's.

    She is currently busy chopping a loathsome mess of suet with
    a wicked looking knife, her greasy hair hanging down over her
    face.

    The moment Todd enters -- and the bell at the door sounds --
    her head snaps up and her eyes are on him like a bird of
    prey:

                           MRS. LOVETT
                 A customer!

    Todd is startled, starts to go--

     distraught, strained, tears in her eyes.

     As Lucy paces we notice the room is full of dead and dying
     flowers: dozens of dried bouquets tossed aside and ignored.

     The Beadle ushers Lucy into a ballroom. She is shocked to see
     a fancy-dress ball in progress.

     Masked couples swirl around the ballroom, their number
     sinisterly multiplied by the distorting mirrors that frame
     the room. The hanging chandeliers, draped in red cloth, cast
     a disquieting incarnadine glow on the proceedings...

               Poor thing.
               "Oh, where is Judge Turpin?" she asks.

     The Beadle finds Lucy again and graciously gives her his arm,
     leading her through the party. She is thankful for the
     salvation he provides. He brings her to Judge Turpin.

     The Judge descends on Lucy, raping her. The other guests
     crowd around ravenously, enjoying the spectacle. A feverish
     nightmare.

                  She poisoned herself. Arsenic from the
                  apothecary on the corner. I tried to
                  stop her but she wouldn't listen to
                  me. And he's got your daughter.

                  particularly kind to you, Mr. Barker,

                  Todd now. Sweeney Todd ... And he will
                  have his revenge.

     He continues with a chilling and quiet resolve as he stares
     with unblinking eyes into the fire:

     They emerge from the pie shop. She begins to scale the
     exterior staircase to the darkened second floor room. He
     hesitates.

     A macabre shroud of dust and spider's webs. Furniture covered
     in sheets. A broken mirror on one wall.

     We hear footsteps approaching and then Mrs. Lovett enters.
     The door creaks like a living thing.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Not to worry, a touch of oil will put
                  that right.

     She moves into the room. But Todd hesitates at the door,
     looking into the room.

     For him this is a truly haunted place.

     Meanwhile, she kneels and pries loose a floorboard.

     Underneath there is a hidden area. Within that, something
     covered with a velvet cloth. She removes it and carefully
     unwraps it. Her touch is particularly gentle and respectful.

     We discover it is a fine leather case. She looks at it for a
     beat. Then turns to him, dusting it off.

                            TODD
                  I don't believe it...

     He finally steps into the room, drawn toward the case.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  When they came for the girl, I hid
                  'em. I thought, who knows? Maybe the
                  silly blighter'll be back again.
                  Cracked in the head, wasn't I?

     Haunting music begins as she opens the case...

     And we see it contains a beautiful set of razors.

     He stands for a long moment, gazing down at his beloved
     razors.

                            MRS. LOVETT

     Anthony, now out of his sailor's uniform, is walking along
     the sidewalk near the Judge's mansion, absorbed in a copy of
     Baedeker's London.

     He stops, lost, trying to get his bearings, studying his map.

     Then an unusual sound emerges through the normal cosmopolitan
     bustle. It is the sound of a woman humming. He looks up to
     see...

     JOHANNA, a 16-year-old girl with golden hair, beautiful and
     hauntingly sad. She sits at her window above, behind bars,
     humming to herself as she does needlepoint.

     Anthony watches her, absolutely mesmerized.

     Johanna notices a Bird Seller passing. He carries a long,
     wooden pole with little bird cages attached.

     Then ... she sees Anthony on the sidewalk below.

     Music continues. There is a long look between them. Her
     intense, melancholy expression moves him.

     She continues singing, the strange anguish and yearning of
     her words seem intended only for him...

     Then she turns away quickly, alarmed, when someone enters her
     room. She looks terrified.

     Below, Anthony is concerned for her. He sees her move from
     the window.

     He is craning to see better when a BEGGAR WOMAN -- a filthy
     tendril of a woman, her foul clothes of rags like a second
     skin -- suddenly thrusts her arm up from the curb, imploring:

               Like you got plenty there to push.

     She grabs at Anthony's crotch -- Anthony starts back -- she
     turns away, instantly plaintive again, and appeals to other
     pedestrians as she goes:

                         BEGGAR WOMAN
               Alms! ... Alms!...
               For a desperate woman...

     Anthony considers the mansion. He sees a figure standing at a
     window, unclear behind the shutters, watching him.

     He sits on a bench outside the mansion and sings quietly:

                         ANTHONY
               I feel you,
               Johanna,
               I feel you.
               I was half convinced I'd waken,
               Satisfied enough to dream you.
               Happily I was mistaken, Johanna!
               I'll steal you,
               Johanna,
               I'll steal you...

     Then the figure disappears from the window above. Anthony
     stands, waits. Then the doors to the mansion swing open...

     Anthony is expecting Johanna...

     But it is Judge Turpin, the predator we met in Todd's
     flashback, who steps into the doorway.

     He seems a different man now. Paternal and warm, he smiles
     and beckons to Anthony.

     Anthony hesitates, unsure. The Judge beckons again. Again the
     warm smile.

                         JUDGE
               Come in, lad. Come in...

     Anthony goes into the mansion.

18   INT. TURPIN'S MANSION -- LIBRARY -- DAY                       18

     Judge Turpin leads Anthony into the dark library, filled with
     books. Anthony is looking around for Johanna. He is wary,
     this is all very strange.

                            ANTHONY
                  Yes, it's terribly large on the map
                  but I keep getting lost...

                            JUDGE
                  Sit down, lad, sit down.

     Anthony sits, uncomfortable, as the Judge pours two snifters
     of brandy.

                            ANTHONY
                  It's embarrassing for a sailor to lose
                  his bearings, but, well, there you
                  are.

     Then...

     The large form of the Beadle appears from the shadows. No
     introduction is made. Anthony glances to him, uneasy.

                            JUDGE
                  A sailor, eh?

                            ANTHONY
                  Yes, sir. The "Bountiful" out of
                  Plymouth.

                  world, yes? ... Must be practiced in
                  the ways of the world ... Would you

                  Sir?

     The Judge moves to consider some beautiful volumes, bound in
     the richest leather. He runs a finger along the spines of the
     books; his large library of pornography.

                            JUDGE
                  Oh, yes ... such practices ... the
                  geishas of Japan ... the concubines of

     Anthony is speechless. The Judge just smiles at him amiably.

               Would you like to see?

               ward, Johanna ... You gandered at her

     The Beadle moves behind Anthony.

               Your meaning is immaterial. Mark me:
               if I see your face again on this
               street, you'll rue the day your bitch
               of a mother gave you birth.

     Anthony is stunned. The Judge proceeds with shocking venom:

                         JUDGE
               My Johanna isn't one of your bloody
               cock-chafers! My Johanna is not to be
               gandered at!

     He nods to the Beadle -- the Beadle instantly grabs Anthony
     and brutally hauls him out.

19   EXT. MANSION -- ALLEY -- DAY                                  19

     The Beadle drags Anthony through a rear door of the mansion
     and flings him into a filthy alley.

     Anthony pulls himself up. Stunned.

     Flustered, Anthony turns to look--

     The instant Anthony's back is turned, the Beadle swings his
     lethal billyclub and SLAMS him from behind brutally, in the
     kidneys -- Anthony's knees buckle--

     The Beadle then SLAMS Anthony across the back of the neck --
     Anthony falls hard--

     The Beadle then uses one dainty foot to roll Anthony over--
     Anthony gazes up at him, panting for breath, in agony--

                            BEADLE
                  You heard Judge Turpin, little man.

     He presses the end of his billyclub into Anthony's forehead,
     grinding it hard--

                  Next time it'll be your pretty brains

     With that, the Beadle returns to the mansion and slams the
     door.

     Anthony slowly pulls himself to his knees, doubled over,
     coughing up blood.

     A long beat as Anthony gets his breath, wiping blood from his
     face.

     Still doubled over, he sings with burning intensity:

                  I am in the dark beside you,
                  Buried sweetly in your yellow hair.

     He pulls himself up, every movement is agony. He makes his
     way down the alley, leaning on the wall for support.

21   EXT. STREET LEADING TO ST. DUNSTAN'S MARKETPLACE -- DAY        21

     Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett are moving quickly, she
     struggles to keep up with his long, loping stride. He carries
     his razor case, she carries a shopping basket.

     They round a corner and move into the bustling marketplace. A
     steady mercantile hum as the cries of merchants and wandering
     coster-mongers fill the air.

     Todd and Mrs. Lovett move toward a hand-drawn caravan
     dominating one corner of the marketplace. It is painted like
     a Sicilian donkey cart and on its side a sign declaims:
     "Signor Adolfo Pirelli -- Haircutter to His Royal Majesty the
     King of Naples."

                            MRS. LOVETT

     malnourished and consumptively pale -- emerges from Pirelli's
     caravan. He bangs on a tin drum, drawing customers.

     A crowd begins to gather at the caravan as:

     Suddenly, the curtains on the caravan are dramatically flung
     wide to reveal--

     PIRELLI, a flamboyant Italian with a velvet suit, thick wavy
     hair and a dazzling smile. Pirelli poses splendidly for a
     moment. Then:

     The crowd gasps. Pirelli is about to respond, outraged, but
     Todd continues--

                         TODD
               And furthermore --   "signor" -- I have

               shave a cheek with   ten times more
               dexterity that any   street mountebank.

     He snaps open his razor case and holds it up for the crowd to
     see, turning to display the wondrous razors:

                         TODD
               You see these razors?

               yourself as a sham.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Bravo, bravo.

     The crowd is enjoying this now, whispering eagerly about the
     bold challenge. In the crowd, we see a quick flash of the
     meek TOURIST we saw earlier.

     Pirelli studies the razors for a moment and then turns to the
     crowd with a confident smile:
                         PIRELLI
               You hear zis foolish man? Watch and
               see how he will regret his folly!

     Music begins as Todd moves into action, preparing the
     challenge:

                         TODD
               Friends, who's for a free shave?

     Two men step forward. A plain wooden chair is brought for
     Todd as he moves into the boldest part of this plan...

     He carefully turns to ... The Beadle.

                         TODD

     Mrs. Lovett's eyes shoot to Todd, alarmed--

     The Beadle moves toward Todd ....

     Todd smiles amiably, but quivers internally at being so
     dreadfully close to his prey...

     Mrs. Lovett watches, concerned. Will the Beadle recognize the
     features of Benjamin Barker...?

     Apparently not.

     The Beadle stops right before Todd and smiles.

                         BEADLE

               ... Let the challenge commence!

     One man sits in Todd's plain chair as the other moves to an
     elaborate chair on Pirelli's caravan. Pirelli shakes out a
     fancy bib with a flourish and covers his man. Toby prepares
     Pirelli's ornate shaving supplies as Todd takes a plain towel
     and tucks it around his man's neck.

                         BEADLE
               Ready?

               winner.

     He blows his shrill whistle. Agitated music begins.

     Pirelli strops his razor quickly, Todd in a leisurely manner.
     Pirelli keeps glancing at Todd in various paranoid ways
     throughout, frightened of Todd's progress. He starts whipping
     up lather rapidly:

                         PIRELLI

     Unexpectedly, Todd still shows no signs of starting to shave
     his man. He merely watches Pirelli's performance. Mrs. Lovett
     looks at him nervously, wishing he would get on with it.

     Pirelli, now feeling he can take his time, sings lyrically as
     he lathers and shaves with rhythmic scrapes and elaborate
     gestures of wiping the razor.

     Todd strops his razor slowly and deliberately -- shoop,
     shoop, shoop -- disconcerting Pirelli and drawing the crowd's
     attention.

     Todd is unconcerned. He just continues to slowly strop his
     razor -- shoop, shoop, shoop -- which flusters Pirelli.

     While Pirelli holds this note elaborately, Todd, with a few
     deft strokes, quickly lathers his man's face, shaves him and
     signals the Beadle to examine him.

                  but I do hate to see a boy treated
                  like that, no better than your Aunt

                  listening to me?

                               TODD
                  Of course.

     But then his eyes dart again -- looking for the specters. He
     only sees strangers.

     Johanna sits, framed by the window, quietly cutting out
     silhouettes. Aimless Victorian handicrafts.

     But we see there are tears in her eyes.

     She steals a glance across the room. We see a small hole in
     the wallpaper. Through this hole, the Judge is watching her
     from another chamber. Lascivious. Perverse.

     Johanna finally stands and casually glances out from between
     the shutters at her window. She sees...

     Anthony, standing at the park across the street, keeping up
     his lonely vigil, gazing up at the mansion.

     She watches him for a moment and then makes her decision. She
     moves to a table and opens a drawer. Reaches in and removes
     something...

25   EXT. TURPIN'S MANSION -- MORNING                              25
     Anthony sees a figure at the shutters -- then hears a
     clinking sound. Metal on pavement.

     He quickly moves across the street and looks...

     A key, dropped from above.

     He looks up to the shutters and smiles, then snatches up the
     key and hurries off.

26   INT. JOHANNA'S ROOM -- MORNING                                26

     Peering through the shutters, Johanna watches him go.

     We linger on her face and then dissolve to another face, also
     watching...
                                                                  PAGE 37.

     ... Her father.

     Todd's face, staring out the window, intense and brooding.
     Seething with discontent.

     Mrs. Lovett chatters as she moves around behind him:

                         MRS. LOVETT
               ... It's not much of a chair, I'll
               grant, but it'll serve. Was me poor
               Albert's chair. Sat in it all day long
               he did, after his leg give out from
               the gout, poor dear.

     He moves from the window and paces like a caged tiger in the
     small barber shop.

     Though it has been cleaned, it is still a spartan room. A
     tatty parlor chair. A large chest. A few counters with meager
     bottles of tonsorial supplies. And his gleaming razors,
     always waiting.

                         TODD
               Why doesn't the Beadle come? "Before
               the week is out," that's what he said.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               And who says the week's out? It's only
               Tuesday.

     Todd moves away from her, she pursues, trying to calm and
     soothe him...

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Easy now.

               Watch it close.

     He does not respond. She dares to move closer...

                  Ah, wait, love, wait.

     Todd sourly tosses himself into the chair, he picks up his
     largest razor and looks at it intensely:

     Her gentle words have calmed him considerably. She moves even
     closer. Risks touching him softly...

     in the razor--

     all in, savoring every second:

     Todd is on him.

     He leaps across the shop and brutally grabs Pirelli by the

     strong and puts up a desperate struggle -- they thump
     awkwardly around the shop--

                  one for the lashings.

     He moves past Todd to the large chest and sits--

     Only now do we see one of Pirelli's hands protruding from the
     chest, dangling limply.

     Toby doesn't notice it. Todd at this moment, however, does.

               This is the second time, sir, that you

               Though it is my earnest wish to ever
               temper justice with mercy, your
               persistent dedication to a life of
               crime is an abomination before God and
               man.

     He places a black cloth on his head:

               the neck until you are dead and may

     Mrs. Lovett is pouring Toby a glass of gin, not his first.

     He gulps down the gin between ravenous bites of another meat

     He casually points the razor toward the chest.

     She lifts the lid and sees Pirelli's body at the bottom of
     the chest.

     She starts to close the chest, then has an idea.

     She reaches in and rummages around the body. Pulls out
     Pirelli's chatelaine purse, then drops the lid of the chest.

     moves off as the Judge approaches the shop--

     Mrs. Lovett gives him a quick kiss and then very quickly
     leaves. A beat as Todd prepares himself.

     nervously. Now that his great moment of revenge is at hand,
     he doesn't quite know what to do with himself.

     Small, white hands ... removing some clothes from a drawer
     ... putting them into a portmanteau ... locking the case...

     Johanna, wearing traveling clothes, is packing to leave when
     a voice surprises her:

               So it's true.

               Sir ... A gentlemen knocks before
               entering a lady's room.

               I told myself the sailor was lying ...
               I told myself this was a cruel fiction
               ... That my Johanna would never betray
               me. Never hurt me so.

     He moves toward her. She stands her ground.

               I think that only appropriate. Since
               you no longer find my company to your
               liking, madam, we shall provide you
               with new lodgings.

     He stands very close to her. Still she holds her ground.

               Until this moment I have spared the
               rod ... And the ungrateful child has
               broken my heart. Now you will learn
               discipline...

                            JUDGE
                  When you have learned to appreciate
                  what you have, perhaps we shall meet
                  again. Until then ... Think on your

     He nods to the Beadle -- the Beadle surges forward and grabs
     Johanna brutally--

     She screams and fights like a tiger -- to no avail--

     The Beadle covers her mouth with one of his huge hands and
     hauls her out--

50   EXT. TURPIN'S MANSION -- EVENING                               50

     Anthony is racing toward the front of mansion when he sees--

     A hansom cab is just pulling away -- Johanna's terrified face
     looking at him through the window--

                             ANTHONY
                  JOHANNA!

     Anthony sees the Beadle pulling her away from the window as
     the carriage clatters off--

     Judge Turpin stands on the steps of the mansion -- Anthony
     goes to him in a murderous rage:

                            ANTHONY
                  Where are you taking her?! Tell me or
                  I swear by God--!

     The Judge spins and roars -- a hellish howl that echoes--
                            JUDGE
                  WOULD YOU KILL ME, BOY?! HERE I STAND!

     Anthony's eyes burn into the Judge -- but he is no killer.

     He turns and races after the hansom cab. It rounds a corner
     and is gone.

     The Judge watches as Anthony pursues the cab, disappearing
     around the corner.

     And we fade to...

     She sits, crouched on her haunches, peering up from under her
     few greasy locks of hair.

     She is watching something intently. A few pedestrians move
     quickly down the sidewalk past her, excited. They chatter
     back and forth eagerly...

     The Beggar Woman uncoils and follows...

     intently...

52   EXT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                          52

     Mrs. Lovett's wretched establishment has been transformed!

     She has created a modest outdoor eating garden with tables,
     surrounded by glowing Chinese lanterns. A fresh coat of
     paint, a few bushes in pots and birds in cages add to the
     feeling of upward mobility.

     A new sign hangs proudly over the entrance to the pie shop:
     "MRS. LOVETT'S WORLD FAMOUS MEAT PIES!" And then in smaller
     letters: "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE."

     The eating garden is already crowded, the benches at the
     tables are filled and other customers stand and mill about.

     All eating, eating, eating...

     ...The most delicious looking meat pies you could ever
     imagine. Crispy crust. Thick, luxurious gravy. Tart and tangy
     meat.

     The customers take great, hungry mouthfuls; the steaming
     gravy oozing down greedy faces.
     Chomp. Chomp. Chomp.

     The Beggar Women stands across the street, ravenously hungry.
     She finally gets the nerve to approach when--

     Toby -- wearing a spiffy new outfit with apron -- bursts from
     the shop and circulates through the customers:

                            TOBY
                  Ladies and gentlemen,
                  May I have your attention, perlease?
                  Are your nostrils aquiver and tingling as well

     He moves through the greedily eating customers in the outdoor
     garden and toward the street as:

                            TOBY
                  Well, ladies and gentlemen,
                  That aroma enriching the breeze
                  Is like nothing compared to its succulent source,
                  As the gourmets among you will tell you, of course.

     He arrives at the street and drums up some more business:

                            TOBY
                  Ladies and gentlemen,
                  You can't imagine the rapture in store--

                  Savory and sweet pies,

                  Conjure up the treat pies
                  Used to be!

     Just then Mrs. Lovett sweeps from the pie shop with a tray of
     hot, steaming pies.

     Like her shop, she has been transformed as well. She wears
     her somewhat gauche notion of a "fancy dress." Buckets of
     decolletage. And her hair has been dyed a rather unique
     aubergine color.

     mouthfuls of pie:

     Toby scurries inside to get a jug of ale, whisks back out and
     starts filling tankards as Mrs. Lovett circulates grandly.

     She is a bundle of activity -- serving pies, collecting
     money, giving orders, addressing the patrons individually and
     with equal buoyant insincerity:

     Todd is alone. He sits in the barber chair, smoking a pipe.
     He is holding an old Daguerreotype; creased, stained and
     bleached-out.

     The image shows his wife, Lucy, smiling and holding Baby
     Johanna. The child's features are almost completely obscured
     by a stain on the picture.

     Mrs. Lovett and Todd rest on a picnic blanket, just like any
     other couple out enjoying the fine day.

     The remains of a nice picnic lunch are scattered around them
     and Toby can be seen flying a kite a bit away.

     Mrs. Lovett watches happy couples moving about ... dogs and
     kids running hither and yon ... military officers squiring
     their ladies ... nurses with prams...

     Todd is distinctly ill at ease, brooding, as she chatters:

     ...In Mrs. Lovett's mind.

     She and Todd sit in the exact same positions as in Hampstead
     Heath. Only now they are sitting on a beach.

     They are wearing what she imagines as fashionable seaside
     bathing clothes.

     Toby, who is not consumptively pale but overly rosy-cheeked
     in her fantasy, is building a sandcastle nearby.

     Mrs. Lovett is sitting with her Dream Todd, of course, so he
     has a bland smile on his face. Somewhat unnatural.

     In fact, there is something vaguely unreal and stilted about
     all of this.

     Todd. Silence.

     Her smiles fades as she considers him. The grim, brooding
     reality is so clear next to her lovely dream.

     She watches him in silence as we fade to...

95   INT. BARBER SHOP -- MORNING                                    95

     Todd is standing at his usual post, the window, gazing
     intently down at Fleet Street.

     Mrs. Lovett enters with a tray of food:

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Brought you some breakfast, dear, farm
                  fresh eggs and a dollop of lovely
                  clotted cream, only the best for my...
     She stops when he realizes he isn't even listening to her.
     Her heart sinks seeing him at the window, wearing his
     obsession like a cloak.

     A beat as she looks at him.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Mr. T., might I ask you a question?

                  She had yellow hair.

     He turns back to the window.

     Mrs. Lovett proceeds with great sincerity:

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  You've got to leave all this behind
                  you now. She's gone ... You keep
                  looking down into the grave, you're
                  never gonna look up. And life will
                  just pass right by ... Life is for the
                  alive, my dear.

     He does not answer.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  We could have a life we two ... Maybe
                  not like I dreamed, maybe not like you
                  remember ... But we could get by.

     He does not answer.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  Come away from the window.

     A long beat.

     He finally turns from the window. Almost as if to leave his
     demons behind...
     She smiles quietly and holds out her hand...

     She begins to cross to him...

     SUDDENLY REVEALING--

     The Gentleman!

     Standing right behind Mrs. Lovett--

     He is glaring at Todd, relentless and accusatory--

     Blood pouring from his throat--

     A shocking horror movie vision--

     Gentleman is gone ... we hear footsteps climbing the
     stairs...

     Mrs. Lovett remains standing, her hand out to him, as--

     Anthony enters, absolutely exhausted.

                         ANTHONY

               For all the good it'll do -- it's
               impossible to get to her.

     Todd begins pacing, the tiger again, his mind is racing--

                         TODD
               A madhouse ... A madhouse ... Where?

               Fogg's Asylum. But I've circled the
               place a dozen times. There's no way
               in. It's a fortress.

     Anthony fades to a brooding silence as Todd continues pacing,
     thinking, thinking. Mrs. Lovett watches him, concerned.

     Todd suddenly stops...

     We see him settling into an inspired sort of calm, as if he
     can finally see the Promised Land.

     Todd suddenly grabs Anthony and hauls him up -- holds him
     close, forehead to forehead -- his whispered intensity truly
     disturbing:

                         TODD

               search of hair -- that will gain you

     Mrs. Lovett watches, troubled, as Todd embraces Anthony
     closely. He holds him for a long beat.

     Then Todd is all action, hurries to get some money and gives
     it to Anthony, as:

     Mrs. Lovett begins going down the stairs outside the barber
     shop.

     Then she stops. She stands for a long moment, disturbed that
     Todd's demons are again devouring him.

     She looks down and sees Toby washing the tables in the
     outdoor garden. Toby is serious about his work, vigorously
     scrubbing the tables with soap and water.

     She watches him for a moment and then continues down the
     steps:

      Toby is stunned and terrified. It is the first time he has
      seen this side of his friend, Mr. Todd.
      Todd releases him. Toby races out.

      Todd immediately begins pacing like a caged animal, back and
      forth, back and forth, whispering to himself neurotically, as
      day becomes evening...

      A macabre vision of Hell.

      The roof hangs low in this subterranean chamber. The grisly
      tools of her trade are scattered about the place: a large,
      stained chopping block; a meat grinder; buckets of
      questionable viscous liquid; cleavers and bone saws and meat
      hooks; wet sewer grates for the blood.

      A metal sheet, hinged at the top, has been attached to cover
      an opening in the wall: the mouth of the chute from the
      barber shop above.

      from a large industrial oven against one wall.

       A cacophony of madness. The ragged inmates of the asylum are
       slammed together in a series of cramped cells, the low
       ceiling pressing down.

       We discover Anthony, dressed as a fashionable wigmaker,
       walking past the cells with the odious MR. FOGG. Fogg carries
       a large pair of scissors.

                 children's hair.

       Fogg goes into the crowded cell -- the inmates, all blonde
       women, scurry back, clearly terrified of Fogg. Anthony sees
       Johanna, wearing a filthy straitjacket, hunched like a feral
       animal, cowering in a corner of the cell.

      clothing, grabs Johanna and pushes Fogg back into the cell.
      He swings the cell door shut, locking Fogg in.

                   mercy of your "children."

108   INT. BAKEHOUSE -- EVENING                                  108
      Toby is eating a pie as he slowly wanders around the
      bakehouse.

      He stops to consider the many stained cleavers and bone saws,
      curious.

      Then he bites on something hard -- stops -- he reaches into
      his mouth and pulls something out. Looks at it:

      It is a fingernail.

      To be exact, it is the severed tip of a finger.

      Toby drops it in horror and starts back--

      disappears down into the sewers as the shrill factory whistle

      He waltzes her toward the roaring oven.

      She offers no resistance, fully aware of what's coming.

      The blazing, thundering inferno of the oven makes it seem
      they are the damned, dancing through Hell.

                          TODD

      The music reaches a thundering crescendo as--

      He flings her into the oven and slams the doors--

      We hear her screaming. And banging on the oven doors.

      Todd sinks to his knees and covers his ears desperately as
      the banging and screaming and music finally fade to silence.

      Then he slowly drags himself across the floor to the Beggar
      Woman.

      He cradles her head in his arms.

      Todd folds himself over his dead wife.

      The only sound his deep, anguished sobs.

      A long beat.

      Then he becomes aware of something. He looks over to see....

      Toby -- staring at him from the open sewer grate. He has seen
      everything.

      Todd watches as Toby silently pulls himself up. Todd gently
      sets Lucy down and then, still kneeling, turns to face Toby.

      A long beat as they look at each other.

      Then Toby slowly moves and carefully picks up Todd's razor.

      Todd looks at him.

      Then slowly unbuttons his collar and exposes his neck.

      He bends his head back, offering his naked throat.

      Toby slowly goes to him and methodically slits his throat.
      Todd continues to gaze up at Toby as we hear the lonely sound
      of wind escaping from his severed wind pipe.

      Then Toby turns and leaves the bakehouse.

      Todd leans forward, dying.

      We cut to his point-of-view:

      The rough brick floor...

      From the bottom of the frame...

      A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up
      the frame ... the fiery glow from the bake oven reflected in
      the blood...

      Finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame.

      We realize this is the first image we saw in the story.
      Todd's perspective. Todd's blood. As he dies.
