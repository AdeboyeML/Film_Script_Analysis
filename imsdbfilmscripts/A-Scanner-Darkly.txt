          Lately, Jerry Fabin stands all day
          shaking bugs from his hair. The
          doctor says there are no bugs in his
          hair.


   The sound of fingers scratching scalp begins and grows louder
   through the following montage.

   EXT. COCA-COLA BOTTLING PLANT - PRE-DAWN

   SUBTITLE: ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, IN THE YEAR 1994

   A massive, unlit Coca-Cola sign is eerily silhouetted
   against the early morning sky. Antiquated delivery trucks
   set out from loading docks, as red futuristic cargo planes,
   emblazoned with the Coca-Cola logo, take off from the roof.

   EXT. FREEWAY - PRE-DAWN

   Birds-eye view of Coca-Cola trucks spreading out through the
   city. Coke planes shoot by close to the camera.

   A Coke truck pulls into the parking lot.

   A Coke plane lands gracefully on the roof of the supermarket.

   EXT. MCDONALD'S - DAWN

   Uniformed delivery men enter, hauling cases of Coke syrup.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAWN

A Coca-Cola truck rumbles slowly past a row of low-income,
plastic pre-fab houses. We hold on one house whose front
lawn is strewn with furniture and cleaning products.

INT. JERRY FABIN'S LIVING ROOM - DAWN

The windows are spray-painted over with silver paint. A
single pole lamp with bare, harsh spot-lights illuminates
the room, which is emptied of furniture, covered in a sickly
green shag carpet, and littered with fast-food wrappers. In

the center of the room stands Jerry Fabin, thirty, with wild-
eyes and a long, tangled mass of hair. He is naked, draped
over a metal garbage can, and vigorously scratching his
head. This process continues for an uncomfortably long
time. A Golden Retriever sleeps in the corner.

INT. JERRY FABIN'S BATHROOM - LATER

Jerry Fabin stands under a hot shower. Steam fills the
stall. He scrubs his hair violently with tensed fingers.

INT. JERRY FABIN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

We hear the shower. Steam pours out the open bathroom door.

EXT. JERRY FABIN'S HOUSE - MID-DAY

The sun is high; the day is bright and hazy.   A few hippies
stroll by or sit on front steps, discreetly smoking joints.
We hear the distant sound of Jerry's shower.

INT. JERRY FABIN'S BATHROOM - LATER

Jerry is still in the shower, scrubbing away. He finally
turns it off and steps out, a drowned rat. He dries
himself, wipes the mirror and squints nervously at his
reflection. Tiny bugs hop around on his head. He screams.

INT. JERRY FABIN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Jerry lies on the cruddy shag carpet, open volumes of the
Encyclopedia Brittanica spread around him. He scratches
himself as he studies one of the volumes. Insects hop up and
down all over his body, and on the rug. When he exhales, a
cloud of bugs pours from his mouth; he shoos them away.

EXT. JERRY FABIN'S HOUSE - DAY

Jerry heads up the walkway carrying a shopping bag. Several
cans of Raid and other bug sprays poke out of the bag. Bugs
hop around on Jerry. He puts the bag down on the stoop to
scratch himself. He notices tiny bugs chewing the shrubs.

INT. NURSERY - DAY

Jerry consults with a man behind the cash register.

          Eating the bushes?   Could be aphids.

          Aphids! Of course. Y'know, I started
          with "A" in my cyclopedia, yet somehow
          I must've skipped right over aphids.
          It does start with "A", right?
          Aphids?

                        NURSERY CLERK
          Yes.   Yes, it does, sir.

          Boy, those fuckers can really bite.

                       NURSERY CLERK
          Aphids don't bite people.

Fabin just stares at the clerk.

INT. JERRY FABIN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Scrawled charts depicting the aphid life-cycle now adorn the
walls. As Jerry sprays a can of "Aphid-Off" around the
room, he notices his sleeping dog is covered with the bugs.

INT. JERRY FABIN'S BATHROOM - DAY

Jerry stands in the shower with his dog. Jerry is lathered
head-to-toe and in the process of lathering the dog.

Jerry and the long-suffering dog are still in the shower.
Charles Freck, early thirties and stoned, enters.

                       CHARLES FRECK
          Hey, Jerry, I was in the neighborhood
          looking to score, and I thought --
          What the fuck are you doing in the
          shower with the goddamn dog?

                       JERRY FABIN
          I got to get the aphids.

Jerry turns off the shower, steps out with the dog, and
begins drying him. Freck watches silently, transfixed, as
Jerry proceeds to rub oil, then talc into the dog's coat.

                       CHARLES FRECK
          I don't see any aphids. What's an

          an aphid is.

Freck nods sympathetically.

                       JERRY FABIN
          They're in my hair and my skin and my
          lungs. The goddamn pain is unbearable.
          I'm gonna have to go to the hospital.

          How come I can't see them though?

Jerry stops talcing the dog, looks up at Freck.

INT. JERRY FABIN'S LIVING ROOM - A BIT LATER

Jerry and Freck are on all fours on the carpet. Bugs hop
all around. The powdered-white dog sleeps in the corner.

                       JERRY FABIN
          I'll find an especially big one, cause
          they're hard for many people to see.

Jerry grabs a bug from the carpet, throws it in a jar, and
clamps the lid down fast. He shows it triumphantly to Freck.

                         CHARLES FRECK
          Wow!    That is a big one!

The two men are still on their hands and knees collecting
bugs. Three jars are already full of hopping insects.

             What do we get for these? I mean,

They continue to collect bugs in silence. Jerry starts
scratching himself again, trying not to be too obvious.

          Hey, man, you continue while I take a
          leak and like that.

Jerry heads to the bathroom. The dog, who has been sleeping
near the bathroom door, skulks to the other side of the room.

                       CHARLES FRECK
          Jerry, these bugs sort of scare me.    I
          don't like it here by myself.

Jerry stops, holds the door jam for support.    He is in pain.

                       JERRY FABIN
          You're a chickenshit bastard, Freck.

Jerry enters the bathroom, slams the door shut, and locks it.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jerry turns on the shower, climbs in and begins to soap
himself vigorously. Freck is barely audible throughout.

                       CHARLES FRECK (O.S.)
          I'm afraid out here, man.

          Can I wash them off and wait for you?

Jerry ignores Freck. He scrubs himself intently,
ritualistically, totally absorbed in his task.

INT. LION'S CLUB HALL - DAY

We hear pronounced, rhythmic breathing, as we scan the hall,
which is filled with middle-aged businessmen wearing an
array of brightly colored suits. They are well-fed and dull-
looking. At the podium is another bussinessman, this one fat
in a pink suit and yellow tie. He addresses the assemblage.

                       FAT BUSINESSMAN
          Gentlemen, we have a wonderful
          opportunity this afternoon. The
          county of Orange has provided us with
          the chance to hear from -- and put
          questions to -- an undercover
          narcotics agent from the Sheriff's
          Office.

The fat businessman gestures with a sweep of his arm toward
the camera.

The heavy breathing stops as we angle on what the fat
businessman is gesturing toward: a generic blur of a human
being sitting on stage. The blur is clearly human, but it's
impossible to settle on its facial features. It's as if the
features keep changing.

                       FAT BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          Now you will notice that you can
          barely see this individual becuase he
          is wearing what is called a "scramble
          suit", which he wears during most of
          his daily activities of law
          enforcement. Due to potential
          corruption within the Sheriff's
          Department, even this gallant
          officer's co-workers and superiors
          must not know his "street" identity.

Heavy breathing. Again we're inside the suit. Now we see,
in shadowy profile, the face of the man in the suit. This is
Bob Arctor, early thirties, homely, and looking like a
druggie. He scans the audience disdainfully.

          Nitwits. Pathetic, soulless morons.

          voice or by appearance. He looks,
          does he not, like a vague blur. This
          is because his scramble suit projects
          thousands of different human faces
          onto your retinas, thus turning Fred
          into a veritable Everyman. All things
          to all people translates into nothing
          to anyone, does it not?

The fat businessman smiles a big, toothy smile.   The audience
of straights smiles back, almost in unison.

                       FAT BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          So let's hear it for our vague blur!

The audience erupts into enthusiastic applause. Fred rises
and replaces the fat businessman behind the podium. When he
speaks it is an emotionless computer voice.

                       FRED
          If you saw me on the street, you'd
          say, "There goes a weirdo freak
          doper." And you'd feel aversion and
          walk away.

The audience is silent, blank, their blankness a reflection
of the blankness of Fred's scramble suit.

                       FRED (CONT'D)
          I don't look like you. I can't afford
          to. My life depends on it.

Dramatic pause.

Now the audience is hooked, their eyes wide.

We move inside the suit and watch Bob Arctor watching the
audience, timing the pause for best effect. We hear the
breathing again, and when Arctor speaks, it is in his normal
voice, bored, delivering a memorized speech.

QUICK SHOT OF FAMILY PHOTO OF ARCTOR, HIS WIFE, AND TWO

The Arctor in the photo is different, conservative, in a

are smiling and suburban-looking. Their features indistinct,
generic, impossible to recall.

INT. CHARLES FRECK'S CAR - DAY

Freck drives slowly along a strip-malled Anaheim street. He
passes a Thrifty pharmacy and notices the window display:
bottles of slow death, slow death mixed with speed and junk
and psychedelics. Dayglow signs in the window: "Your
Credit is Good Here" and "Death to the Masses" He looks
again. The window displays combs and shampoo. Freck checks
his rearview mirror, sees a police car following him.

                       CHARLES FRECK
          Fucking goddamn fuzzmobile. What was
          I doing? Was I weaving? I don't even
          know.

Freck drives very deliberately, his hands gripped, white-
knuckled, on the steering wheel in an attempt to keep the car
completely straight. He tries his best to plaster a non-
stoned, regular guy look on his face. But he's sweating.

                       CHARLES FRECK (CONT'D)
          What I'll do is pull over when I see a
          parking space. That's it: pull over
          like I was gonna pull over anyway.
          Like it's totally normal to pull over.
          Like I'm going to a store. That's
          perfect. Real people do that all the
          time.

Freck sees an angle space, pulls over suddenly. The cop car
glides past, apparently having had no interest in Freck.

EXT.   ANAHEIM STREET - CONTINUOUS

Freck hurries after a pretty young woman, nineteen, with
black hair. This is Donna Hawthorne.

                        CHARLES FRECK
           Hey!

Donna realizes that Freck is following her and picks up her
pace. The sidewalk is crowded with people. Donna weaves
through, graceful and fast. Freck struggles to catch up.

                        CHARLES FRECK (CONT'D)
           Hey!

The light is against her at the corner and while the other
pedestrians wait for the WALK sign, Donna juts out into
traffic, causing a Coke truck to swerve and honk. She gives
it the finger. Freck waits with the others till the light
changes. Then he runs, catches up with Donna, and walks
backwards ahead of her, sweating and panting.

pointing at his stomach. He jumps out of the way.

Donna keeps walking. Freck shrugs and slouches dejectedly
away. He turns and gives one last glance over his shoulder.
Donna has stopped amid the bustling foot traffic. She is
squinting at him. Freck cautiously approaches her.

Bob Arctor, now out of his scramble suit and looking like a
druggie, wanders depressed and aimless along a crowded
street. He passes a McDonald's, a 7-11, a mirrored office
building, pulls a pill box from his pocket, and
surreptitiously swallows two capsules. He studies his
reflection in the office building. Behind him on the street
are the disapproving reflections of passing straights. He
blends back into the flow of foot traffic. A grungy hippy
smiles at him. Arctor nods, passes another McDonald's. He
passes a third McDonald's almost immediately.

Arctor parks across from the New-Path Drug Rehab Facility, a
converted wood frame house. He checks the police photo of
Erroll Weeks, a.k.a Spade Weeks, shoves it into his glove
compartment, and heads, business-like, toward the building.

          Bob Arctor? He's not doing anything
          much. Working at his nowhere Blue
          Chip Stamp job, dropping a few tabs of
          meth cut with Death during the day.

                       HANK
          That's not what I hear.

Arctor studies the vague blankness of Hank.

          What do you mean?

          We have a tip that Arctor has funds
          above and beyond what he makes at the
          stamp redemption center.

We move outside the suit and see Fred.

          No shit, Hank. Is that true?

                       HANK
          And according to this information,
          Arctor comes and goes mysteriously.
          Have you observed any of this?

                       FRED
          Most likely he's with his chick, Donna.

EXT. BOB ARCTOR'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

The yard, lit only by moonlight, is overgrown with weeds and
littered with rubbish. Barris sits on a cracked cement
patio fiddling with some sort of foam rubber and aluminum
foil tube. Freck looks on anxiously. Ernie Luckman, a big
stoner in a football jersey, sits on a decrepit swing set,
looks up at the moon, and sips a beer.

                       CHARLES FRECK
          Why do you need a silencer, anyway,
          Jim? I mean, they're illegal.

                       ERNIE LUCKMAN
          Law abidance has always been of the
          utmost concern to Jim Barris.

                       JIM BARRIS
          In this day and age, with the kind of
          degenerate society we live in and the
          depravity of the individual, every
          person of worth needs a gun at all
          times. To protect himself.

                       ERNIE LUCKMAN
          Just shut up and fire off the great
          eleven cent silencer of our times.

Barris half shuts his eyes and fires the pistol into the
air. It is the loudest report ever heard.

Arctor jerks awake and reflexively grabs his gun from under
his pillow. Confused, heart pounding, he tries to take in
his surroundings. Dogs bark outside.

          rather than dampen it. But I almost

Arctor sighs, replaces the gun, and gets out of bed.

INT. BOB ARCTOR'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Arctor trudges through the pig-sty living room, past the
ratty couch, the broken cephscope, the crooked pictures on
the wall. He disappears into the kitchen.

          Not much.   Thirty bucks. I'll sell it

Arctor reappears, leans against the kitchen door, beer in
hand, and looks at the depressing living room.

It's the same room, but different. It's neat. The pictures

children. Through shadow and obstruction, we never get a
clear view of Arctor's family.

The catchy, reduntant Coke jingle continues in the
background throughout. Bob Arctor squats down and reaches
into a floor level cabinet to grab a popcorn popper. When he
rises, he hits his head hard on a sharp corner. His
countenance changes dramatically, violently.

them from behind, looking at Arctor.

Arctor's wife runs to him. His daughters hover in the
doorway. Arctor looks up at his wife, at his daughters.

          All the elements that made up my life

Arctor pulls into the parking lot, gets out of the car.

                       BOB ARCTOR (V.O.)
          While in Long Beach today I checked in
          on Kim, an addict acquaintance who
          lives with dealer Dan Blake. My
          intention was to get the latest on
          Blake, but also to strand Barris and
          Luckman down here long enough for the
          scanners to be installed.
                                                             36.



INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - MORNING

Arctor knocks on an apartment door. Shuffling inside.    The
chained door opens slightly. An eye peeks out.

                       KIMBERLY
          Yes?

                       BOB ARCTOR
          It's me, Kimberly. Bob Arctor.

Kimberly unchains the door. She has a black eye and a split
lip. Her manner is listless. Arctor enters the apartment
and Kimberly closes the door behind him.

INT. KIMBERLY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Arctor looks around. The place is a shambles. There's been
a fight. The windows are broken, there's glass on the floor.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          Are you alone?

                       KIMBERLY
          Dan and I had a fight and he split.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          He beat you up?

                       KIMBERLY
          Thank God he didn't have his knife.
          His case-knife, which he now carries in
          a sheath on his belt.

Kimberly drops back into a chair and stares blankly.

                       KIMBERLY (CONT'D)
          Why are you here, Bob? I'm bummed, I
          really am.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          Do you want him back?

                      KIMBERLY
          Well...
               (listless shrug)
          Who knows?

Arctor looks out the window at the street.

                          Maybe. Maybe.
          Another day.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          Can't you get it anywhere else?
          Y'know the name of Dan's supplier?
          Maybe you could deal directly.

                         KIMBERLY
          I dunno.

The sound of loud, irregular car pipes.   Kimberly stiffens.

                         KIMBERLY (CONT'D)
          Is that him?    Fuck. Red '79 Torino?

Arctor looks out and spots a red Torino pulling into the lot.

                         BOB ARCTOR
          Yeah.

A car door slams.    Kimberly shuffles to the front door and
triple locks it.

                       KIMBERLY
          Probably has his case-knife with him.
          Y'know, he keeps it in a sheath on his
          belt now.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          You should call the police.

          No phone.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          Kim, he'll kill you.

Kimberly shrugs and sits back down, staring blankly, hands
clasped in her lap. Sound of running upstairs. A knock on
the door turning to pounding.

                       DAN (O.S.)

Sound of running downstairs. Kimberly rises, and she and
Arctor watch out the window as Dan, a skinny, short-haired
effeminate-looking guy, appears in the parking lot, crazily
waving a knife in the air.

                       DAN
               (screaming up at Kimberly)
          I'll slash your tires, your fucking
          tires! And then I'll kill you!

Dan begins slashing tires on Kimberly's old Dodge. This
seems to wake Kimberly up. She shrieks, runs to the door
and frantically begins unlocking it.

                       KIMBERLY
          I got to stop him! I don't have
          insurance!

Arctor grabs her, tries to hold her back.

Kimberly fights loose of Arctor with manic energy.

Kimberly is scrambling down the stairs. She arrives at an
apartment door and pounds on it. Arctor is right behind her.

The door opens. An old man in tie and sweater stands there.
Kimberly hurries past him, goes for the phone, and dials.

INT. OLD PEOPLE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Arctor enters, closes the door and watches out the peephole.

                          KIMBERLY
                  (on phone, crazily)
             Hi, yeah, my boyfriend and me got into
             a fight because of these cowboy boots
             which were worth seven dollars. See,
             I said, they're mine, and he says, no,
             they're mine 'cause you gave them to
             me as a present. And I say but I
             bought them. Which makes them mine.
             Right? So he grabs 'em and I grab
             'em, and I rip the backs of them with
             this can opener and... yes, I'll hold.

Arctor glances at the old man, who's been quietly studying
him. An old woman in a print dress stands in the dining
room doorway. Kimberly paces on hold, chews a fingernail.

INT. ARCTOR'S CAR - DAY

Arctor drives on the freeway, deep in thought. Luckman's
next to him. Barris is in back grinning in his dark shades.

                       BOB ARCTOR (V.O.)
          Dog shit. All that misery and that's
          what really upset them.

Arctor chuckles.   The car is behind a crawling Safeway truck.

                       ERNIE LUCKMAN
          You ought to pass that truck, man.
          The humper's hardly moving.

Arctor comes back into focus, picks up speed, passes the
truck on the left. As he eases up on the gas, the pedal
falls to the floor. The car shoots forward at great speed.

                          LUCKMAN AND BARRIS
          Slow down!

Arctor is panicked. The speedometer is registering eighty-
five, ninety, one hundred. Arctor reaches down, tries to
fiddle with the gas peddle. The car is rocketing right for
a VW van chugging along. Barris and Luckman throw up their
hands. Arctor swerves to the left of the van at the last
minute. They pass it, but a fast moving Corvette had been
about to pass in that lane. It honks, its brakes screech.

                       LUCKMAN AND BARRIS (CONT'D)
               (top of their lungs)
          What the fuck?! What are you doing?!

Luckman grabs at the ignition key, and turns it off. Arctor
shifts into neutral, the car begins to slow, and he
maneuvers it onto the shoulder. The Corvette shoots by, lays
on it's horn, continues to do so until it's long gone down
the freeway. The three guys just sit in the car, hearts
pounding. The VW van passes and honks its VW horn.

They all look down at the still-depressed gas pedal.     The
Safeway truck passes and sounds its own basso horn.

EXT. CAR - DAY

Arctor, Barris, and Luckman are looking under the hood.
White smoke drifts from the oil caps. Water fizzles from the
overflow spout of the radiator.

                          ERNIE LUCKMAN
             The linkage from the pedal to the carb
             fell apart.

                          BOB ARCTOR
             Shouldn't this locking ring hold the
             nut in place?

                          JIM BARRIS
             The idle screw has been turned all the
             way out. So when the linkage parted,
             the override went up instead of down.

                          ERNIE LUCKMAN
             Could it screw itself all the way out
             like that accidentally?

                          JIM BARRIS
             No. A special tool would be needed.
             A couple, in fact. I have the tools
             to fix this, but back at the house.

                                Is Barris saying he did it?
Arctor looks over at Barris.

          So we'll have to get to gas station

          Hey, man, did this happen by accident
          or was it done deliberately? Like the
          cephscope.

Barris pulls out a snuffbox, removies a few tabs of Death,
and swallows them. He passes the snuffbox to Luckman, who
takes a few with a shaky hand, then passes the box to
Arctor. Arctor hands it back to Barris without taking any.

          Put the fucking snuffbox away!

Barris smiles, puts it away. Arctor tries to focus back on
the engine. He sways lightheadedly and supports himself
against the car. The hot sun beats down on the back of his
head. Cars whiz by, the traffic noises intensified. He
hears singing, quiet at first, but soon overwhelming. It's
awful, discordant. He looks at Luckman and Barris,
silhouetted against the sun. Luckman says something, but
Arctor can't make it out over the singing and the traffic
noise. An awful smell permeates the air. Arctor sniffs at
it. His face contorts. He feels nauseated, shuts his eyes.

Now he looks around the engine and sees it everywhere: all
over the block, on the wires, on the fire wall. He looks
up, sees it smeared on the soundproofing under the hood.
The smell is overwhelming. He lurches away from the car,
shuts his eyes, staggers. Luckman grabs Arctor's arm.

Arctor closes his eyes.

EXT. KIMBERLY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Kimberly walks, catatonic and terribly bruised. Dan pops up
and stabs her repeatedly. She falls onto a big wet pile of
dog shit. Barris appears in an apartment window, waving.

                       JIM BARRIS
          Hey, Bob, want a lump of dog shit?   To
          chew on?

EXT. ARCTOR'S CAR - DAY

Arctor opens his eyes fast. Barris, looking on
compassionately, squats next to him outside the car.

                        BOB ARCTOR
          What, Jim?   What'd you say?

Barris begins to laugh and laugh.

                       ERNIE LUCKMAN
               (punches Barris on the back)
          Leave him alone, man. Fuck off.

                       BOB ARCTOR
               (to Luckman)
          What did Barris say just now? What
          the hell exactly did he just say?

                       ERNIE LUCKMAN
          I don't know, man. I can't figure out
          half the things he lays on people.

Arctor again looks at Barris.   He is smiling sweetly.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          You goddamn Barris! I know you did
          it, screwed over the cephscope and now
          my car! You kinky freak mother
          bastard!

The smell of dog shit is becoming overwhelming again.
Arctor tries not to vomit. His head swims.

                       ERNIE LUCKMAN
          Take it easy, Bob.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          I know it's him, man. I know.

          That doesn't make any sense.      He'd
          have snuffed himself too.

Barris nods in agreement. He smiles again. Now there's dog
shit coating Barris's teeth. Arctor throws up on the
dashboard, rests his head in his hands

                       ERNIE LUCKMAN
          What was in those tabs you gave us?

          Hell, I took some too. And so did
          you. Didn't give us a bad trip.

Arctor's head jerks up to face Barris.

Barris and Luckman look at Arctor.

EXT. ARCTOR'S CAR - AFTERNOON

A tow truck is parked in front of the car. The three guys
are inside, Arctor at the wheel, Barris and Luckman in back.
A mechanic closes up the hood.

INT. ARCTOR'S CAR - AFTERNOON

The three drive along in silence.      Arctor is pale, but seems
back in control.

          I wonder what's been going on back at
          the house.

Arctor glances at Luckman in the rearview mirror.

             You know, this proves, Bob, that

             I just hope the house is still there
             when we get back.

          Christ, Barris, they may have ripped
          off everything we got, or stomped all
          our animals, or --

                       JIM BARRIS
          But I left a little surprise for
          anyone entering the house. An
          electronic surprise, if you will.

Arctor shifts his glance in the rearview mirror to Barris.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          What kind of surprise? It's my house,
          Jim, you can't start rigging up --

          Easy.   Be cool.

          Well, what is it?

                       JIM BARRIS
          If the front door is opened, my tape
          recorder starts recording.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          You should've told me.

                       ERNIE LUCKMAN
          What if they come in the window or
          through the back door?

                       JIM BARRIS
          To increase the chance of them making
          their entry via the front door, I
          providentially left it unlocked.

They drive in silence.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          Well, they're not going to expect it
          to be unlocked, so they'll go in the
          window.

          But I put a note on the front door.

           Are you fucking jiving us or not?   I

           jiving us or not, Bob?

                        BOB ARCTOR
           We'll see when we get back. If
           there's a note on the door and it's
           unlocked, we'll know he's not jiving
           us.

More silence.

                        ERNIE LUCKMAN
           But they'd probably take the note down
           and lock the door after vandalizing
           and robbing us. So we'll never know.
           It's that gray area again. Damn it!

                        JIM BARRIS
           Of course I'm kidding, guys! Only a
           psychotic would leave the front door
           open with a note on it.

Silence.

                        BOB ARCTOR
           So what did you write on the note, Jim?

                        JIM BARRIS
           I wrote: "Donna, come on in, the door's
           unlocked. We..." The note's to Donna.

                        ERNIE LUCKMAN
           He did do that. He really did it.

           This way, we'll know who's been
           messing with us, Bob. And that is of
           prime importance.

EXT. BOB ARCTOR'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

The car pulls up to the house. The three guys get out. A
piece of paper is tacked to the door. It reads: "Donna come
on inside; door's unlocked. We've gone to Long Beach for the
day to purchase a stolen cephscope."

Arctor turns the knob. It's unlocked. He looks at Barris
and shakes his head. Barris grins, shrugs. They enter.

INT. BOB ARCTOR'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Barris studies the room.

                      JIM BARRIS
          Interesting. Everything is exactly as
          we left it. They're very clever.

Barris pulls his .22 from the top of the bookshelf.    The
animals appear, clamoring to be fed.

                       ERNIE LUCKMAN
          Well, Barris, I can see you're right.
          There was definitely someone here. You

Arctor and Luckman, who has emerged from the kitchen with a

          That roach may not be a slip-up.

          plant dope, then phone in a tip later.
          Maybe there's dope planted all over

INT. HANK'S OFFICE - MORNING

Scramble-suited Hank is unrolling a floor plan labeled
"Arctor's House" in front of scramble-suited Fred.

                       HANK
          Here are the locations of the eight
          scanners. We transmit to a safe house
          down the block from Arctor's.

                       FRED
          That's where I do playback?

                       HANK
          Yeah. And we use also use it for
          playback on five other houses. So
          you'll be bumping into other
          undercover people. Always wear your
          scramble suit.

                       FRED
          Fine.

                       HANK
          Make note of the scanner locations.
          If they need servicing, you can take
          care of it while you're at Arctor's.
          As long as nobody's around.

                       FRED
          I'll have to edit myself out, so you
          won't see who's fixing the scanners.

                       HANK
          Right. Although we assume you're

          This will help greatly in determining
          what the hell Arctor's up to.

                       FRED
          We don't know he's up to anything.

                       HANK
          We've got more recent information.
          There is no doubt any longer:
          Arctor's a phony, a three dollar bill.
          So keep on him until we have enough to
          arrest him and make it stick.

                       FRED
          You think he's high up in Death
          distribution?

          What we think isn't of any importance
          to you. You report; we evaluate.

                          FRED
             Well, Arctor is doomed if he's up to
             anything. And I have a hunch from
             what you say that he is.

                          HANK
             We should have a case on him soon.
             Then we can seize his house. I think
             you'd like it. It's rundown and
             dirty, but it's big. Nice yard. The
             installation crew reported it has
             excellent possibilities.

                       HANK
          Well, the living room gives a view of
          the intersection, so passing vehicles
          could be graphed and... but Burt
          What's-his-face, who headed the crew,

INT. ROOM 203 - MORNING

The room is all white, with steel fixtures, steel chairs, and
a steel desk. Fred is being interviewed by two sheriff's
deputies in full uniform with medical stripes.

          Look, about the Lion's Club --

                       MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1
          What this testing session is about
          stems from a departmental survey
          showing that several undercover agents
          have been admitted to Neural Aphasia
          clinics in the last month.

                       MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2
          You're aware that Substance D is
          highly addictive, are you not?

          Don't answer that.

          You think I'm an addict?

                       MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1
          Whether or whether not you are an
          addict is not a prime issue, as a
          blocking agent is expected from the
          Army Chemical Warfare Division within
          the next five years. What these tests
          pertain to is --

diagram printed on it.

          Within these apparently meaningless
          lines is a familiar object that we all
          would recognize. You are to tell me
          what the object is and...

Fred studies the diagram searching for some recognizable
shape. There is nothing discernible in the diagram.

          In many of those taking Substance D, a
          split between the right hemisphere and
          the left hemisphere occurs. There is
          a loss of proper gestalting, which is
          a defect within both the percept and
          the cognitive systems.

Fred continues to study the diagram.

          A soda pop bottle is correct.

Medical Technician #1 puts down the card and makes a note on
his clipboard. He holds up another card.

          Is this about the Lion's Club speech?

                       MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2
          Are you getting cross-chatter, Fred?

          Getting what?

          Between the hemispheres. Cross-

          If there's damage to the left
          hemisphere, where the linguistic skills
          are normally located, then sometimes
          the right hemisphere will fill in.

          You could put a four barrel on instead
          of a two, while you're at it.

                       ERNIE LUCKMAN
          It would idle too high. And it
          wouldn't upshift.

                       JIM BARRIS
          The idling jets could be replaced with
          smaller jets. And he could watch his
          rpms with a tach. Usually just
          backing off the gas pedal causes it to
          upshift if the automatic linkage
          doesn't do it.

                       ERNIE LUCKMAN
          If he tromped down heavy on the step-
          down passing gear to get a lot of
          torque suddenly on the freeway, it'd
          downshift and rev up so high it'd blow
          the whole engine.

INT. ARCTOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The living room has a monochromatic, dream-like quality to
it. Suddenly Donna crawls in on all fours. There is an non-
human blankness to her face. She sticks her head into the
dog's bowl and eats greedily, making slurping noises.

INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

Fred sits in a cubicle and stares at a holo-monitor On it
Barris winds a string around the bowl of a hash pipe while
Luckman watches tv and stuffs his face from a tv dinner. We
hear other tapes being played in other cubicles: stoned
conversations; screaming; high-pitched fast-forward squeals.
Another scramble suit walks by Fred's cubicle and glances at
the monitor.

                       SCRAMBLE SUIT #1
          You're allowed to fast forward through
          the dull stuff, y'know.

Suddenly Luckman gags, jumps to his feet, turns to Barris,
signaling wildly. He staggers around, choking. Barris
watches him blankly. Luckman lurches to the kitchen.

                        FRED
          Jesus fuck!   Barris!

We see Luckman on the kitchen holo-scanner knocking things
over, grabbing a glass from the counter and trying to fill it
with water. On the living room monitor, Barris camly
continues to wrap string around his hash pipe.

Luckman gives up on the water and begins hurling pots and
plates at the kitchen walls trying to attract Barris's
attention. Barris, in the living room, does not respond.
All at once, Luckman falls to the kitchen floor unconscious.
In the living room, Barris smiles a little smile. Fred
watches, paralyzed. Barris casually rises and strolls into
the kitchen. He studies Luckman spread out on the floor.
He looks at the dishes and pots scattered about. Then,
suddenly, he rips off his sunglasses in a faux panic,
working himself up for the frantic 911 phone call. His eyes
widen in horror, he flaps his arms helplessly, runs back and
forth until he starts to pant, then dials the phone.

newspapers on the floor.

          Stay on the newspaper. I just had the

Donna slips out of her leather jacket, tosses it on a pile of
jackets, and pads into the kitchen. Arctor follows her,
tiptoeing along the paper.

plastic bags of pills. She lays them on the counter, opens
a drawer, pulls out a pipe and some hash, sits at the table
and fills the pipe. Arctor lays money on the table.

          Hey, man, can I go with you? To

Donna smiles up at Arctor. She gently shakes her head "no."
He studies her. Her answer will never change. He shivers.
Donna takes Arctor's hand, squeezes it, holds it. Her touch
fills him. After a moment, Donna lets her hand drop.

INT. ARCTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Arctor enters the dimly lit bedroom followed by Connie, a
skinny girl with hollow eyes and a flat affect. He sifts
through his dresser drawer as she hovers behind him. Finally
he pulls out a baggie with some pills in it. Throughout, we
hear stoned conversation coming from another room.

          Thanks, man.

Connie stuffs the baggie into her purse. She sits on the
bed and begins to unceremoniously undress. When her blouse
comes off, we see needle tracks and bruises on her arms.
She pulls a comb from her purse and listlessly combs her
lank hair. She drops the hand holding the comb and begins
to nod. Arctor looks at the tracks, at the pimple on her
cheek. Connie wakes up, sort of, and starts combing again.

Connie drones on, but her voice has become so quiet it can't
be heard. Arctor watches her lips work soundlessly.
Finally her voice becomes audible again.

Connie removes her bra and her skirt.

INT. ARCTOR'S BEDROOM - LATER

The lights are off. The off-screen conversation has stopped.
Instead we hear static from a signed-off tv station. Arctor
is in bed with Connie. Both are naked and partially under
covers. Connie lies rigidly on her back, arms straight down

glances over at the woman next to him. It's Donna. He
bolts upright, studies her face. It's still Donna. He
fumbles for the switch on the night table lamp and knocks it
to the floor. The woman next to him sleeps on. He watches
her face. Gradually it begins to turn back into Connie.
Arctor drops onto his back and looks at the ceiling.

INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

Fred sits in his cubicle monitoring the scanners. On one
scanner Barris sits in the living room reading a book about
mushrooms. After a moment, he lays the book face down on the
coffee table and leaves the house. Fred watches the empty
living room. He presses the fast forward button. The
sunlight coming in through the living room window shifts as
the day speeds by. The living room door opens. Fred slows
the tape to normal speed. Barris is back at the couch with
a brown bag. He dumps several mushrooms onto the table,
compares them with illustrations in the book. Finally, he
puts one aside, throws the rest in the bag, crumbles the
mushroom, and fills capsules. He dials the phone. An LED on
Fred's console indicates the phone number dialed.

Fred watches the monitors. Arctor's house is quiet. Barris
and Luckman doze in the living room, the television tuned to
static. On another monitor, Arctor is sleeping in his bed
with a woman. After a beat Fred notices the woman is Donna.
We move in close to Fred's ever-changing eyes.

Fred fast-rewinds the tape, switches it to play. Arctor is
in bed having sex with Connie. Fred sighs a computerized
sigh of relief and fast-forwards the tape. Arctor is now
sleeping next to Connie. Fred watches for a moment. As he
does the face of the sleeping woman transforms into Donna's.
Fred freezes the frame. Then he enlarges the holographic
image so it fills up the space previously occupied by all
eight monitors. The image is now almost actual size. Fred
rises and walks around the console into the projection area.
It's as if he's entering Arctor's bedroom, or a slightly
scaled down, frozen version of it. He approaches the
sleeping couple, bends down and examines the face of the
woman. It is clearly Donna. He stands in Arctor's bedroom
for a while, confused and disoriented, tries to look at
himself in Arctor's bureau mirror. Fred does not appear in
the holographic reflection of the room. He shudders,
returns to the console, brings up all eight monitors, and
turns off the freeze-frame. On the bedroom monitor, Arctor
awakens, and glances over at the woman sleeping next to him.
His eyes widen. He fumbles for the switch on the bedside
lamp, knocks it over. He turns back and stares at the
sleeping woman. As does Fred at the console.

INT. ENGLESOHN LOCK COMPANY - CONTINUOUS

A plump old lady stands behind the counter.    Arctor enters.

                           OLD LADY
             Yes sir?   Good morning.

                          BOB ARCTOR
             Hi, I'm here...

The scene shifts to very slow motion. Everything grows
quiet. Colors become saturated, as in a Raphael painting.

                       FAR-AWAY VOICE
          Ihr Instrumente freilich spottet

          Bugel:/Ich stand am Tor, ihr...
The scene shifts back.     Maybe a hiccup's worth of time has
passed.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          ... to pay for a check of mine the
          bank returned. It's twenty dollars.

                        OLD LADY
          Oh.   All-rightey.

The old lady opens a metal file box and, after a moment's
search, pulls out a check with a note clipped to it.

                       OLD LADY
          Mr. Arctor, is it?

                       BOB ARCTOR
          Yes, I am Mr. Arctor. Nobody else is.

                       OLD LADY
          Okay, sir. That'll be twenty dollars.

Arctor hands her a twenty dollar bill.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          I'm sorry about this, but by mistake I
          wrote the check on a closed account.

The lady nods amiably as she writes something on the note.

                       BOB ARCTOR (CONT'D)
          Also, I'd appreciate if you'd tell your
          husband --

                       OLD LADY
          My brother Carl.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          I'd appreciate if you'd tell your
          brother that I was distraught when he
          called and I apologize for that, too.

                       OLD LADY
          I believe he said something about
          that, yes.

She hands the bad check back to Arctor.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          Any extra charge?

                       OLD LADY
          No extra charge.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          I was distraught because a friend of
          mine had just passed-on suddenly.

          Oh dear.

His business done, Arctor stands at the counter awkwardly.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          He choked to death alone, in his room,
          on a piece of meat. No one heard him.

                       OLD LADY
          You know, Mr. Arctor, more deaths
          happen from that than people realize.
          I read that if you're dining with a
          friend and he doesn't talk for a long
          time, you should ask him if he can,
          beacuse he may be strangling.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          Yes. That's true. Thanks.      And
          thanks about the check.

                       OLD LADY
          Well, I'm sorry about your friend.

                          BOB ARCTOR
          Yes.     He was the best friend I had.

                       OLD LADY
          How dreadful. I'll tell Carl. And
          thank you for coming all the way down.

                      BOB ARCTOR
          Thank you. And thank Mr. Englesohn
          for me. Thank you both so much.

Arctor stands there.    The two just look at each other.

                       BOB ARCTOR (CONT'D)
          Okay then, thank you.

Arctor backs out of the tiny shop.

INT. CAB - MORNING

Arctor rides in the back with his open notebook and studies
the returned check. He writes in his notebook.

SHOT OF NOTEBOOK

We see Arctor writing the following words in the same
handwriting as is on the check. The V.O. is tense.

          A perfect forgery. Barris has my
          handwriting down. How many checks has
          he written on my account? Evil genius
          bastard.

INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS

Arctor looks up, stares out the window, tries to focus.
Something's bothering him. The stores speed by in a blur of
color.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          What if I, Bob Arctor, wrote this
          check myself and just don't remember?

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - MORNING

Arctor is on the pay phone outside the Shell station.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          I'm sorry to bother you again, ma'am,
          but I was just wondering what address
          do you have for that service call?

                       OLD LADY (V.O.)
          Just a minute, Mr. Arctor, I'll check.

                       OLD MAN (V.O.)
          Is that Arctor?

                       OLD LADY (V.O.)
          Yes, but Carl, don't say anything.   He
          came in just now --

                       OLD MAN (V.O.)
          Let me talk to him.

          Mr. Arctor? It says here it was in
          Santa Ana. On Main Street.

EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Arctor is stoned and on the phone in the crowded, smokey,
noisy room. A blonde woman nibbles his ear.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          Yeah, I lost my ignition key.

EXT. SHELL STATION - MORNING

Arctor hangs up the pay phone.   He paces, trying to think.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          So, Arctor's the forger, not Barris!
          Not deliberately, but because his
          brain is slushed on dope. All their
          brains are...

The busy intersection slows almost to a standstill. Colors
become saturated. Details seem momentous: A man gesturing
in mid-conversation, a newspaper blowing down the street.

Back to normal as a car passes with a faulty muffler.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          ... slushed and mutually interacting
          in a slushed way.

INT. CAB - MORNING

Arctor rides in the back. He stares out the window at the
endless loop of McDonald's, Thriftys, 7-11's.

                       BOB ARCTOR (V.O.)
          But what is Arctor up to? Clearly the
          Sheriff's Office has some good reasons
          to focus their investigation on him.
          No doubt reasons I know nothing about.
          My job is to report, theirs to
          evaluate.

Arctor lets his head fall back against the seat.

EXT. ARCTOR'S HOUSE - MORNING

The cab drops Arctor off. He heads up the newspaper-strewn
walk to the front door. He eyes the house and the grounds:
The house needs paint, a rain gutter is halfway dislodged.
The yard is overgrown.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          Fucking waste of a perfectly good
          house. A family could live here, for
          Christ's sake.

          Oughta take it away from this fuck.

CONTINUED:

Arctor arrives at the front door, tries to pull his house
keys from his pocket without spilling the armful of
newspapers. He succeeds, opens the door, enters the house.

INT. ARCTOR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The place is a mess.    Arctor drops the papers on the floor.

                  (for benefit of scanners)
             Nobody home, I guess.

Arctor moves through the room in an almost studied way.
There is something stilted about the way he intentionally
avoids looking in the direction of the scanner.

SHOT OF NOTEBOOK DAPPLED WITH SUNLIGHT

Kids playing in background. The camera glides across the
following words as the dispassionate V.O. reads along.

                       BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          What does a scanner see? Does it see
          into the head? Into the heart? Does
          it see into me clearly or darkly? I
          hope clearly, because I can't any
          longer. I see only murk inside and
          out.

INT. ARCTOR'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Arctor rises and pulls a book from the shelf. It is The
Picture Book of Sexual Love. He opens the book, revealing a
photo of a man nibbling a woman's breast. He positions
himself so as to be best picked up by the living room
scanner,then appears to read aloud from the book. We can see
that what he is reciting is not on the page.

                          BOB ARCTOR
             Any given man sees only a tiny portion

          It is no problem how to kill yourself
          in the circles in which I hang. When
          life becomes more and more depressing
          as you watch those you know falling
          apart from drug use, just take a large
          quantity of reds.

Freck places a bag of reds on the night table.

                       CHARLES FRECK
          Wash 'em down with a bottle of cheap

Freck pulls a bottle of Thunderbird from the counter of his
kitchenette and places it next to the pills.

          The hard part is choosing the correct

          archaeologists. So they know from
          which stratum you came and where your
          head was at when you did it.

Freck pulls a copy of "The Fountainhead" from his book
shelf, and places it face down and open on his bed.

          I have been a misunderstood superman
          rejected by the masses and so, in a
          sense, murdered by their scorn.

Freck places a typewritten letter next to the book.

                       CHARLES FRECK (CONT'D)
          Also, an unfinished letter to Exxon

          the system and achieve something by my
          death. Over and above what the death
          itself achieves.

Freck lies on the bed and readies himself for the suicide.
He unscrews the cap on the wine, tastes it, reconsiders.

                       CHARLES FRECK (CONT'D)
          Perhaps a connoisseur wine is in order

INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

Fred sits in his scramble suit watching a holo-tape. In it
Arctor is pulling a book from the shelf in his living room
and opening it. Fred zooms in to the title of the book. It
is The Picture Book of Sexual Love. Fred zooms back out to
take in the entire scene. Arctor recites, ostensibly from
the book, in a creaky, stagy way.

          Any given man sees only a tiny portion

                       FRED
          What the fuck is he talking about?

Fred glances at the other monitors. The only other activity
is in Luckman's room, where Luckman lies snoring, sprawled on
his floor, a bag of reds by his side.

          shucking us. The fucker!

Fred rises and paces in front of the console, keeping an eye
on the monitors, trying to figure what Arctor is up to. On
the other monitor, we see that Arctor's recitation has
roused Luckman, who sits up groggily and listens to the odd
German-English rant. Luckman picks up an axe, heads to the
bedroom door, and listens there intently. In the living
room, Arctor has put down his book and is sifting through
the pile of mail on the coffee table. He tosses a large
piece of junk mail at the trash can. It misses and crashes
against the wall. In his bedroom, Luckman hears the crash.
He stiffens suspiciously, sniffs the air, raises the axe,
ready to tear into the other room and attack. In the living
room, Arctor reads a piece of mail.

Luckman recognizes Arctor's voice, relaxes, puts down his
axe, opens the bedroom door, and exits his bedroom. He
appears on the living room monitor with Arctor.

          Hi, what's happening, Bob?

          I drove by the Maylar Microdot
          Corporation building.

Luckman casually drops into a chair across from Arctor.

          You're shitting me.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          One of the employees had evidently
          tracked the inventory out on the heel
          of his shoe. So they were all in the
          parking lot with many little
          magnifying glasses.

          They had a reward, but they lost that,
          too. It was a little tiny penny.

          Pathetic, soulless nitwits.

Fred sighs, fast-forwards the tape. He watches on the meter
until an hour's worth of tape has passed. He switches back
to play. Arctor is across the room now, sprinkling food
into a fish tank. Luckman is stretched out on the couch.

Fred fast forwards again for a long while, then puts the
machine back on play. Now Luckman is on the floor, cleaning
some grass. Arctor sits on the couch strumming a guitar.

          What's the sign look like?

Fred fast forwards until five hours have past, then goes

          Y'know how can you smuggle microdots
          into the U.S.? Barris told me. I'm
          not supposed to say, cause he's
          putting it in his book, "Simple Ways
          to Smuggle Objects into the U.S. and

          Oh, just tell me.

                       ERNIE LUCKMAN
          You smuggle it with a shipment of
          dope. Like heroin. The microdots are
          so small no one would notice.

          Well, you take a huge block of hash
          and you carve it in the shape of a
          man. Then you hollow out a little
          section and put a wind-up motor in.
          And a cassette tape. And just before
          it goes through customs, you wind it
          up and it walks up to the man, who
          says, "Do you have anything to
          declare?" and it says, "No, I don't,"

          are chewing hides when this six foot
          block of hash comes walking through
          the snow saying, "No, I don't" over

             don't have with me today, consits of
             tape recordings I have made of Robert
             Arctor's phone conversations.

             I believe it to be political in
             nature, and against this country.

                          FRED

             Substance D?

                          JIM BARRIS
             When you examine my evidence, you will
             undoubtedly conclude that Substance D
             is produced by a foreign nation
             determined to overthrow the U.S., and

             It's a competition between your   left
             and right hemispheres. Kind of    like
             you have two gas gauges on your   car,
             one says your tank is full, the   other
             says it's empty.

             Substance D. Damage has taken place
             in the normally dominant left
             hemisphere. The right hemisphere is
             attempting to compensate for the
             impairment. But the twin functions do
             not fuse. Now, we could perform a

             It's probably a functional impairment.

             small sections of both hemispheres

                       HANK
          By a process of elimination we were
          able to determine you're Bob Arctor.

                        FRED
                (horrified, confused)
          Arctor?    I'm Bob Arctor?  But he's
          ugly!

                       HANK
          Nevermind. It's not important.

          Get me a Donna Hawthorne at...
               (to Fred)
          Where does she work?

             Uh, Thompson Jewelers.   I'm Arctor?

                  (to Fred)
             We should probably get you to a
             hospital. Barris poisoned you. It
             was really Barris, we were interested
             in. That's why we set up the
             scanners. He's into something heavy
             and sick, and it has to do with guns.

                  (massaging temples)
             So, wait, you used me to get to Barris?

                          HANK
             We had to get to him, Bob. He's bad
             news. We couldn't tell you. We were
             afraid you'd spill the beans.

The intercom buzzes. Hank flips off his voice grid, picks up
the phone. It's the first time we hear his real voice.

                       HANK (CONT'D)
          Hey, Donna? This is a buddy of Bob's.
          He's in a bad way. I'm not jiving
          you. So could you pick him up, ...

Fred watches Hank, sounding like a head, looking like a blur.

INT. DONNA'S CAR - EARLY EVENING

Donna drives a sick Bob Arctor along a tree-lined road.

                       DONNA HAWTHORNE
          Before we go to New-Path, Bob, I
          thought maybe we'd drive into the
          hills, y'know, look at the city lights.

Donna waits for a response, there is none. She glances over
at Arctor. He rests his forehead against the window. She
sighs. Suddenly he begins to heave and vomit. Donna pulls
onto the shoulder, gets out of the car, hurries to the
passenger side to help Arctor.

EXT. TREE-LINED ROAD - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Arctor is on his hands and knees vomiting. Donna kneels
beside him, holding his forehead. He finishes.

                       DONNA HAWTHORNE
          Let's sit a few minutes.

                       BOB ARCTOR
               (so weakly)
          Do you have any hash?

Donna looks at him for a second, gets up, fusses around
under the passenger seat, and pulls out a piece of foil and
a pipe. She takes Arctor by the hand.

                       DONNA HAWTHORNE
          C'mon, let's get off the road a little
          bit. In case of cops.

Donna and Arctor walk through the trees in silence, arrive
at a clearing, from which the city lights can be seen. She
sits Arctor down, fills the pipe, lights it, and draws. She
passes the pipe to Arctor, but he is shivering and glassy-
eyed. A big, dark stain is forming on his pants.

          Here.

She inhales, leans forward to super-charge Arctor. But he
doubles over, clutching his stomach. He vomits and moans a
crazy song-like moan, attempting to comfort himself. Donna
touches his hand. But he is unaware of it. She sits on a
rock and stares at the city lights below.

                          DONNA HAWTHORNE (CONT'D)
             I guess we never know what's in store
             for us.

Arctor continues to clutch himself and moan.

                          DONNA HAWTHORNE (CONT'D)
             Did you know this dude Tony Amsterdam?

No response from Arctor.    Donna relights the pipe, inhales.

             After he saw God, he felt really good,
             for around a year. Then he felt
             worse than he had ever felt before in
             his life. Because one day it came to
             him, he was never going to see God
             again. He was going to live out the
             rest of his life, fifty years maybe,
             and see nothing but what he had always
             seen. He realized he was going to
             have to live on and on with no
             purpose. Just a lump of flesh
             grinding along, eating, drinking,
             working, sleeping, crapping --

                          BOB ARCTOR
             Just... like... the... rest... of us.

                          DONNA   HAWTHORNE
             That's what I told   him. We're all in
             the same boat, and   it doesn't freak us
             out. But he said,    "You don't know
             what I saw."

A spasm passes through Arctor, convulsing him.       Then:

                          BOB ARCTOR
             Did... he say what it was like?

                          DONNA HAWTHORNE
             Spars. Showers of colored sparks.
             In the air. Going up the wall.
             Wherever he looked. The whole world

             was a living creature. And there were
             no accidents. Everything fitted
             together to achieve something, some
             goal in the future. And there was a
             doorway. For a week he saw it
             wherever he looked. Always the same
             proportions, very narrow. Very
             pleasing. That's the word he used.
             He never entered it though. Just
             looked at it, surrounded by red and
             gold light, like the sparks had
             collected into lines. Then he never
             saw it again his whole, entire life.

                          BOB ARCTOR
             What was on the other side?

                          DONNA HAWTHORNE
             He said it was always nighttime.
             Moonlight and water. Nothing ever
             changed. Water like blank ink and a
             beach. He was sure it was ancient
             Greece, that the door was a weak link
             in time. Later when he couldn't see
             it anymore, he became so frustrated
             with the noise and lights and motion
             in this world. He'd tell everyone he
             met that he lost everything.

                          BOB ARCTOR
             I've lost everything.

                          DONNA HAWTHORNE
             There was a woman on the island. More
             like a statue. Of the Cyrenaican
             Aphrodite. In the moonlight. Pale
             and cold.

                          BOB ARCTOR
             He should've gone through while he had
             the chance. You only get one chance.

                          DONNA HAWTHORNE
             He didn't have the chance, Bob. It
             was a promise. Something to come.
             Something better a long time in the
             future. They show us trailers now.
                  (puts arm around Arctor)
             So we'll hold out.

          hold out.

Donna is quiet, sniffs in some snot.

                       DONNA HAWTHORNE
          You're a good man. You've been dealt
          a bad blow. But life isn't over for
          you. I care for you a lot. I wish...

Donna's voice cracks. She looks down at Arctor, who seems
only semi-conscious now. She continues to hold him in
silence, rocking him slightly, looking out at the city.

                       DONNA HAWTHORNE (CONT'D)
          You're a good and kind person. And
          this is unfair, but it has to be this
          way. Try to wait for the end.
          Sometime, a long time from now, you'll
          see the way you saw before.

A light shines into Donna's eyes. She squints at it, at the
silhouette of a uniformed cop behind the light.

                       COP
          Would you stand, you first, miss, and
          show me your identification, please?

Donna lays Arctor gently on the ground. She approaches the
cop, signals him away from the unconscious Arctor, and hands
him her wallet. He studies it in his flashlight beam.

The cop shines his flashlight into Donna's face, studies
her, hands her her wallet, then takes off. Donna approaches
the unconscious Arctor.

INT. NEW-PATH RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT

Arctor lies on the floor, curled up and shivering. Dried
vomit flecks his face. The stain on his pants is bigger
now. Two New-Path staff members stand surveying the
trembling Arctor. Donna kneels at his side.

             It's easy to win. Anybody can win.

Donna bends down close to Arctor's face and silently mouths
"good-bye." She rises and heads to the door. A staff
member drapes Arctor with a blanket as Donna exits. She
does not look back.
                                                            116.



INT. DONNA'S CAR - NIGHT

Donna drives her tiny MG on the freeway in heavy traffic
behind a huge Coca Cola truck. She picks a tape from the
show box in the back. It's Carole King's Tapestry. She
plugs it in and cranks it up loud, then pulls a pistol out
from under the dashboard. She unrolls the window, sticks
the pistol out, and begins firing at the Coke truck. She
hits it several times before the clip is emptied. Broken
Coke bottle glasses and brown liquid splatter her windshield.
This soothes her for a moment, but misery builds up in her
again almost instantly. To relieve it, she floors it and
smashes into the truck with all her might. The impact spins
the MG around. Tires shriek against fender as her car comes
to rest on the shoulder facing against traffic. Water pours
from her radiator. Her headlights dim. Donna gets out of
the car and looks at the Coke truck. It is still grinding
along, seemingly untouched. Motorists gape at Donna as they
crawl by. One guy unrolls his window.

                        MOTORIST
           You want a ride, miss?

She ignores him and heads back on foot to the exit ramp,
squinting into the headlights of the oncoming traffic.

Arctor and George stand in a dorm-style bathroom, with
several toilets. George hands the mop and pail to Arctor.

Arctor nods obediently, takes the pail to the sink,
sprinkles in some soap flakes, and begins to fill it with
water. He becomes transfixed with the foam forming in the
pail and the roar of the running water. After a while,
George speaks, sounding very far away.

INT. LOUNGE - DAY

Arctor sits with a paper cup of coffee. There are others in
the lounge, but they pay him no attention. He stares down
at his coffee, focused on the rising and swirling steam.
Jabbering is heard in the background.

Arctor sits on a folding chair in a semi-circle of residents
and a staff member. He stares down at his hands. A
portable blackboard is covered with scribbled words, such as
"Goals", "Responsibility", and "Community." A large coffee
urn percolates in the corner, making a "whoop-whoop" sound.
Arctor focuses on this sound, which frightens him.

                          NEW-PATH RESIDENT #3
             Living and unliving things are
             exchanging properties.

All murmer agreement except Arctor, who just looks down.

                       NEW-PATH RESIDENT #4
          That's because the drive of the
          unliving is stronger than the drive of
          the living.

Whoop-Whoop.    The coffee urn gets progressively louder.

                       NEW-PATH STAFFER
          So we are incorporating too much
          unliving drive within us. Now,
          activity does not necessarily mean
          life. Quasars are active, but not
          alive. A meditating monk is not dead.

INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT

The room is filled with sad-looking people at collapsible
tables eating dinner off trays. Arctor sits at a table by
himself, and stares down at his steaming soup.

INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY

A bunch of residents excitedly rifle through a cardboard box
of donated clothing. Arctor stands back from the box and
look at his feet. Mike, a short, stocky man with a pug face
slips into a shirt that looks like an American flag.

                          NEW-PATH RESIDENT #1
             Hey, Mike, you're one sharp dude!

          Thanks, man.

Mike fiddles with a belt with two metal rings for a buckle.
He can't cinch it.

                       MIKE (CONT'D)
               (cheerily)
          Oh, c'mon, you guys left me the belt
          nobody else could work!
               (to Arctor)
          You know how to do this, man?

Arctor reaches down and cinches the belt.

                       MIKE (CONT'D)
          Hey, thanks, buddy!

Mike touches Arctor's shoulder.    Arctor glances at the hand.

INT. MEETING ROOM - MORNING

Arctor sits in the center of the room. A circle of
residents yell at him. A Chinese girl is more shrill than
the others

                       CHINESE GIRL RESIDENT
          You know what he is? A kissy-face!
          You're a kissy-face!

          Can you fuck yourself? Can you fuck
          yourself?

The Executive Director smiles from the circle.

                       NEW-PATH RESIDENT #1
          Let's see you fuck yourself!

                       CHINESE GIRL RESIDENT
          The kissy-facy!

Another female resident flaps her arms and bulges her cheeks
in Arctor's face. The Chinese girls swivels around and
sticks her ass in Arctor's face.

                          CHINESE GIRL RESIDENT (CONT'D)
             Kiss my ass, kissy-facy! He wants to

Arctor shuts his eyes, but still hears the screaming. The
Executive Director clears his throat; the screaming subsides.

                      EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
          You pimp. You fuck. You dong. You
          shit. You turd. You snot. You
          asshole. You vomit. You wart.

We shift to Arctor's POV, looking out at the group and
hearing the Executive Director's chant.

                      EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
          You bile. You worm. You maggot. You
          pus. You running sore.

The chanting continues, but the actual words become
indecipherable. Mike's voice breaks the chant.

                      MIKE
               (gently)
          Bruce?

Arctor looks at Mike's compassionate face.

                          MIKE (CONT'D)
             Bruce, what's the matter? What
             brought you here? Can you tells us
             anything about yourself? Your past?

                           NEW-PATH RESIDENT #2

             pimp! You ass-kisser, you fuck!

                          BOB ARCTOR
             I am an eye. I am dead. I can only
             look at what is front of me.

                          EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
             You turd prick. You weakling. You
             puke. You suck-off. You snatch.

The Executive Director continues, but Arctor can't make out
the words as he surveys the cold, hard faces of the group.
Spade Weeks is among them.
                                                           121.



INT. NEW-PATH HALLWAY - DAY

Arctor walks down the hall, carrying his pail and mop. He
passes an open door. Inside is a brightly lit room in which
several children play. Arctor watches, transfixed.

INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING

The children sit at a table in an alcove off the main dining
area. Some of the smaller children sit in high chairs and
are being fed by old men. Arctor watches from outside the
alcove. Mike walks by. He smiles.

                       MIKE
          You like kids, Bruce?

                          BOB ARCTOR
          Yes.

                       MIKE
          You can eat with them if you like.

Arctor nods and sits at the end of the table.

                       MIKE (CONT'D)
          You can feed them in a month or two.
          After we're sure you won't hit them.

                          BOB ARCTOR
          Okay.

INT. DINING AREA - A BIT LATER

The table is mostly empty now. Only a couple of straggling
children and Arctor remain. The two old men are beginning
clean-up. One of the children goes, leaving only Arctor and
a wide-eyed little girl.

                       LITTLE GIRL
          What's your name?

Arctor doesn't respond.

                       LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
          I said, what's your name? My name is
          Thelma. Did you forget your name? If
          you forget your name, you can write it
          on your hand. Want me to show you how?

             No, that's my name. And that's a
             girl's name anyway. If I see you
             again, I'll give you a name. I'll
             make one up for you. 'kay?

             Yes, but my mommy may be leaving.
             She's thinking about taking us, me and
             my brother, and leaving. 'kay, Bye!

She runs off.    Arctor watches after the girl.

INT. NEW-PATH RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Arctor sits on a folding chair against the wall, staring at
his cup of coffee. Mike walks by in his bright new shirt.

SHOT OF NOTEBOOK DAPPLED WITH SUNLIGHT

kids laughing in background.    We scan the following words,
read offhandedly by Arctor.

                       BOB ARCTOR (V.O.)
          For now we see through a glass,
          darkly; but then face to face: now I
          know in part...

The camera pulls back to reveal that it's Donna reading the
journal. She's sitting at a picnic table outside a
McDonald's. Her eyes move back and forth across the page.
Near her, a group of children laugh and play on a
McDonaldland jungle gym.

                       BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...but then shall I know even as also
          I am known.

That's the last entry. She closes the notebook, takes a sip
of Coke, and watches the children play. A pick-up truck
pulls into the parking lot. Mike gets out, approaches
Donna's table, sits across from her. There's a silence,
then:

                          DONNA HAWTHORNE
             So are they paranoid about him?

                          MIKE
             No. He just sits there all day.
             There's really nothing to suspect.
             They can't get anything out of him
             during the game sessions.

Donna looks off for a moment, sadly.

                          DONNA HAWTHORNE
             Well, then, will he be able to act,
             when the time comes? Is anything left?

                          MIKE
             You never really know. A memory. A
             few charred brain cells flicker on.
             People like him are clacking insects.

Donna gets up and walks away.    Mike watches after her.

INT. NEW-PATH HALLWAY - DAY

Arctor opens the door to the room where he first saw the
children. In there now is an old woman trying to juggle. She
smiles at Arctor and he sees that she has almost no teeth.

                          OLD WOMAN
             Can you do this?

She throws the balls in the air to juggle and they fall back
onto her then bounce onto the floor. She stoops over,
spitting and laughing. Arctor is dismayed.

Arctor is pulling some cleaning supplies from the cabinet
under the sink. He notices something, picks it up, studies

someone cutting vegetables, and holds up the bone.

EXT. NAPA VALLEY FARM - DAY

It's a hot, bright day. A car drives in through the gate of
the razor-wire fenced farm, and raises dust as it heads
toward a cluster of wooden houses. It stops and Arctor
steps out, pulling a suitcase after him. He is met at the
car by the farm manager, a middle-aged man with a sun-
creased face. The car drives off.

             Mike Westaway recommended we give you
             a try on the farm. You're going to
             work here for a while.

                         BOB ARCTOR
             Okay.

                          FARM MANAGER
             I think you'll like it better here.

          You like mountains?

          I like mountains.

                       FARM MANAGER
          Beautiful mountains all around.

The manager points, but Arctor does not look.

                       FARM MANAGER (CONT'D)
          And the air is good.

                         BOB ARCTOR
          I like air.

                       FARM MANAGER
          Yeah, Bruce, we all like air. We
          really all do. C'mon, I'll show you
          your bunk and get you a hat to protect
          your head from the sun.

The manager leads Bruce to the bunkhouses.

INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY

It's crude with six cots.    The manager points to one of them.

                          FARM MANAGER
             This is where you sleep.

                          BOB ARCTOR
             Will I be seeing my friends?

             The farms are closed facilities, so
             they can't come visit. Besides you're
             not supposed to make any one-to-one
             relationships at New-Path. Didn't they
             teach you that?

          They had us memorize that as part of
          the New-Path creed.

The farm manager studies Arctor's sad, blank face.

                       FARM MANAGER
          But we usually send you back to your
          residence-of-origin for holidays. So
          you'll be visiting at Thanksgiving if
          you do good work.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          Thanksgiving.

                       FARM MANAGER
          All right then. What else?
               (looks around, points)
          Bathroom there. And you can turn on
          and off the light with this cord.

Arctor is no longer paying attention. He's caught a glimpse
of the mountains out the window, and stands transfixed.

                       FARM MANAGER (CONT'D)
          Mountains, Bruce, mountains.

EXT. CORNFIELD - DAY

Arctor, in a cap and carrying a pesticide sprayer, wades
through the stalks, checking for insect infestation. His
entire focus, his entire consciousness is directed at this
task. His hat blows off, and he bends to pick it up. As he
nears the ground, he notices a second crop growing
underneath, hidden by the corn. It's a small, bright blue
flower, and now that he's close to the ground, he can see it
planted everywhere. He squats there, transfixed. Someone
comes up behind him. It's the Executive Director of New-
Path. Arctor doesn't look up; he just stares at the flowers.

                          EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
             You're seeing the flower of the
             future, Bruce. But not for you.

          Why not for me?

                       EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
          You've had too much of a good thing.
          So get up and stop worshipping. This
          isn't your god anymore.

Arctor keeps staring. The Executive Director reaches down
and holds his open hand in Arctor's field of vision. Arctor
doesn't move his head; he just continues to stare, now at the
Executive Director's hand.

                          BOB ARCTOR
          Gone.     The flowers of spring are gone.

                       EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
          No. You simply can't see them.
          That's a philosophical problem you
          wouldn't comprehend. Epistemology --
          the theory of knowledge.

Arctor stares forever at the palm of the Executive
Director's rich, uncalloused hand, sees every crease.
Finally:

                       EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
          C'mon, back to work, Bruce.

                         BOB ARCTOR
          I saw.

The Executive Director chuckles, rises, and heads off.

                       EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
          Back to work, Bruce.

Now that the hand is gone, Arctor stares once again at the
blue flowers. The colors shift, grow more saturated.

                       FAR-AWAY VOICE
          I saw Substance D. I saw death rising
          from the earth itself, in one blue
          field.

In very slow motion, Arctor picks a blue flower, and puts it
inside his shoe. Shift back to normal speed and color.

                          BOB ARCTOR
             A present for my friends.
