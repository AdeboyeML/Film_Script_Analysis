          it's an American game.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Actually, Imlay, it's Scottish.
          PVT. KERNS, 19, an antsy fireplug of a guy, shakes his head.

          I'm jumpy? You're crawling up your
          own ass 'cause we train with Sgt.
          Nantz tomorrow.
          Correggio eyes Kerns. This was the wrong thing to say.
          One girl, smiling seductively, steps to Correggio, takes the
          golf club.from him.

          If this is the officer's course,
          what happens if they catch you out
          here?
          She readies to take a shot. Correggio snuggles up behind
          her, ostensibly teaching her how to swing.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          We can handle it, baby. We're
          experts at night maneuvers.
          Nearby, the SECOND GIRL chats up Adukwu.

          So you're from where again?
          Imlay pops a beer, interrupting.

          Nigeria. Adukwu's our corpsman.
          Like a medic. Saved Kerns' ass.

          Adukwu starts to talk, but Imlay interrupts again:

          Adukwu's a green card marine...

          Mom signed so he could join at 17.
          I'm looking after him since he
          don't know his ass from a hot rock.
          Lenihan suddenly ducks behind the Tahoe, throwing up.

          Hey, barfy. Grab your beer.
          toast.
          Everyone holds beers aloft. Lenihan joins in reluctantly.

          PVT. IMLAY
          To Lenihan. Who gets his first
          taste a' those hills tomorrow.
          He points off to the HILLY, DESOLATE TERRAIN near the course.

          Good luck, rookie.
          The marines chuckle knowingly, about to drink...
          Then they hear the sound of TIRES skidding to a halt. They
          look toward the hillside, see the WHITE HELMETS'of MPs.

          Lenihan staggers, knees trembling, weaving back and forth.
          Then his foot comes down on a ROCK IN THE TRAIL. His ANKLE
          GIVES WAY. Lenihan falls, yells in pain, grabbing his ankle.

          He's not injured. He twisted his
          goddamn ankle.
          Nantz' looks over the men, sweaty, covered with grime.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We are marines. "Can't" is not the
          code we live by. "Can't" gets
          marines killed. Do things the
          right way, the marine way, maybe
          you get to come home... Maybe your
          buddy gets to come home.
          Correggio stares back sullenly on this.

          A HUMVEE and TWO FIVE-TON TRUCKS
          Speeding up the dirt road toward the marines.
          Everyone is silent as they watch the HUMVEE and TRUCKS pull
          up... This is not normal.
          1st Sergeant Roy hops from the Humvee, shouting:

          Marines! Into the trucks. Now.

          The camera PANS back to the REPORTER, silently staring out.

          Crowded with MARINES, including squad leader Grayston, all

          PEOPLE RACE AWAY, plodding along the sand in hopeless flight

          GUNSHOTS ring out, police shooting at the INDISTINCT FIGURES

          The NEWS CAMERA suddenly cuts to BLACK. In black, all we

          EXT. CAMP PENDLETON AIR FIELD - MINUTES LATER

          All activity has doubled, a frantic energy now. TRUCKS race
          along the perimeter of the air field, massive CH-46
          HELICOPTERS TAKE OFF loaded with MARINE UNITS...
          The 1st platoon stands together, Lt. Martinez addressing them
          as ANOTHER CH-46 HELICOPTER is landing nearby.

          As you probably heard, Sgt. Nantz
          will be taking over for Sgt. Beck.
          We're lucky to have him aboard.
          The CH-46 helicopters TOUCHES DOWN now, its massive,, bay door
          opening for them. Martinez barks:

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Let's move, men!,
          The platoon grabs gear, runs for the helicopter, climbing
          aboard. Nantz hurries them along, grabbing packs, throwing
          them on after the marines.
          Then he grabs Correggio's pack, about to throw the pack on...
          Correggio grabs it back from Nantz.
          Nantz turns, faces off with Correggio.

          SGT. NANTZ
          You got something to get off your
          chest, Corporal?

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          No. It's cool, Sergeant. You got

          Beat.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Get aboard, Corporal.
          Correggio jumps into the chopper.

          INT. CH-46 TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - LATER

          IN FLIGHT. The marines, helmets on, packs between their
          knees, sit facing each other.
          The sound of the CH-46's massive rotors is deafening. Some
          shout over the din, too nervous to remain quiet.

          What the hell you think those

          Correggio looks down at his hand... Sees the GIRL'S PHONE
          NUMBER written on it.
          ACROSS THE DECK, Martinez huddles with Nantz, MAP in hand.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Santa Monica airport's our Forward
          Operating Base. We get some Cobras
          and F-18s in the air, we'll have
          plenty of support.
          Nantz nods. They're flying into the unknown and Martinez
          seems as nervous as the younger men.
          Kerns leans in to Nantz, desperately needing reassurance.

          PVT. KERNS
          How many a' them you think there
          are, Sergeant?
          Nantz just stares out, stone-faced.

          INT. CH-46 TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - LATER

          The marines are glued to the windows, shocked by what they're
          seeing as the chopper BANKS toward Venice/Santa Monica:
          FIRES raging from various explosions. In the distance,
          MASSIVE LINES of TRAFFIC moving away from the ocean.
          The STREETS bordering the beach look deserted-- Except for
          the BODIES dotting the landscape.
          Nantz looks at Martinez, who is hunched over, scribbling a
          LETTER. Martinez folds it, then writes the name ANNA on it.
          We realize it's a letter in the event of his death.
          Martinez stares at the letter. Then carefully tucks it away.

          The airport is being quickly transformed into a military
          base: MILITARY VEHICLES line the runway, more being driven
          from a nearby CARGO PLANE.
          The CH-46 LANDS.
          The platoon JUMPS OUT, squad leaders forming the men up as...
          Nantz and Martinez salute a CAPTAIN heading to them as F-18
          JETS take off, screaming overhead.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Lt. Martinez, sir. 1st Platoon of
          the 2/5.

                         CAPTAIN
          Situation is as follows: Most of
          Santa Monica is cleared of
          civilians. We've got a defensive
          line at Lincoln Boulevard a mile
          from the ocean...
          He points out LINCOLN BOULEVARD on a MAP, the OCEAN close by.

                         CAPTAIN
          At 9 p.m., everything from Lincoln
          to the ocean will be bombed.
          Martinez blanches.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          We're... leveling it, Captain?

                         CAPTAIN
          We've got an infestation of god-
          knows-what. It's an enemy ground
          force only, they have no aircraft.
          So our jets'll tear 'em a new
          asshole. We will rule the air.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          But... there must be civilians
          stuck behind the line, sir.

                         CAPTAIN
          That's affirm. We're getting
          distress calls, sending squads out.
          He points to the MAP, to streets running from Lincoln Blvd.

          Your mission, Lieutenant, take your
          1st squad, proceed west from
          Lincoln to a community center
          located here...
          (pointing to map)
          In a park on 10th and Bay Street.
          Police were using it as an
          evacuation point. They got
          overrun. Get there, any civilians
          you find, get 'em back here to the
          FOB for evacuation. You got three
          hours.
          Another CHOPPER is LANDING. Nantz yells over the sound:

          SGT. NANTZ
          What do we know about these things,
          Captain?

                         CAPTAIN
          Not much. But police have shot
          'em. They bleed.
          The captain, hurrying to the next chopper, yells back:

                         CAPTAIN
          It's our job to kill 'em.

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          Nantz and Martinez are double-timing with the 1st squad (Cpl.
          Grayston, Correggio and Kerns, Stavrou and Harris, Imlay and
          Lenihan, Mottola and Guerrero, Simmons and Adukwu).
          As they approach Lincoln, they slow, eyes widening.
          REVERSE to see what they're staring at:
          LINCOLN BOULEVARD. Being fortified into a defensive line.
          MARINES are setting up sand-bagged MACHINE GUN NESTS in a
          parking lot fronting a nail shop and a China Express.
          Other MARINES hunker behind barricades in front of a Goodyear
          Tire Store, firing MORTARS toward the ocean.
          RUBBLE. BURNING BUILDINGS. Smashed-in storefronts. Cars
          CRASHED at intersections, the echoing WAIL of CAR ALARMS.
          Pockets of CIVILIANS are being waved forward by MARINES. A
          LITTLE GIRL with a Smurf backpack is rushed across Lincoln.

          running. Focus on the mission.
          We're gonna get to that community
          center and get those people safe.
          A COBRA ATTACK HELICOPTER screams overhead, firing into the
          distance. Martinez turns to Nantz, shouting over the din:

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Something to add, Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          (to the squad)
          Kill anything that's not human.

          EXT. 10TH STREET - LATER

          Nantz and Martinez lead the squad FROM LINCOLN onto 10th St.
          Various STRUCTURE FIRES are visible in the distance.
          The squad passes a FIRE TRUCK crashed against a fence, engine
          idling. FIREMEN lie near their hose lines, dead.
          Suddenly... BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Deep, deafening sounds
          exploding in the distance.
          The ground SHAKES from massive AFTERSHOCKS. Billowing SMOKE
          rumbles from the west. Ash rains,down, the sky turns black.
          The squad hunkers down, panicked looks exchanged.

          PVT. KERNS
          What the hell is that?!

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Keep it together. Watch your
          angles.
          The aftershocks fade. Ominous quiet again.
          The squad continues DOWN THE STREET.

          THICK SMOKE hangs in the air. The lack of visibility is
          clearly adding to the marines' fright.
          Numerous SHAPES become visible in the smoke.
          As the squad approaches slowly, the shapes become clear...
          BODIES splayed in the street.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Cherise and I were supposed to
          register at Bed, Bath & Beyond

          CPL. STAVROU
          Think you're gonna be busy, bro.
          Nantz points his rifle into a CRASHED PICKUP TRUCK. A BODY
          is slumped beneath the wheel.
          Simmons comes up behind Nantz. Peers into the truck:
          Sections of the BODY appear almost dissolved by a white
          phosphorous-like substance.

          A SHAPE is moving to them through the smoke.
          The marines aim, about to fire just as the smoke clears...
          A DOG. Standing there, staring mournfully at them.
          Nervous chuckles now. Correggio sidles up to Kerns.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Relax, man.
          Kerns just shoots him a look. The squad moves on.

          Something spooked that dog...
          Then Kerns sees the SMOKE SWIRLING DOWN THE SIDE STREET...
          As if something is racing through it.
          Kerns breaks formation, SPRINTS DOWN THE SIDE STREET, FIRING.

          PVT. KERNS

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          What'd you see?!
          Suddenly, the INDISTINCT FORM of an ALIEN CREATURE appears
          through the smoke, moving FAST down the side street.
          Kerns is ready, FIRING. The others react, FIRING as well.
          The ALIEN FORM is blasted, DROPPING into the smoke.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
          Everyone stops firing. Nantz gets in Kerns' face.

          One enemy runs and you break
          discipline and chase it?!

          The MARINES FIRE back into the THICK SMOKE. But the enemy
          attack keeps INCREASING in ferocity.
          One PROJECTILE hits a wall above Lenihan. It EXPLODES, some
          kind of liquid splashing onto him. Lenihan grimaces.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Ahh, shit! It's burning!
          His HELMET is being eaten away by the liquid. Imlay is
          immediately at Lenihan's side, pulling the helmet off.

          A moment. SILENCE. Nantz looks at the heavy FOLIAGE, dense

          THE REST OF THE SQUAD battles fiercely.
          An alien PROJECTILE slams into Cpl. Grayston'S ARM. The
          SPRAY OF LIQUID bubbles out from the wound.
          Then something grabs Grayston through the bushes...
          Nantz sticks his SHOTGUN into the bushes, fires. BOOM. And
          Grayston is suddenly free. Nantz drags him into...

          A SWIMMING POOL, its water gently lapping. A GARAGE nearby.
          Lenihan, startled by the SOUND of ALIENS RUNNING in the alley
          behind the house, takes cover BY THE GARAGE.
          He struggles to remain calm. Then the sound FADES. He
          waits. Silence. Lenihan starts to edge,out as...

          breathing turns shallow-- from loss of blood and from fear.
          Lenihan sees the BRANCHES of a bush SWAYING outside the
          window, as if something just brushed past it.

          drifting smoke at the garage, he's unaware that BEHIND him...

          A SHADOWY ALIEN FORM IS RISING FROM THE POOL.
          Lenihan doesn't see it, but he senses it. He turns, FIRES...
          A SPLASH as the shadowy alien figure is blasted back INTO THE
          POOL, disappearing under the water.
          Quickly, nervously, he loads another mag, edging to the pool.
          He peers over the pool edge...
          An indiscernible DARK FORM lays on the bottom of the pool.
          Lenihan is transfixed a moment. Then he raises his rifle to

          CRUMPLES to the ground. Guerrero stands, blind, helpless.
          Panic. The marines spin, searching for targets.

          LT. MARTINEZ

          Stavrou hoists Simmons as the marines run off, FIRING to
          cover their retreat, as...
          The SILHOUETTES of DARK ALIEN FORMS are visible on distant
          rooftops, watching the rifle squad disappear down the street.

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          Nantz, Martinez and the rest of the squad hustle silently
          through the street, supporting their wounded. They take
          cover behind cars, peering out to see...
          The PARK in the distance. A wide open FIELD with a COMMUNITY
          CENTER BUILDING on the far side.
          There are distant sounds of warfare, but the area here seems
          strangely quiet.
          Then, out of the smoke, an IMAGE APPEARS... Something MOVING

          AT THEM...
          The marines all shift, aim forward, about to blast away as...
          FOUR MARINES come into view, moving ghost-like.
          Nantz signals with his flashlight. The marines hurry over,
          silently falling behind the cars.

          We were on the street, like, ten
          minutes and they ambushed us. As

          A large FIELD stretches from the street to a squat BUILDING,
          the COMMUNITY CENTER.

          A MAN, JOE RINCON, 45, jacket and tie, behind her.

          There's five of us. Three kids.
          Nantz is immediately moving.

          He pushes past the adults, sees TWO GIRLS AND A BOY, 8-10.

          The marines run up to the chopper with the wounded. INSIDE
          THE MEDEVAC they see WOUNDED laid across the helicopter's
          cabin. A CREWMAN in the medevac yells over the din:

          Imlay and Stavrou get Simmons and Grayston on.
          Mottola helps Guerrero in, squeezing his hand.

          Nantz, Martinez and Harris run to the chopper with the kids.
          The marines around the medevac are screaming up at it, trying
          to hold it, but to no avail.
          The CHOPPER GAINS ALTITUDE as suddenly...

          LIGHTS are ADVANCING from a street leading to the field.
          As the SOUND and LIGHTS BUILD, Nantz runs to the other
          marines to get them off that field.
          He pulls on them, urging them to the COMMUNITY CENTER doors.
          They REACH THE COMMUNITY CENTER, fall into it just as...
          Glowing through the heavy cover of smoke... The STROBING
          LIGHTS of some strange ALIEN AIRCRAFT zooming overhead.

          The dazed marines begin COVERING doors and hallways. We see
          in their FACES that it's a very different fight now.
          Nantz turns, can see the MEDEVAC ABLAZE out a window. His
          solemn stare hints at a growing desperation.
          Martinez steps up to him, looks out. Quietly:

          Marines on post, watching various windows and doors.
          Imlay kneels by the kids, who look devastated by the day's
          events. Imlay wets a rag with water from his canteen, wiping
          the dust and dirt from the kids' faces.
          The younger girl, KIRSTEN, 8, begins crying. She suddenly
          hugs Imlay.

          An ALIEN BODY. On the ground nearby. Ripped by bullets.
          They step to it cautiously, realizing... IT'S NOT QUITE DEAD!

          What's the plan, Lieutenant?

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Mission is still to get the
          civilians to the Forward Operating
          Base. We've got a battalion there,
          all that firepower... I was
          thinking, I saw a bus couple of
          blocks back on 11th...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Maybe we should stay on foot.
          Martinez looks at Nantz. Then opens a MAP, pointing to
          'Santa Monica Airport' on it.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          The FOB is here, at the airport...
          That's miles to cover with those
          kids... And those bombs are gonna
          drop in a little more than an hour.
          (thinking, deciding)
          We've got to move fast.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We have no radio contact, nothing
          to let us know the best route to
          take... And a bus is a big target.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          I made the call, Sergeant. It's my
          responsibility.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Harris, Stavrou, lieutenant needs
          recon on a.bus. It was abandoned
          two blocks south off 11th...

          LT. MARTINEZ
          If it runs, get it back here.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Can you hotwire a bus?

          CPL. HARRIS
          (gestures to Stavrou)
          He's from Jersey, sergeant.
          A nod from Nantz on this.

          EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER ROOFTOP - MINUTES LATER

          Correggio and Kerns are surveying the street. Correggio
          pulls the RADIO up, talks quietly into it:

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Stavrou, Harris...

          INT. EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER - SAME

          Stavrou and Harris peer out an EXTERIOR DOOR as they hear
          Correggio (V.0.) from the RADIO:

           CPL. CORREGGIO (V.0.)
           .you're clear down 11th Street.
          They exchange a quick glance.

          Every day a holiday, buddy...

          CPL. HARRIS
          .every meal a feast.
          They slip outside, running off silently.

          Correggio and Kerns watch Harris and Stavrou run down the

          INT. SIDE ROOM - LATER

          Adukwu and Michele, scalpels in hand, hover over the alien
          body. Its thick leathery skin has been sliced open.
          Martinez and Nantz observe, Imlay on post nearby.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          How's it going?

                         ADUKWU
          Well, Lieutenant, I'm a medic, Dr.
          McDermott's a vet... We weren't
          sure who was most qualified to cut
          this thing open.
          Martinez smiles.

                         ADUKWU
          Look. It's been surgically
          modified...
          He pulls tissue aside, revealing where the alien's 'gun' is
          attached to its arm.

                         ADUKWU
          Part of its arm has been amputated
          to fit this weapon.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Talk about commitment to cause.
          Adukwu examines a VENTED CAP just to the right of where the
          alien's 'heart' would be. Thick, fleshy veins run from it.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          What is that thing?

          PVT. IMLAY
          He's from Nigeria, Lieutenant. Not
          a different solar system.
          Nantz looks over at Imlay.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Thank you, private.
          Adukwu twists the cap. It comes free, revealing...
          A GELATINOUS ORGAN. Slimy, viscous fluid seeping from it..
          Everyone steps back, reacting to the putrid smell.

          Everyone steps back except Michele, that is. Unfazed, she
          takes her scalpel, makes an INCISION across the organ.

          PVT. IMLAY
          I'm gonna puke. Swear to God, I'm
          gonna puke!

          Whatever you do, do it quietly,
          Imlay.

          EXT. STREET - SAME

          Stavrou forces the door of a METRO BUS open, climbs INTO THE
          BUS, ducking below the steering wheel as...
          Harris covers, staring off to the FAR STREET. Tree branches
          there cast LONG SHADOWS which sway with the breeze. Then...
          The indistinct FORM of an ALIEN scout appears in the shadows.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Hey, Stavs...

          CPL. STAVROU
          Relax. First thing I wired was a
          school bus. Trying to impress this
          Betty. She had a huge rack...

          CPL. HARRIS
          Enemy scout. Move your ass.
          Stavrou doesn't look up. Just works diligently.

          Don't rush genius.

          EXT. ROOF - SAME

          Correggio and Kerns remain still, peering into the distance.

          PVT. KERNS
          Shit. You seeing what I'm seeing?
          Correggio pulls BINOCULARS...

          Appearing and disappearing through the smoke and trees.
          Then the POV THROUGH BINOCULARS PANS to pick-up...
          The BUS. Nearby. In the path of the alien movement.
          Correggio grabs the RADIO. Says:

          Suddenly, a loud BANG rings out below them.

          PVT. KERNS
          What the hell was that?!
          They exchange glances with the other marines across the roof.
          All four move quickly, converging on one side of the
          building, look down the side of it...
          An EXTERIOR DOOR leading into the center is BROKEN OPEN.

          INT. COMMUNITY CENTER SIDE ROOM - SAME

          Michele finishes her incision, carefully PEELS A SECTION OF

          THE ORGAN BACK.
          Something vaguely METALLIC is revealed within it.
          As Michele touches her scalpel to it, it SPARKS.
          Then starts rhythmically GLOWING.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Looks like it's receiving a
          signal...
          Suddenly, the ORGAN CONVULSES rapidly. Expanding,
          contracting.
          Nantz sees the ALIEN'S GUN VIBRATING now, the whole arm
          TWITCHING, spreading through the alien's body like a seizure.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          This thing's still alive!
          Nantz pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE, thrusting it DEEP INTO
          THE ORGAN, twisting viciously.

          Mottola appears in the room, a sense of controlled panic.

          INT. HALLWAY / COMMUNITY CENTER - SECONDS LATER

          The marines step from the side room with Michele. They peer
          up and down the dark hallway, listening...
          OTHER DOORS along the hall take on an ominous presence now.

          the SAWS up front and take off with
          these kids.

          BUT NANTZ IS OUT OF THE BUS.

          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz runs down the street with the radio under his arm.
          Heading toward a GAS STATION.
          Nantz glances back, sees... The ALIEN AIRCRAFT SEARCHING the
          street below, getting closer and closer to the bus as...

          INT. BUS (STOPPED) - CONTINUOUS

          Amy and Kirsten pressed under seats, Michele covering them
          up... Hector closing his eyes in his dad's arms...
          The marines duck low, gripping their weapons.
          They hear the aircraft coming closer, almost above them.
          LIGHT starts shining through the windows as...

          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz, almost to the gas station, wraps the pony tail holder
          around the radio, looks back to see.
          The ALIEN AIRCRAFT STOP, HOVERING OVER THE BUS!
          Shining lights into it, scanning, scanning...

          INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

          Hector's eyes widen, staring up at the light. Michele pulls
          the girls in closer, trying to calm them, herself.

          Nantz presses the "Push to Talk" button on the radio as...
          The alien craft suddenly TURNS in NANTZ' DIRECTION.
          Nantz wraps the pony tail holder around the radio, keeping
          the button on it depressed so it's SENDING A CONSTANT SIGNAL.
          He slides the radio toward one of the GAS PUMPS...
          Keeps moving, diving BEHIND A VAN across the street.
          Nantz peers around it, sees...
          The alien aircraft HEADING FOR THE GAS STATION, descending.
          Nantz slams a grenade into the launcher on his M-16.
          The alien aircraft zooms at the gas pumps, its unearthly hum
          growing louder and louder as...

          NANTZ FIRES THE GRENADE.
          The GAS PUMP EXPLODES! A MASSIVE FIREBALL HITS THE ALIEN

          CRAFT!
          Nantz flattens himself to the street as...
          The ALIEN AIRCRAFT, trailing smoke and flames, thunders out
          of control RIGHT OVER HIM...
          Then CRASHES into a building... BLOWING APART!

          INT. BUS (STOPPED) - CONTINUOUS

          Marines ducking, civilians screaming as...
          DEBRIS from the alien ship BLOWS OVER THE BUS, burning pieces
          falling to the ground...

          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz runs out from behind the van, checks the remains of the
          burning alien aircraft, rifle raised.
          NO ALIEN inside. The ship is a DRONE.
          Nantz takes this in, then starts back for the bus.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (TO MARTINEZ)
          That ship was an unmanned drone,
          lieutenant. And that alien we cut
          open had something in it receiving
          signals... They must have one
          helluva command and control center.
          Martinez pulls his map out, eyes Nantz.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          That was some real John Wayne shit,
          Sergeant.
          Nantz tries to shrug it away. But Martinez nails him.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Don't do it again. We work as a
          team, Sergeant. We clear?
          Beat. Nantz nods.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're clear, Lieutenant.
          Nearby, Imlay whispers to Mottola:

          PVT. IMLAY
          Who's John Wayne?
          Martinez looks up from the map, turns to Stavrou.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Take the freeway, Corporal. Cuts
          half the distance off our drive.

          Sir. We get on that freeway, we'll
          be exposed...

          LT. MARTINEZ
          It doesn't seem like we're much
          safer out here. We've got two

          one that gets us there fastest.

          The bus bangs past a few stalled cars, cruising up a ramp,
          onto the freeway.

          INT. BUS (MOVING) - 10 FREEWAY - SAME

          Martinez and Nantz crouch near the front, keeping watch.
          From this elevated vantage point on the freeway, the big
          picture emerges IN THE DISTANCE:
          The BATTLE FRONT is moving east... A DEFENSIVE LINE of TANKS
          is visible, blasting away at aliens.
          SWARMS of DRONE AIRCRAFT engage F-18 JETS flying at them.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Jesus...

                         (TO STAVROU)
          Double time, Corporal.
          The bus barrels forward, careening BETWEEN CARS, knocking
          some out of the way.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Take the next exit. Head south.
          We're two clicks from the FOB.
          The bus drives onto the shoulder, past the sea of abandoned
          cars, heading to the off-ramp.
          Nantz appears uneasy. They are exposed on this freeway and
          he doesn't like it.
          He MOVES TO THE BACK, peering out windows, checking angles.
          Michele looks up as he passes, sees a GASH on Nantz' head.

                         MICHELE
          Your head, Sergeant. You're
          bleeding.
          Nantz touches his head, looks at the blood. He wipes it on
          his pants. Michele smiles at him softly.

                         MICHELE
          Bet when you woke up this morning,
          you didn't think your day would end

          of the way...

          TWO 2nd SQUAD MARINES are instantly killed, blown clear out
          of the hole. Civilians screaming...
          Stavrou hits the gas, BACKING THE BUS UP the best he can.
          An ILLUMINATION heading toward them... BOOM!
          Another projectile DESTROYS AN OVERPASS behind the bus!
          Trapped. And ALIENS are STREAMING AT THEM in the distance.
          Stavrou works the shift, grinding gears, gunning the bus...
          BEHIND A CONCRETE DIVIDER close by the COLLAPSED OFF-RAMP.
          The off-ramp now dangles precariously: a 15-foot cliff-face
          of missile-scarred concrete and re-bar.
          Martinez looks over to Nantz, not sure what to do...

          SGT. NANTZ
          (to Martinez, low)

          roof, CLIMBING OUT, taking position on the bus' roof.
          The rest of the marines EXIT THE BUS. Nantz grabs Adukwu.

          Stay here with the civilians. As
          soon as Stavrou gives the sign, get

          Stavrou descends down the collapsed off-ramp, negotiating the
          fractured, angled slab of roadway.
          Kerns covers him above, from the freeway.
          Stavrou hits the ground, securing the area. He looks up at

          RUNNING ACROSS THE FREEWAY...
          To the off-ramp. It seems like a long way off. They run

          Mottola's body starts to convulse. Rincon stops, tries to
          control him. Sees Mottola's eyes rolling back in his head.
          Then Rincon is horrified when he looks up to see...
          ALIENS RACING FORWARD... Heading his way!
          Moving in and out of the sea of abandoned cars.
          Rincon redoubles his efforts, pulling on the injured Mottola.
          As he does, he looks back up to see...
          The ALIENS ARE ALMOST ON TOP OF HIM now as...
          BANG! The first alien is shot by...
          Nantz, suddenly there, M-16 poised.
          Rincon looks from Nantz to... MORE ALIENS coming at them!
          No choice-- Rincon PICKS UP the injured Mottola's RIFLE.
          Scared, but resolute. He looks at Nantz.

                         RINCON

          It's set to fire in three round
          bursts. We're low, so don't waste

          And give 'em hell.
          Rincon sights down the barrel of his rifle at ONE ALIEN in

          BY THE FREEWAY OFF-RAMP

          BAM! BAM! BAM! Rincon FIRES, blowing the alien away.
          Adukwu looks up, realizing Rincon just saved him.
          He,meets eyes with Rincon, who stares back, stunned a moment
          by his own actions. Adukwu immediately shouts a. warning.:

          PVT. ADUKWU
          Keep fighting!
          Rincon snaps back, turns to fire... A moment too late as...
          THUMP! Rincon is HIT. He falls.
          Adukwu grabs Rincon, sees the pain and fear in the civilian's
          eyes. Adukwu rips open packages of QuickClot, begins
          spreading the fast-clotting powder on Rincon's wounds as...,

          EXT. BUS ROOF

          Harris and Imlay firing... From this height, they can see the
          full expanse of freeway:
          More WAVES OF ALIENS coming, using abandoned cars as cover...

          CPL. HARRIS
          Shit, Lieutenant, we're gonna be
          overrun !

          BY THE BUS / ON FREEWAY
          Nantz and Martinez exchange a desperate glance on this. Then
          Nantz. looks around, assessing the situation.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Gimme two of your smoke cannisters!
          Martinez pops two canisters off, hands them to Nantz.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Take someone to cover you!.
          Nantz turns, sees Correggio. Then he turns the other way,
          sees Kerns.

          I'm not worried about fightin' next
          to you, Kerns. Now let's go.
          A slight smile from Kerns on this as he follows Nantz...
          Who sprints low, scurrying between cars... 10... 20... 30
          yards closer to the enemy.
          Nantz and Kerns arrive at a large SUV.
          Kerns ducks low, covering Nantz. Nantz crouches, opens the
          gas tank...
          Unscrews the fuse from the smoke grenade body, tossing the
          canister aside... pulls the pin... flips the 'spoon' off...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Get ready to move on my word.
          Nantz holds the fuse over the open gas cap.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Now!
          Nantz drops the fuse into the gas tank.
          They go RUNNING BACK TOWARD THE BUS as...
          B0000M! The SUV EXPLODES in a ball of flames!
          Nantz and Kerns dive BEHIND ANOTHER VEHICLE, Kerns crouching,
          laying cover fire. Nantz pulls a fuse.

          SGT. NANTZ

          PVT. KERNS
          (pops up, fires)

          Nantz drops the fuse, they run... The CAR EXPLODES in flames!
          Nantz runs to ANOTHER CAR, making sure Kerns is with him.

          Soon as they come through, blow 'em
          back to hell!
          The first alien appears THROUGH THE BURNING CORRIDOR. Imlay
          blows it away! Harris blows away the next... It's working!;.

          EXT. FREEWAY BY BUS

          Nantz and Kerns fall back BEHIND THE BUS, next to Martinez,
          Correggio and a 2nd squad marine.
          Along with Harris and Imlay on the bus roof, they are the
          only ones left holding the aliens off. All FIRE forward as...
          More and more aliens begin pouring through, braving the
          flames... Into the line of fire...
          Many aliens go down. But because of their sheer numbers,
          few start to make it through, FIRING BACK at the marines.
          Martinez sees the 2nd SQUAD MARINE go down in front of him.
          Martinez rushes to his side... HE'S DEAD.
          Martinez rises to shoot and...THWUMMP. Martinez is hit.
          He looks down, blood running over his belt. Shock on his
          face. He's been shot in the stomach.
          Martinez looks around...
          The remaining aliens now only cars apart from them.
          Two forces taking cover behind spraying glass and punctured
          metal, firing directly into the faces of their enemy.
          Martinez pulls himself together, struggling over to Nantz.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Pull the men back... Pull 'em all
          back now, Sergeant. I'm gonna stay
          and cover.

          Nantz looks at Martinez about to say something. Sees the
          blood draining from his stomach, down his legs.
          Nantz grabs Martinez, pulling him up.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Lieutenant. We gotta get you outta
          here. No way we're leavin' you...

          I'm not leaving you here to die.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          That's not your call, Sergeant.
          Now get your men outta here...
          He pushes Nantz away, looks around, the chaos slowing down
          for him. He reaches into his vest...
          Martinez hands the LETTER we saw earlier to Nantz. A moment
          between them.
          Nantz nods, then spins, moving, yelling to the men.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're pulling back. Head to the
          lower street, now! NOW!
          Nantz runs toward the edge of the destroyed off-ramp, laying
          cover as the men head down.
          Harris and Imlay slide down off the roof of the bus, joining
          the others running to the off-ramp. Correggio sees...
          MARTINEZ STAYING BEHIND, shooting at the aliens, drawing
          their fire.

          Keep movin', corporal! Go!
          All the men climb DOWN THE OFF-RAMP. Nantz turns to go back
          to get the Lieutenant himself, sees...
          Martinez hauling himself toward the rear of the bus.

          for Nantz to see...
          Then unscrews the fuse, pops open the gas cap of the bus...

          Nantz turns, dives for cover as...
          Martinez drops the fuse into the gas tank...
          A flash of fear across his face as... Aliens are on him as...

          His eyes wide at Martinez's sacrifice, the burden now on him,
          he's in charge of the men, the civilians...

          marines and civilians BEHIND THE ABANDONED VAN. He sees
          Adukwu working on Rincon, Hector crying in Michele's arms.

          A frantic dash through the street, rubble and fires all over.
          Marines carry the kids. HECTOR, in Harris' arms, head
          swiveling, eyes searching for his dad, sees... Imlay and
          Adukwu CARRYING rINCON, who appears lifeless.

          INT. BIG 5 SPORTING GOODS STORE - CONTINUOUS

          A dark, empty store. The marines burst in, aiming rifles.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Tighten this place down. See if we
          can establish communications. Hard
          line only! Nothing wireless.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Listen, we're out of the bomb
          zone... But when they fall, we will
          definitely be rocked. Make sure
          the kids are prepared for that.
          Hector suddenly breaks free, rushing forward.as Imlay and
          Adukwu enter with Rincon, setting him down.
          Nantz pulls blankets from a nearby rack, covering Rincon. As
          he does, we see a glimpse of Rincon's BLOOD-SOAKED CLOTHING.
          He is very pale. Blood flecks his lips.
          Hector stares into his father's face, eyes filling. Rincon
          touches Hector's face lightly.

          SGT. NANTZ
          It'll be okay. We'll get your dad
          fixed up.
          But when Hector looks to Nantz on this, he can't meet the
          boy's gaze. Hector can see this isn't the truth.

                         RINCON
          Listen to me, son. I'm not going
          to make it.

          I know. But you have to. Now wait
          with Michele a minute. Let me talk
          to the sergeant.
          Reluctantly, Hector allows Michele to lead him away.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Mr. Rincon, we can take you and...
          Rincon turns to Nantz, steel-eyed.

          MR. RINCON
          Don't waste time, sergeant. You

          No. You can't take me.
          Nantz is silent, at a loss.

          ACROSS THE STORE
          Imlay stares at a CLOCK on the wall, calls out:

          PVT. IMLAY
          Four minutes and those bombs drop,
          Sergeant.
          NANTZ looks over at this. But his expression is blank.
          He turns back to Rincon, who's staring straight into him.

                         RINCON
          I keep playing it over in my
          head... If I'd done things
          differently... Maybe I could have
          gotten Hector out earlier.

          SGT. NANTZ
          You can't look back. You make the
          best decision you can...
          A beat.

          Nantz looks like he has the weight of the world on him.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I promise.
          Rincon holds out his hand. Nantz takes it, meeting his gaze.

                         RINCON
          I'm trusting you with the only
          thing I have in this world.
          Nantz stares, nods.

          an INTERNET CONNECTION on its screen.
          The marines crowd around, reading the ominous HEADLINE...
          "GLOBAL INVASION -- Alien 'Creatures' Attack From Oceans"
          PICTURES of ALIENS racing through urban streets, swarming
          over cars stuck in massive lines,of traffic...
          Underneath these pictures we see CAPTIONS, a litany-of doom:

          Then a BUDDY LIST pops up on the screen, an INSTANT MESSAGE:

          CPL. HARRIS
          Damn, that's Cherise...
          Harris quickly types back a response: 'you ok?'
          The message comes back: no, real scared.'
          Harris responds: 'where are you?'
          He hits SEND. But the message doesn't go through. He clicks
          the mouse. But the computer has frozen.
          Then 'Internet Connection Lost' pops up on screen.
          Everyone stares. Harris stands, walks from the computer.
          Stavrou watches him go as...

          ACROSS THE BIG 5 FLOOR
          HECTOR steps back to his dad's side. Rincon's eyes open

          out, wipes a tear from his son's face.

          Nantz turns, staring off at Hector, sitting by his father.
          It's all too much...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Jesus...
          Nantz takes a deep breath, his mind racing, the world closing
          in on him. He turns to Michele.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Listen, our Forward Operating Base
          is about a mile away. We have to
          go on foot. I'll need your help
          with Hector now.
          Michele nods. Watches as Nantz slowly walks to Hector.
          Nantz kneels by the boy.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I'm sorry Hector. Your dad...
          didn't make it. You understand?
          Hector, sobbing, overwhelmed by grief and fear, looks up at
          Nantz.

                         HECTOR
          I don't wanna be here. I want my

          TWO ALIEN SCOUTS appear. They crouch by a car.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Sergeant, we got hostiles in front.
          All the marines stiffen, the clatter of rifles being raised.
          But Nantz, tearing up himself, just stays focused on Hector.

          Nantz lifts Hector. We see Hector's face, stricken, staring
          back at his father as he's carried off.
          The other marines gather up Michele and the girls...
          And everyone is moving silently THROUGH THE STORE as...

          AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE
          CRASH! The plate glass window is SHATTERED as...
          An ALIEN smashes through it.
          The alien is very still, peering around. Then it begins to
          creep forward as...
          A SECOND ALIEN, then a third, a FOURTH follows, leaping into
          the store with sinewy power.

          AT THE REAR OF THE STORE
          Nantz peers out a BACK DOOR. It's clear. They MOVE OUT just
          as...
          MORE ALIENS leap in. They move in formation THROUGH THE
          STORE as...

          Stavrou and Harris FALL BEHIND A BUILDING with the others.
          NANTZ, still holding Hector, looks off to a SIDE STREET..He

          Hector nods, still crying. Nantz exchanges a glance with
          Michele, who moves to Hector, comforting him.
          Nantz steps away as Kerns and Correggio run up, reporting:

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Looks good, both directions.
          Out of earshot of the civilians, Nantz spins to his men with
          fiery intensity.

          We are not losing one more of these

          Suddenly, Nantz stops, fist raised. The squad halts as...
          A SOUND fades in, a deep RUMBLING.
          The marines FALL BEHIND CARS now, pulling the civilians down
          with them as the RUMBLING continues to BUILD.

          SGT. NANTZ

          The marines frantically shed their packs, squirming UNDER THE

          close, gets his legs under the car, under cover, just as...
          The mass of aliens SWARM PAST, the ground shaking, RUMBLING.
          The humans HUDDLE UNDER THE CARS, peering out to see the legs
          and arms of the aliens flying by. Some bound OVER THE CARS,
          which bounce up and down, BANGING with the aliens' weight.
          The RUMBLING EBBS as the aliens disappear into the distance.

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          The squad moves in formation, surrounding the civilians.
          Little Kirsten comes up behind Correggio. He's surprised as
          she slips her hand into his. Correggio looks down, seeing
          how scared she is. He smiles, grips her hand tightly.
          Up ahead, Nantz leads, MAP in hand.

          Until we are CLOSE ON NANTZ' FACE.
          A REDDISH GLOW is reflected there. Nantz stops, looking
          horrified. We REVERSE to see...
          A DEEP BLACK COLUMN OF SMOKE rising into the night sky from
          NUMEROUS FIRES that rage within the fence line of...

          SANTA MONICA AIRPORT.
          As they approach the Forward Operating Base, the devastation
          is slowly revealed:
          CRASHED F-18 JETS and COBRA HELICOPTERS line the runways.
          BODIES and SMOLDERING MARINE VEHICLES litter the airfield.

          PVT. IMLAY

          You save a marine under fire, you

          Hector takes the heavy medallion, looks it over, pointing to
          the 2/5 MOTTO on it:

                         HECTOR
          What's that mean, "retreat hell?"

          SGT. NANTZ
          During World War I, an officer from

          Nantz is happy to see a slow smile from Hector now.

          Adukwu stay with the civilians.

          Black plumes of SMOKE fill the night sky as Nantz and his men
          head silently toward the bodies of dead marines and aliens.
          The tarmac is a smoldering WASTELAND: Empty, bombed-out
          buildings on its outskirts, burning aircraft and vehicles
          litter the runways. Fires crackle.
          As they go, the marines rifle the pockets and pouches of
          their fallen comrades, pulling out any available ammo.
          IMLAY whispers a low, heartfelt refrain to the dead marines
          he searches.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Sorry, bro.
          He moves on to another fallen marine, searching.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Sorry, bro.
          Across the runway, Nantz pulls ammo from the pouch of a dead
          marine. Then looking up, he sees...

          A LAV-25 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER. INTACT.
          Nantz moves to it. Then turns. A LOW WHISTLE from him and
          the marines look up. They hustle to Nantz. Everyone gives
          the LAV an excited once-over.

          their ice cream. Used to visit the
          firehouse with my little brother,
          they always had tons of it...
          (re. the kids)
          My brother's not much older than
          these guys.

                         MICHELE
          You don't look much older, either.
          She gazes at the kids, pain and anger washing over her.

          PVT. KERNS
          Maybe the Sergeant'll find a way
          outta here.

                         MICHELE

                         (SMILES)

          Doesn't anybody have a first name?

                         ADUKWU
          Emmanuel. Manny.

          PVT. KERNS
          Pete. You married? Family?

                         MICHELE
          I'm single. Lots of family back in
          Nebraska, though... Hopefully
          they're safe...
          She shakes the thought away.

                         MICHELE
          What about you guys?

          PVT. KERNS
          Little Rock.

          Nigeria. I came here to be a

          You should be a surgeon, the way

          Adukwu smiles. Then his smile fades as he looks around.

                         ADUKWU
          Yeah. Maybe...

          INT. CONTROL TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

          Nantz enters with Imlay. They look around...
          The WINDOWS have been BLOWN OPEN. The wind rustles papers
          through the ghostly space, blowing them out into the night.

          On one desk, a COMPUTER is flashing a SLIDESHOW: Happy
          PICTURES of someone's family vacation.
          From this, high vantage point, they can see for miles...
          Nantz looks out one end of the control tower, sees all the
          way to the ocean...
          Then he turns, looks the other way, dead east...
          A vista of EXPLOSIONS, spreading-into the distance. ALIEN
          DRONE AIRCRAFT engage F-18s. One jet is blown up, spiralling
          to the ground.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Look how far east they've gotten.
          That's almost the whole city...
          Nantz looks out through BINOCULARS:
          Sees the HOLLYWOOD SIGN ablaze in the hills...
          Then pans to a mid-city area. Stops when he sees one
          quadrant of the city, blocks wide, SHIMMERING an INKY BLACK.
          Some kind of DARK ENERGY WAVE emanating from the ground.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What the hell's that?
          Imlay peers out.

          SGT. NANTZ
          There's zero activity there.
          And the area does seem completely devoid of activity-- No
          alien or human aircraft above it. Like a DEAD ZONE.

          PVT. IMLAY
          What are we gonna do, Sergeant?
          Nantz, panning with the binoculars, sees a CHOPPER TAKING OFF
          in the distance now.
          Nantz grabs a MAP on the desk, eyes roaming over it. Then
          looks back to where he saw the chopper.

          SGT. NANTZ
          That must be the alternate
          extraction site. Maybe we can
          evacuate the civilians there...
          He turns to Imlay.

          Get them in the LAV. I'll radio
          for an evac helicopter... When I
          do, they'll be coming, so we have
          to move fast.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Think we can make it, Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're gonna give it one helluva
          try, Imlay.
          He reassures the young marine with each-word:

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're not dying here.

          INT. FIREHOUSE - LATER

          The marines, absent Nantz, surround the civilians
          protectively as they hustle them into the LAV.

          CONTROL TOWER - SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - MINUTES LATER
          Nantz standing alone with a RADIO PACK looking out into the
          black night, wind blowing through the tower.
          The LAV WAITS ON THE TARMAC below, engine running.
          Nantz takes a deep breath. Presses the button on the RADIO.

                         NANTZ

                         (TRANSMITTING)
          Any station, this is Foxtrot 2
          November. I have four civilians
          and seven marines, we're heading to
          Alternate Extraction Point Charlie.
          Requesting evacuation. I say
          again, this is Foxtrot 2 November
          heading to Alternate Extraction
          Point Charlie. Out.
          Nantz turns immediately, hurrying out.

          EXT. CONTROL TOWER - SECONDS LATER

          Nantz runs from the tower and climbs into the LAV.

          Nantz sees the civilians and marines crammed together in the
          back amid gear and guns.
          He turns to Stavrou behind the wheel.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Use the thermal sight. No lights.
          Stavrou drives, spins away as Nantz climbs...

          INTO THE TURRET
          He mans the M-240 MACHINE GUN. Imlay beside him on the 25MM

          BUSHMASTER CHAIN GUN.
          Headlights off, running dark, Stavrou drives, peering through
          the THERMAL SIGHT.

          STAVROU'S POV THROUGH THERMAL
          Washed green, the city a war zone, massive destruction..
          An ALIEN DRONE winging toward the airport as...

          EXT. STREET, NEAR SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - LATE NIGHT

          The LAV moves fast in total darkness down a car-strewn
          street. Santa Monica Airport fading behind them, suddenly...
          BOOOOOOM-! Bright burst of light!
          And the Control Tower explodes in a ball of fire.

          INT. LAV - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz watches the alien drone fly off into the night.

          EXT. STREET - LATER - NIGHT

          Miles away, the LAV drives through a CITY STREET, surrounded
          by TALL BUILDINGS, the area a desolate wasteland now.

          INT. LAV - SAME

          Stavrou drives, hands gripping the wheel as he maneuvers
          carefully through wrecked abandoned cars.

          Nantz eyes a nervous Imlay.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Extract site's only a couple more
          miles, Imlay.
          Imlay nods back. Nantz peers down to...

          STAVROU, BEHIND THE WHEEL...
          Eyes focusing tensely through the thermal sight scope.

          THERMAL SIGHT POV
          Green wash of the city passing by. Tall, empty buildings all
          around... Suddenly, a big DARK OBJECT in the street!
          Stavrou SLAMS THE BRAKES. Civilians and marines in the tight
          passenger compartment are thrown around.
          Right in front of the LAV...
          A massive CRATER. The street's impassable.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We gotta go around.
          The LAV backs up, Nantz scanning the sky, gripping the M-240
          machine gun, trying to see out into the darkness...
          Then they TURN A CORNER... And a VIEW BETWEEN TWO TALL
          BUILDINGS is harrowing...
          FOUR ALIEN DRONE AIRCRAFT hovering... Then turning. Flying
          toward them.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Get ready, Imlay. Here they come.
          Stavrou looks out to see... A HELICOPTER in the distance.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Think I see our ride, sergeant!

                         SGT NANTZ
          Get us there. Cause we're about to
          get lit up.
          The alien drone ships are winging at them. They are only 200
          meters out when...

          Imlay!
          Imlay OPENS UP on the 25MM BUSHMASTER CHAIN GUN.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Come on, you martian bastards!
          The Bushmaster is a rapid-firing CANNON spewing 200 rounds a
          minute, each capable of destroying a light tank.
          For once, the aliens are overmatched. The ALIEN SHIPS take
          HEAVY FIRE from the Bushmaster...
          One goes down IN FLAMES, the others PEEL OFF, flying behind
          buildings.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Where'd they go? Where'd they go?
          Nantz is scanning the sky, then...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Imlay, on your six!
          Imlay spins in the turret, picking up...
          The three remaining ALIEN AIRCRAFT coming back around.
          The lead alien ship FIRES!
          A ,CAR EXPLODES next to the LAV. Imlay rocks in the turret.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Son of a...
          Imlay targets, fires the Bushmaster...
          The lead alien ship is HIT, winging out of control INTO A
          SECOND SHIP. The TWO SHIPS EXPLODE into a building as...
          The FINAL ALIEN AIRCRAFT dodges the FIREBALL, flying straight
          at the LAV...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Getting close, Imlay...

          PVT. IMLAY
          I got it.
          Imlay FIRES a burst. The last aircraft is hit...

          It PINWHEELS TO THE GROUND, exploding into FLAMING WRECKAGE
          which hurtles RIGHT AT THE LAV.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Stand on it, Stavrou!
          Stavrou pushes it, TRYING TO OUTRUN the burning wreckage...
          Which is almost on top of the LAV as...
          Stavrou spins AROUND A CORNER, escaping.
          The wreckage explodes into a building behind them as...
          THUMP - THUMP - THUMP! The sound of a UH-1'Medevac ECHOES.

          PVT. IMLAY
          The chopper!
          Nantz looks out, sees the CHOPPER LANDING in the street.
          The LAV screeches up amid the RUBBLE and SMOKE.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Last stop!

          SGT. NANTZ

          The marines rush the civilians OUT OF THE LAV... Nantz and
          Imlay scrambling out last.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Pretty decent shooting, Imlay.

          The marines begin loading the civilians in, the old-school
          CREW CHIEF hopping off to help the kids in.

          The chopper powers up, Nantz SCRAMBLES ON with the others.

          INT. EVAC HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

          The CHOPPER BEGINS TO LIFT OFF. As it rises, Nantz gazes out
          at the CITYSCAPE. He sees fires, wreckage everywhere. Then
          he looks off to see...

          THE BLACK DEAD ZONE SHIMMERING NEARBY
          Nantz watches the HELICOPTER BANK TOWARD THE BLACK ZONE. But
          as it gets closer...
          The HELICOPTER DIPS precipitously, suddenly losing altitude.
          The kids SCREAM. The marines hang on.
          Nantz sees the PILOT STRUGGLING with the controls. The
          HELICOPTER'S GAUGES are going crazy.
          The pilot BANKS HARD AWAY from the area, reversing course.
          And the helicopter STABILIZES.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What the hell happened?!

          Something there was playing hell
          with our power!
          Nantz stares at this. Then notices Hector watching. him.
          He sees the 2/5 MEDALLION clutched tightly in Hector's hand.
          Sees the words "Retreat Hell."
          Nantz looks back at the MYSTERIOUS BLACK PATCH of cityscape.
          Then he turns to the crew chief.

          to take off again...
          Nantz looks out. Spies a BUILDING with a FLAT OPEN ROOF. He
          points to it.

          (to the others)
          Let's go, marines.
          The marines look frightened, confused. They start to pull
          themselves up. ROPES are dropped from the chopper as it
          hovers over the building...

          SGT. NANTZ
          NOW! Go! Go!
          The marines start to RAPPEL DOWN, one after another as...
          Nantz exchanges a glance with Michele.

          SGT. NANTZ
          They'll get you safe.
          He smiles at the girls. Then turns, nods at Hector. Puts a

          As the chopper hovers, Nantz drops to the roof, hunkers down
          with the other marines. Nantz watches the evac helicopter
          fly off to safety.
          Then he turns to the marines, who stare back hopelessly,
          clearly at their lowest point.

          PVT. KERNS
          Why'd we get off the chopper,
          Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          'Cause we have a job to do.

          PVT. IMLAY
          But we were getting out...!

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          You have some hunch and now we're
          stuck out here in the shit?!

          That's right. This fight's not

          Sergeant's gonna get us killed!
          Just like my brother.
          A beat. Nantz eyes Correggio. It's laid open now.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Believe me, Correggio, I grieved
          for every marine I ever lost...
          Nantz looks around now, from marine to marine.

          SGT. NANTZ
          But we are in the fight of our
          lives right now. And our duty is
          to keep moving forward. Keep
          fighting. That's how we honor men
          like your brother, Correggio. And
          Lt. Martinez. And Hector's father,
          who saved Adukwu's life. He wasn't
          trained for that. He just picked
          up a rifle and did what needed to
          be done. If a civilian can do
          that...

          Nantz stares. The tension is palpable.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I need you men. And maybe we'll
          die fighting today. Not because
          we're heroes. But because we're
          goddamn United States marines, and
          always will be.

          Stavrou fires it up, drives off as... Nantz eyes the jumble
          of gear. He grabs his COMBAT SHOTGUN, a portable RADIO,

          Then an olive case marked: GLTD. He stuffs it in his pack.

          ALIEN SOLDIERS appearing on the street now.
          Nantz goes back to stuffing his pack.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Just hit the gas, Corporal. We got
          plenty of armor.
          Everyone looks up at this. Then looks out to see...
          The aliens attacking, FIRING on the LAV as...
          Stavrou floors it, ALIEN FIRE pinging off the LAV's armor
          as... SPLAT!!!

          STAVROU MOWS THROUGH THE ENEMY LINE.

          The LAV cruises slowly. Nantz stares forward.
          The BLACK DEAD ZONE looms ahead... As they get closer, it
          seems like the whole area is absent of light. A black hole.
          Nantz stares out, about to answer when the LAV LURCHES, then
          lurches again. Stavrou REVS the engine.

          Correggio and Kerns on one side of the street, Stavrou and
          Harris on the other. Imlay with Adukwu. Nantz watches his
          men move forward, covering each other's advance. Scanning'
          the buildings, searching for targets...
          Then Nantz halts them. They crouch together, peering at...
          The middle of the DEAD ZONE just ahead of them. It is very
          dark. No lights are visible from any source. The men SWEAT.

          Harris, Adukwu, stay here, watch

          Harris and Adukwu nod. Taking position at the entrance.
          Nantz motions to the others.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Let's go.
          Nantz leads Stavrou, Correggio, Kerns and Imlay down the
          stopped escalator to the SUBWAY PLATFORM.
          Nantz stands, gazing around at the empty subway platform.
          Silent. Spooky. A train is stopped. Doors open. It is
          dark, the only light bleeding in from the street above.
          He motions Stavrou to guard against anything coming from
          above. Then he moves forward with the others.
          A huge number of BIRDS line the dark cavity above the train
          tracks, taking cover themselves, roosting quietly.
          Nantz sees a DOOR in the tunnel wall, heads to it.
          He pulls his KA-BAR KNIFE out, sticks the blade into the door
          jam, pops the DOOR OPEN. Nantz turns to Correggio and Kerns.

          Nantz and Imlay stand very still, peering down the long, dark
          hall, looking for movement. Nantz motions and they move
          forward silently, guns ready.
          They turn a corner and stop. It is PITCH BLACK here.
          Nantz clicks on his flashlight. They move forward. After
          only a few feet, the FLASHLIGHT DIMS AND DIES.
          Imlay clicks on his flashlight.

          Imlay clicks his flashlight OFF. But now we see...
          A dim light ahead. Nantz and Imlay creep forward, very
          slowly. Turn a corner, see...
          A STRANGE LIGHT at the end of the hallway. THE LIGHT GLOWS
          fiercely, as if it's shining through the floor.
          Nantz, silhouetted by the light, signals Imlay to stay put.
          Nantz steps forward, toward the strange glow of light. As he
          approaches, he realizes it's coming through...
          An IRON GRATE in the floor.
          Nantz moves to the grate, kneels, PEERING DOWN INTO...

          A MASSIVE SUBWAY TUNNEL
          Fifty feet wide, the dim tunnel has been further EXCAVATED.
          It is a huge CAVERN now, extending off into the distance
          further than Nantz can see.
          The huge space is illuminated by MASSES OF ALIEN MACHINERY.
          An ELECTRIC HUM FILLS THE AIR.
          Tending the machinery: DOZENS OF ALIENS, bigger than the
          others.
          One of the ALIENS TURNS, focusing up, right at Nantz.
          Nantz spins, runs back into the darkness. Calling to Imlay:

          SGT. NANTZ
          Run, Imlay! Run!
          BANG. The iron GRATE FLIES into the air.

          Nantz and Imlay, race along in the dark. They hear POUNDING
          FOOTSTEPS of the alien pursuing him.
          A glimmer of LIGHT ahead. Along the floor. It is, a DOOR.
          They burst through a DOOR, into...

          Nantz spins, swinging his shotgun. HE FIRES.
          BOOM! The blast ILLUMINATES the huge ALIEN, filling the
          stairwell with its horrible bulk.
          Nantz backs up the stairs, pumping the shotgun, firing...
          Each blast ILLUMINATES THE ALIEN in a STROBE EFFECT. The
          alien moves up the stares. Nantz KEEPS FIRING.
          The NOISE IS DEAFENING in the enclosed space.
          Then the SHOTGUN RUNS DRY. And we're left IN DARKNESS.
          Imlay clicks on his FLASHLIGHT, revealing...
          The ALIEN at Nantz' feet, its strange "hand" on his boot.
          Nantz, terrified, aims at the alien, waiting to see if it
          will move. It doesn't.

          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - MOMENTS LATER

          Nantz and Imlay re-enter, running up to join the others.
          Up the stairs, by street-level, Harris and Adukwu keep watch.
          Harris motions: "ENEMY TROOPS".
          Nantz nods. Signals for all the marines to head down the
          stairs. The marines gather around Nantz. To Harris:

          SGT. NANTZ
          Look. There's something big down

          as the station starts to come apart, chunks of concrete fall.
          The walls crack. Dust fills the air.
          Nantz SCREAMS as a chunk of concrete FALLS ACROSS HIS ANKLE.
          Then, it's over. All is silent. Nantz, GRIMACING in PAIN,
          strains to lift the concrete chunk off his ankle. He GROANS.
          The marines rise. Pale, sweating, Nantz hobbles to his feet.
          He slings his rifle, and carrying the GLTD, hurries on his
          bad ankle to the stairs.
          Nantz looks up. Rubble nearly fills the stairway. There is
          only a small opening of daylight near the ceiling.
          The men all unclip their web gear, begin climbing.

          A chunk of rubble falls from the pile at the subway entrance,
          and Nantz emerges, rolling down the pile to the street.
          The other marines follow, set up a perimeter as..,.

          Nantz looks up to see...
          The street fill with ALIEN SOLDIERS rushing out now.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Here they come!
          The marines FORM A PERIMETER AROUND THE LASER, OPENING UP on
          the aliens as...
          The mass of aliens surges forward like a wave.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Hold them back! We have to keep
          the laser on target!
          Nantz FIRES. An alien goes down. He picks another target
          and FIRES. The alien staggers, keeps coming. Three more
          rounds and the alien goes down.
          But the rest KEEP COMING... closing in...

          FOLLOWING THE BEAM OF THE LASER BACK TO NANTZ.
          Nantz is picking his targets. AIMING, FIRING... Turning,
          finding targets, reloading, the aliens getting closer...
          Then his rifle runs dry.
          NANTZ pulls his sidearm. He aim, FIRES, shooting a closing
          alien in its 'heart.' It drops.
          Rounds impact around Nantz as he shoots another alien...
          Then the next. The next. Then his sidearm is out of bullets
          as... An EXPLOSION rips near Nantz.
          Knocking the laser away.
          Nantz struggles...TO THE LASER. RE-AIMING it as...

          MORE ALIENS POUR INTO THE STREET.
          The marines are pushed into a SMALL CIRCLE around the laser.
          Fighting nearly back to back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.
          Kerns is HIT. He is thrown to the ground, but is back up,
          arm bleeding, firing.
          An alien RUSHES AT CORREGGIO who spins just in time, FIRING
          repeatedly until the alien goes down.
          Stavrou swings his rifle butt, SMASHING another alien. It
          staggers back. Stavrou puts numerous rounds into it.
          An alien reaches ADUKWU, knocking him to the ground, about to
          blast him...
          Harris runs the alien through with his bayonet, twisting and
          firing his rifle at the same time. The alien falls.
          The marines are FIGHTING AS ONE.
          All focused on SURROUNDING NANTZ. THEN THE LASER DIES.
          Imlay notices the laser beam is gone.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Did we get a lock!?

          SGT. NANTZ
          I don't know!
          Then... An ear-splitting NOISE. The marines look up, see...

          A CRUISE MISSILE COMING STRAIGHT DOWN THE STREET!
          Nantz looks up at his men, yelling:

          SGT. NANTZ
          INCOMING! Fall back! This way!
          Nantz and his men begin BACKING AWAY. Firing as they do,
          trying to hold off the aliens.
          Nantz, limping on his injured ankle, GOES DOWN. Correggio is
          there to help him up.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Think you just twisted your ankle,.
          sir.
          And through it all, Nantz still smiles at this.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Don't stop!! We're too close to
          the impact point!!
          The marines start running as...

          MORE CRUISE MISSILES APPEAR, RIPPING TOWARD THE GROUND...
          BOOOOOM! The first missile strikes!
          Then another...and another ...BOOOOM! BOOOOM!
          A piercing WHISTLE sounds. Nantz looks into the sky as...
          Suddenly KABOOOM!!! A 2000 pound laser-guided ARTILLERY
          SHELL explodes INTO THE GROUND...
          THE GROUND HEAVES UP. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION of fire and smoke
          erupting from beneath the surface.

          A SHOCK WAVE BURSTS OUT FROM THE IMPACT POINT.

          THE MARINES ARE ENVELOPED... DISAPPEARING as...
          Buildings shatter, cars are tossed, flames erupt.
          Then SILENCE descends a moment. Only the crackle of flames,
          falling glass. The dust and ash settles in a grey haze.
          Nothing could have survived this. BEAT. Then...
          A FIGURE RISES UP out of the grey destruction.

          SGT. NANTZ

          MARINES!
          AS ONE, the men rise out of the ash, standing tall.

          SGT. NANTZ

          ON ME!
          The marines fall in. A PHALANX with Nantz at its center.

          SGT. NANTZ

          FIRE!
          They move forward. Precise. Deadly. FIGHTING AS ONE.
          The seven remaining marines POUR FIRE on the mass of aliens.
          The Drone Ships fall from the sky, EXPLODING on the ground.
          The aliens, in disarray, are mowed down. The rest FLEE.
          And as the smoke drifts away, there is silence again.
          Nantz looks up to see...

          HIS MEN. His warriors. Standing with smoking weapons, ready
          for more. Correggio staggers up, covered in dust, bloody.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          You know what, Sergeant? My
          brother said you were a bad ass.

                         (SMILES)
          I had no idea...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Your brother was one helluva
          marine, Correggio.

                         (SMILES BACK)
          So are you.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. MEDEVAC HELICOPTER

          Nantz sits in the rumbling chopper. Surrounded by his
          marines. Imlay stares out at the city below.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Man, it's quiet.

          CHOPPER PILOT (V.0.)
          They're in full retreat throughout
          Los Angeles, heading back into the
          ocean. Units are mopping up.
          On this, Nantz turns to his SQUAD. Beat.

          SGT. NANTZ
          This has been a hell of a battle.
          Plenty of other battles to go.
          Everybody good with that?
          The marines don't hesitate.

                         MARINES
          Yes, Sergeant!

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Well, uh, actually, Sergeant...
          there's this girl I was supposed to
          meet up with tonight...

          SGT. NANTZ

          call yourselves marines today. I'm
          damn proud of every one of you.
