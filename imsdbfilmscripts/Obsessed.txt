          EXT. HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS - EARLY MORNING
          
          A two-story California Craftsman with a SOLD sign in the
          front yard. Yukon SUV pulls into the drive and stops.
          
          The driver's door opens and DEREK CHARLES steps out, a
          handsome and likable African-American in his early 30's; a
          guy who's fought hard to make himself a success in business
          and life. Derek wears a business suit and the first thing he
          does is cross the lawn to the SOLD sign.
          
          With a new homeowner's look of satisfaction, Derek grips the
          SOLD sign and pulls it out of the ground.
          
                                  WOMAN'S VOICE
                       Derek?
          
          D erek looks over to where his pretty wife BETH is standing
          beside the SUV, holding their cute 2 year old son KYLE in her
          arms. Beth shakes her head with amusement.
          
                                BETH
                      What are you going to do with that?
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
          The SOLD sign, now in pieces, burns brightly in the
          fireplace. The rest of the room is empty except for KYLE who
          is nearby, asleep in his stroller. Derek and Beth's VOICES
          drift down from upstairs.
          
                                BETH'S VOICE
                      This is coming down.

                      Why?

                      Do you want people to think we put it up?

                        I don't know. I kind of like it.
          
                                 BETH'S VOICE
                     Please tell me you're joking.
          
                                                                             2.

          Derek and Beth stare up at their own reflections in a huge
          ceiling mirror. The rest of the room is vacant.
          
                              DEREK
                    All I'm saying, before we take it down...
                    maybe we should try it out.

                    a fine shag carpet?

          Derek puts his arms around her waist and pulls her close.
          Beth resists -- but only slightly.
          
                              BETH (cont'd)
                    Don't you have to go to work?

                              BETH
                    Maybe not, but the movers...
          
                              DEREK
                    Won't be here for another hour.
          
          Beth smiles, giving in. They look up at themselves in the
          mirror like naughty teenagers.
          
                              BETH
                    Derek, you are so bad.

          Beth, drowsing in Derek's arms.    They stir at the sound of

                    No. Go to work and earn that promotion.
                    Somebody's got to pay for all this.
          
          They share a quick kiss and then Beth swings over to find her
          clothes.
          
          As Beth dresses, Derek stares up at himself.    He smiles with
          satisfaction. Life is good.

          arranges them with loving care on the mantle above the fire

                    Charles' office. They said it was this
                    way.

                    I guess you probably know him.

                    Kind of an asshole, takes himself waaaay
                    too seriously. But don't tell him I said
                    that.     L

                    Deep trouble.
          
          Approaching a desk where Derek's assistant, a mild-looking
          man in his late 30's named PATRICK looks up and smiles.
          Across from Patrick is another desk and another assistant, a
          middle-aged woman named MARGE.

                    Morning, Derek. How's the new house?

                    as soon as the movers showed up.
          
                              PATRICK
                    Beth must have loved that.

                    If she calls mad -- and she will -- tell
                    her I'm in a meeting.
          
                              PATRICK
                    Remember who used to sit at this desk?
                    She'll know I am lying.

          Patrick CHUCKLES as Derek enters his office and vanishes
          inside. Patrick notices Lisa standing there with her arm
          load of files.

                    Yes.
          
          Lisa breaks into a smile; obviously charmed.
          
          Patrick takes amused notice of Lisa's interest in Derek.

          INT. MEETING ROOM - LATER
          
          Derek sits at a long table with his silver-haired boss, JOE
          GAGE and his best friend and co-worker BEN KINGMAN. One wall
          of the room is glass, giving a view of the outer office
          activity.            G
                               AGE
                        (to Derek)
                    Did you talk to our German friend, Herr
                    Ganz?
          
                               DEREK
                    Matter of fact, I just got off the line
                    to Berlin.
          
                              GAGE
                    And?
          
                              DEREK
                    Ganz doesn't like the way the Stock
                    Market's been gyrating and he thinks the
                    hedge fund wave is about to crest.
          
                               AGE
                    You think he's right?
          
                              DEREK
                    Hell, no. I think he's a hundred percent
                    wrong. We haven't even gotten close to
                    that point yet. Hedge fund demand is
                    coming from individual investors which is
                    why it's gaining mainstream acceptance.
                    You know Ganz. He gets paranoid when
                    anything goes mainstream. He started
                    making Auf Wiedersehen noises but I
                    managed to talk him into a private equity
                    portfolio instead... to the tune of 155
                    mil.

                    No offense, Ben.
          
                              BEN
                    None taken, Joe. I'm just honored to be
                    allowed to exist in Derek's world.
          
          Derek looks over at Ben who winks at him. They're friends
          and good-natured ribbing is part of their relationship.

          Derek and Beth sit at a table on the outside deck that
          overhangs a sheer drop to the canyon below. In the distance,
          the LA basin sparkles like a diamond in the night.
          
          Derek and Beth are happy but exhausted. In front of them is
          an empty pizza box. Derek picks up a bottle of champagne and
          pours some for Beth and himself. They're both a little
          drunk.

                       of their spouses, less likely to kick
                       back and enjoy themselves and mingle with
                       co-workers, which is what the party is

                    for a barbecue on Saturday.

          Derek enters. No one else around. He goes to the urinal and
          begins to unzip. About 30 seconds later he hears the door
          open and close but thinks nothing of it because it is a large
          public Men's restroom in the workplace with 4 urinals and 2
          stalls.
          
          But suddenly, a hand snakes around his waist and grabs his
          crotch. Derek whirls around, face to face with a brazen,
          smiling Lisa who dangles a sprig of Mistletoe in her free
          hand. Her eyes flash with desire.

          That's when someone comes in. Derek kicks the stall door
          shut with his foot just in time. He and Lisa freeze, pressed
          close together as A DRUNK MALE WORKER staggers to the urinal
          and unzips.
          
          Lisa hides a GIGGLE.    Derek is horrified they'll be
          discovered.

          Derek is trapped. Lisa gives him a naughty smile. She's in

          When there's no reply, the Drunk resumes pissing.
          
          Lisa smears the Mistletoe sprig against Derek's face, then
          starts to go down on him. He clutches her head with both
          hands forcing her to stop. She looks up at him, eyes

          He clumsily zips back up, lurches over to the sink. He looks
          at himself in the mirror, runs his fingers through his hair,
          smiles at himself and then stumbles out the door.
          
          The stall door bangs open as Derek pushes Lisa aside and
          staggers out, trying to zip up his fly.

          head for the elevator.

          the party. A little tipsy, he walks over to her.

          trying to make sense of what happened.
          
          That's when he hears a SIREN. Derek's eyes go up to the rear
          view mirror in panic as a police car with flashing lights
          gains on him.

          Lisa stands there in her overcoat staring in mute
          disappointment as Derek speeds out of the parking garage.

          With a YAWN, Derek sits down at his computer and goes to e-
          mail. He scans it and is instantly confused.
          
          Dozens of e-mails, all from the same sender: TEMPGIRL.
          A
            little fearful, Derek pulls up the first e-mail. It opens
          up to reveal a self-taken photo of Lisa looking sexy and
          inviting on a bed, smiling seductively and wearing skimpy
          lingerie that shows off her sexy body.
          
           nder her photo: SEE YOU IN THE NEW YEAR.
          
          Derek feels a jolt of panic.    He deletes it, brings up the
          others.
          
           t's the same photo, Lisa on the bed, over and over.
          
          Derek stares at Lisa on screen, feeling sick and invaded. He
          isn't aware of Beth coming out of the bathroom behind him.
          She approaches as he continues to delete.

          key and the last photo of Lisa disappears.

          INTERCUTTING WITH BETH in Kyle's bedroom, putting him to
          sleep.

                       They're all getting wasted. Any minute
                       now, Joe's going to suggest the Jacuzzi.
          
                                 BETH
                       Well, if your future depends on putting
                       on a bathing suit and hot tubbing it with
                       a bunch of drunks... Derek? You there?
          
          Derek freezes. Across the patio, he sees A FIGURE slowly
          approaching. It's a woman back-lit, a silhouette. But as
          she passes into the light from the bar, she's revealed as
          Lisa, transformed into an alluring femme fatale.

          Derek clicks off and pockets his cell.
          
          On the other end, Beth looks perturbed.
          
          Now Lisa comes face to face with Derek, smiling.     She boldly
          picks up his drink and takes a sip.

          Lisa turns aside. Out of Derek's sight, she slips a capsule
          into his drink, then puts it back on the table.

          Ben goes one way, Derek the other.
          
          Derek, feeling more and more disoriented, makes his way to
          his room. He fishes around in his pockets and finds his key
          card. He slides it and pushes open the door.

          Derek lets himself in, doesn't even click on the lights.
          There's enough moonlight coming through the window to lead
          him to the bed where he flops down on his back. He doesn't
          even bother to undress.
          
          Derek closes his eyes, then opens them. He feels sick.
          Sound and perception are playing games with his head. The
          room begins to spin and he can hear a sound, a rushing noise.
          Is it the shower in the bathroom? The bathroom door is shut
          but there's a crack of light around the edges. Is someone in
          there?

          Derek is too out of it to care. He just wants to sleep, make

          The bathroom door opens, letting in a cloud of steam and a
          shaft of light. A woman's silhouette appears, naked. She
          moves to the bed.

           erek feels the bed move... feels a tug on his trousers...
          then, an amplified ZZZZIIIPPP.
          
          Derek's eyes open in shock. He can't believe what he sees --
          Lisa, naked, straddling him. Her hand caressing his face.
          It's like a dream. A nightmare. Lisa smiles seductively and
          puts a finger to her lips.

          Derek tries to resist but finds he has no control over his
          body or mind. All he can see is a shifting, distorted image
          of Lisa's face... her smile... her teeth.. her lips... the
          blazing look of sexual desire in her eyes. And somewhere in
          those eyes he can see HIMSELF.
          
          And that's the last thing Derek sees before he passes out and
          the entire world goes black and silent.                C

          is. A hotel room. Naked under the covers. How did he...

          overslept and now he's late for the seminar.
          
          Derek starts to get up, looks over and -- his heart stops.
          
          There's Lisa sprawled beside him on her stomach, naked under
          the covers. She opens her eyes and gives him a sexy, sleepy
          smile, stretching her body like a cat.

          Derek grabs Lisa by the arm, drags her out of the bed at the
          same time gathering her clothes from the floor and thrusting
          them into her arms.

          No response. Her head is cocked to one side and her skin is
          ghostly pale.
          
          Derek leans over and shakes Lisa's naked shoulder.

                    Lisa, get up.
          
          It's like shaking a doll.

                       in the hall.
          
          That's when Derek sees it. On the night stand: an empty
          bottle of prescription pills. Derek picks up the bottle and
          looks at the label: Ambien.
          
          Derek grabs the bedside phone and punches Desk.

                       This is 622. There's a woman in my room,
                       she's taken an overdose of prescription
                       pills -- Ambien. You need to get the
                       paramedics and security up here right
                       away. Please hurry.
          
          Derek hangs up. Now he puts one knee on the bed and takes
          Lisa's face in his hands, turning her head. He might as well
          be handling a marionette.

          No response. He puts his ear to her naked chest, trying to
          detect a heartbeat. If there is one, he can't hear it.
          Derek gently slaps her cheeks. Rolls back her eye lids.
          Nothing.

          Now Derek begins to perform CPR. He tilts Lisa's jaw back,
          clears her mouth and begins to breathe into her, alternating
          chest compressions.

                       Maybe I was too nice to her, said
                       something she took the wrong way, I don't

          Before Derek can respond, Reyes sees AN ER DOCTOR signalling.

                    I'll be right back.

          The Doctor hands Reyes a piece of paper. Derek can't stand

                    They pumped her out in time. Doctor says
                    she's groggy and disoriented. Probably

                    As a matter of fact, she was lucid long
                    enough to give the doctor a name to call
                    in case of emergency. He wrote it down.

                    Derek, not everybody gets drunk and does
                    things they regret.
          
          Derek looks like he's been punched in the face.

          S
           amantha is sprawled on the couch. The TV is going, she's
          listening to music on her I-pod while texting a friend on her
          phone and paging through a teen magazine all at the same
          time, multi-tasking.
          
          She doesn't hear the door bell RING the first time. Or the
          second. Then there's a LOUD KNOCKING. Samantha becomes
          aware, looks around, then sees a shadowy figure through the
          frosted window next to the door.
          
          With a SIGH of annoyance, Samantha gets up and goes to the
          door. She unlocks and opens it. Lisa is standing on the
          threshold, looking fresh and pretty and smiling.

          looks relieved.

          light from the hall, turning Lisa into a silhouette. She
          enters the room, silent as a ghost, and approaches Kyle's
          crib. She stands over him, smiling down at the vulnerable
          sleeping child.
          
          Then, Lisa turns away and looks at herself in a mirror.

          Lisa vanishes. Samantha sends a last message, then thinks
          she ought to check on the baby. She gets up, starts for the
          stairs when she gets another text message on her phone. She

                       We pumped his stomach. X-ray and cat scan
                       came back normal. We'll wait for the
                       blood work but it appears he's completely
                       fine. I don't see any reason why you
                       can't take Bhim home in a couple hours.

                       earlier today, then used her sister's

                       Hey.
          
                                 BETH
                       We just left the house.
          
                                   DEREK
                       Good.    Did you set the alarm?
          
                                 BETH
                       The... I think I did. I had to run back
                       in and I can't remember if I re-set it.
          
                                  EREK
                       Look, don't worry about it.
          
                                 BETH
                       No, I'm barely down the hill.     I'll do it
                       and call you back.
          
          Beth clicks off. She slows down and pulls into a driveway.
          She backs out and returns up the hill.
          
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM
          
          Lisa enters, carrying the ice bucket with the champagne
          bottle in it and the two flutes. She smiles excitedly, like
          a woman preparing for her lover's return.
          
          Lisa places the champagne on the night table.
          
          She removes her coat to reveal a sexy white nightgown, then
          reaches into the coat pocket and takes out a paper bag.
          
            he upends the bag and with a giggle, begins to sprinkle red
          rose petals on the floor, making a trail to the bed.

          The ice bucket and champagne sit on the night table.
          
          Lisa stretches out on the bed, amid the rose petals, leaving
          a space for her lover beside her. She gazes up at the
          cracked ceiling mirror. She smiles at herself and, thanks to
          the cracked mirror, her smile is distorted, scary and insane-
          looking.
          
                                                                          94.

          On the bed, Lisa hears the car.
          
          She rolls off the bed and crosses to the window, parting the
          curtains to look out.

          Lisa tenses, suddenly fearful.

          He can't work, glancing at his cell for Beth's call.

          Beth lets herself in. She's about to set the alarm when she
          hears the floor creak above her.
          
          Beth freezes.    She waits, listens.
          
          No further sound.    But Beth knows.
          
          Beth goes to the front door as if to leave. She opens the
          door and closes it as if she left the house.
          
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM
          
          Lisa, standing very still near the window, hears the sound of
          the door opening downstairs, then closing.
          
          Relieved, she moves to the window and peers out, expecting to
          see Beth getting into the car. But there's no sight of her.
          
          INT. FOYER
          
          Beth pulls off her shoes and lays them by the door. She
          begins to quietly tip toe up the stairs, certain to be as
          quiet as she can.

                    Girl, you're even dumber than my husband
                    said you were.

                    Or did you just forget to take your meds?
          
          Lisa whirls around. Beth is standing in the doorway, giving
          Lisa a deadly look, like a cat who's just trapped a mouse.
          
          Beth takes notice of the rose petals on the bed and floor.
          
          Lisa is wide-eyed, terrified, caught. Lisa begins to edge her
          way around the room.
          
                              BETH (cont'd)
                    You really fucked up this time... coming
                    back to my house. Didn't you get my
                    message?
          
          Lisa's eyes dart around for escape.   Beth seems remarkably
          calm.
          
                              BETH (cont'd)
                    You can look all you want but you're not
                    getting out of here.
                     ot until I've given you the beating of
                    your life... bitch.
          
          And she means it, too.
          
          Lisa tries to dart around her. But Beth cuts her off,
          grabbing Lisa by the throat and forcing her back, slamming
          her hard against the bed post.
          L
           isa bounces off the post, stunned. Beth is on her, slapping
          her hard, grabbing a handful of Lisa's hair, ripping it out
          by the roots as Lisa tries to get free. Lisa lets out a
          subhuman shriek of pain.
          
          Beth tosses the hank of hair aside, keeps on coming.    She's
          beyond pissed.
          
                               BETH (cont'd)

          hell out of her, knocking her around the room.

          adjoining bathroom. She slams the door shut and throws the
          lock, face bleeding, looking around for a weapon, something
          to protect herself with.
          
          CRASH!   The bathroom door comes off its hinges as Beth barges
          in.

          flushes it, holding her there as Lisa flops and chokes.

          As Beth comes out of the bathroom, Lisa lunges for the night
          table and grabs the bottle of champagne. She swings it and
          hits Beth is the side of the head. Whack! The cork pops and
          champagne goes spewing everywhere.
          
          Stunned, Beth goes down on her knees. Lisa wipes blood from
          her face, circling Beth, lips drawn back and teeth showing
          like an animal.

                    Derek!
          
          Lisa tries to make it to the kitchen to get the phone. Beth
          grabs her by the sleeve and pulls her back. The sleeve tears
          loose in Beth's hand.

                    Beth?
          
          Lisa stumbles back toward the stairs. She scrambles upward,
          thinking maybe she can get to the phone in the bedroom.
          
          Lisa reaches the top step just as Beth snags her ankle,
          stopping her. Lisa rolls around and viciously kicks Beth in
          the shoulder with her other leg. Beth falls back, tumbles
          halfway down the stairs.

          night stand.

          Before she can answer, Beth is suddenly there. She rips the
          phone from Lisa's hand and strikes her with it. As Lisa
          stumbles back into the hall landing, Beth speaks calmly, even
          sweetly, into the receiver.
          
                              BETH
                    Derek, I'm right in the middle of

          Alarmed, Derek hurries out of the office, punching a number
          into his cell as he runs to the elevator. A nervous Patrick
          watches Derek exit...
          
                               EREK (cont'd)
                    I need to speak to Lt. Reyes.   It's an
                    emergency!
          
          Beth goes out into the hall and Lisa springs on her.
          
           he two women fight, going up against the bannister. They
          claw and punch at each other. With renewed strength, Lisa
          forces Beth up against the bannister. Beth looks over the
          side and down...
          
          Fifteen feet below is that large glass dining table.
          
          Lisa bangs Beth against the bannister. A few feet away is a
          heavy crystal chandelier suspended from the ceiling by a
          metal chain.
          T
           he bannister rail begins to crack. Lisa tries to force Beth
          over, then Beth suddenly swings them around, reversing
          positions --
          
          The bannister cracks, breaks apart and Lisa topples over the
          side.
          
          As she's about to fall, Lisa reaches out and grabs the
          chandelier with both hands.
          
          By a miracle, it supports her and she swings back and forth
          like a human pendulum but now the chandelier is beginning to
          pull loose from it's ceiling mount. Plaster cracks and rips
          away.
          
          Lisa swings back and forth, dangling.
          
          Beth stands on the landing. She looks at terrified Lisa,
          then up at the ceiling mount. It won't take Lisa's weight
          much longer.
          
          And both women know it.
          
          Lisa hangs by one hand, reaching out with her other hand to
          Beth who could pull her to safety.
          
                                 LISA
                    Please....
          
          Beth considers. Then, as if coming out of dream, she slowly
          reaches out to Lisa. Their hands lock together. Beth slowly
          pulls Lisa toward her, toward safety.

                    now.
          
          And, trusting, Lisa lets go.
          
          But so does Beth!!!
          
          With a look of horror on her face, Lisa falls through space.
          The soundtrack goes dead silent as we go into slow motion.
          
          Down, down, down Lisa falls. Her arms and legs flop around
          like a marionette with its strings cut, clawing the air.
          
          The fall seems endless.
          
          Then... Lisa hits the glass dining table with her back.    Her
          whole body buckles. The surface of the table ripples.
          
          In slow mo, the glass shatters and explodes around Lisa,
          framing her entire body, forming a halo around her head.
          Sound returns -- the sound of breaking glass -- and it's
          deafening.
          
          The table gives way and Lisa lands hard on the marble floor,
          her skull cracking. Her back is probably broken but she's
          still conscious.
          
           ying there, Lisa stares up at Beth on the landing as glass
          bounces and TINKLES around her.
          
          The two enemies lock eyes.   Beth's face is impassive.
          
          Lisa opens her mouth, trying to speak.
          
          And that's when the chandelier breaks loose.

          Beth watches without emotion as the chandelier plunges
          downward and hits Lisa in the chest with a radiantly
          beautiful shower of crystals. It kills her on impact.

          On the landing, Beth stares down at Lisa's body, splayed
          under the chandelier like a broken doll. Lisa's eyes are
          open but they're dead.
          
          Beth, stoic, just stands there, looking down.

          Beth comes down the stairs, taking no notice of Lisa's

          opens the front door.

          back as Beth goes to her car and opens the driver's door.
