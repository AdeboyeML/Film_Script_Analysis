    The CAMERA is MOVING SLOWLY DOWN a long basement corridor.
    We hear a narrator (Werner) --

                             WERNER (V.O.)
               On his 35th birthday, I decided
               to tell Julius Benedict the truth
               about himself...

    HOLD ON sign:   "Top Secret - Authorized Personnel Only."

                             WERNER (V.O.)
               It wasn't that he was the product
               of a scientific experiment.

3   INT. LABORATORY - DAY (PERIOD - 1952)                       3

    A white coated scientist (PROFESSOR WERNER) is studying a
    bizarre piece of equipment that looks suspiciously like
    a milkshake blender. With him is another scientist --
    (this is TRAVEN -- already imperious, already a prick).

                             WERNER (V.O.)
               An experiment designed to produce
               a physically, mentally and
               spiritually superior human being.
               I explained that to him when he
               was two years old.


4   INT. MEDICAL EXAM ROOM - HALF A DOZEN MEN - DAY (PERIOD) 4
    Most of them young, 20s and 30s. They are being given a
    medical examination by a group of doctors, including
    Werner.
                             WERNER (V.O.)
               And it wasn't the complexity of
               Julius's parentage. He knew that
               unlike other little boys, he
               didn't have just one, but half
               a dozen fathers, all very
               distinguished men.                                   *

    (PERIOD)

    Not your Hollywood type. This is obviously a lady of
    character and talent. Her name we will come to learn is
    MARY ANN BENEDICT. She is on a hospital bed and being
    readied for surgery.

                            WERNER (V.O.)
              Nor was it about the
              extraordinary woman chosen to
              be his mother...
                                                                    *

    Traven emerges, sadly shaking his head. Werner tries to
    enter the room -- Traven won't permit it.

                            WERNER (V.O.)
              Julius had long lived with the
              tragic news that she died giving
              birth to him.

    up a plump, serene, smiling baby boy.

                  What Julius didn't know, until
                  this very moment, was that, about
                  a minute after he was born...
     Another nurse emerges from the delivery room, holding up
     a second INFANT -- this one is SCREAMING with rage.

                                WERNER (V.O.)
                  His mother gave birth to another
                  baby...

     The serene baby.    Any mother's joy.

     The angry baby.    Fuming.
     PULL BACK to reveal:
     The two of them are in the same crib.
     The leg of the angry baby. It suddenly lashes out,
     connects with the rump of the serene baby:
     The serene BABY.    Starting to CRY.
     The angry baby.    All smiles now.
     HOLD ON the two babies in their crib as the following

      Werner, now 70, is bent and old. Julius, in peasant garb
      is a marvelous-looking human being.

                                 WERNER
                          (speaks with an
                           Austrian accent)
                   He was sent to an orphanage in
                   Los Angeles. At the same time I
                   brought you here to the island.
      Julius isn't listening.    His eyes shine.

                                 JULIUS
                          (amazed)
                   I have a twin brother?!!

                   something I called it Vincent --
                   I called my first computer
                   Vincent!

      Julius strides along a windswept path, followed by
      Werner. The ocean spread out below them is vast and
      empty. This island is far from anywhere.
                                 WERNER
                          (fretting terribly)
                   You've been here since you were a
                   baby -- you know nothing of
                   America --
                              JULIUS

                   primitive, not like us.

      It's a blend of modern technology and the tropical
      environment -- floor-to-ceiling book-cases, computers, a
      hammock shrouded in a mosquito net.

      Julius is hurriedly packing a small leather suitcase,
      watched by Werner.
      Werner hands over a photograph: it's a picture of a
      younger Werner, Traven, and the six fathers.
                                 JULIUS
                   It's your only copy --

                   sentimental -- yours may be
                   practical --
      Julius slips the photo into his suitcase.
                                 JULIUS
                   Thank you -- I'll miss you.

               It was an honor to study under
               you, Master.
      Without warning, the Oriental tries to strike Julius in
      the face with the side of his hand, but Julius blocks
      the blow.

                             ORIENTAL

               Ahhh, always on guard. You have

                   Well, if a woman loved my brother
                   enough to marry him, she might
                   have a sister who'd feel the same
                   way about me. That often  happens
                   with twins, you know.
                                 WERNER
                   Julius -- please -- don't get
                   your hopes up. Your brother
                   doesn't even know you exist.

      Julius gets in the boat and casts off. The boat takes off
      like a streak. Julius, in perfect rhythm, increases the
      pace. The boat is almost flying across the water.

      Carla snuggles against Vince as he surveys the bedroom
      like a house-proud new owner.

     Noticing an expensive gold lighter on the dresser top,

     Vince steps out and  jauntily climbs over the rail. It's
     very clear he likes  the danger, being on the edge. In

     Flying through clear, blue skies.


29   INT. AIRPLANE - ON STEWARDESS                               29
     Coming down the aisle, checking the passengers, as we
     hear:

                             JULIUS (V.O.)
                      (singing)
               'Put on your red dress, baby
               'Cause we're going out tonight...'
     A few passengers turn and look back at --


     JULIUS
     seated in the rear, still in his peasant garb, the bamboo
     suitcase resting on his lap. He has his headphones on
     and is singing along to the music, his eyes closed and
     his head bobbing.
                             JULIUS
                      (singing)
               'I better wear some boxing gloves,
               In case some fool might want to
                 fight.'

     The STEWARDESS removes his headphones and considers
     Julius with amusement.
                             STEWARDESS
               I knew you were trouble the second
               I laid eyes on you.
     Julius stares up at her, speechless and mesmerized.

                             JULIUS
                      (realizing)
               Sorry -- I've never heard this
               music before -- I love it.                             *
     She sighs, leans over him, fastens his seat belt, while
     Julius gazes down at her ample cleavage.

                             STEWARDESS
               The captain wants us to buckle our
               seat belts because we're expecting
               a little turbulence.

                             JULIUS
                      (reading her name
                       tag)
               Thank you, Betty Lou.

                                STEWARDESS
                  I bet you're a football player.

                                JULIUS
                  Actually, I'm a horticultural
                  botanist, a mathematician, and a
                  philosopher.

                                  STEWARDESS
                  Right.    And I'm a brain surgeon.

     As the Stewardess heads back up the aisle, a MAN jumps
     up, grabs her around the neck with one arm and brandishes
     a gun in his other hand.

                                  HIJACKER (MAN)
                           (to passengers)
                  Nobody   moves, or else we're gonna
                  have a   serious draft in here.
                           (turns to another
                            stewardess)
                  Get the   captain. I want to
                  discuss   our final destination.

     He continues maneuvering the Stewardess up the aisle.
     His back is totally to Julius now.


     JULIUS
     turns to the terrified elderly woman beside him who's
     clutching a hardcover Bible in her lap.
                                JULIUS
                         (whispers)
                  Excuse me, ma'am.

     As he takes the book from her, quickly draws back his
     arm --

     HIGHJACKER

     The gun at the panicked Stewardess's head, he continues
     slowly up the aisle, shouting for everyone to freeze, not
     even to think about moving --
     -- now a hardcover book comes rocketing through the air,
     hits him in the back of the neck and he goes limp, fall-
     ing across some seats, the gun dropping from his hand.

     grabbing him, all of them brave and heroic -- a lot of
     commotion -- shouts of "I've got him," "Don't move," etc.

     OLD WOMAN

     as Julius smiles reassuringly, returns her Bible to her,
     sits back in his seat.
                                JULIUS
                         (gently; calming her)
                  His mischief shall return upon his
                  own hand, and his violent dealing
                  shall come down upon his own head
                  -- Psalm 7:16.
     In front now, there is a lot of activity as various pass-
     engers hold the Highjacker, almost arguing over who's in
     control. Julius looks at them a moment, puts on his
     headset, closes his eyes and is soon bopping away to the
     music.

     As Vince sidles into a booth, watched by a BARTENDER who
     clearly dislikes him.

                               BARTENDER
               It's him.    He's back.

     A pretty young cocktail waitress called MARNIE turns and
     stares daggers at Vince. Marnie is a fireball of a girl,
     all brass and sass on the outside and sweet as cotton
     candy on the inside, sort of a Jean Harlow valley girl.
     She approaches Vince, who greets her with effusive
     warmth.
                             VINCE
               Marnie! How are you?        Is your                       *
               sister around?                                            *

     Marnie pointedly scoops up the tip left by the previous
     occupants of the booth.
                                                                         *
     Marnie starts to wipe down the table, spilling crumbs into
     his lap.
                             MARNIE
               You total Linda's car. You pawn                           *
               her stereo. You declare us as                             *
               dependents on your tax return!?

                              FEMALE (O.S.)
               Vince!   I knew you'd come back!

     Marnie's sister, LINDA, also a cocktail waitress, slips
     into the booth and gives Vince a big kiss. Linda,
     although just as attractive as her younger sister, has a
     completely different personality: she's trusting,
     dependent, and legally blind when it comes to Vincent.
                             VINCE
                      (to Linda)
               I am so sorry for all the

                  money. Just take care of my
                  station for a minute.

     Marnie exchanges an exasperated glance with the Bartender
     and walks away. Linda distances herself a little from
     Vince in the booth, not meeting his eyes.

                  What did you do, Vince?

     Vince takes Linda's hand between his and stares into her
     eyes.
                                LINDA
                  Don't look at me like that...
                  Don't do that with your eyes... I

      knees. His journey abruptly ends as he now faces KLANE
      #2 -- BOB -- considerably larger than his brother inside.

      Vince is thrown in, forcefully, into a table.        He crashes
      onto the floor.

      A booth at the back of the restaurant: Vince is seated
      with the two Klane brothers. He hands over the money he
      picked up from the BMW -- $4000. The smaller Klane counts
      it quickly.

50    INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - DAY                                   50
      An elderly MOTHER SUPERIOR looks dubiously at Julius as
      he stares out the window down on the playground.
      He turns and examines the dormitory which is lined with
      metal cots. He points to a cot near the door and smiles
      fondly.
                                 JULIUS
                   And that's where he must have
                   slept.

                                 MOTHER SUPERIOR
                   How did you know?

                                 JULIUS
                   It's the one I would have chosen.
                   It's next to the fire
                   extinguisher. In case of a fire,
                   I could have given the alarm, and
                   saved the other orphans.
                                 MOTHER SUPERIOR
                   We've only had one fire at St.
                   Charlotte's. Vince Benedict
                   started it, we like to think by
                   accident.

51   INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE - DAY                          51
     The Mother Superior opens a file cabinet and begins
     rummaging through it, watched by Julius.

                             JULIUS
               Tell me about him. Was he a good
               athlete? Did he like chess and
               poetry?

                  I'm certain that God had a purpose
                  when he created Vincent Benedict,
                  but it had nothing to do with
                  chess or poetry.

     She locates a file, removes it; the only thing inside it
     is a photograph, which falls to her desk.
                                MOTHER SUPERIOR
                  That's odd... the contents of his
                  file are missing.
     Julius picks up the photo -- a 13-year-old boy leering up
     at an attractive young nun.

                                 JULIUS

                                MOTHER SUPERIOR
                  So did Vincent. He disgraced
                  Sister Maria, who had to leave
                  the order. Then he stole all the
                  money from our library fund and
                  ran away.

     The Mother Superior is trying, tactfully, to close the
     door on Julius.

                  But I have to find him.   Where do

     A bunch of people are in the cell along with Vince. Most
     noticable is an amazingly tall, slender, muscular black
     man. We're talking a SEVEN FOOTER here. A bad tempered
     Seven Footer.

     patch, but make no mistake, Vince is tough.

     Julius is already seated in one of the cubicles, separated
     by a glass partition from the prisoner's side. This is
     a big moment for Julius and he looks around as various
     prisoners are brought in --
     -- and as a look of pleasure comes across his face --

     trying to fight his excitement, watching as the prisoner
     moves toward him --
     -- then past him.

     Julius, confused, stares for a moment straight ahead
     across the partition, and now he's more confused --

     -- because Vince is sitting across from him, dubiously
     studying him, arms crossed. There are phones on both
     sides of the glass partition. The room, it should be
     noted, is busy.

     Julius makes a smile.
     Vince just stares.

     Julius mutters "excuse me" and gets up, goes to a nearby
     GUARD.

     side of the cubicle and sits, he is overcome with the
     wonder of it all.

                  moment all my life...
     It's hard to tell what Vince is feeling but clearly the
     look of dubiousness is gone. He picks up the phone on
     his side, gestures for Julius to do the same. As Julius
     does, Vince at last speaks:

                  Benedict -- I like my work.
     He pulls  Vince groggily up and this time he's going for
     Vince's  face. He takes his time setting Vince up,
     getting  his chin at just the right angle. He's concen-
     trating  on his work, so he doesn't pay much attention to
     the fact  that the elevator door has opened behind.

     Klane draws   his fist back and is about to drive it into
     Vince's face   when he suddenly pauses; the expression on
     his face, at   first puzzled, becomes increasingly agonized
     as we REVEAL   that --

     JULIUS

     Behind him, is squeezing a pressure point on Klane's
     neck, rendering him unable to punch out Vince. Julius
     maneuvers the Klane off of Vince and forces him down
     onto the floor.

                                JULIUS
                         (quietly)

                  I don't know what the problem is,
                  but I'm sure it can be solved
                  without resorting to violence.

     Julius lets go of Klane, who gets to his feet, turns
     around, and instantly lets fly with his fist at Julius's
     face.

     Here Julius effortlessly blocks the punch and goes right
     on talking.
                                JULIUS
                  You moved too soon.
     Klane spins and aims a karate kick at Julius's head.
     Julius coolly ducks it and sends Klane crashing into a
     wall.

                  kind of enemy I am.

     Klane drags himself to his feet while trying to gauge what
     he's up against.

     Klane isn't buying it. Seeing a fire axe inside a GLASS
     CASE on the wall, he SMASHES through and grabs it.

                   Hi, Vincent.

                                 VINCE (V.O.)
                   There's a supermarket up ahead.
                   Take your foot off the gas and
                   very -- very -- very gently
                   put it on the brake.
                                 JULIUS
                   The brake -- right.

      As Julius makes a sharp turn -- on two wheels -- into
      the parking lot and comes to a dramatic squealing stop
      that spins the car around 180 degrees.
      Vince's car pulls in a moment later. He gets out, gazes
      at the skid marks as a smiling Julius approaches.

                   The brakes worked just fine!

      Adjacent to the express checkout lane where Linda and
      Marnie now join the line. Julius picks up a Playboy and
      begins speed-reading it. His eyes widen at what he's
      reading, and seeing, and when he reaches the centerfold
      he audibly gasps.

                   Excuse me.
      She reaches past Julius to take a copy of Cosmopolitan.
      Julius drops the Playboy, which falls open on the ground,
      with the centerfold revealed. Flustered and blushing, he
      bends down to retrieve it, watched by Marnie, who can't
      take her eyes off the sheer beauty of his physique.

      Julius tries to stuff the centerfold back into the maga-
      zine, but only manages to crumple it. Linda and Marnie

                  our fathers was a famous football
                  player, another one was a physicist
                  at M.I.T. --

     Vince, playing along, rolls his eyes.

                  Naturally... so all of our dads
                  were these big shots and Mom was,
                  like, Superwoman, but she didn't
                  survive our delivery. I got sent
                  to an orphanage while you were
                  brought up in a tropical paradise
                  by this scientist you do research
                  for, but who doesn't actually pay
                  you because you don't need money.
                         (a beat)
                  Did I leave anything out?
     Julius ignores Vince's cynicism.

                                JULIUS
                  I think it's important we try to
                  find our fathers.

                  Why are you being so immature
                  about this?                                            *

                  Do you know how many times I've
                  heard stories like this? It's
                  every orphan's fantasy: 'My real
                  Mom and Dad were rich and
                  beautiful, but there was a mix-up
                  at the hospital and I got switched
                  with another baby... But one day
                  there's going to be a knock at the
                  door and there they'll be with
                  open arms, crying... "My darling!
                  My treasure! We didn't know! How
                  can we make it up to you?"'
                         (a beat)
                  I'm telling you this for your own
                  good, Julius. It's a crock.
     Vince goes over to a trunk, rummages in it, comes up with
     a dusty mouldering folder from which he removes a yellow-
     ing piece of paper.

                  I liberated this from my file at
                  the orphanage. Read it and weep.
     Julius takes the paper and reads aloud.

                                JULIUS
                  Dear Sister Anderson, your request
                  for orphans benefits for Vincent
                  Benedict has been denied.
                  According to our files his mother
                  did not die during birth. We have
                  a current address for her at 172
                  Canyon Glen Drive, Los Angeles.
                  Vincent's case seems to be one of
                  simple abandonment and as such he
                  is inelligible for aid.
     Vince snatches the paper back.    Julius stares at him,
     just stunned.
                                VINCE
                  That's right, Julius, she abandoned
                  me.

                  You've known all this time where
                  she was and you never contacted

                  I don't know about your momma,
                  Miss Perfect of 1952, but my momma
                  was a slut, and if she's still
                  alive, I hope she's in a lot of
                  pain. She dumped me once -- no
                  way she gonna get a chance to do
                  it again --

                  Vincent, if they lied to us about
                  Momma for all these years, maybe
                  they lied to her, too. We must
                  find her, we must check this

     Suddenly, Vince's    living room WINDOWS EXPLODE in a burst
     of GUNFIRE. Vince     and Julius hit the floor and try to
     shield themselves    from the SHATTERING GLASS. The sound
     of a CAR SQUEALING    away outside the window.
                             JULIUS
               Everyone seems so angry in America.

                  Let me explain something to you.
                  I have a reputation to uphold.
                  People put their trust in me
                  because they know I always deliver
                  the goods and I always come back
                  with the money. This whole thing

                  He asked us if we were going
                  surfing. He was a jerk.

     Webster suddenly gets to his feet, smiles.                         *

       house number against the address on Vince's letter.

B88    EXT. STREET (BEL AIR ESTATE) - DAY                         B88

       An imposing security gate stands wide open as several
       cars roll through it and climb up the long driveway.
       Julius, checking the address, sprints in after them just
       before the gates close.

C88    EXT. BEL AIR ESTATE - DAY                                  C88

       As Julius jogs up to the front door. The circular
       driveway is filled with cars. Adults and children are
       visible on the grounds; it appears that a party is in
       progress. Julius rings the doorbell, which is answered
       by GRANGER, a man of about 60; he's dressed in swimming
       trunks and sports an impressive physique. He's holding
       the hand of a five-year-old GIRL.

       Julius and Granger look at one another and, for a brief
       moment, hesitate, as if each of them finds the other
       vaguely familiar.

                   I'm terribly sorry to disturb your
                   party and I realize this might
                   sound strange, but I'm looking for

      Granger reacts; he's speechless. Julius hands him the
      group photo of his mother, six fathers, Traven, and
      Werner.

                                 JULIUS
                   She was my mother.
      Granger looks at the photo, then at Julius.
                                 GRANGER
                   You're Mary Anne's son?

                   Isn't that you, Grandpa?

      Julius gently takes the photo from the Girl, looks at the
      face she pointed at, then at Granger. Now Julius is
      speechless -- Granger is one of his fathers!

                   Why don't you go help your grandma
                   with lunch, honey?

      The little Girl disappears back inside.       Granger, clearly
      shaken, looks at Julius.

                afraid to have children. She took
                it real hard when they told her
                you died. She even stopped
                painting. Did you know she

      Al and his wife Carla are tied to chairs in the dining
      room. Webster sits between them, drinking a cup of
      coffee and calmly loading his gun.

      As Vince comes out of     his house, carrying a sleeping bag,
      pillow, some clothing,     a six-pack of soft drinks. On top
      of the stack is a map     of the Western U.S., which he's
      studying while singing     the song "Houston":

      Vince tosses the items into the back seat of the Caddy,
      just as Julius jogs up the driveway and collapses against
      the Caddie door. He's red in the face, completely
      drenched with sweat, gasping for breath, having run all
      the way from Bel-Air.

                   Look, Julius, I'm in kind   of a
                   hurry. Sammy wants me to    take
                   the car to Houston. Much    bigger
                   bucks when you raffle for   charity
                   in Houston.
      Julius takes the map from Vince, looks at it.

                   up my phone bill. Throw wild
                   parties. Take advantage of me.

      Vince gets in behind the wheel. Julius marches around
      the car and gets into the passenger seat beside him.

                                 JULIUS

      Vince, realizing that Julius won't be denied, tries a
      new tack.

                   You know -- you're right. This is

                   -- be right back --

      Julius leaps out of the car and bounds into Vince's
      apartment. As soon as the door shuts behind him, Vince
      hits the CADDY'S IGNITION and begins SQUEALING out of
      the driveway in reverse... just as Linda and Marnie's
      car pulls into it, blocking his path. Vince slams his
      hands down onto the wheel in frustration.

      Linda and Marnie get out of their car, singing "Happy
      Birthday." Linda approaches Vince with a birthday
      cake, complete with lit candles.

      Vince gets out of the car and, although it kills him,
      tries to put on a happy face for Linda.

      Marnie snoops around, examines the group photo lying on
      top of Julius's suitcase. In the b.g. she can hear
      Julius singing in the shower --

                    'cause we're going out tonight...'
      She puts the photo back as the sound of SHOWER STOPS.
      Julius emerges from the bathroom, clutching a towel
      around his waist, and freezes at the sight of Marnie.

       deeply. His biceps bulge and one of the shirt sleeves
       tears apart at the seams.
       Vince watches through the rearview mirror, knows what's
       going on. Or rather, what isn't going on, yet. He drives

                    If you choose to bluff, you must
                    be prepared to have your bluff
                    called.
                                  BURT KLANE
                    This is no bluff -- Asshole --

       Burt gives a small head signal and two very large men
       stand up from a nearby table. They each grab one of
       Julius's arms.

                                  BURT KLANE
                    Meet my cousins.
                           (to the Klanes)
                    Get these jerks outside.

       Just then, so sudden and quick that it's over as soon as
       it begins, Julius double kicks the seated Burt and Bob in
       the head. They're out cold before they realize they've
       been attacked.
       Without stopping, Julius whips his arms together in front
       of him bringing Sam and Dave into painful contact with
       each others' head. They, too, are now out cold.
       Vince uses this opportunity to stomp, with all his might,
       on the toe of Morris who's busy watching Julius dismantle
       his relatives. Morris screams and lets go of Vince, who
       runs to the nearby pool table, grabs a cue and slams it
       over the head of the now hobbling Morris. All five
       Klanes are out cold.

                    How many of those... rules do you

                                  JULIUS
                    Quite a few. They were formulated
                    by a Kendo swordsman in the 17th
                    century, but their philosophical
                    underpinnings can be applied to
                    many other areas of life.

143   INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                         143
      Julius is unpacking his suitcase on one of the beds --
      arranging his books on the bedside table, hanging his
      clothes on hangars. Vince watches him, glances at
      his watch, and begins to edge towards the door.
                                 VINCE
                   Uh... we got cable TV, a fully
                   stocked bar, free ice -- we're
                   in great shape.
                                 JULIUS
                   Where you going?
                                 VINCE
                   I thought I'd just go and tuck
                   Linda in for the night.

      Vince picks up one of Julius' heavy tomes.
                                 VINCE
                   Maybe read her a bedtime story.
                          (with a wink)
                   Don't wait up for me.

      Julius looks fondly at his brother as he sees him to
      the door.
                                 JULIUS
                   What a day, Vincent, we visited
                   our birth place. We bought new
                   clothes. We danced the waltz.
                   We get into a fight -- We've got
                   this great room.
                          (heart-felt)
                   It just doesn't get any better
                   than this.

      Vince gives Julius a sly look as he lets himself out of
      the room.
                                 VINCE
                   Oh yes it does.
                                                      TIME CUT TO:


      CLOSE - A TV SCREEN
      showing a clip of the "3 Stooges" at their moronic best.

      JULIUS

      sits watching the TV, nodding in amusement, laughing,
      slapping his knee in pleasure.

      He returns his attention to the book he's been reading
      -- something the size of a dictionary -- but can't help
      returning his gaze to the TV.
      He freezes at the sound of a KNOCK at the DOOR. Embar-
      rassed by what he's been watching, he quickly turns off
      the TV, and goes to answer the door, still holding the
      book.
                                 JULIUS
                          (calling out)
                   You forgot your key -- I know.
                   Lucky I waited up.
      Julius opens the door, revealing Marnie, who walks in
      right past him.

                                 MARNIE
                   Hi -- Vince and Linda want to be                        *
                   alone, so I'm afraid I'm going to
                   stay here. Which bed should I
                   take?
                                 JULIUS
                          (stunned)
                   Either... I always sleep on the
                   floor.

      Watched by Julius, Marnie pulls the curtains shut, kills
      the overhead lights, all the while providing him with
      glimpses of various parts of her anatomy. She gets into
      one of the beds, turns off the bedside lamp.
                                 MARNIE
                   Good night.
                                 JULIUS
                   Good night.
      Julius puts the blanket and pillow from the other bed
      onto the floor between the two beds, then shuts off the
      other lamp.
      Silence...
                                 MARNIE
                   This mattress is awful.
      Getting out of bed, she pulls the blanket and pillow
      with her as she steps over Julius, who tries not to look
      up, and gets into the other bed.
                                  MARNIE
                   Sorry.   Good night.

                                 JULIUS
                   Good night.

      Silence...

                                 MARNIE
                   This mattress is just as bad as
                   the other one.

      She gets out, again dragging the blanket and pillow,
      puts them down on the floor next to Julius. She crawls
      under the blanket, turns her back to him.

                                   JULIUS
                   Good night.

      Silence.     Marnie shivers, chattering her teeth.

                                   JULIUS
                   Are you cold?

                                   MARNIE
                   It's alright.
                                 JULIUS

                   baking.
      Julius strips it off and hands it to her. She puts it
      on and pulls the blanket over her shoulder. Again she
      shivers.
                                 JULIUS
                   You still cold?


                                   MARNIE
                   Just my legs.

      Julius lies there, thinking about it.
                                 JULIUS
                   Well, I could give you my...

                                    MARNIE
                             (sitting up)
                   Thanks.

      Julius reaches under the blanket, removes his bottoms and
      passes them over. Marnie puts them on under her blanket.

                                 JULIUS
                   Anything else?
                                 MARNIE
                   I'd love a glass of water.

                                    JULIUS
                             (realizes that he's
                              now nude)
                   Right.

      He wraps his blanket around his waist, goes into the
      bathroom, comes out with a glass of water. He hands it
      to her.

                                MARNIE
                   Oh, great!

      She starts stripping off everything she's wearing.      Julius
      averts his eyes.

                                 MARNIE
                   Do you mind if I share your
                   blanket? -- Mine's all wet.

                          (gulps)
                   No -- that would be okay.
      They both lie down under his blanket.      Silence...
                                 MARNIE
                   Could we switch sides?   I like to

                                JULIUS
                   Sure.
      She starts to roll over Julius, then pauses directly
      above him and looks him dead in the eye.
                                 MARNIE
                   Can I ask you something for a

                                 MARNIE
                   Do you like me? I mean, even a
                   little bit?

                                 JULIUS
                   I... I'm crazy about you, Marnie.
                   But there's something about me
                   you ought to know.

      Marnie tenses, expecting the worst.
                                MARNIE
                   What?

      Linda, dressed in a negligee, comes out of the bathroom
      area. Vince, wearing pajamas, is on the floor, legs
      curled under the bed, doing sit-ups.

       of her life. Julius is equally dazed and happy.

       In the mountains, which dramatically tower over a lovely,
       wide park-like area with a large adobe building and a few
       smaller satellite huts.
       The car drives up a long, dusty driveway to the entrance,
       which is protected by high gates. Our principals exit
       the car.
       They approach the fortress-like gated entrance, gazing
       around at the magnificent scenery. Both men carry flowers
       and seem self-conscious about the prospect of finally
       meeting their mother.

                    Mary Anne Benedict never
                    understood why people wanted to
                    buy her paintings. But for a
                    brief period they were considered
                    valuable. She used the money to
                    buy Whispering Pines so that young
                    artists would have a place to
                    work.

      He drives inside a large warehouse, parks, gets out and
      looks warily around. He opens the trunk, unzips the
      sleeping bag, revealing the merchandise.
                              BEETROOT (O.S.)
                Step away from that car, Mr.

      Vince turns to see Beetroot coming out of the warehouse,
      accompanied by his BODYGUARD carrying an attache case and
      holding a gun. The Bodyguard pats Vince down.

      Vince closes his eyes, waiting for the bullet that he
      knows is coming. When he opens his eyes the Bodyguard
      is holding the attache case open to show him the five
      million dollars.

      Vince takes the case, gazes at the money, snaps it shut.
      He can't believe he's pulled it off. Beetroot and the
      Bodyguard get into the Cadillac.
      The Caddy speeds away while Vince clutches the attache
      case to his chest and does a little dance of triumph.
      The big score at last! TWO SHOTS RING out. Vince freezes
      and sees --

       He lights it with his lighter.       Suddenly Julius smells
       something. Bad.

                           (smiling)
                    But your luck just ran out.
       A stream of gas is pouring out of the drums that Webster
       punctured whilst he was shooting at Vince. It runs in a
       broad stream across the warehouse floor, right beneath
       Julius and Vince's feet. Webster is holding his
       cigarette out, ready to drop it in the fuel and incin-
       erate them.

                                  WEBSTER
                    Drop the gun and give me back the
                    case, or we're gonna have
                    ourselves some barbecued Benedict.
       Julius drops the gun and Vince slowly hands back the
       case. Webster smiles and backs off down the stream of
       gas, still holding out the cigarette. He stops at the
       very edge of the building.
                                  WEBSTER
                    Well, I guess this is goodbye.
       He raises the cigarette, ready to throw it.
                                  JULIUS
                    Wait a minute.
       Webster looks up.

                                  JULIUS
                    You've forgotten something.
       Webster grips the case tighter.

                                  WEBSTER
                    I don't think so.

       Julius nods.

       by one arm.

       smashes into Webster's back, and then dumps on him,
       burying him in rubble.

       JULIUS
       drapes his arm around Vince as they walk towards the
       unharmed attache case full of money.

                    What about it?

       Vince gets to his feet.

       They rush into each other's arms.

177   INT. VINCE'S OFFICES - NIGHT                                177
      CLOSE A NEON SIGN

      It reads: "The Benedict Corporation." CAMERA PULLS BACK
      to reveal we are -- inside Vince's office.                        *
      The offices have been redecorated -- they look serious,
      professional, and are filled with computer terminals and
      other high-tech equipment.
      Julius is sorting through a stack of mail while Vince
      talks to a prospective client on the phone. Both of
      them are wearing suits and ties.
                               VINCE
                        (into phone)
                 What do we do? Most people on this
                 planet cause problems -- the Benedict
                 Corporation solves them. We're a
                 consulting firm -- a think-tank --
                 sort of like the Rand Corporation
                 -- only smarter!
                        (a beat)
                 Tuesday at three. See you then.

      Vince hangs up the phone, loosens his tie.     Julius
      excitedly holds up a stack of letters.
                               JULIUS
                 Look at this, Vince -- proposals
                 from the Red Cross, UNICEF, the
                 World Health Organization -- we
                 should only have clients who do
                 humanitarian work.

                               VINCE
                 Just as long as they pay -- we're
                 not running a charity, you know.

      The sound of FOOTSTEPS down the corridor, then a
      tentative KNOCK at the DOOR.

                               VINCE
                 Come in!

      THE DOOR

      As it opens, revealing Mary Anne Benedict, not looking at
      all like the gardener they met in Whispering Pines.


      VINCE AND JULIUS
      Confused, just look at her for a moment.

      Clearly overwhelmed, struggles to find the appropriate
      words.
                                 MARY ANNE
                   It's so incredible I'm not even
                   sure which one of you is which.
      VINCE AND JULIUS

      Look at one another, then at Mary Anne, realizing at
      the same time that she's their mother!
      THREE OF THEM

      Staring at each other in silence, until --
                                 MARY ANNE
                   You see, I didn't believe you, I
                   mean who would believe a story like
                   your story -- crazy -- They lied to
                   me all these years... And they lied
                   to you... But you found one another
                   ... And you found me... Please --
                   God -- one of you say something.

      Mary Anne nods.

                            (softly)
                   Mamma?

      She nods again.

                   MOMMA!
      They both run to Mary Anne and hug her for all she's
      worth. They're laughing, crying, holding each other.
      Slowly, we...

       JULIUS
       Watching them. Now there are tears on his face, too.
       He goes to them, gently puts his arms around them, lifts
       them both up in to the air, cradling them.
       They're laughing.   They're crying.   They're holding each
       other.

       No words are necessary.

       Smiling happily.    PULL BACK to reveal we are --


       EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY
       In front of the merry-go-round. Werner purchases a hand-
       ful of tickets from the vendor, hands one each to Mary
       Anne, Linda and Marnie.
                                 MARY ANNE
                   I just can't get over how alike
                   they are...
       The three women all turn and gaze affectionately back
       at --

       VINCE AND JULIUS

       Walking along the path behind them. We assume it's them
       the women were discussing, until we notice that each of
       them is pushing a double-stroller with identical twin
       babies inside! It's the twin children that are the
       source of the women's wonder, and Vince and Julius' as
       well.
       Vince and Julius both yawn simultaneously.

                                 JULIUS

                   Sceaming in stereo.

      They both stop the strollers, look down lovingly at their
      kids, begin fondling them. Vince and Julius, simultan-
      eously flip identical baby rattles and shake them at
      their twins.

                                 JULIUS
                          (to baby #1)
                   I think you need your diaper
                   changed.
                          (to baby #2)
                   What a surprise -- so do you.

      Vince becomes aware of the condition of his kids'
      diapers.

      They both start pushing their strollers again.
                                 JULIUS
                   Just think what we'd be like if
                   we'd been raised together.

      and Marnie hand their sons up to them, watched proudly
      by Mary Anne.
      The merry-go-round starts moving, and the last image we
      see is of Vince and Julius on the horses, holding their
