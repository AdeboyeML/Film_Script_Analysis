          FADE IN ON:

          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT -- MOVING

          A DISTORTED IMAGE of downtown city streets at night.
          This is not a FISHEYE LENS, but the REFLECTION in the
          mirrored surface of a helmet visor.

          EXT. LUXURY BUILDING - NIGHT

          A near-future MOTORCYCLE stops near a dramatic HIGH-RISE
          RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. The rider, clad in black leather,
          climbs off his machine. We'll call him the ASSASSIN.
          He flips up his VISOR. His face is scarred, stubbly. He
          conceals himself in an alcove, eyes never leaving the
          building's entrance.
          A uniformed DOORMAN opens the high-rise's lobby door for
          a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in a TUXEDO and TRENCHCOAT.
          THE ASSASSIN has been waiting for this. He removes what
          looks like a rifle scope from his jacket, aims it at

          TUXEDO.
          SCOPE POV - focusing on TUXEDO'S FACE, magnified. A
          digital readout: "SCANNING..." Then a long SERIAL
          NUMBER reads out and the name, "LIONEL ALEXANDER CANTER,"
          along with other personal information below.
          THE ASSASSIN puts away the scanner scope, satisfied. He
          reaches a hand into a pocket, withdraws a mysterious
          DEVICE. The size of a first generation cellphone, it has
          a military look, with a clear sliding panel over safety
          switches and buttons.
          The ASSASSIN hurries toward TUXEDO, but before he can

                         REACH HIM--
          A sleek, futuristic LIMOUSINE pulls up and TUXEDO gets in
          the back. They're gone in an instant.
          The ASSASSIN, frustrated, dashes for his MOTORCYCLE. He
          starts it and pursues the limousine.

          FORMAL CROWDS, a RED CARPET, signs for an OPERA. The
          LIMOUSINE approaches.

          INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

          TUXEDO leans forward to the DRIVER, a muscular, handsome
          man in a suit named ARMANDO.

                         TUXEDO
          I'm not really in the mood for
          opera, Armando.
          ARMANDO nods knowingly pulls back into traffic.

          You read my mind. Let's not
          mention this to my Dad...
          As he speaks, he passes a few BILLS over the seat.

          EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

          THE LIMO moves through this seemingly deserted area,
          pulls up near a STEEL DOOR with a spray-painted X.
          TUXEDO emerges sans jacket and tie, his dress-shirt open.

                         TUXEDO
          I can find my way back.
          ARMANDO nods and pulls away. TUXEDO moves toward the
          entrance, says a word into an INTERCOM with a
          SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. The door opens within moments, he
          disappears inside.
          THE ASSASSIN parks his bike, a few steps behind. Tuxedo
          has vanished through the STEEL DOOR before he can catch
          up with him.

          The ASSASSIN takes off his helmet, tries the door. It
          won't move. He buzzes the intercom. The DOOR slides
          open a crack--
          THE BOUNCER is a huge, bald man with JET BLACK skin, RED
          EYES and TEETH that glow fluorescently. The THROBBING
          BEAT of MUSIC within. The BOUNCER narrows his eyes.

                         BOUNCER
          This is a private club.

                         ASSASSIN
          I just need to talk to--
          THE STEEL DOOR has already shut in his face.

          INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

          POUNDING MUSIC. BODIES SLAM together in a brutal mosh
          pit, MEN and WOMEN. All are young, some beautiful,
          others extremely decorated and pierced. They tear at
          each other brutally, trying to do real damage. On the
          edges of the pit, individual FISTFIGHTS go on. An
          incongruous CHANDELIER overhead, gilt-edged MIRRORS on
          the walls-- the FIGHTERS SLAM INTO and SHATTER them.
          A HARD-CORE BAND plays on an elevated stage. The
          MUSICIANS are heavily punked out, in outlandish clothes,
          with pierced faces, tattoos and body make-up.
          IN A VIP AREA, a balcony elevated above the stage,
          numerous BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE at tables. Many are making
          out, gay, straight, threesomes-- orgies happen up here.
          TUXEDO sits by himself. He raises a GLASS TUBE attached
          to a CORD, one of a few leading into an ELECTRONIC DEVICE
          on the table. As he brings the tube close to his own
          neck, an ARC of electricity jumps to his skin. His
          features go slack, a shudder goes through him. Then he
          lowers the tube with a smile. He's using a JACKER-- a
          sort of electro-shock hookah. A SHOUT over the MUSIC:

                         BLONDE
          Mind if I join you?
          A stunningly beautiful BLONDE in edgy, dramatic clothes
          stands nearby. Tuxedo, recovering from the hit, gestures
          graciously for her to sit. She picks up one of the
          cords, gives him a sly smile. She opens her mouth,
          SPARKS fly to her tongue and--

          RAIN pours down as TUXEDO and the BLONDE burst out the
          door, laughing. He pushes her against a brick wall, they
          grope each other hungrily, hands inside clothes, getting
          drenched in the warm downpour.
          WITH THE ASSASSIN, wearing his HELMET with the VISOR UP,
          as he approaches the entwined couple. TUXEDO hears him,

          ANGLE ON the alley's mouth as we hear the BLONDE'S
          SCREAM. Seconds later she staggers out, clutching her
          head, and collapses to the pavement. We hear an ENGINE
          START from the alleyway.
          THE ASSASSIN emerges on his bike, rides directly over her
          body unconcerned-- and ROARS into the night.
          CAMERA PULLS UP to--

          great number of SUPER-CELL TOWERS and DISHES,
          considerably larger than the ones we see today.
          CAMERA PICKS UP SPEED, moves quickly to a run-down part
          of the city, tenements and vacant lots. MOVE DOWN and
          through a third-story window of--

          A dark, decaying hallway. A MAN and a WOMAN move
          stealthily up the stairs, LASER-SIGHT GUNS in hand.
          The man is THOMAS GREER, the woman JENNIFER PETERS. Both
          are about 30, handsome, athletic. Greer's spent his life
          in law enforcement. He's smart and able, wants things to
          make sense-- but as the world changes around him, he
          feels he's losing the thread. PETERS is junior to Greer,
          her attitude's professional but rigid, by the book.

          GREER, in the lead, waves PETERS up. They approach a
          door at the end of the hall. We see now that their
          windbreakers read "FBI."
          GREER kicks open the door--

          INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT

          Lit by CANDLES and KEROSENE LANTERNS, SMOKE HANGS in the
          room. We glimpse BODIES hanging from the ceiling in
          CHAINS. GREER and PETERS train their LASERS around the
          place, disturbed by the scene. A flash of MOVEMENT in a
          bedroom and a CRASH--
          THE PSYCHO who lives here has kicked over a LANTERN, FIRE
          spills across the floor. We glimpse a surprisingly good-
          looking guy, grinning maniacally. He dashes across the

                         ROOM--
          GREER squeezes off a couple of SHOTS. The PSYCHO's too
          fast, he LEAPS through a cracked WINDOW.

          RAIN has let up. The PSYCHO FALLS thirty feet into a
          pile of soft DIRT and TRASH. He rolls to the bottom,
          gets to his feet and runs.

          running from between buildings across a street--
          WHAM! He's hit full-on by a SEMI, his body FLIES through
          the air. He LANDS HARD on cement, but amazingly is still
          alive. He tries to get up, but--
          GREER plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast
          against the ground. Greer, still wiping at this eyes,
          points his weapon at the PSYCHO's head.

          side. The back of his skull is smashed. Instead of gore
          and brains, we see torn GRAY PLASTIC and dense CIRCUITRY,
          oozing pinkish hydraulic fluid at his neck.
          We're in a world of SURROGATES, remotely operated
          synthetic humans (also known as SYNTHs). These are not
          artificially-intelligent robots-- each is linked directly
          to a human being, miles or hundreds of miles away.
          Surrogates are distinguishable from flesh-and-blood

          an inhuman quality. Without a human mind sending and
          receiving impulses, they are completely inert.
          Suddenly the PSYCHO comes to life, spins his head around

          the door as they move into the place.
          It's minimalist, nothing on the walls. Empty pizza
          boxes. Skirts, stockings, high-heels strewn around

          core CLUB. FAST FORWARD to the ALLEY, making out with
          TUXEDO. This is a recording of recent experience, as
          seen through the eyes of the BLONDE.

          The POV reels, we hear the Blonde's SCREAM-- and STATIC

          GREER (the real one) sits at the table in a bathrobe,
          finishing the food his surrogate brought home. As he
          empties the remains into the trash--

          woman, looking ridiculously good for someone who's just
          gotten up. Maggie starts at the sight of Greer, begins
          to retreat. It's as if she's stumbled upon him in the
          bathroom.

          COLUMNS containing ELECTRONIC PARTS, FLUID SACS and
          TUBES. ARMS and LEGS, elaborate hydraulic apparatus, are
          attached by ROBOTIC ASSEMBLERS. There's no skin yet,
          just the exposed machinery, made mostly of plastic and
          microcircuitry.
          A WINDOW overlooks the factory floor. Here, TECHNICIANS

          GREER and PETERS stand before WATERS, who looks like a

          INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY -

          GREER and PETERS go down metal stairs into-a sprawling,
          high-tech surveillance center. COMPUTER WORKSTATIONS are
          arranged radially, at the hub is a central COMMAND
          STATION with large SCREENS facing in all directions.
          GREER and PETERS move toward the center. At first we see
          just the head and shoulders of scattered FIGURES, staring
          at the monitor screens.
          ON SCREENS - these are POV SHOTS from thousands of
          SURROGATES, the Feds can have a direct surveillance feed
          from any surrogate's eyes.
          We glimpse POV SHOTS of-- driving-- drinking in a bar--
          intimate conversations-- watching an old movie-- a sex
          partner's face.
          The FIGURES before the screens are WATCHER DRONES,
          specialized surrogates-- a head and shoulders mounted on
          a wheeled contraption attached to tracks. This enables
          them to move and stop at any monitor quickly, surveilling
          dozens of surrogates. Males and females, but all have
          the same faces.
          PETERS stares in wonder at this voyeur's paradise. GREER
          grabs her arm to keep her from getting hit as a WATCHER
          tracks past. The Watcher ignores them, intent on work.
          They mount stairs into the RAISED HUB that overlooks the
          work floor. An extremely corpulent human being-- BOBBY
          SANDERS-- sits on a reinforced rolling chair, which he
          keeps in almost constant motion, eying the DOZEN SCREENS
          up here at once.
          ON SCREENS - POVs of actual criminal activity-- frantic
          running across a park-- a burglary in a darkened jewelry
          store-- packets of drugs changing hands.
          BOBBY eats candy, guzzles soda, waves them off for a
          moment, speaking rapid-fire into his HEADSET.

          --a couple of SQUAD CARS catching up with him.
          He hits the THROTTLE. ANOTHER COP CAR roars around the

          from his pocket. Without poking his head out, he aims it
          in the cops direction.
          He PRESSES A BUTTON. A row of RED DIODES GLOW on the
          device as he sweeps it across the alley, but it emits no

          A HUGE CHAIN-LINK FENCE, topped with barbed wire,
          stretching across the whole city, just a hundred yards
          away. PORTRAITS of the PROPHET (the man we heard on the

          PEDESTRIANS, PARAMEDICS pushing a body past on a gurney.
          From Greer's now human perspective, surrogates seem
          artificial, appearance too perfect, eyes empty of souls.
          This should be reeling, vertiginous.
          PETERS pauses, seeing Greer is having a panic attack. He
          has trouble speaking.

          immediately dives for cover as--

          PEDESTRIANS are plastered across the grill and embedded
          in the windshield.

          flying or runs over them. It spins sideways into a WALL
          with the FBI SEAL overhead.
          The DRIVER leaps out, armed with a MACHINE GUN. He's
          clearly a DREAD, angry and deranged. He starts SHOOTING
          at anything that moves.
          PETERS crouches for cover as BULLETS shatter GLASS and

          NEWS READER VOICE (CONT'D)
          His motive is unclear at this point,
          but may be a response to the recent
          incident at the Baltimore human
          reservation...
          GREER, in the back seat, takes in this news grimly. The
          CABBIE has been glancing at his own monitor in front.

                         CABBIE
          Goddamn Dreads... sure you don't
          wanna change your mind?

                         GREER
          I'm sure.

          EXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - DAY

          Late afternoon. GREER emerges from a TAXI near the same
          gate we saw earlier. Greer wobbles, steadies himself
          against the car as he pays the CABBIE-- a DRONE
          SURROGATE, built into the seat.

                         CABBIE
          You OK, man?

                         GREER
          Just a little carsick.
          The TAXI pulls away, Greer heads for the GATE.

          EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - DAY

          AT THE GATE: METAL SIGNS read "HUMANS ONLY - NO
          SURROGATES." GREER goes through a big,.old-fashioned
          (present-day) METAL DETECTOR, the light flashes GREEN. A
          DREAD GUARD waves him past. Greer gestures toward one of
          the many IMAGES OF THE PROPHET to be found in the rez.

                         GREER
          Where would I find the, the what do
          you call it, the Temple?

          As Greer crosses the rubble-strewn no man's land, he
          pauses, sickened as he sees--
          --the burned-out HELICOPTER HULK, now sprayed with
          GRAFITTI. "PIGS DIE," etc. And just beyond this--
          --what's left of GREER'S SURRIE, half the head blown off
          with fried electronics hanging out. It's been lashed to
          a makeshift crucifix, made from the bent CHOPPER BLADES.
          The clothing is shredded, the remains spray-painted.
          GREER, wary of being recognized, continues on.

          EXT. RESERVATION STREET - DAY

          GREER walks through a poor but surprisingly pleasant
          neighborhood-- rowhouses, gardens. Very few cars.
          DREADS look like ordinary working-class folks.
          A BARBECUE, a group of RESIDENTS laughing and drinking.
          Greer inhales the SMOKE as he passes, smiles to himself.
          A couple of FRIENDLY DOGS trot curiously after him for a
          moment, then return to the barbecue. GREER, not paying
          attention, brushes past an ELDERLY MALE PEDESTRIAN.

                         GREER
          Excuse me.

          No problem.
          A PLAYGROUND a short distance on,.LOTS OF KIDS shrieking
          and running. Greer pauses here, taking this in. These
          are the first children we've seen, outside of a TV ad.
          A CLOUD OF DIESEL SMOKE from a decrepit BUS. Greer
          CHOKES on this, but doesn't seem displeased. His body
          language has become more relaxed as he gets further into
          the rez, getting his land legs back.

          A cavernous convention center, thousands of folding

          GREER moves down a path in this expanse of greenery. He
          comes to an open lawn with a fairly large CROWD gathered,
          illuminated by a FLAMING TORCH.
          THE PROPHET is speaking. He stands before a platform
          atop wooden scaffolding, firewood piled below. A
          formidable ring of BODYGUARDS stands between him and the
          gathered throng of DREADS.

                         PROPHET
          --serving faithfully beside us in
          the cause of humanity. _I had the
          privilege of hearing his confession
          shortly before his death.
          GREER has pushed his way gently toward the front to get a
          look at the BODY atop the funeral BIER.
          The corpse atop the bier is that of JACK STRICKLAND, eyes
          closed, hands folded.

                         PROPHET (CONT'D)

          day for which we are all
          preparing, the day I promise you
          is close at hand...
          So saying, the PROPHET lifts the torch and touches it to
          the base of the PYRE, which ERUPTS IN FLAME.
          CLOSE ON STRICKLAND as the FLAMES lick up around him.
          LATER, the BIER consumed in FIRE, the MOURNERS
          dispersing. THE PROPHET is moving away, HANDLERS
          surrounding him. GREER tags along-- but one of the

          doubles over. He seems amazed at the sensation, the
          pain. But he recovers, throws a wild punch at Miller an d
          misses by a foot. [Violence for Greer in human form

          disconnected, they're stationary on their tracks. THE
          GLOWING MONITORS remain on, showing random scenes,
          unwatched. MOVEMENT at the elevated entrance--
          --PETERS spins and FIRES HER HANDGUN in that direction.
          The intruder retreats. We now see a couple of SURRIES
          have already been dropped here, sprawled on the staircase

          Ow! Easy, I'm only human.
          As Armando relaxes his grip a bit, GREER flexes his left
          arm-- then gasps and clutches his chest, as if having a

          The CLERK goes stock still, he's checked out-- he's
          obviously making the call from home. Greer shoves the
          inert body aside, it falls flat. He reaches for the
          elevator key, snatches it up when--
          ARMANDO wraps his one good arm around Greer's throat from
          behind, choking him. They stagger backward, GREER aims
          the gun behind his head and FIRES, blowing a HOLE in
          Armando's forehead. GREEN COOLANT, FRIED ELECTRONICS fly
          from the exit wound.
          They topple to the ground together. GREER struggles from
          the frozen surrie's grip, clutching his ear, deafened by
          the gun's loud report.
          As Greer gets to his feet, the DOORMAN enters, takes in
          the tableau-- the gun-wielding man, the two surries on
          the ground-- and dashes outside again.
          GREER hurries for CANTER'S PRIVATE ELEVATOR. He turns

          inside the roof overhang, a fifteen-foot drop.
          GREER squeezes his eyes shut, steeling himself for what
          he must do. He lowers himself to hang onto the edge,

          momentum going the right way--

          GREER has almost given up hope when he starts at a noise
          and spins, ready to shoot at--
          --the AUTOMATED VACUUM humming around a corner. As it
          moves past his feet, Greer registers--

          discovers a LATCH at waist level, the wall becomes a

          GREER enters, moves immediately for his wife's bedroom.

                         GREER
          Maggie--?
          He KNOCKS gently, then tries the door-- it isn't locked.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/MAGGIE'S ROOM - DAY

          The room is DIM, there's a FORM huddled in the bed,
          SOBBING, covers pulled up. GREER moves slowly toward
          her, speaks in a soothing voice.

                         GREER
          Maggie, it's me.
          She pulls away from his touch at first, struggles.

                         MAGGIE
          No! Please no, don't look at me...
          Greer pulls away the covers to reveal the REAL MAGGIE.
          She's pale, emaciated and malnourished, tears running
          down her face. She shrinks away from him.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          No Tom, I don't want you to...
          It doesn't matter to Greer-- he takes her in his arms and
          holds her close.

                         GREER
          It's OK, it's OK...

                         MAGGIE
          No it's not...

                         GREER
          Ssh. It's just us now.
          Slowly, she puts her arms around him, weeping against his
          chest. PULL BACK and--

          EXT. GREER'S BUILDING/NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

          --OUT THE WINDOW. MOVE to show exterior DOORS OPENING
          and GREER'S NEIGHBORS EMERGING, blinking in the
          unfamiliar sunlight. Most wear robes, sweatclothes.
          They're all ages, some overweight, others homely-- it's
          almost a relief after all the young, perfect people.
          DOWN THE STREET, OTHERS EMERGE, regard each other warily,
          like people after an earthquake. Some begin speaking to
          each other for the first time, in whispers at first,
          others take in the SUNSET which bathes the neighborhood
          in orange light.

          FADE TO BLACK.
