    INT. SETH'S CAR - MORNING

    Seth, seventeen, a bit heavyset, in the midst of a sad
    attempt at growing a goatee and clearly a terrible driver,
    cruises along while fiddling with the CD player. He pulls out
    his cell and dials.

    volleyball team sweat pants and a tank top. He looks up from
    her breasts to her face: she is staring right at him. He
    immediately looks to the front of the class, embarrassed.

     other five fall to the ground, cracking on impact, and
     spraying beer all over the place. Fogell scrambles to stop

     The two police, OFFICER SLATER, 30 and experienced, and
     OFFICER MICHAELS, 25 and learning, are talking to the
     Cashier. Fogell stands beside them, nervous and afraid.

     The cashier breaks down crying and walks off to the back of
     the store. The officers look at each other.

                  Apparently, she has an exam.

     back at the cops. He nods.

               Hah. Probably could have found a way. But
               a good general rule is only take people
               in you want to ride with. And whiny

      the windshield. The car screeches to a halt and Seth slides
      off the front of the car.

      Seth lies motionless, still holding one of the detergent
      jugs. The cap is knocked loose and beer is spilling all over

      A little GIRL runs out and books it into the house. From
      inside the tent, another kid starts kicking at Seth.

      The guys turn and see a crazed, slightly overweight FATHER in
      his underwear running at them with a baseball bat. Fogell and
      Seth scramble to their feet as the Dad takes a swing at them,
      narrowly missing them.

      Seth and Fogell run to the backyard gate and try to open it.
      They can't.

      coming for them. Seth swings the detergent jug at the Father,
      knocking him on his ass. He quickly gets up and charges,

                   from her parents and her and Helen have

      Evan enters the bathroom and slams the door shut, a bottle of

      back the rest of his beer and marches into the room Nicola is
      dancing in.

      He walks up to Nicola, who is by far the best-looking girl in
      the room, and starts dancing with her. She looks a bit thrown
      at first, but after a few beats, she seems to like it.

      Jules eyes Seth suspiciously. Seth just looks at her, smiling
      drunkenly.

                   Why not? I haven't conversed in ages.
                   Let's do it.

      Jules walks out of the kitchen. He finishes off his beer and
      then, happy as shit, drunkenly dances out of the kitchen and
      after Jules.

      Evan practically holds Helen up, almost dropping her several
      times, as they stumble into Jules' bedroom. Helen puts down
      the tequila and starts kissing Evan, but it's not nice
      kissing, it's sloppy porno kissing with way too much tongue.
      After a few moments Evan pulls away and looks at the
      remarkably drunk Helen.

      Helen yanks him onto the bed and starts sloppily kissing him
      again. Evan doesn't know what to do. She tries to take off
      Evan's shirt, but is way too inebriated to undo the buttons.
      Evan yanks it off.

      Helen stands up and starts to waver back and forth. She looks
      like she's about to tip over, but she catches herself and
      sloppily tries to strike a sexy pose like a model.

      Evan watches in dread as she starts to strip, pulling her
      shirt over her head, completely failing to look sexual.

      As Evan watches the tragedy unfold, he grabs the bottle of
      tequila and takes a big swig. Helen sits on the floor and
      concentrates on untying her shoes.

                   Shit. Can you, like, slip out?

      Helen tries to squeeze her feet out, but she can't. She grabs
      a pair of scissors off a desk.

                   Whoa. Fuckin'...careful.

      Helen laughs as she staggers to her feet and start kissing
      Evan. He starts taking off his pants.

      Jules and Seth step out onto the front porch. There is no one

                   saying that as we stopped you from being
                   mugged, a crack-head stole our cruiser
                   and did God knows what with it.

      The cops and Fogell push the cruiser towards a small, but
      steep, hill. They shove it over the edge and watch it roll.
      It gains speed and smashes into a tree, shattering the
      windows and crushing the front of the car.

                    (to Evan)
                Yeah, I...um...I'm sorry, about all that.
                Thanks for being such a gentleman.

      There is a moment of silence.

                          SETH
                You look good with a black eye.

      They all chuckle a little.

                          JULES
                Thanks, smart guy. That's why I'm here. I
                have to go to Macy's to get a shitload of
                cover-up for the grad photo.

                          SETH
                    (mortified)
                Oh man...

                          HELEN
                Yeah, and I'm going to Linen Brothers to
                buy Jules a new comforter.

                          EVAN
                Oh! I have to get a comforter too, for
                college.

                          JULES
                    (flirtatiously, joking)
                So, you gonna come with me to Macy's and
                buy me my cover-up, or what?

                           SETH
                Yes! Definitely. I'd love to. I had such
                bad acne last year, I became an expert on
                the stuff.

                          EVAN
                You could get your college pants there.

                          SETH
                Yeah, but wait...you drove me here, Evan
                drove me here, how do we-

                          JULES
                I've got my dad's car. I'll take you
                home, and Evan can give Helen a lift.

                          HELEN
                That sounds good.

                Sweet.

      Seth and Evan look at each other, odd smiles on both their
      faces. They didn't blow it.

                          SETH
                So, uh, I'll call you later.

                Yeah man, have a good one.

                          JULES
                Come on, Seth. Let's go.

      Jules pulls Seth away. Evan and Helen start walking in the
      opposite direction.

      As they walk away from one another, Seth and Evan look back
      and give each other a small and yet emotionally-charged wave.
      A SLOW, GUT WRENCHING SOUL SONG STARTS TO PLAY. They look as
      though they're never going to see each other again.

      As Jules and Seth walk into Macy's and Helen and Evan descend
      an escalator, the music swells to a mind-fuckingly awesome
      crescendo, and we humbly fade to black...
