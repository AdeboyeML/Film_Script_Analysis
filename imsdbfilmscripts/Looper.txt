          EXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS - DAY

          A pocket watch. Open. Ticking. Swinging from a chain.
          Held by a young man named JOE in a clearing beside a Kansas
          corn field. Sky pregnant with rain.
          Waiting. He checks the watch, removes his earbud headphones,
          stands.
          Without much ceremony a BLOODIED MAN in a suit appears from
          thin air, kneeling before the young man. Hands and feet
          tied. Burlap sack over his head. Muffled screams, gagged.
          With no hesitation Joe raises a squat gun and blows the man
          apart with a single cough of a shot.

                         LATER
          Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck.
          Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing FOUR bars
          of gold taped to the dead man's back. Joe takes them.

          EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

          Massive, in the middle of nowhere. Black smoke.

          JOE (V.O.)
          Time travel has not yet been
          invented. But twenty five years
          from now it will be. Once the
          technology exists, it will be
          relatively cheap and available to
          the public at large. And so. It
          will be instantly outlawed, used
          only in secret by the largest
          criminal organizations. And then
          only for a very specific purpose.
          Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse
          from the flatbed.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It's nearly impossible to dispose
          of a body in the future. I'm told.
          Tagging techniques, whatnot. So
          when these future criminal
          organizations in the future need
          someone gone, they use specialized
          assassins in our present, called
          loopers.

          INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

          Cavernous and empty. Joe carries the body to an iron hatch,
          opens it, and dumps him in.

          JOE (V.O.)
          And so. Thirty years from now. My
          employers in the future nab the
          target, they zap him back to me,
          their looper. And I do the
          necessaries. So the target has
          vanished from the future, and I've
          just disposed of a body that
          technically does not exist. Clean.
          The body slides down a long chute. Vanishes in a little
          flare of angry red fire.

          EXT. DINER - DAY

          A sidecar roadside diner in the middle of nowhere. Joe's
          truck in front.

          INT. DINER

          Nearly empty, Joe at a booth listening to headphones. A
          waitress sets down coffee.
          Her bright red name tag: BEATRIX.

                         BEATRIX
          Bon jour, Joe.

                         JOE
          Bon jour, Beatrix.

                         BEATRIX
          How's the French?

                         JOE
          Slow. How's the coffee?

                         BEATRIX
          Burnt.
          Cream in the coffee. White clouds boil deep down.

          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY

          Joe's truck zooms from the flat fields towards a mid sized
          city on the horizon.

          INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

          Grungy, heavily fortified. Joe enters and puts his gun in a
          basket labeled âLOOPERS - BLUNDERBUSSESâ
          Slips down a narrow passage, which ends at a steel wall with
          a protruding duct taped camera and microphone.

                         JOE
          Two, Jedd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          Joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket.
          A small narrow slot slides open in the wall, and gnarled old
          hands take the gold bars. It slides shut again.
          In the background the front door to the pawn shop dings open.
          The slot slides open and Jedd's hands push a wad of cash.
          Joe pockets it, and backs around Dale, another Looper.

                         DALE
          Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight?

                         JOE
          Yup.
          Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves
          his gun and exits.

                         DALE
          Four, Jedd.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

          High ceilings, big clean windows overlooking a sooty city.
          Joe finishes smoothing out an oriental rug and scoots a
          coffee table in place over it.
          Puts a bebop LP on a turntable.

                         LATER
          On the bed, shooting at the ceiling with his fingers.

                         JOE
          Bon jour, mademoiselle. Bang!

          INT. CAR GARAGE - EVENING

          Suit-and-tie Joe pulls a tarp off a cherried-out 1992 Mazda
          Miata. Lingers over it. His baby.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY EVENING

          Joe drives through the sooty city streets. A muted beep, and
          he fishes a matchbook sized screen from his pocket.

                         JOE
          Yeah Seth? Yeah. Ok.

          EXT. STREET CORNER - EARLY EVENING

          A young looper named SETH on the side of the road, kneeling
          beside a motorcycle without wheels called a SLAT BIKE. He
          kicks it in frustration.
          A VAGRANT approaches and SETH pulls a gun, identical to
          Joe's.

                         SETH
          Walk around! Around, I'm not
          kidding. Wide around, ya shit.
          The vagrant crosses the street. Joe pulls up.

                         JOE
          Seth.

                         SETH
          Hi Joe.

                         JOE
          That's new.
          Seth kicks the bike.

                         SETH
          Thanks. Goddamn thing. You going
          to the Belle?

          EXT. DRIVING THROUGH THE CITY STREETS

          Seth and Joe.

                         JOE
          Slat Bikes are all junk. Stick
          with rubber on the road.

                         SETH
          Yeah but Gat Men pull up in them,
          they get respect.

                         JOE
          They get respect cause they run the
          town. How much did that thing set
          you back? How much?
          Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm.

                         SETH
          I was gonna pull up in it.
          Tonight. Heads or tails, call it
          in the air.
          The coin lifts, floats several inches in the air, quivering.

          with me instead.
          Joe notices the floating quarter.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          And don't, if we're going in, don't
          do that.

                         SETH
          Chicks dig TKs.

                         JOE
          It's tacky, don't do it.
          Seth catches the quarter, sullen.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          When the TK mutation started
          appearing in the general populace
          it was on every magazine - âNext
          Step in Evolution, what's next.â
          Everyone got tested. But turns out
          this was it, and now it's just a
          bunch of assholes thinking they're
          blowing your mind by floating
          quarters.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT

          A shitty but bright nightclub in the heart of the city.
          Flashy people shiver behind a velvet rope, huge black cars,
          big rollers in odd suits swept in by the bouncers.
          All trying very hard to be big time.

          JOE (V.O.)
          Big heads. Small potatoes.
          Drives past, revving the engine.

          Down the street. Joe tosses the keys to an attendant.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE

          A dingy stage door in back of the building. Joe and Seth
          ring a buzzer, smile for a camera, and the door opens.

          INT. COAT CHECK

          A long dark hallway leads to a tiny antechamber with a coat
          check room used for guns. BIG CRAIG leans out of it, and
          stops the two.

          Seth backs towards the door, Joe stops him.

                         JOE
          We'll stick backstage, just meeting
          up. In and out.

                         BIG CRAIG
          Packing your blunderbusses?

          Hardly. Right Seth?

                         SETH
          Hardly. I'm with Joe.
          Big Craig pats them down, waves them in.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          A claustrophobic maze of twisty halls and passages.
          DANGEROUS MEN and half naked SHOW GIRLS weave through.
          Joe expertly navigates the turns, going someplace. Seth
          struggles to keep up.

                         SETH
          So are we - hey -
          Joe has vanished. Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men.

          INT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE

          An ornate parlor, LACY WOMEN entertaining men. A velvet
          curtained doorway leads to back rooms.
          Joe lingers by the entrance, watching one girl in particular,
          SUZIE. Bold dark eye makeup. A BIG MAN leads her off
          through the curtains. Joe's eyes drop. Pained.
          A fat MADAME doesn't look up from her ledger.

                         MADAME
          No loopers on Wednesday, Joe. Gat
          Men only.

          Curious, Joe follows. They pass Seth, who tails after them.

                         SETH
          Hey, Joe. We leaving? Cuz, what-
          Joe?
          And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men.

          INT. STEEP STAIRS

          A starkly lit steep stairwell leads down. Five or six young
          loopers gather at the top. Joe and Dale join them.

                         JOE
          What?

                         DALE
          Zach. In there right now, with
          Abe.
          Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his
          eyes.

                         JOE
          For what?

                         DALE
          He closed his loop.
          This lands heavily on Joe.

                         JOE
          No shit?
          The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another
          looper, steps out. An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder
          then retracts into the door.
          The loopers watch him in awe.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          There's a reason we're called
          loopers.

          EXT. ABANDONED LOT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Zach stands waiting, checking his wristwatch, gun in hand.
          Obviously performing a similar ritual to Joe's.

          JOE (V.O.)
          Time travel in the future is so
          illegal, that when we sign up for

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          If our employers in the future get
          busted up by the law, their first
          priority is going to be erasing any
          trace of their relationship with us
          ever existing.
          A flash of light, and a HOG TIED MAN with a sack over his
          head kneels in front of Zach.
          Zach fires, and the man's chest explodes.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          So. If they're busted, and if
          we're still alive 30 years from
          now, they'll find our older self
          and zap him back to us, like any
          other job.
          Zach rips open the back of the corpse's jacket, revealing
          several dozen gold bars taped to his back.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          This is called closing your loop.
          Zach freezes. Looks at the shape of the corpse's face
          through the sack.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And you get paid out a mythic
          amount of money, and you get a
          handshake and get released from
          your contract. Enjoy the next 30

          This job doesn't tend to attract
          the most forward thinking people.

          village in a field.

          IN THE CAR
          Joe stares at the kid, frozen. A moment. Then spins the
          wheel, peels out. The Loopers hoot and shout. Joe's Miata
          screams along the dirt road bordering the vagrant village,

          base.

          INT. WAITING ROOM

          Dingy with a few benches. In one wall three steep stairs
          lead to a high door. Kid Blue knocks. Muffled voice from

                         WITHIN:

          ABE (O.S.)
          Two minutes.

                         LATER
          Joe and Kid Blue on benches, facing each other. The Kid
          stares daggers and spins his gun. Joe tries his best not to
          engage.

                         KID BLUE
          You know why they call that pea
          shooter a blunderbuss? Cuz it's
          impossible to hit anything farther
          than 15 feet, and impossible to
          miss anything closer. A gun for
          fuck up turkeys. Not like a gat.
          A gat has range. Accuracy.
          His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than
          Joe's blunderbuss, long and slim and chrome.

                         JOE
          Alright, cut it out Kid. You're
          gonna blow your foot off again.
          The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins.

                         KID BLUE
          You're right, it'd be real easy for
          it to accidentally go off.
          He clicks the safety off. Joe shifts uncomfortably.

                         JOE
          C'mon.

                         KID BLUE
          Don't disrespect a gat man, Looper.
          Joe stifles a chuckle.
          In a flash, the Kid stands and pistol-whips him across the
          face. Joe falls back. The Kid raises his gun at Joe.
          Frozen in that tableau a moment, the Kid savors his victory.
          Lowers his gun.

          ABE (O.S.)
          What the hell is going on out there-
          The high door swings open fast, SMACKING Kid Blue hard on the
          side of the head. His gun goes off, firing into the wall.
          Out of nowhere three gat men burst into the room, guns drawn.
          ABE, a sallow man in his 50s, appears in the high doorway.

                         KID BLUE
          S'alright, s'alright.
          Humiliated, the Kid tries to stand, but falls over again.
          After a moment everyone realizes what's happened, and the
          tension breaks.

                         ABE
          Alright. Joe.
          Joe climbs into the doorway. Kid Blue stands shakily.

                         ABE (CONT'D)
          You didn't shoot your other foot
          off, didja kid?
          The door closes, and the gat men laugh at the Kid.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Cluttered, with a big desk. Joe sits, Abe hands him a
          handkerchief for the ugly gash on his cheek.

                         ABE
          My great grandfather always told my
          grandfather, men's like spiders.

          careful of.

          JOE (V.O.)
          This man is from the future. He
          was sent back here by the mob, a
          one way ticket, to run the Loopers.
          That's low effort even for Abe, so
          to pass the time he recruited some
          real muscle, the Gat Men. Now he
          runs the city. Any other city,
          that'd be impressive.
          Abe settles in his chair. Regards Joe.

          Well then I'll talk a little. You
          know you were the youngest looper I
          ever hired? You looked goddamn
          ridiculous they said, the
          blunderbuss up to here on you. But
          I remember they brought you in, I
          forget what it was for,

          Watch shop.

                         ABE
          That's yeah, you had rolled one of
          our fronts, a watch shop. And they
          had you, your arms pinned, this
          kid. Like an animal. But you
          looked at me, your hair stuck to
          half your face so just this one eye
          looking at me. And I thought
          what's this kid lived through, what
          he had taken away from him. What's
          he lost. And I could see, like
          seeing it happen clear as seeing
          it, the bad path in front of you,
          the bad version of your life. Like
          a vision I saw it happen, you
          turning bad. So I cleaned you up
          and put a gun in your hand. I gave
          you something that was yours.

          yours. And I remember that kid,
          and I think when you ask yourself
          you ask who would I sacrifice for
          what's mine, I think Seth is deep
          and cozy inside that circle.

          Joe gets home. Empty, quiet. Everything in place. He goes
          to the rug, pulls it aside. Opens the safe.
          All the gold, and nothing else. One bar juts from the side,
          knocked out of place.
          He pushes it back, and when he lifts his fingers they have a
          bright smear of fresh red blood.

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

          A hunched figure sprints through an abandoned lot towards a
          train yard.
          It is a 55 YEAR OLD SETH. He limps up to a razor-wire fence
          bordering the train yard.
          Surveys the sharp wire, rips the lining from his jacket and
          wraps first his left hand then his right.
          But stops.
          On the palm of his right hand, a WEATHERED SCAR. Clearly
          carved in the shape of an arrow, pointing down to his wrist.
          Old Seth squints at it, confused. He pulls back his sleeve,
          revealing his clean bare forearm.
          Then his face changes.
          Because his arm is no longer bare. Suddenly, out of nowhere,
          more intricate scarring has appeared down its length.
          The scars spell out clearly: âBE AT 75 WIRE STREET IN 15

                         MINUTESÂ
          Old Seth's breath returns, jagged. He pulls his sleeve up
          and hoists himself up the fence, climbing fast.
          He reaches the top, gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist
          himself over... and stops again.
          His right hand is missing a finger. The ring finger is just
          gone, its stump worn with age.
          Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well.
          A freight train whistle moans. The cars, open and inviting,
          leading out of town. Behind him, the city.
          Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it
          takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing
          has changed to a ragged whistle.

          He lifts his hand, now with just two fingers, to his face...
          and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be.

          EXT. CITY STREETS

          The train yard far in the distance. Old Seth RUNNING back
          into town.
          He looks down at his right hand, fingerless now but for his
          thumb.
          He speeds up, desperate. Cuts through an alley. And has no
          right hand, just a stump.

                         OLD SETH
          No no no no no!
          A bell-like DING. Old Seth spins, sees a WEDDING BAND lying
          on the sidewalk.
          He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left
          hand, stuffs it in his pocket, sobbing.
          Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the
          street and into the headlights of an oncoming car.
          The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows
          Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face.

          IN THE CAR
          Old Seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out the
          DRIVER. Jams on the gas.
          Speeding through the streets, hands slipping on the wheel.
          His pant leg crumples. Empty boot tangling with the pedals.

          EXT. WIRE STREET

          The car hits a pole.
          Out climbs what's left of Old Seth, his face mangled, missing
          a foot, one arm gone to the elbow.
          Street sign - WIRE STREET. The numbers, 45.
          He runs. Howling, missing his tongue. Arm totally gone.
          Then falls as his leg goes to the knees. And he's crawling,
          an animal form, bellowing wordlessly.
          Makes it to an iron street-side door. 75. And with his one
          arm, slams it.
          Slumps against it, heaving. After a long moment it swings
          open.

          With no hesitation, a BLAST from the darkened doorway, and
          Old Seth's head mists open. He slumps to the pavement.
          Kid Blue steps from the doorway, drags the body inside.
          Deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a DOCTOR in a surgical
          frock smeared with bright red blood. The door SLAMS.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          Joe wakes with a start.

          EXT. CORN FIELD

          Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away. He takes his
          stance. Earbud headphones, the drone of French lessons.
          A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears kneeling
          before Joe. Joe raises his gun without hesitation and shoots
          the man in the chest.
          Walks to the body, flips it. The man's hands, tied and
          purplish. Joe hesitates. Puts his hand next to them.
          Similar.
          He flips the man onto his back, stares long and hard at the
          shape of the man's face under the cloth sack.
          Tears it off. An older Asian man's face, frozen in terror.
          Joe smirks, the spell broken. His face hardens.

          INT. PLANT - DAY

          Joe watches the Asian man's body slide down the hatch and
          vanish in a puff of distant fire.

                         BEGIN MONTAGE:
          1. Joe in the club, drinking, watching more loopers
          celebrate.
          2. Joe in the field, he shoots a hog-tied man.
          3. Joe in his floor safe, setting more gold bars.
          4. Joe in the field, BANG.
          5. Joe in the club, watching Suzie with her red hair.
          6. Joe in the field, BANG.
          7. In the plant, a body sliding into the fire.
          8. Joe in the field, BANG. BANG. BANG. His face more
          determined with each shot.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

          Our montage comes to an end suddenly and all is silent.
          Joe in the corn field, in his stance, ready to draw.
          But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks his watch,
          confused.
          2:30 and change. Waits. Watching the blank space where the
          man is supposed to appear.
          Hand on his gun. Breathing shallow. Something is wrong.
          2:32. An eternity. Then, there he is.
          But different. Not kneeling. On his side, so he flops over
          and has to straighten himself. The man's hands are UNTIED.
          Holy shit.
          Joe raises his gun, scared. Time slows. Finger tightens on
          the trigger.
          Then he sees: the man has NO SACK ON HIS HEAD. And the face
          that stares back at Joe is his own.
          57 YEAR OLD JOE. His eyes fixed on Joe.
          And for just one split second, Joe's face slackens, and his
          finger eases on the trigger.
          It's all the hesitation Old Joe needs. He throws his body
          into a spin.
          Joe snaps out of it, and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
          The shot catches Old Joe square in the back, and the impact
          blows him forward. But instead of blood beneath his torn
          jacket's back, we see the layered gold bars spill out. They
          caught the blast.
          In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joe's fingers grab
          one of the bars, he spins again, throwing handfuls of dirt
          and the bar back towards Joe.
          Joe flinches, again just for a moment, and when his eyes
          focus again and his arm steadies the gun it's too late.
          Old Joe is on top of him, with a heavy blow knocking the gun
          aside, and with an even heavier one swinging down on Joe's
          head, a fist and then

          THE CORN FIELD, HOURS LATER
          Joe wakes. Blood caked on his face. Headphones beside him,
          still squawking French lessons. Sits up.

          Oh god.
          Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no
          truck. Joe staggers to his feet, shaky. Head thick. But
          realizing.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Late to my own funeral.

          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

          Joe runs, shaky, towards town. Fishes his phone-device from
          his pocket, chucks it.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          Across the street, Joe huddles behind a car, breathing hard.
          Looks up at his lit window. Debating.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY

          Joe walks silently towards his apartment door.
          It is ajar. He hesitates. Knows he shouldn't.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Holding his breath, Joe edges in. It's ravaged, torn to
          pieces. The floor safe is open, about half the gold bars
          missing. But the apartment seems empty.
          Exhaling, Joe works quickly. Knocks a tile aside, pulls a
          wad of cash from the wall. A heavy jacket from the closet.
          Eyes dart around the room - what else? But too late --
          footsteps in the hallway. Joe ducks into the bathroom just
          as Kid Blue and a TALL GAT MAN enter the apartment.

          INT. JOE'S BATHROOM

          Joe crouches. Outside, Kid Blue piles the man's arms full of
          gold bars.

          KID BLUE (O.S.)
          That's twenty four there. I'm
          keeping count.

          TALL GAT MAN (O.S.)
          Uh huh.

          KID BLUE (O.S.)
          Two more trips should do it.
          Joe gently lifts himself off his haunches.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          The Tall Gat Man exits, Kid Blue stays crouched over the
          floor safe hefting out bars, his back to the bathroom. In
          the distance, a GUNSHOT. Kid Blue's head perks up.
          CREAK! From the bathroom. Quick as lightning, the Kid draws
          his gat and spins - but Joe is already upon him, full sprint.
          SLAM! Joe tackles the Kid backwards. But while Joe uses his
          momentum to leap over the OPEN FLOOR SAFE, the Kid tumbles
          back into it, vanishing inside with a painful thud.
          Joe scrambles to a stop, lifts the heavy safe trap door and
          SLAMS it down - just as the Kid's hand grasps the open edge.
          With a sickening CRACK, the trap door closes on the Kid's
          fingers.
          A bellowing howl, his fingers withdraw, and the safe door
          clicks shut. The ELECTRIC BOX rigged to the code pad to
          crack it clatters off, and whirrrr, CLICK. Locked. Joe,
          panting, goes on hands and knees to the safe door and shouts
          clear and earnest:

                         JOE
          Kid listen Kid. I'm sorry. Tell
          Abe I'm going to fix this. Tell
          him keep my bars safe cause I swear
          to god I'm going to fix this, I'm
          going to find my loop and I'm gonna
          kill him. Tell Abe-
          CRACK CRACK! The wood paneled floor above the safe door
          splinters upwards with gunshots, and a chunk of Joe's right
          ear explodes.
          More blood than you'd think spills down his neck, Joe falls
          back. Three more shots - CRACK CRACK CRACK! And now
          footsteps running down the hall.
          Joe on his feet, slipping in his own blood, sprints across
          the apartment. The TALL GAT MAN appears in the doorway,
          shooting blindly at Joe, chunks of wall and plaster exploding
          as Joe doesn't stop but JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT WINDOW - NIGHT

          5 floors up, Joe leaps out, hits the fire escape, bullets
          shattering the window. Blind with blood, ears ringing, Joe
          barrels down the fire escape. A confused blur of iron steps,
          slipping and scrambling down, but now the tall gat man is out
          the window and shooting down at him.
          Somehow Joe slips and rolls, grabs at thin air, falling -
          three stories at least, falling.
          When he hits the ground the world goes away.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

          We abruptly CUT ON to a very familiar scene.
          Young Joe stands alone in the corn field, in his stance,
          ready to draw. But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks
          his watch, confused. 2:30 and change.
          This is exactly the scene where Old Joe appears, being
          replayed before our eyes. But when Old Joe does APPEAR, it's
          different: his hands are tied, his head covered with a sack.
          And something very different happens:
          Joe raises his gun and without hesitation PULLS THE TRIGGER.
          Old Joe's chest explodes. He falls dead.
          Joe approaches the body, and slows. Sensing something. He
          pulls off the sack. The face of his older self. Old Joe.
          He flips him over. Gold bars CLINK beneath a bloody jacket.
          Joe has closed his loop.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT

          The other LOOPERS buy Joe drinks and cheer him, celebrating.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          His belongings in boxes. Joe unloads the GOLD BARS from the
          trap door.

          EXT. CARGO SHIP DECK - DAY

          Out at sea. Joe, bundled against the cold, leans on a
          railing, eagerly watching the horizon.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Joe smoking in window of an empty apartment, half unpacked.

          Joe walking the city streets, breathing deep. Alive.

          INT. PARIS BODEGA - NIGHT

          Joe picks up a bottle of beer.
          Several FRENCH GANGSTERS in suits shake down the OWNER of the
          shop for money from the register. One holds a gun in the
          owner's face.
          Joe ignores them, walks out.

          dances like a madman.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Joe's apartment, unpacked and lived in. Joe smokes.
          In a NOOK behind a wall panel - stacks of CASH.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY

          Cloudy and cold. Joe wanders alone. Buffeted by strangers.

          EXT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT

          Music pumping, Joe deadened at a table, in another world.
          Beside him a YOUNG PUNK makes a glass float using his TK
          power, then shatters the glass. Red liquid goes everywhere.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Joe takes money from the stacks in the nook, which have grown
          drastically low.
          LATER - sets a hypo down in the ashtray.

          INT. PARIS BODEGA - DAY

          A GUN in the face of the shop's OWNER. Held by Joe. Several
          years older now, in his mid thirties.
          Dressed in a suit, surrounded by fellow GANGSTERS. Now part
          of their gang.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - NIGHT

          A shoot-out between rival gangs. Joe's guns blaze.
          A remorseless killer. Blasting away, cold and skillful.
          Smashing up shops that won't pay protection. He's muscle.

          INT. PARIS GANG HEADQUARTERS

          A dingy dark hallway. Distant thumping bass indicates it's
          maybe behind a club.
          The hall is lined with French Gangster, all similarly
          dressed. Reminiscent of the Gat Men. It takes us a moment
          to recognize Joe among them.
          In his EARLY 40s now. His face a hard weathered mask. A
          soldier. (Note - it is here we transition from the actor
          playing Young Joe to the one playing Old Joe.)

          Old Joe high as a kite, in an all out brawl. Punched to the
          ground. Laughing his ass off.
          A bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around.
          Old Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his WIFE for the
          first time. Long red hair (reminiscent of but NOT Suzie.) In
          a green dress. She flees the fighting, towards the exit.

          âSORTIE.â
          Transfixed and high, Old Joe follows her. Puts his hand on
          her shoulder. She turns, looks him over. Flips him off.
          Leaves. Old Joe watches her go. In love.

          LATER - He holds her in bed, both of them troubled.

          INT. CAR - DAY

          Old Joe driving. Deep in thought. His future Wife beside
          him, her hand on his. He hits the brakes.

          EXT. FRENCH BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

          The car screeches to a halt on a beach side road. Old Joe
          gets out, runs across the beach to the water, pulling his gun
          out of its holster. He fires it out to sea till its empty,
          then throws the gun into the ocean.
          He runs back to his Wife, standing on the beach. They kiss.
          They fall to the sand, and kiss.

          Old Joe in his mid 50s, his Wife lying on a hammock with him,
          reading. Hands lazily entwined. A good life.

          INT. FRENCH COTTAGE KITCHEN - MORNING - A WEEK LATER

          The Wife cuts vegetables. Headlines (in French) scroll
          across a small floating screen, against images of
          destruction. âGangland Terror Spreads, Who is The Rainmakerâ
          She turns it off.

          INT. FRENCH BEDROOM - MORNING

          Lazy, dust motes hanging in the sunlight through the windows.
          Old Joe in bed, in his late 50s.
          His Wife walks through, says something inconsequential, puts
          her hand on his foot. Draws it away, fingers sliding off
          gently. And is gone.
          We stay with Old Joe. His deep breath. The sun warming the
          sheets. Running water from the kitchen.
          His eyes focus on his hand. Written in faded ink on the palm
          is a number we do not recognize: 07153902935.
          A long moment.
          With all the violence in the world, the cottage's green front
          door is KICKED OPEN.
          Joe runs out of the bedroom half dressed, and GANGSTERS grab
          him, taking him down with a rifle butt to the head.
          His Wife is dragged from the kitchen screaming.

          EXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

          Dark cars parked out front. We watch the quiet facade for a
          moment too long, violence that we don't want to think about
          happening inside.
          Then the door BURSTS open and Gangsters drag Joe out, sobbing
          thrashing and bleeding from his head.

          INT. BASEMENT - DAY

          Concrete, nondescript. The Gangsters carry Joe in, now hog
          tied. Put a sack over his head.
          Lead him towards a machine, an iron monstrosity with a hatch.
          One of the men taps his watch - hurry. Another man pulls a
          large lever, and the machine hums, warming up.
          Joe's face, covered with the sack. Breathing. Remembering:
          flashes of his WIFE, screaming.
          Then Joe LUNGES and somehow his hands are loose, he PUNCHES
          one man, tears off the sack, PUNCHES another man, a flurry
          and then it's over. He stands among a pile of broken men.
          Slowly takes stock. Looks at the exit. Looks at the faded
          number on his blood-smeared hand.
          A million things in his mind. But just one choice. The
          machine hums angrily. Ready.

          INT. TIME MACHINE - CONTINUOUS

          Like an iron coffin. Old Joe climbs inside. Braces himself.
          Closes the hatch behind him.
          Flash and crack and he is sent.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

          And appears in front of his younger self.
          The scene now plays out as it did the first time. Joe
          hesitates, Old Joe gets the upper hand, knocks him out.
          Old Joe looks around, gets his bearings. Stares at his
          younger self a moment. Then goes to the truck.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK

          Old Joe drives the truck into the city.

          INT. BODEGA - NIGHT

          Cramped. Old Joe walks in quickly, gets aspirin, wrapped
          sandwiches, bandages, big bottles of water. Removes his torn
          jacket, dumps it.
          At the register, the CLERK bags everything up. Old Joe pulls
          the blunderbuss on the clerk.

                         OLD JOE
          And your jacket.

          Wearing the clerk's jacket, Old Joe takes four aspirin.
          Holds his head a minute, rocking gently.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          On the street outside the building. Old Joe approaches,
          watching the window high above. Weighing his options.
          He scans the street. Spots an ARMORED VAN in the alleyway.
          Movement from behind it - Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man
          loading their bars in the back.

                         OLD JOE
          Shit.
          Old Joe turns to go, but STOPS when his eye catches movement
          between parked cars.
          It's Joe. Young Joe, hid between the cars, looking up at the
          apartment building weighing his options.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)

                         (SOTTO)
          Don't do it. Idiot. Don't do it.
          After a moment Joe dashes across the street and into the
          building. Old Joe stays still a moment, watching him go.
          Ducks into shadows as Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man step from
          the alleyway, wiping their hands.

                         KID BLUE
          Two more trips.
          They enter the building.
          Old Joe takes a breath, then casually walks down the
          sidewalk, past the alleyway, scoping the Armored Van. A GAT
          MAN DRIVER in the driver's seat.

          INT. ARMORED VAN

          The Gat Man Driver watches Old Joe disappear from view.
          Suspicious, he uncovers a GAT on the seat beside him.
          When he looks back up Old Joe stands in his headlights,
          blunderbuss raised. BANG! The windshield shatters, the Gat
          Man Driver is torn apart.
          Old Joe runs up, flings open the door, digs through the
          bloody mess frantically, finding the GAT.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Old Joe dashes out onto the street as gunfire cracks from the
          high apartment window. Sharp eyes will notice that Old Joe's
          right ear is now clipped off, an old wound.
          He dashes towards the apartment door, gun in hand, but stops
          when the window five stories above shatters with gunfire.
          Old Joe backs up, and sees Joe scrambling down the fire
          escape as the TALL GAT MAN fires down at him.
          Old Joe takes expert aim with the gat, and fires three shots
          upwards. The Tall Gat Man's gunfire stops.
          Joe slips on the fire escape, falls two stories and lands on
          the hood of a parked car.
          Old Joe goes to him, checks his pulse.
          Behind them the TALL GAT MAN hits the sidewalk with a SPLAT.
          Old Joe goes to the tall gat man's remains, picks another gat
          out of them, and goes back to Joe's inert body on the car
          hood.

                         OLD JOE
          Stupid little shit.
          He lifts him in his arms.

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

          Joe wakes slowly, pained. Lying alone in an abandoned lot on
          the outskirts of town.
          Slowly he takes stock of himself. Nothing broken. A tight
          bandage on his ear.
          A mournful train whistle, and he turns. Through a chain link
          fence, the train yard. He was put here for a reason.
          A man and a young boy in rags hop onto an empty cargo car,
          heading out of town. Joe watches the boy, his eyes angry.
          Stands shakily. And walks away from the train yard.
          Something like a HELICOPTER sweeps overhead, a spotlight
          zigzagging the area. Joe ducks into shadows, heading towards
          the city.

          More helicopters sweep the streets, searchlights blazing.
          Cars with Gat Men circle slowly, shining spotlights
          themselves.
          Joe leaps from the shadows, ducks behind a dumpster. Barely
          avoiding the light. He won't last long out here.

          EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT

          Joe finds himself in front of a familiar BRIGHT RED GARAGE.
          Seth's apartment. Three stories up, Seth's darkened window.
          He looks up at it, hesitant but desperate.

          INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

          A window shatters inward, punched through by a wrapped fist.
          A big reading hall, empty and dark. The broken window opens,
          Old Joe slides in. Weaves his way past the reading tables,
          finds what he's looking for at a desk.
          A suspended sheet of thin plastic turns out to be a computer.
          Checking his hand, he inputs the number. Navigates menus and
          windows, information flashing, searching.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT

          Gat Men in cars and helicopters patrol the streets.
          Kid Blue sits on the curb, smoking a cigarette. Seething at
          his bandaged hand. Deep in thought. His eyes lift. An
          idea.

          EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The familiar red garage. And three stories up, Seth's lit

          Kid Blue pulls a small caliber gun from a holster concealed
          on his boot, enters the building.

          INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

          Old Joe finishes printing several large documents that look
          like maps. He folds them up, pockets them.
          Dashes to the window, starts to heft himself up - And stops.
          On his hand, a smooth aged scar. Of an arrow. Pointing to
          his wrist.
          Old Joe's breath catches. He pulls down his sleeve,
          revealing âBâ then âEâ
          Then âA then âTâ... He bares his arm, reading the entire

          The peephole screen on the inside of Seth's apartment door.
          Kid Blue manipulating a device, a shower of sparks blows the
          screen out momentarily, and the door swings open.
          Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the
          apartment with over-eager purpose.
          Empty. He deflates. Thinks.
          Goes to the peephole screen, touches it and a menu comes up.
          A little manipulating, and the image is rewinding.
          An empty hall, scanning back half an hour. Then: young Joe.
          Kid Blue stops scanning, hits âPLAY'. Joe feels around the
          door jam, retrieves a key, and enters the apartment.
          Kid Blue exhales. Well Joe was here.
          Taps the screen again, it goes back to a live feed, and he's
          about to step away when his eye catches something.
          He pushes a square on the screen, and the view changes. To a
          live feed from a camera in the ceiling of the apartment.
          Excited, Kid rewinds this half an hour.
          On the screen: Joe enters the apartment. Rifles around a
          little, then sits at the table. Head in his hands. Staring
          into space.
          Then goes to a kitchen drawer, opens it, gets something.
          Goes to the front door, takes something off the wall, briskly
          exits.
          Kid Blue stops the screen.
          He goes and sits where Joe sat. Stares where Joe stared.
          The kitchen counter. A blender, sink. Can labeled âCOFFEE.â
          Kid goes to the kitchen drawer Joe opened, pulls it open.
          It's full of knives.
          Kid goes finally to the door, looks at the wall. A small
          rack for keys, several hanging and one empty hook.
          Kid Blue stares into space, trying to put these pieces
          together. Lights a cigarette.

          Old Joe in bed, half asleep. A woman's arm under his neck.
          It slips away, and he kisses its wrist. Comfort, warmth.
          The woman, leaving. Her hand touches and slides off his
          foot, moving away.

          aspirin. Regains his footing. Walks around the diner
          cautiously.
          Parked in back behind a dumpster, SETH'S SLAT BIKE.

          INT. DINER

          Joe sits at a booth. Old Joe enters, steps up slowly, sits.
          A moment of silence.
          Along with his ear, Joe's hand and arm are now wrapped in
          bloodied bandages. Joe's eyes go to Old Joe's arm. Old Joe
          pulls his sleeve back and shows him the scar spelling

          You know what the voice of god
          sounds like? See now good you're
          confused now but you're listening.
          I hope the voice of god sounds like
          an old man speaking French. Old
          men speaking French sound like
          primeval trees in a strong wind,
          just irrefutable. Wise, strong,
          gentle, all these things in
          harmony, complimentary. At once.
          Old men speaking French. Young men
          speaking French sound, without
          exception, like weenies. Fact.
          You ever hear a Frenchman under 40
          try to sound threatening? It's
          hilarious. English is a tight t-
          shirt, flatters the young. Rat a
          tat tat. French is a double
          breasted suit. Young man can put
          it on, but it always feels like
          he's putting something on. Some
          things, you just need the years.
          It's my favorite language.

          my memories start clear here,

          but as they go back they get
          cloudier, until they're totally
          obscured. It's like a fog.
          Because my memories aren't really
          memories, they're one possible
          eventuality now, and they grow
          clearer or cloudier as they become
          more or less likely. But then they
          get to the present moment
          (the left straw)
          And they're instantly clear again.
          Like a wall of fog moving forward

          He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it
          pushes the pepper with it.

          tell you why I'm here now.
          He puts his hand on the folded papers.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna save her.
          A quick beat. Joe goes for his gun. But Old Joe is fast, he
          jams his foot into Joe's crotch, crushing the hidden gun into
          him. Joe cries out, Old Joe grabs his hair and plants his
          face into the table.
          When Joe's hands go to his face Old Joe grabs them and pulls.
          Foot in his crotch, pulling his arms tight over the table.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          The Rainmaker is alive right now.
          Living here, somewhere in this
          county. And I can find him with
          this. I need you to lay low, stay
          out of my way and not get caught.
          I know how to fix this, I won't
          stop till I finish it. I'm going
          to find him and kill him.
          Joe's face loosens, his eyes on their coffee cups.

                         JOE
          It's been awhile since we've gotten
          a warm-up.
          Old Joe realizes, looks around. The diner is eerily quiet.
          Beatrix and the staff have all quietly left. Fled.
          Old Joe swings out of the booth, still holding Joe by the
          hair, dragging him like a doll. Joe's blunderbuss clatters
          to the ground. Old Joe drags him to the window. They look
          out. Nothing in the parking lot. Too quiet.

          It's been thirty years for me, so
          it's hard to remember. When you
          stole Seth's bike you stripped out
          the security tracker. Right?
          Joe's fearful face says âno.' Old Joe draws his gat.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Make it to the field, you can lose
          them in the field. Go east and hop

                         A TRAIN
          Joe punches Old Joe square in the jaw, and he goes down. His
          papers and gun fall. The diner door EXPLODES.

                         JOE
          I've got him! He's here!
          A GAT MAN barrels in, his gat blazing. Joe scrambles but Old
          Joe gets the gat.
          With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there
          are two more behind him. Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe
          returns fire, glass breaking and chaos.
          Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks.
          Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet.
          Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the
          booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have
          their fire fight. Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath
          the table. He scoops it up. Turns, and fires at Old Joe.

                         OLD JOE
          Shit.
          Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind
          Old Joe explodes. Old Joe makes his break, sprints for the
          broken window, jumps...

          EXT. BACK OF DINER - MORNING

          ...and hits the dusty parking lot running. Towards the corn.

          EXT. FRONT OF DINER

          Kid Blue squats on his haunches with four more Gat Men, their
          guns trained on the diner door. Three Gat Men burst out,
          followed by Joe.

          DINER GAT MAN
          The back, he's running!

                         JOE

          50.
          They all run around back, where Old Joe is halfway to the
          corn but not there yet.
          The seven Gat Men and Kid Blue and Joe fire their guns after
          him while running but they're too far away (and they're
          running) so nothing hits. Joe blasts at the old man blindly,
          sprinting with all his might, eyes streaming tears in the
          dust.
          When Old Joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish. Four
          of the Gat Men follow him in, while the remaining pursuers
          slow to a stop, doubled over, panting. Defeated.
          It takes a few seconds for Kid Blue to realize that Joe is
          there with them. It takes another second for Joe to realize
          that the dynamic has changed. He turns and runs back towards
          the diner, Kid Blue and the Gat men in pursuit. One of the
          Gat Men fires.

                         KID BLUE
          Alive! No, alive!
          Joe makes it to the Slat Bike, jumps on, hits the ignition.

                         JOE
          No fuck no fucking piece of shit
          CLICK CLICK. The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the
          moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike
          the engine turns over with a ROAR.
          The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the
          open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass. The
          bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground.
          Joe roars off into the corn. The Kid is on his feet running
          back to the Gat Men.

                         KID BLUE
          The tracker! Get the tracker!

          EXT. CORN FIELD

          Joe riding at full speed through the thick corn stalks. He
          BAILS, snapping through corn stalks and rolling to a painful
          stop. The bike ZOOMS onward through the stalks, quickly out
          of sight.
          Pained, Joe lies still, breathing hard. Pulls Old Joe's torn
          paper from his pocket. On one side, the number Old Joe
          scribbled: 1027363259 He flips it over. It's a map.
          Mostly of empty farm land, bisected by a bold highway and
          scattered farm houses.
          One of them is CIRCLED IN BLACK.

          EXT. FIELD - DAWN

          A bare field of churned chocolatey earth. Near its edge juts
          the dead stump of an old tree.
          A YOUNG WOMAN in work clothes named SARA chops away at the
          trunk with a large axe. Over and over, splintering it apart.
          Endless plains of corn surround the field. In the near
          distance, a two story farm house with an adjacent barn.
          Sara focused on her work as the sun rises.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - EARLY MORNING

          Sara fiddles with a garbage can sized DEVICE, and with a
          crackle of mechanic thrusters it floats up and over the corn
          fields, spraying something chemical.

          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

          Sara makes coffee.

          EXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - EARLY MORNING

          She sits on a rocking chair, and mimes smoking an invisible
          cigarette.
          Our first good look at her face. Clear and beautiful, but it
          has been here for awhile.
          The morning light changes from steel blue to pale white.
          Rocking gently, fake smoking and drinking coffee. Not going
          anywhere.

          INT. FARM HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

          Blinds drawn, dark. A FIGURE lies in bed. Sara steps in,
          puts her hand on the sleeping figure's foot.

                         SARA
          C'mon baby. Time to get up.

          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

          Cooking eggs. The front door bangs. She looks up.

          INT. FARM HOUSE FOYER

          The screen door bangs in the wind. Sara inspects it. The
          latch is broken. She sighs.
          Then freezes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.
          Through the screen door, some fifty yards across the front
          lawn, the dark figure of a MAN stands at the edge of the corn
          fields. Watching her.
          She watches right back for a long moment.
          Then grabs a shotgun mounted above the door and with no
          hesitation at all plows outside.
          The dark figure vanishes into the corn fields.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN

          Sara storms down the porch and stalks across the lawn,
          shotgun extended. Not fucking around.
          Does not slow her pace until she is ten yards from the corn
          fields, where she plants herself and shouts:

                         SARA
          Listen up fucker. I have shot and
          buried three vagrants in the past
          year. If you want to know the
          Christ's honest truth I'm starting
          to get a taste for it. So I don't
          care what hobo sob story you've
          got, I get a dozen a week and it
          cuts no cash with me. It's me and
          my husband here, we're broke and
          angry at our lot in this world and
          heavily armed. So take some corn
          and move on, but if you show your
          face again I will cut you the fuck
          in half.
          Silence. Just the wind in the corn. A long beat. Then Sara
          turns, walks briskly back.
          Moments later Joe's face pokes through the corn stalks. He
          takes in the farm. The barn behind it. The fallow field.

                         LATER
          Joe sits in the same spot, a few feet in the corn but with a
          clear sight line at the house.
          His gun on his knee.
          JOE'S FACE - Pale, sweating. Something's wrong. He winces.
          Pinches his eyes. Headache.
          The sun pounds down. He looks at the piece of map.

                         JOE
          C'mon. C'mere. C'mon. C'mon.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Abe stands fuming, flanked by two Gat Men. Kid Blue sits
          like a kid in detention.

                         ABE
          Well. You found him. And you
          russeled up a posse and went to git
          âem. Like a good little cowboy
          from one of your movie movies.
          Without telling me.

                         KID BLUE
          I can do it again.

                         ABE
          You can fuck up again? Really.
          You know what happens to me if I
          don't get that old bastard? I got
          too much riding, Kid, I can't
          afford a fuck-up playing cowboy.
          Put your gat on the table.
          Fighting tears now, Kid puts his gun on the desk. But he
          doesn't take his hand off it.

                         KID BLUE
          I wanted you to say I did good,
          that's all I wanted. This is all I
          have.
          Abe puts his hand on the gat. Kids' finger still on the
          trigger. A tense moment. Abe pulls the gun away, across the
          table.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          Please just give me one more
          chance, I'll bring him here alive
          and hold him and you can put a
          bullet in his brain yourself-
          Abe grabs the hammer. SLAMS it on Kid's bad hand, crushing
          it. Kid howls, the Gat Men grab him.

          INT. STEEP STAIRS

          Kid is literally dragged up the stairs by a Gat Man.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          The Gat Man shoves Kid Blue through the twisty maze of
          backstage, past girls and Loopers and men.

          The Kid blubbers and bleeds. Humiliated. But he pulls
          himself halfway together. Make a show:

                         KID BLUE
          I'm gonna make this good again. I
          will. I'm gonna be back.

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

          Raining. The Gat Man pushes the Kid out the back entrance
          door, into the alley. The Kid instinctively turns towards
          the street.
          But the Gat Man steers him back, deeper into the alley. The
          Kid realizes what this means. Everything changes.

                         KID BLUE
          Oh no. Oh no no no no
          He fights in vain to break from the Gat Man's grip. Weeps,
          begs, clasps at whatever he can grab.
          The Gat Man turns a corner -- towards the alley's dead end.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          No! No! No no no no!
          Shrieking. Annoyed, the Gat Man throws the Kid hard to the
          concrete. The Gat Man pulls his gun, raises it without
          ceremony.
          BANG. The Gat Man's face explodes. Staggers, his gun FIRES
          into the wall. He drops like a doll.
          Kid Blue lies in the rain, hyperventilating. His pant leg
          hiked up, showing his boot with its holster.
          In his mangled left hand, the small caliber PISTOL he keeps
          stashed. His pinkie on the trigger.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          Oh.
          Cradling his crushed hand, dazed, he scampers off like a
          soaked rat.

          Silent and still. Sara comes out onto the front porch. She
          gathers up a few things, turns out the porch light.
          Notices a floodlight still lit on the BARN across the yard.
          She turns the porch light back on.
          The dark corn fields, silent and vaguely threatening. She
          steps back in the house, emerging again with the shotgun.

          across the yard. All is silent.

          EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

          She reaches the barn. A hard pool of light from a mounted
          floodlight falls off to inky darkness.
          Hits a metal switch near the barn door and the light snaps
          off. In its absence the darkness swarms.
          She briskly walks back towards the house, but slows. Stops.
          Turns. In the darkness by the barn, crunch crunch. Crunch.
          And maybe a shape. Deep in the swarming dark.

                         SARA
          Hey. Who's there.
          Sara levels the shotgun at the darkness, and steps back.
          Quiet but definite - crunch crunch. And now, definitely a
          shape. A man. coming towards her.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Stop right there. Stop!

          EXT. CORN FIELD - CONTINUOUS

          Joe slumped over unconscious where we left him, in the corn.
          Sara's shout wakes him with a start. Sweating, pasty.
          Disoriented. Something is wrong with him.
          In a flash of panic he parts the corn stalks, sees Sarah
          backing away from the barn. The dark hulking figure of a man
          pursues her slowly but steadily.

                         JOE

                         SHIT

          Sara backing up still, shotgun leveled. The man, still in
          darkness, comes towards her.

                         SARA
          You stop right there, you stop!
          She fires her gun in the air. The man pauses, but then
          continues towards her. She trips on a root, FALLS.

          WINDOW. A child's hand smacks the glass, and framed through
          the pane, through the unseen child's eyes, this is what we

                         SEE:
          Sara on the ground, fumbling the gun. In trouble. The DARK
          MAN, advancing towards her menacingly.
          At the last moment, from the corn fields, JOE runs into the
          light and steps directly between them, shouts, his gun raised
          at the Dark Man.
          And the Dark Man STOPS.

          EXT. FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

          Joe's gun leveled, face set. But the porch light on the
          man's face: it is not Old Joe.
          It is a man in his 30s, filthy, with down's syndrome. A
          greasy sign around his neck: âPLEASE HELP MUWTE FOOD $ GOD

                         BLESS YOUÂ
          Joe lowers his gun, face melting.

                         SARA
          Jee sus.
          (to the MUTE VAGRANT)
          Hey, hey. I'm going to get you

                         SOME FOOD-
          But the man scampers off, leaving his sign.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          ...great.

          EXT. SECOND STORY BEDROOM WINDOW

          The child, in darkness, watching. He recedes into the
          bedroom, his hand slipping off the glass.

          EXT. FRONT LAWN

          Sara stands, picks up the sign, calls after the MUTE.

                         SARA
          Hey you forgot your greasy goddamn
          hobo sign oh for godssakes.
          (turns to Joe)
          Alright, what are you?
          Joe turns away from her quickly, but doubles over, crumpling
          to a heap on the grass. Sara checks his face.

          Hey. Look at - hey. The fuck-
          ehh.
          Joe PUKES. She steps away. Takes a moment. Breathes.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

          She drags Joe up onto the porch, under the light.

                         SARA
          Hey. Up here, at the light. Hey.
          Sara SLAPS HIM. Hard. His eyes snap open. He sees her face.
          She feels his head. Checks his eyes. Cherry red and veined,
          swollen under the lids.

                         JOE

                         (TOTALLY GONE)
          My head... splitting apart... time

                         JOE

                         DROPPED
          Sara mimes an eye dropper.

                         SARA
          Dropped, or what the kids call it.

                         JOE
          A day.

                         SARA
          One day. Wow.
          She leans back on her haunches, looks at him, deep in
          thought. Deciding what to do. Joe lies prone, shaking,
          sweating.

                         JOE
          Thirsty. I can't feel my legs

                         SARA
          You're withdrawing from a synthetic
          barbiturate. It's a quick punch
          but it's this bad a day in, without
          care you might not make it through
          the night.
          Sara looks at his shoes. Beneath the caked mud, fine
          leather. Her eyes linger on his gun. They turn cold.

          She stands quickly without a word, vanishing into the house.
          Joe lies still, breath shallow. Turns his head, hazy.

                         JOE
          Thirsty. Thirsty.
          Soft footsteps approach. Small bare feet padding towards him
          through the front door. A young boy steps out onto the
          porch, 6 years old, named CID.
          Cid looks Joe over. His eyes linger on Joe's gun. Then he
          kneels, his small hands feeling Joe's sweaty face. Pushes a
          straw to Joe's lips. Joe's hands clasp around a plastic cup
          with a cartoon tiger, and he drinks.

                         (SHARP)
          Cid. C'mere monkey.
          Cid goes back into the house, leaving his cup with Joe.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

          Sara tries to pick Cid up but he dodges, walks up the stairs.

                         CID
          Who's that man?

                         SARA
          Just a vagrant babe.

          INT. FARMHOUSE UPPER HALL

          Sara leads him down the hall and into his bedroom.

                         CID
          No he's not.

                         CID
          His shoes are too shiny.

          Well aren't you a smart monkey.

          He gets in bed.

          Go to sleep. Okay. Night baby
          boy.
          Kisses him.

                         CID
          Night Sara.
          Lingers over him in the pale light. Then goes.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          A darkened highway, the lights of the farm house distant. A
          small STAKE BED TRUCK rumbles up, stops on the soft shoulder.
          Sara at the wheel. Sits a second. Then climbs out.
          Roughly pulls Joe out of the flatbed. He lands in the dirt.
          Sara avoids looking at him, closes up the flatbed.
          Joe weakly grabs her ankle. She pries his hand off, and
          discovers CID'S CUP in the dirt beside him. Takes it
          angrily, strides back to the truck.

          INT. STAKE BED TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

          Sara gets in, drops Cid's cup on the seat beside her. Looks
          in her rear view mirror. Leaving a man to die. Looks down
          at Cid's cup. For a long moment.

                         SARA
          Ssssshhit.

          INT. BARN - NIGHT

          Sara lights a gas lamp. Threads a hose from a tank of water
          around the cot. Joe on a metal cot, covered with blankets.

                         SARA
          Water. Drink it, all night, more
          than you think you want.
          Moves a metal bucket next to the bed. Adjusts the blankets.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Aim for the bucket. And don't chew
          your tongue off. In the morning
          we're gonna talk.

          The last thing she does is handcuff his wrist to the cot and
          take his gun. On her way out she puts it on a bench beside
          the door, and turns out the floodlight.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING

          Dawn breaks. Exhausted Gat Men dutifully patrol the streets
          with flashlights, stopping every passerby.
          On the outskirts of the city. Vagrant fires burn distant
          orange. A large drainage pipe drips into a brackish creek.

          INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL

          Underground. We move through it.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Cavernous space beneath a high street grating, damp and cold.
          Old Joe sits on the ground, methodically cleaning and loading
          his gun. He finishes. Places the gun on top of his folded,
          torn maps. Closes his eyes. Sees:

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          A bank of fog clears, revealing Sara's face looking down at
          us. She slaps us hard.

                         SARA
          Hey.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Old Joe touches his temple. Head aching. Remembering.

                         OLD JOE
          The first time I saw her face.

          Old Joe holds his pocket watch tight like a talisman.
          Fingers dug deep in his head.

                         OLD JOE
          No. The first time I saw her face.

          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT

          A fist comes straight at us. SMACK!
          We reel back, revealing: the Paris club, crowded and rowdy.
          A piece of Old Joe's life that we've seen before.
          Joe (mid 40s) lies on the ground, lip bloodied, laughing
          hysterically at a YOUNG PUNK who has just hit him. A bar
          fight blossoms in slow motion all around.
          Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his Wife for the
          first time. In her green dress. Whisps of fog drift into
          frame.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Inside Old Joe's pocket watch, a picture. Of his WIFE.
          The sun breaks in through the grate above. Old Joe closes
          the pocket watch, holds in tight. Then he stands and picks
          up the gun and goes.

                         CUT TO:
          A child stands in a massive doorway with blinding white light
          beaming through.
          JOE'S FACE - wrecked, but his eyes flutter. Blink.

          INT. BARN - MORNING

          Joe lies on the cot. Blinks. The barn doors, the morning
          sun rising through. If the child was there, he's gone now.

          INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

          Cid draws at the kitchen table. Sara enters.

                         SARA
          Morning monkey.

                         CID
          The man's up.
          Sara stiffens, looks out the window.

          A WALL OF LEAVES
          Fingers part the green, and Old Joe peers through the dense
          foliage.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

          Old Joe hides in the trees across the street from a suburban
          track home.
          A young boy in a bright jacket runs out the front door and
          off down the street.
          Old Joe checks the folded map in his trembling hands. On it,
          this house is circled in black, exactly like Sara's farm.
          Stuffing the map in his pocket, he pushes out through the
          trees.

          EXT. BARN - MORNING

          Sara approaches the barn, her shotgun in hand.
          Joe sits on the ground just outside the open barn door, the
          metal cot behind him still handcuffed to his wrist.
          Methodically cleaning and loading his gun.

                         SARA
          Toss it.
          Joe freezes. Then, half annoyed

                         JOE
          I just finished cleaning - alright.
          Tosses it into the dirt. Sara lowers the shotgun slightly.

          How do you feel?

          Take it slow and by the end of the
          week you'll be at fifty. Good.
          She tosses him a key, he unlocks his handcuff.

                         JOE
          Look I'm not a threat to you or
          your boy. I need to be on your
          property but I'd prefer to not have
          any contact with you at all, I'll
          stay in the fields. There's just
          one thing you need to do for me,
          and you won't have to deal with me
          again.
          He takes the map from his pocket, unfolds it. Tosses it over
          to her.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Just, verify for me that's your
          house on the map. So I know I'm in
          the right place.

                         SARA
          What is this?

                         JOE
          A map.

                         SARA
          That's my house. Why is it marked?

                         JOE
          Doesn't matter. Ok. I'll be out
          of the barn in an hour, if you can
          spare it I'll take the water jug
          with me. Does that well have
          water? I'll fill it from there.
          Sara turns the map over. Sees the NUMBER that Old Joe wrote
          on the back. 07153902935.
          And everything changes.

                         SARA
          What is this.
          She shows him the number. She is not asking what the number
          is - she knows. Joe is suddenly not so relaxed.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          What is this.

                         JOE
          Does that mean something to you?
          For the first time in their conversation, Joe looks in her
          eyes. Sara stares daggers, searching. Very different than
          she was ten seconds ago.
          Joe scoots back

          And without hesitating Sara hefts the shotgun and SHOOTS HIM.
          BLAST! Rips his shirt open bloody, blows him back screaming.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe STOPS in his tracks, children running around him.
          His hand goes to his temple.

          EXT. BARN - DAY (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          Fog clears from Sara blasting us with her shotgun.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe's hand runs from his temple to his neck. Feels a new
          but old scar, just a little divot behind his ear.

          INT. BARN

          Sara drags Joe in by the foot. She heaves the barn door
          closed. In the lamp lit dark Joe rolls and groans in the
          dirt.

                         SARA
          Who are you?
          She shoves the shotgun barrel in his face, a rush of fury

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          You're right I'm not a killer but I
          am fine with how a blast of rock
          salt to your face won't kill you.
          Who are you and what are you here
          for? Who are you?
          Joe breathes hard, bleeding in the dirt with a shotgun in his
          nose. But he forces calm. A beat. Then he starts talking.

                         JOE
          Time travel hasn't been invented
          yet. But in thirty years it will
          be.

          EXT. PARK - DAY

          A suburban park. On its far end, a birthday party.
          The YOUNG BOY in the bright jacket we saw run out of the
          house earlier sits alone under a tree.
          Old Joe approaches him.

          Hi. Daniel, right? I'm Chad's
          father. Aren't you going to come
          over? We're doing cake.

                         DANIEL
          It's ice cream cake and I can't eat
          ice cream. Cause of the milk.

                         OLD JOE
          Well you should join the party even
          if you don't have cake. You have a
          birthday coming up?

                         DANIEL
          In July. We were gonna go to the
          lake but I don't think we are now.

                         OLD JOE
          I'm sorry.
          Old Joe leaves, walks across the grass. Having trouble
          breathing.

          INT. BARN

          Sara sits. Joe weakly talks, the end of a long explanation.

                         JOE
          I can't go back to the city and
          find him cause Abe, the boss, all
          his men are going to search the
          streets 24/7 till they turn up me
          or... him. All I have is this map.
          And that he's coming here.
          Sara stands. Paces away. Deep in thought.

                         SARA
          A Looper.

                         JOE
          Yeah. Did you know about Loopers,
          what we do

                         SARA
          I've heard stories. So he's coming
          here to murder me and my son
          because he thinks we might be this
          Rainmaker. And once he kills the
          Rainmaker, what happens?

                         JOE
          I think... he thinks, the instant
          the rainmaker dies, he'll never
          have been sent back, so he'll just
          vanish, and be back with his wife.

          Well tended by someone who loves growing things. Laurels,
          ivy on trellises, flowers and trees.
          Daniel comes through the side gate. Lifts the back door
          matt, revealing a dusty key.

          Sara takes a pen from a workbench. Shows Joe the numbers:

          She draws lines with the pen, thus:

          Joe's face, taking this in.

          Old Joe. Sitting in a corner of the yard. Face set hard.
          Daniel stands, key in hand. Drops the matt. Slow motion.
          Turns. Sees Old Joe, standing now.
          Stillness between them. OLD JOE'S FACE. Struggling to be
          stone, and then it is.
          He draws his gun in one fluid motion and FIRES.
          We don't hear the shot. We just hear the garden, the wind
          through the plants.

          stone.
          Numb he puts his gun away and exits.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe walks across the park. Map in his hand. Children
          play in the distance. Children's voices all around.
          Old Joe spins, his breath up into his head.
          The map falls to the ground. The park around him, green and
          full of children.
          He keels over onto his knees and cries. Grabs the grass,
          holds it in his fingers, thick and green.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

          The Wife stands at the edge of a bed. 35 and Full of life.
          Old Joe on the bed. Mid 40s.
          She unsnaps her GREEN DRESS and it falls, leaving her naked
          in the sunlight.

                         LATER
          On the bed. Old Joe and the Wife. Faces close. Drifting
          into sleep. From a neighboring apartment, a BABY CRIES.
          Loud and insistent.
          Old Joe opens his eyes, joking-annoyed at the crying baby.
          âGod you have to be kidding me.â
          Then he sees her face. Her smiling eyes, listening to the
          neighbor's baby cry. Like she's listening to music. She
          touches his hand.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe. Staring at the grass. On the map beside him:
          three circled houses around the city. And the torn corner.

          Sara holds the torn piece of map in her hands. Their house

          They sit on the steps, Joe stripped to the waist. Sara picks

          Joe surveys the surrounding land, cleaning his gun.

          We're surrounded by the corn, that

          EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

          but it's Joe who wakes up with a start. Slumped against the
          steps, gun in hand.
          Cid's hand on his forehead. Cid steps back quickly, puts his
          finger to his lips. Shhh.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - NIGHT

          Cid leads Joe inside, beckoning him to follow.

          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN

          Dark. Cid leads Joe to the kitchen table. Laid out on it:
          an arrangement of toys.
          With the deliberateness of a man at work Cid clicks on a
          flashlight and sets it on the table.
          Works on several toys, cracking open cases, pulling out
          wires. Hands moving fast. Joe sits, watching Cid.

                         CID
          Hand me that Phillips.
          Joe hands him the screwdriver. Cid keeps working.

                         CID (CONT'D)
          Tell me if you hear her coming.

                         JOE
          What are we doing here?

                         CID
          Commundication.
          He pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands, and
          an identical one next to Joe lights up.
          The way Joe looks at Cid changes slightly.

                         CID (CONT'D)
          But I need to make it stronger.

                         JOE
          How do you do that?

                         CID
          Bigger battery.
          Joe idly fingers a toy.

                         JOE
          Smart.

                         CID
          Do you kill people?
          Joe half laughs. Cid keeps working, his face in shadows.

                         AFTER AWHILE:

                         JOE
          Let's say I kill people.

                         JOE
          Uh huh.
          Cid looks at him in the dark. Not scared at all. Then he
          goes back to fitting the backing on a toy.
          A long beat, Joe thinking.
          Broken by a PIERCING NOISE.
          They both jump - the toy truck Joe has idly played with is
          shrieking, sirens blaring.
          Joe fumbles with it, Cid reaches over and switches it off,
          they both freeze.
          And look up at the ceiling.
          Silence in the house.
          With a look of reproach beyond his years, Cid takes the truck
          from Joe and finishes up his work.

          JOE (CONT'D)
          How long have you and your mom been
          on the farm?

                         CID
          She's not my mom. My mom got
          killed when I was a baby. Someone
          bad, bad men killed her.
          Cid sets the two finished BUZZERS on the table.

                         JOE
          I'm sorry.

                         CID
          Sara doesn't think I remember cause
          I was a baby. But I remember my
          mom. I couldn't stop her getting
          killed. I don't remember it all
          but I remember. I was a baby. I
          couldn't do anything. I couldn't
          stop it. Cause I was a baby.
          Cid is crying. Joe has never been more at a loss.

                         JOE
          I'm sorry
          Takes the buzzers. Stands, fumbling. Retreating.

                         CID
          She's not my mom. She's a liar.
          With one last look back at Cid in the dark, Joe exits.

          SMASH CUT TO:

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS STREET - NIGHT

          Old Joe. Running hard. Sirens, flashlights behind him.
          Being chased.
          Zig zags through an alleyway, a pursuing car smashing up
          behind him.
          Bursts out onto the street, nearly hit by another car.
          Shouts all around, a few shots. Surrounding. He runs.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          A Gat Man briefing Abe, who hasn't gotten much sleep lately.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - SEEN FROM HIGH IN THE AIR

          Cars, motorcycles, cop prowlers, all roar to life and blaze
          through the city streets in one direction.

          INT/EXT. HALF BUILT HIGHRISE

          Kid Blue, squatting in the 10th story of a half finished
          highrise, looks down on the activity in the streets.
          Spread on the floor are maps with notes. He's been searching
          for Old Joe.
          And now his eyes are alight. He bolts for the stairs.

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS STREETS - NIGHT

          A small park on one block. With a playground. Swings, and a
          merry-go-round. Gat men sweep the park.

          After they pass, Old Joe's face pops up under the merry-go-
          round. He crouches in a shallow space beneath it.
          He sees: Across from the park, a cheap APARTMENT BUILDING.
          He checks his map - the 2nd circled address. Kid number two.
          He waits.

          EXT. FIELD - EARLY MORNING

          Sara chops the dead tree trunk in the field, greatly
          diminished but still formidable. Joe approaches.

                         JOE
          Can't you pull that out with a
          plow?

                         SARA
          Uh huh.
          She keeps chopping.

                         JOE
          I found a, in the barn I found some
          parts, and I made a, thing.
          Joe pushes one of Cid's BUZZERS into her hands, which we now
          see is a colorful plastic frog toy with a light bulb nose.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          If you see anything, just push
          that, and,
          Joe pushes the button on his buzzer, and Sara's lights up and
          vibrates. She regards the toy, then stares hard and cold at
          Joe.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          It's important.

                         SARA
          When?

                         JOE
          Last night. He woke me up. Don't
          tell him I told you though, he...
          Sara rolls her eyes, turns away. Starts chopping again. Joe
          doesn't leave.

                         SARA
          What?

                         JOE

                         JOE
          He told me you're not.
          This hits Sara hard. She resumes chopping to cover it.

                         SARA
          He said that?

                         JOE
          If he's not your son who is he?

                         SARA

                         (SHARP)
          He's my son.

                         (BEAT)
          I had Cid when I was twenty two.
          But I didn't want to give up my
          life. In the city.
          The word âcityâ has weight for her. Implies volumes.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          So I dropped Cid with my mom, here.
          And my sister. And they saw how I
          was living and they took him. My
          sister raised him here, she loved
          him. He called her mom.

                         JOE
          How'd she get killed?
          When Sara's eyes hit him they're daggers.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Cid told me. You have to talk to
          him about it.
          Icy silence from Sara, and an odd stare.

                         SARA
          I told you one thing, I told you to
          stay away from my son.

                         JOE
          He asked about my gun. You think
          this is going to go away if you
          don't talk to him about it but it's
          just gonna grow

                         SARA

          She goes back to chopping. Joe lingers, then leaves. She
          hacks away.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - EARLY MORNING

          Sara sits with coffee, looking out at the fields. Deep in
          thought.
          She takes a drag from her pretend cigarette.

          EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

          A motel style building. Gat Men in cars pass occasionally
          with spotlights and radios, but the activity has calmed.
          Old Joe slips around a corner. Staying hid. Checks the
          address on the map. 12 Talbott Dr, #205.
          Makes a break for stairs leading to the 2nd level. But just
          at that moment a car pulls into the building's lot.
          Old Joe ducks under the stairs. Holding his breath.
          The car parks. Door slams. Footsteps. A WOMAN. Slumping
          exhausted, up the stairs.
          And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash by.
          It is Suzie, the girl from Abe's brothel. Old Joe's face,
          pure disbelief. He recognizes her instantly. It can't be.
          He gingerly steps half a foot out. Looking up he can see the
          apartment doors above. Suzie walks down the landing.
          Towards apartment 205.
          Jesus it can't be.
          Then she passes it. Keeps walking. Old Joe's eyes,
          relieved.
          She stops at the next door over, knocks. It opens, vaguely
          indistinct conversation between her and the girl that
          answers.

                         SUZIE
          Sorry, I know I promised five, you
          know how it gets.

                         GIRL NEIGHBOR
          Don't worry sugar. She was no
          problem. Gat men searched through
          here, lookin for god knows...
          Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a
          sleeping 6 year old girl. She whispers goodbye to the
          neighbor and walks back to APARTMENT 205. She enters.

          Old Joe, frozen. Gun in his hand. Face numbly: âYou have to
          be shitting me.â
          He climbs the stairs. On the 2nd story landing. To 205.
          Breath held, back against the wall. Peeks in the window.
          On the couch, Suzie holding her daughter. Head in her lap.
          Stroking her hair. Suzie's back is to us, and with her long
          red hair down, she is eerily reminiscent of Old Joe's wife.
          Old Joe watches them for a long time.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT PORCH - DAY

          Joe sits, watching the corn. It rustles in the wind. Hand
          on his blunderbuss. Beside it, his frog buzzer.
          The tension is constant. And it's a long, long day.

          INT. FARMHOUSE HALLWAY - LATER

          Sara vacuums while Cid plays with toy trucks.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER

          In the basement, bare concrete. Sara empties the dryer.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

          Sara sits on the floor with Cid, putting numbered tiles on a
          plastic multiplication table.

                         SARA
          Where does 56 go? Good. 21.

          Good, there. 32.

          Baby. Let's do this now. You have

                         CID
          I want to help him.
          Sara is distracted by a distant bell-like DINGING.

                         SARA
          Cid. 32.
          She goes to the window, looks out, nervous.
          But it's just a loose LAUNDRY LINE down in the yard, whipping
          in the wind against its metal pole. In the distance, Joe
          paces the yard.
          Relieved, Sara returns to Cid. He sets the tile, petulant.

                         SARA (CONT'D)

          Deliberately, Cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back
          down on the same spot.

          He's protecting us cause you can't

          Cid lunges at her, Sara slaps him back.

          Cid stands, balls his fists, SCREAMING at her. Sara pushes
          back away from him.
          Maybe a cloud passed over the sun. The room darkens.
          And we see it now, in her eyes: Sara is afraid. She bolts
          out of the room.

          EXT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

          Sara walks fast down the hall

          INT. SARA'S BEDROOM

          Not slowing, through her bedroom

          INT. SARA'S CLOSET

          Into her walk-in closet, to a huge steel safe tucked in back.
          She opens the safe with trembling hands. And climbs inside.

          INT. SAFE

          Closes the heavy door. Turns on a small LED light.
          And waits. Cid's screams distant but not lessening.

          EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

          Cid's screams from the house, clear as day.
          Joe paces in front of the barn. Turns his head back towards
          the house, not sure what to think.
          The screams stop. Joe turns uneasily back to the swaying
          corn.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          The math game scattered, numbered tiles everywhere. Cid lies
          face down on the bed, cried out.
          Sara enters quietly. Sits on the bed beside him. Strokes
          his hair. He folds into her, and they're holding each other
          tight.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

          A Gat Man named CANADY strolls out of a donut shop, coffee in
          hand, and gets in his car.

          INT. CANADY'S CAR

          Canady starts the car up, starts driving.

          passenger side foot-well.

                         KID BLUE
          Hey Can. Can.
          Canady sees him, jumps and yelps.
          The sedan swerves, scrapes to a stop against a parked car.
          Coffee everywhere.

                         CANADY
          Jesus, fuckin Kid Blue what the

          You don't wanna be seen with me
          Canady, pull in the alley.
          Canady glares at him, but pulls the car into a narrow alley,
          parks it.

                         CANADY
          The fuck are you still doing in
          town, Abe wants you dead man

                         KID BLUE

          night?

                         CANADY
          Jssshhh. No we didn't get him.
          Spotted and lost him. West End,
          near Whore's Alley.

                         KID BLUE
          Whore's Alley?

                         CANADY

                         CANADY
          Yeah, maybe you bring him the
          looper, but short of that Abe don't
          get right with priced men.

          I got a price?

                         CANADY
          Big one.
          Canady locks the car doors.
          And in that one moment, Kid Blue pulls Canady's gun from his
          holster. Holds it on him. A tense moment.

                         CANADY (CONT'D)
          Course I'd never turn a friend for

                         A PRICE

          EXT. ALLEYWAY

          BANG and the drivers side window explodes outward bloody.
          A moment, then Kid Blue stumbles out, holding his ears in
          pain. Off down the alley and out of sight.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          Sara lies with Cid, both asleep.
          Distant but sharp, a bell ringing. It's unmistakable this
          time. The DINNER BELL. Sara's eyelids flutter. She hears.
          Stiffens.
          The bell stops suddenly. She stands, careful not to wake
          Cid.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

          Sara rushes quietly down the stairs.
          Through a doorway, she sees the Frog Buzzer sitting on the
          living room coffee table. Lit up and buzzing.
          She goes to the front door, throws it open. And is face to
          face with a tall Gat Man named JESSE. She freezes.

                         JESSE
          Evenin ma'am.

          You can start by accepting my
          apologies re the hour, I hope I
          didn't catch you in supper.

                         SARA
          No, that's fine.

                         JESSE
          Yours was the last house on my list
          today, been walking between empty
          farms all day in the hot sun.
          Thought I'd tick this off my list,
          not have to come back tomorrow.

                         SARA
          What's this about?
          Back in the house somewhere, a screen door bangs.

                         JESSE
          You alone here, ma'am?

                         SARA
          My husband should be back from the
          city, any time now.

                         JESSE
          Happy to hear. Could I trouble you
          for some water?

                         SARA
          Course. I'll get some, you can
          take the glass with you.

                         JESSE
          Actually ma'am, my business
          tonight, this ticking off the list
          business, it's gonna require me
          coming in. If that's alright.
          Jesse shifts his weight, and Sara notices his heavy boot is
          now a few inches over the door jam.

                         SARA
          Will you tell me what this is
          about?

                         JESSE
          I will, yes. Can I come in?
          Hanging above the door, just over Sara's head: the shotgun.
          Possibilities whirling through her mind.

          Silent decision, and she steps aside to let him enter.

          INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Joe slips in through the screen door, gun in hand. Freezes
          in the kitchen, listening.

          JESSE (O.S.)
          I'm a deputized police officer,
          we're looking for an escaped
          criminal, just doing a sweep. Seen
          anyone through here the past two
          days, vagrants?

          SARA (O.S.)
          No, vagrants are always passing but
          nobody near the house.
          Footsteps, as they walk deeper in the house. Joe can't tell
          if they're coming through the living room or hall. He
          hesitates.

          JESSE (O.S.)
          This man, here.

          SARA (O.S.)
          He's young. No.
          Then at the last moment Joe slips out the hallway door, as
          they enter from the living room.
          Sara leads Jesse in, holding a photograph of Joe. She pours
          him some water. Jesse hands her a second photograph.

                         JESSE
          We're looking for his father too,
          similar look and build but late
          50s. May or may not be travelling
          together.
          This one is a print-out from a security camera in the Bodega,
          of Old Joe holding a gun on the checkout clerk.
          Sara's eyes linger on Old Joe's photo, side by side with
          Joe's. Mind spinning. Maybe making the connection, we're
          not sure.

                         SARA
          No.
          She tries to hand the photos back but Jesse doesn't take
          them. He notices the toys on the table.

          How old?

                         SARA
          Eight.
          Jesse pokes his head into the hallway, just missing Joe
          slipping through the hall and into the living room.
          He lifts his glass, drinks.

                         JESSE
          Thank you.

                         SARA
          I'll show you round the grounds,
          then the house, then you can be on
          your way.
          Sara holds the screen door open for him.

                         JESSE
          We'll start with the house.
          Jesse strolls into the living room, and we follow him.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM

          He sits on a couch, taps on a small folding phone. Sara
          follows him.

                         JESSE
          Eight, you said? Boy? And your
          husband. Just gotta, check in.
          With the home office. This goddamn
          thing.

                         SARA
          This man dangerous?

                         JESSE
          Tween you me and a lamppost? No.
          Sweet kid. But he's wanted. My
          boss has half the city's looking
          for him. Half the city and me.
          So. And if you find him, there's a
          helluva price. Think on that if he
          comes by, acting sweet.
          Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen. He looks up and sees
          Cid in the foyer, standing halfway down the stairs.

          If Jesse turned his head he would see Cid clear as day.
          Joe motions for Cid to get out. Cid points to Jesse, makes a
          GUN with his hand. Asking Joe.
          Joe shakes his head, sharply motions: get out! Cid silently
          creeps down the stairs.
          He is in full sight of the living room, but Jesse doesn't
          look up from his phone.
          Cid vanishes down the hall. Jesse looks up, stands.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          Alright, show me upstairs.
          The screen door in the kitchen creaks and bangs. Jesse looks
          sharply at Sara.

                         SARA
          Drafts, in the house.
          Jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen. The instant
          Jesse exits, Cid appears again in the hallway.
          Opens a small door under the stairway and beckons Joe.

          JESSE (O.S.)
          This door doesn't latch?

          SARA (O.S.)
          It used to, it's busted.
          Joe hesitates, then silently dashes over and in.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER

          Cid follows him in, down steep concrete stairs. Pulls the
          door closed behind them. It CREAKS. Jesse steps out into
          the hallway, gun drawn. Sara behind him.

          Jesse opens the door, then looks at Sara gravely.

                         JESSE
          Two things. First, I have a family
          of my own back in the city, and I
          want to see them again. Second if
          anything happens to me, and I don't
          report back to my boss people in
          fifteen minutes, they're gonna know
          I disappeared searching this house,
          and inside of another fifteen
          you'll have an army of more me's
          kicking down your door. Ok?

                         SARA
          It's a laundry room.
          Jesse motions - her first.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM

          Bare concrete basement, starkly lit by a hanging bulb. The
          only things in the basement are a small washer and dryer, and
          a large canvas hamper the size of a fridge.
          No windows. Nowhere else to go. Jesse levels his gun at the
          hamper.

                         JESSE
          You want to call out whoever's
          hiding in that hamper?

                         SARA
          If someone was hiding in the house,
          that's what I'd do. But nobody is
          in the house. Open it up.

                         JESSE
          No I think I'm gonna put a shot
          through it just to be safe.
          He raises his gat. Sara stiffens slightly.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          You wanna call him out?
          Sara stays silent. A long beat.
          Then Sara strides over, pulls the hamper open. Empty.
          She throws open the washer and dryer. She takes the bucket
          and shakes it upsidown, dumping out the water, shows him it's
          empty.

          Now if you promise not to wag your
          gun at my shoe rack I'll show you
          upstairs then show you the fuck
          out.
          She storms up the stairs. A little cowed, Jesse holsters his
          gun and follows her.
          The water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the
          room, and into a drain hole under the hamper.

          INT. TUNNEL

          Dark and earthy. Cid leads Joe with his flashlight.

          EXT. BARN - LATE AFTERNOON

          Just outside the barn, a trap door covered with earth opens
          two inches. Joe and Cid prop it open, and peer out at the
          house.

          INT. CRAWL SPACE - CONTINUOUS

          A deep large hole capped with a wooden trap door. Joe
          squats, Cid stands.

                         CID
          My granddad built it, but he didn't
          tell anyone of us why. Nanna said
          cuz he was nuts.

                         JOE
          Thank you granddad.

                         CID
          That wasn't the man.

                         JOE
          No. I know him, that's what's
          funny. His name's Jesse. I like
          him. He'll go away when he doesn't
          find me, he won't hurt her.
          They watch in silence for awhile. In the distance, Jesse
          leaves the house alone and scopes the grounds before walking
          back towards the highway.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          My mom gave me up. I was younger
          than you. We were vagrants, and
          she was alone, for a long time I
          thought she was stupid for getting
          on the drug she was on, it was bad
          stuff, it probably ended up killing
          her.

          But now I see, she was so alone.
          And it was what she had. She sold
          me. To a panhandle gang.
          QUICKLY, SILENTLY WE SEE - FOUR YEAR OLD JOE dragged into
          darkness by rough men, screaming. Then we're back to the
          scene.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          But I got away. And I ran and I
          ended on a train, sitting in the
          dark in an empty freight, going to
          the city, and I saw myself over and
          over killing those men who bought
          me and who got my mom on what she
          was on. Finding them and tearing
          them apart. Saving my mom.

                         CID
          But you didn't.

                         JOE
          A man in the city found me, put a
          gun in my hand, and gave me some
          things. I didn't have my mom
          anymore. I had my work, my money.
          My plans. For my life. That's
          what I'd kill for. Not something I
          don't have, and can't ever get
          back.

                         (BEAT)
          There's just men figuring out what

          kind of man there is.

                         CID
          I'm not gonna let Sara get killed.
          Joe looks at him. Wants to put his hand on his shoulder but
          doesn't.

                         JOE
          I think we're clear.
          He opens the trap door, climbs out.

          EXT. BARN

          Joe reaches down to help Cid out. Looking down at Cid in a
          hole with a trap door. Like Seth.
          He grabs Cid's hand and lifts him out.
          Sara comes out, sees Cid and her face breaks with relief.
          Cid runs to her, and in the distance they embrace.

          to the corn fields.

          INT. SECURITY MONITOR ROOM - EVENING

          A tiny, dark concrete room. Kid Blue watches a screen, his
          hand on a toggle wheel. A security cam view of Suzie's
          apartment building upper landing. Playback of last night.
          It scans quickly forward.
          The APARTMENT SUPER leans against the wall behind him,
          counting money.

                         KID BLUE
          All working girls, yeah?

          Uh huh. This whole block. You

                         KID BLUE
          I do.
          On the screen, Suzie comes home. Picks up her daughter from
          next door. Goes into 205. Kid Blue keeps scanning. And an
          instant later, Old Joe climbs the stairs. Kid Blue slows the
          playback.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          âLo Joe.
          Old Joe goes up to the window, his back to the wall. Watches
          Suzie through the window for a long while. Kid watches him
          intently.
          Then very suddenly, without going inside, Old Joe leaves.
          Down the stairs, shoving his gun in his jacket.

                         SUPER
          I'm an arranger, stranger. Huhuha.
          But you don't see what you wanna
          see, no refunds.
          Old Joe vanishes down the street in a swarm of pixels.

          EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

          Kid Blue emerges from a passage, into the parking lot. Looks
          up at Suzie's apartment door. Then down the street. A few
          drops of rain fall.

          EXT. FRENCH CAR - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Driving on a highway along the beach. A few drops of rain on
          the windshield. Old Joe (late 40s) and his Wife in intense
          conversation, her hand on his.

          You want to, I know that. But you

          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
          I'd do anything for you.

          WIFE (IN FRENCH)
          You'd do. You'd kill for me, you'd
          take life for me. But I don't want
          that. You kill for what you love,
          but someone loves the person you
          kill, and it starts again. I don't
          want that. I can't love a killer.
          What would you give up for me?
          That's yours?

          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
          Anything.
          She smiles but does not believe him. Old Joe sees this. A
          moment, in thought.

          EXT. BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

          The car screeches to a stop, and Old Joe runs to the sea.
          THROWS his gun in the ocean. Above the waters, the sun
          breaks the clouds. Rain falls.
          He runs back to her. Falls on her. Kissing her. He holds
          her face like the most precious thing in the world.

                         OLD JOE
          Anything.

          INT. CHURCH - EVENING

          Rain beats against stained glass. Old Joe kneeling in a pew.
          Fists clenched as if in prayer. He stands, stumbles out.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE - EVENING

          Oddly quiet. Old Joe walks down the sidewalk towards the
          side entrance to the theater. Face uncovered. In plain
          sight. Not caring. Stops 30 feet shy of the entrance, at a
          street garbage can.
          He draws his gun and leans over to drop it into the can. He
          lets it dangle from his fingers above the trash can.
          His pocket watch, hanging open from its chain. The picture
          of his Wife inside. Spinning. His gun slowly slipping from
          his grasp.

          With each spin of the watch, the photo of his Wife appears
          cloudier. Blurred. Indistinct.
          Gun on the tips of his fingers, about to fall. Then the
          photo is nearly gone.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.

          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Old Joe staggering to his feet from a fight.
          We've seen this before, it's the IDENTICAL SCENE to the
          previous flashback.
          But when he sees his Wife for the first time, whisps of FOG
          grow, blotting out the scene. Deep in the fog are other
          backgrounds - a street, a house - and unfamiliar faces.
          Other eventualities, clouding this one as it becomes less
          likely Old Joe will meet his wife and have this memory.
          Erasing it.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Old Joe in bed with his wife. Baby crying outside. Her
          face. Then, whisps of FOG thickens, obscuring them.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.

          EXT. FRENCH BEACH - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The thrown gun splashes in the sea, and Old Joe turns back to
          the beach. But where his Wife was in the previous memory,
          now there is the FOG.
          A wall of it, massive, reaching to the sky. Old Joe dwarfed
          against it. Caught between the roiling waves and this wall of
          nothingness falling towards him.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.
          The gun on his fingertips. About to fall. A moment of
          decision.

          INT. SARA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Sara lies in bed. Eyes wide open. Still and quiet in the
          dark. Her hand moves over her bare leg. Slides across the
          sheets. Finds the Frog Buzzer lying next to her.
          A moment of hesitation. Then she pushes it.
          Silence. Her eyes go to the window. A long beat. Then
          sound: a door opening in the house below.

          Quick footsteps approaching. Her eyes follow them. The door
          flies open. Joe, gun in hand, buzzer in the other. His eyes
          adjust to the dark.

                         JOE
          What?
          Closes the door, kisses him. The adrenaline in his head
          doesn't know where to go.

                         SARA
          Don't wake Cid.
          She pulls him to the bed, lifting his shirt off. The rain
          starts to fall against the windows.

                         LATER
          Lying beside each other. Joe still stunned.
          Sara smokes a real cigarette, taking a deep joyful drag. She
          sets the lighter on her palm. It floats about a foot in the
          air, spinning, then drops.

                         JOE
          That's pretty good.

                         SARA
          In the city, young guys would hit
          on me by floating fucking quarters,
          I wouldn't tell âem I was TK but
          I'd keep their quarters down. One

          the city when I got the call, I was
          wearing this ridiculous party
          dress. All my ridiculous shit. I

          he looked at me. I abandoned him.
          I abandoned my baby.

          Maybe I can't be a mother to him,

          When he looked at me then, on the
          porch, he was mine again, he was my
          son. I seen so many men in the
          city, who I look in their eyes and
          they're lost. Whether he loves me
          back or not I'm gonna love my son I
          said. And he's never gonna get
          lost.
          Joe sitting up still, Sara lying beside him, maybe crying.
          He touches her hair.

          INT. APARTMENT 205 - EARLY MORNING

          A DOOR FRAME - kicked open with all the violence in the

          Suzie cooking in a robe, opens her mouth to scream.

          I threw my gun away once. To get

          again, now. Because I know she'd
          want me to. I was going to do it.
          And I saw then, I saw her
          vanishing, like how life probably
          goes when you die. That's what she
          was asking me to give up this time.

          Old Joe, gun ready, down the darkened hallway towards the

          instinct, spins and draws on Cid.
          Cid's POV - Jesse's gun, snapping like a snake, barrel
          leveled at him. Cid makes a strange shouting noise, falls
          back.

          Jesse realizes it's a kid. Lowers his gun. But Cid is mid-
          scream, falling back, his foot misses the step and he tumbles
          down the stairs.
          Confused, terrified, falling. Joe runs into the foyer, to
          catch Cid. Sara runs behind him.
          The room is very dark now. Knick-knacks around the room
          rattle, then LIFT INTO THE AIR. All of them. Floating.
          Spinning. Sara's LIGHTER, on the coffee table: it RISES

          Shoving him TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR. He's confused but her
          face is set.
          Cid hits the hardwood floor of the foyer, face contorted with
          rage now, hand raised to Jesse, palm outstretched.

          Chairs. The couch. And Jesse. He rises five feet in the

          Sara pulls Joe through the front door, and he looks back and
          sees Jesse suspended in the air and Cid on the ground
          screaming like an animal, and just as they cross the

          Joe emerges from the corn.
          Cid crouches at one end of the small clearing. He looks at
          Joe. Terrified. Half covered in blood. Hair matted over
          one eye.
          Joe looks back at him. Approaches him, gun not raised, but
          in hand. Cid, like a frightened animal. A long moment.
          And just like that, Joe puts his hand on Cid's head. Cid
          leans against his legs, crying.
          Sara bursts into the clearing, sees this. Runs to Cid and
          embraces him, wiping the blood from his face. Joe steps back.

          Right now two things have happened.

          Old Joe's hands bound back. Kid Blue glows. He comes to the

          all the Gats are here, the whole
          crew's arming up to make a sweep.

                         KID BLUE
          Joe fuck Joe, save your bullets I
          got the Looper. Not such a fuck up
          huh? I'm taking him up to
          This happens very fast:
          Old Joe uses his legs to kick himself off the wall and back
          into Kid Blue, SLAMMING him against the opposite wall.
          Old Joe grabs (behind his back) Kid Blue's gun, and blasts
          one shot through the chains binding his wrists and into the
          Kid's midsection.
          He whips the gun from behind his back and shoots Big Craig in
          the face. Then blasts the Gat Men in the entrance hallway
          while he reaches into the coat check and pulls an automatic
          rifle.
          He blasts like hell into the hallway. A few shots return but
          mostly the men are trapped. Then it's over. All is smoky
          still for a moment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          Old Joe stares at the exit door ajar, down the long hallway
          jammed with bodies. Then at the passage that leads deeper
          into the club.
          A Gat Man runs in, and Old Joe shoots him down.
          He steps into the coat check and loads his pockets with guns
          and grenades. Then launches himself into passageway towards
          the club.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          Old Joe weaves his way through the backstage area, chucking
          grenades in front of him, then unloading his automatic rifle
          into the smoky aftermath.
          And with a mixture of dumb luck and skill from years of being
          gangland muscle takes out Gat Man after Gat Man.
          The corridors are tight, twisty. Old Joe uses that.
          Throwing grenades. Blasting away. Purging. Killing
          everyone he lays eyes on. Wiping them out. All the bad guys.
          It's horrible. Men maimed, bleeding and crying, dying the way
          people actually die from gunshots. Old Joe forges on, deeper.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Empty. Old Joe kicks the door open. Takes it in, the
          office. Hammer on the desk. He reloads a gun. Eyes find
          the door to Abe's inner den.

          INT. ABE'S DEN

          Abe and two Gat Men, guns out, crouched behind the table.
          Watching the door. A display screen shows Old Joe on the
          other side.
          Abe, eyes dull. Shouts at the door

                         ABE
          Joe. Guess I put the gun in that
          kid's hand, huh Joe. Guess
          everything comes back around. Like
          your goddamn ties.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Old Joe. Breathing hard. Reloaded. Closes the gun.

          EXT. HIGHWAY

          Joe breaks out of the corn, panting. He steps out into the
          middle of the highway.
          Storm clouds on the horizon. He cleans and readies his
          Blunderbuss.

          INT. COAT CHECK - LATER

          Kid Blue's eyes flutter open. He lifts himself painfully.
          Checks his chest. Most of the shot caught his shoulder, his
          chest is grazed.
          The Gat Men in the hall. Big Craig. All dead.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          Kid Blue wanders the smoky halls. Dead and dying men.

          INT. ABE'S DEN

          Abe, shot once in the head, twice in the chest. Kid Blue
          stands over them. Stunned. Tears well in his eyes.
          Then on the wall, he sees the map. The farm circled in red.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING

          Clothes and boxes piled in the back of Jesse's truck. Sara
          loads one last bundle. Calls to Cid, in the front seat.

                         SARA
          Ok baby, we're going.

          EXT. HIGHWAY

          Joe waits. Then, a CLOUD OF DUST on the distant highway. He
          tenses. The cloud gets closer. It is a truck. An armored
          truck.
          Joe squints. It's the ARMORED TRUCK that Kid Blue loaded his
          gold bricks into. The front windshield blown in.
          The truck stops fifty feet away, and Old Joe steps out. He
          throws a gold bar, which lands in the dusty highway between
          them.

                         OLD JOE
          Bon jour. You take this truck, you
          take your money, and you go live
          your life. No one's coming after
          you. I fixed it.

                         JOE
          And you go kill the boy. That's
          how you fix it.

                         OLD JOE
          That's how. You got your life
          back, you better think right now
          about what that's worth to you.

                         JOE
          My life? Your life. Becoming you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.
          Joe raises his Blunderbuss and FIRES. Too far away, the shot
          scatters. The old man flinches, backs away.
          Joe walks forward towards Old Joe, stepping over the gold.

                         OLD JOE
          Stupid little shit! You let him
          live, he's gonna take away
          everything that's yours, everything
          that's mine! You seen what the
          boy's gonna become.

                         JOE
          I haven't seen that yet.
          Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's
          chest and knock him back.
          Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has
          until now blocked our line of sight down the highway.
          Kid Blue.
          The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to
          the dusty pavement.
          The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its
          wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a
          stop and spin it around.
          Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss.
          Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as
          a rock.
          Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires
          scattershot.
          Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe.
          Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round
          after fiery round.
          Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud.
          KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud
          of dust and smoke. He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to
          slow the bike but can't in time.
          In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him.
          He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly
          FIRES his buss.
          A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without
          a driver. It skids, crashes.
          When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head.

          Besides him, the broken remains of Kid Blue.
          Painfully, Joe raises himself. Then realizes:
          Old Joe is gone.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN

          Sara starts the truck up.

                         SARA
          Here we go. Give it a wave
          goodbye.

          EXT. DIRT ROAD

          They roll down the dirt road that leads to the highway.
          At the far end of it, at a distance but walking towards them,
          is the dark figure of Old Joe. Gun in hand.
          Sara hesitates a minute, then guns it. Straight for him.

                         CID

                         STOP

                         SARA
          Duck down baby

                         CID
          Stop please he can shoot us

                         SARA
          Just stay down
          Half the distance closed, but he's still far off. A shot
          cracks the front grill, another cracks the windshield.

                         CID
          Stop!
          The truck lurches horribly, and flips straight back in a
          graceful arc, landing upsidown.
          Sara and Cid, dazed, hanging by their seatbelts.

                         SARA
          Are you ok?

                         CID
          I'm sorry
          In the rear view mirror, Sara sees Old Joe getting closer.

                         SARA
          You're ok. C'mon baby we have to
          run now.

          She unfastens them and they both climb out, and Old Joe stops
          suddenly, taking aim.
          Sara pulls Cid behind the flatbed for cover as two bullets
          glance off the overturned truck.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          We're going into the fields. I
          want you to run, I'll be right
          behind you, don't look back. Okay?
          Old Joe lowers his gun and runs towards them.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Go!
          They both sprint off the road.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          The wide bare field. Cid runs ahead towards the corn, Sara
          not far behind. The earth soft, their feet sink in, like a
          nightmare.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe crosses the road and chases them onto the field,
          firing at them on the run.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Bullets thunk in the earth. Sara stumbles, exhausted. Cid
          turns, about thirty feet ahead of her.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe stops running and steadies his gun.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          A distant gunshot CRACK. A fan of crimson blood sprays from
          Cid's head. His neck twists and he crumples to the ground.

                         SARA

          NO!
          Sara is stopped in her tracks by an invisible force.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          No Cid no!
          The topsoil of the earth around them RISES in a fine dust.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe reacts as the topsoil rises, an eerie moment.

          Sara struggles to reach Cid but is still about twenty feet
          behind him.
          Cid raises his head. The bullet grazed his jawline. Not
          severe but lots of blood.
          Cid's eyes locked hateful on Old Joe. Blood soaks his shirt.
          Far behind him, the barn splinters apart as if in a tornado.

                         SARA
          No!
          With a sudden jolt the field ripples out from Cid, like a
          stone thrown in a pond.
          Sara lifts into the air.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe is hefted off the ground. His gun falls.

          EXT. CORN FIELDS - CONTINUOUS

          Joe struggling through the fields, limping, desperate.
          Something like a furious wind rushes through the stalks.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Cid stands. Intense, eyes dark, in another place.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe, suspended mid-air, realizes what's about to happen.
          He lifts his hand defensively and SCREAMS

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Cid's face straining, about to scream.
          Cid's focus adjusts from Old Joe to Sara. She floats,
          reaching out to him. Frightened. Yelling something he can't
          hear but he can see her eyes.
          Cid's face breaks. He barely mouths the word

                         CID

                         MOM
          And everything FALLS. Sara, Old Joe, the earth. All comes
          crashing down.

          EXT. EDGE OF FIELD - CONTINUOUS

          The corn stalks shiver then are still.

          Joe breaks out of the stalks and onto the field. Gasping for
          breath. Gets his bearings. In the far distance across the
          field, Old Joe, Sara and Cid.
          Too far.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Cid runs to Sara, who sits up slowly. They embrace.

                         SARA
          You did good, baby. You did so
          good. I love you.
          Behind them, Old Joe struggles to his feet. Sara kisses Cid.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Into the fields. Run now baby.
          Go.

          No no mom no

                         SARA
          You go!
          She pushes him away and Cid runs. Then she turns. Standing
          her ground. Directly between Old Joe and Cid.
          Old Joe TRIPS in the mud, fumbles his gun. Sees Cid
          approaching the safety of the CORN STALKS. Blocked by Sara.

                         OLD JOE
          Move!

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Still too far away, struggling as fast as he can, helpless as
          Old Joe closes in on Sara. He fires his buss at Old Joe, but
          is way out of range.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA

          Old Joe gets his gun, rises with it. Cid about to hit the
          stalks. Sara between them.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID

          Cid nears the corn fields, running. Seconds from safety.

          Old Joe. Gun raised. Pocket watch wrapped around it. His
          wife's picture in it. Clear as day.
          No time to move around Sara. Now or never.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe running, useless gun in hand.

          No!

          Sara, not going anywhere.

                         OLD JOE
          I'm sorry
          He pulls the trigger.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe running. Time slows. Watching:

          EXT. FIELD - OLD JOE & SARA

          Everything is a little surreal. Dream-like. Slow.
          Old Joe shoots Sara.
          We hear no gunshot. Just the wind in the corn, and young
          Joe's breathing. She falls, giving him a clear shot at Cid.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE


                         JOE WATCHING:

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID

          Just as Old Joe gets him in his sights, Cid breaches the corn
          fields and is gone, vanishing in the stalks.
          Old Joe lowers his gun, stunned but still frantic. He
          stumbles towards the corn, still far off, his face breaking.
          Trips, falls in the mud. Corn field vast in front of him.
          Cid is gone. He lost him. He holds his pocket watch. Sobs.
          Lost.

          EXT. CORN FIELDS

          On the horizon, a train.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE


                         JOE WATCHING:

          INT./EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR

          Cid sits in a darkened car, holding a bloody rag to his jaw.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe watching, seeing:

          INT./EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR

          Cid's face. Bloody. Dirty. His eyes full of hate. The
          train rumbles towards the dark city.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe watches. Sees, in his mind's eye, all of this.
          And through all of this we have only heard the wind. And Joe
          breathing.
          Time hanging, slowed nearly to a stop. A moment of decision.
          Joe turns his blunderbuss back on himself and FIRES.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA

          Revealing that all we saw was in Joe's head, and we are still
          in the moment where Old Joe is about to shoot Sara.
          But this time, just as he's pulling the trigger, a distant
          shot is heard.
          And Old Joe DISAPPEARS.
          Sara stands shell shocked just for a moment. Then she
          doesn't process any of it, she just turns and yells

                         SARA

          CID!

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID

          Cid stops just shy of the corn. Turns back to the field.
          There's his mom, Sara, unharmed and smiling. The bad man is
          gone. The field is empty.

          EXT. FIELD - SEEN FROM JOE'S POV

          We don't see Joe, but far across the field Cid runs to his
          mom, into her arms. Sara lifts him, holds him.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          She carries him. Walking fast back towards a far distant
          figure lying still on the edge of the field. Joe.
          Then a faint buzz. The flasher, in her pocket. She pulls it
          out. Two flashes.
          She slows. Stops. Looking at him, far away. Two flashes.

                         CID
          Where's Joe?

                         SARA
          He had to go away, baby.

                         CID
          He took the bad man with him?
          She kisses him.

          EXT. FIELD - FROM JOE'S POV

          In the distance, Sara turns away and carries Cid back towards
          the farmhouse.

          INT. CID'S BATHROOM

          Sara bathes Cid, dresses the wound on his jaw.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          She tucks Cid in, holds him close. Kisses his forehead.

          EXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON

          Sara emerges from the ruined front door, crosses the porch.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN

          Sara crosses the lawn, and walks across the field.

          EXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS

          Joe's body. Sara goes to him, slowly. She kneels beside him.
          His pocket watch in the dirt. Open. No photo inside.
          Ticking away. Around and around.
          She closes it.Touches his hair. The wind through the corn.
          After a long while, the sun breaks through the clouds.
