          INT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          WALTER VALE, sixty-two, is standing by the window of his
          modestly furnished Colonial house. He is holding a glass of
          wine and peering out through the drapes.
          
          After a few moments an OLD CAR pulls up. A slightly
          overweight WOMAN gets out of the car. She starts to walk up
          to the house.
          
          Walter steps back from the window and waits. The doorbell
          rings. Walter takes a last sip of wine and sets the glass
          down on the end table. And then he goes to the door and opens
          it.
          
                                 WOMAN
                    Mr. Vale?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              WOMAN
                    Hello. I'm Barbra Watson. Nice to
                    meet you.
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. Come in.
          
                                 BARBARA
                    Thank you.
          
          She steps into the house and Walter shuts the door. They both
          stand there awkwardly. Barbara is tightly wound and
          overcompensates with a forced pleasantness.
          
                              WALTER
                    Can I take your coat?
          
                              BARBARA
                    No, thank you.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. Would you like anything to
                    drink?
          
                                 BARBARA
                    No.
                        (Beat)
                    Shall we get started?
          
                                 WALTER
                    OK.

          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, PIANO ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter and Barbara sit side by side in a very close
          proximity.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Let's try it again.
          
                              WALTER
                    The same thing?
          
                              BARBARA
                    Yes. Remember, fingers curved. Like
                    a tunnel.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK.
          
          Walter starts to play the piano. It's a lesson in progress.
          They are sitting at a beautiful GRAND PIANO but Walter is
          only a beginner. And not a very good beginner.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Don't flatten.
          
          Walter keeps playing.
          
                              BARBARA (CONT'D)
                    Make room for the train.
          
          Walter stops.
          
                              WALTER
                    What?
          
                              BARBARA
                    I said "make room for the train."
                    It's something that I tell my kids.
                    If you curve your fingers like
                    this...
                        (She demonstrates)
                    Then the train can pass through the
                    tunnel.
          
          She passes her pencil through her curved fingers. Walter
          looks at her for a long moment.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          Walter walks Barbara to the front door. He opens it and then
          hands Barbara some money.

                    Here.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Thank you. Next Tuesday at the same
                    time?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. I don't think I'm going to
                    continue with our lessons.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Oh, no. Are you giving up?
          
                               WALTER
                    No.
          
          Barbara gets the point. He is stopping with her, not the
          lessons.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Oh. OK. Goodbye.
          
                               WALTER
                    Goodbye.
          
          Barbara walks out the door and then turns before Walter shuts
          it.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Mr. Vale? If I may ask, how many
                    teachers have you had before me?
          
                               WALTER
                    Four.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Well, for what it's worth, it's
                    difficult to learn an instrument at
                    your age. Especially if you don't
                    possess a natural gift for it. I'm
                    not saying this to be mean. But if
                    you do decide to give up then I
                    would really like to buy your
                    piano. It's a beautiful instrument.
          
          Walter nods, not quite sure how to receive the comment.
          
                               BARBARA (CONT'D)
                    Goodbye.
          
          Barbara turns and leaves. Walter shuts the door.

          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, LECTURE HALL - DAY
          
          Walter stands before a half-empty class. He is wrapping up a
          lecture on economic theory. There is nothing inspiring about
          it.
          
                              WALTER
                    East Asia's experience is really
                    the exception to the rule, because
                    the conditions there that made
                    trade liberalization for the Middle
                    East successful weren't present in
                    the developing countries in sub-
                    Saharan Africa, and in Central and
                    South America.
          
          
          EXT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CAMPUS - DAY
          
          Walter walks across the campus.
          
          
          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter sits in a meeting with seven other COLLEAGUES.
          
          
          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER
          
          Walter is staring out the window in his simple but very lived-
          in office. Classical music plays softly in the background. A
          knock at the door.
          
                               WALTER
                    Come in.
          
          A STUDENT opens the door and enters.
          
                               STUDENT
                    Hi.
          
          He sits down and sets a paper on the desk.
          
                              STUDENT (CONT'D)
                    Sorry it's late.
          
                              WALTER
                    Why is it late?
          
                              STUDENT
                    I had some personal things to deal
                    with.
          
                     5
          
          
          
          Walter hands back the paper.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm sorry. I can't accept it now.
          
                                 STUDENT
                    But...
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm sorry.
          
          Walter goes back to work. The Student sits stunned for a
          moment and then gets up and picks up his paper. He opens the
          door and then stops.
          
                              STUDENT
                    You know you still haven't given us
                    a syllabus.
          
                              WALTER
                        (Lying)
                    I know.
          
          The Student shakes his head and leaves without another word.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
          
          Walter pulls into the driveway of his house. He gets out,
          grabs his belongings out of the back seat and walks inside.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DUSK
          
          Walter is making dinner. Classical music plays from the other
          room. He adjusts the flame and covers a sauce pot. He leans
          against the counter and picks up a half empty bottle of wine
          and pours some into his glass. He catches sight of A SMALL
          FRAMED PICTURE of him and HIS WIFE, smiling.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE,    LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter sits at the piano and practices. It is still going
          badly. The wine glass sits on top of the piano. He lifts his
          hand and inspects his "tunnel".
          
          
          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Walter is at his computer. He pulls up his YEAR SYLLABUS on
          the computer and carefully changes 2005 to 2006. He saves it.
          His work is done. There is a knock at the door.

                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
          The door opens and Walter's colleague, CHARLES VAN HORN steps
          in.
          
                              CHARLES
                    Hello Walter.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Charles.
          
                              CHARLES
                    I'm sorry to interrupt.
          
                                 WALTER
                    That's OK.
          
                              CHARLES
                    Walter, Shelley can't make it down
                    to the NYU conference to present
                    your paper. I'm going to need you
                    to cover for her.
          
                              WALTER
                    Why can't she go?
          
                              CHARLES
                    She's been put on bed rest until
                    she has the baby.
          
          Walter is caught off guard.
          
                                 WALTER
                    When?
          
                              CHARLES
                    Next week. We'll cover your class
                    and make the arrangements.
          
                              WALTER
                    I wish I could, but now is not a
                    very good time, Charles.
          
                              CHARLES
                    I understand but you co-authored
                    the paper and the Dean wants it
                    presented. He wants to keep Shelley
                    on track for tenure.
          
                              WALTER
                    I just don't think I can with the
                    start of classes and my book.

                              CHARLES
                    You're only teaching one class,
                    Walter.
          
                               WALTER
                    So I can stay focused on my
                    writing. I'd really rather not go
                    right now.
          
                              CHARLES
                    I'm sorry but there really isn't
                    another option at this point.
          
          Walter is trapped. He comes clean.
          
                              WALTER
                    Charles, the truth is this is
                    really Shelley's paper. I just
                    agreed to co-author it because she
                    asked me to. I'm not really
                    prepared to present it.
          
                              CHARLES
                    That may be the case but you are
                    the co-author and she can't go.
                    Look Walter, you can take it up
                    with the Dean if you want, but, as
                    your friend, I wouldn't advise it.
                    Not with that argument.
          
          Walter just stares him.
          
                                CHARLES (CONT'D)
                    Good bye.
          
          And Charles is gone, shutting the door behind him.
          
          
          INT. NEW LONDON, THE BLIND TIGER BAR - NIGHT
          
          Walter sits at the end of a bar at a local pub. He is reading
          the newspaper. KAREN, a 44-year-old bartender, is talking to
          a BlONDE HAIRED WOMAN at other end of the bar.
          
          The wall is covered with HAND DRAWN CARICATURES OF REGULAR
          PATRONS. A WAITER hands a plate of food to Karen. She walks
          down the bar and sets it in front of Walter.
          
                              KAREN
                    Here you go, cutey.
          
                                WALTER
                    Thanks.

                              KAREN
                    So I thought you forgot about me.
                    Where've you been hiding?
          
          Karen automatically refills his wine glass.
          
                              WALTER
                    Just busy with work.
          
                              KAREN
                    Well you're never gonna make it on
                    the wall with that excuse. I'm glad
                    your back. Give a holler if you
                    need anything. I'm just gabbing
                    with one of my girlfriends.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK.
          
          She walks back down the bar. Walter starts to eat.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - MORNING
          
          Two cars are parked in Walter's driveway.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME
          
          Walter is packing, laying out his shirts on the bed. After a
          moment, Karen walks in, drying her hair with a towel.
          
                              KAREN
                    When are you going?
          
                              WALTER
                    Today after class.
          
          She takes her earrings of the night stand and puts them in.
          
                              KAREN
                    Sounds like fun. I'm gonna go have
                    a cigarette. You want some coffee?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. Thanks.
          
          Karen leaves. Walter keeps packing.
          
          
          EXT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CAFFETERIA - DAY
          
          Walter sits at a table and eats lunch alone.
          
                        9
          
          
          
          
          EXT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, PARKING LOT - LATER
          
          Walter walks across the parking lot and gets into his car.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Walter drives along the highway. He notices a SIGN which
          reads "Support Our Troops!"
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK CITY, F.D.R. DRIVE - SUNSET
          
          Walter's car drives down the F.D.R Highway.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S CAR - DUSK.
          
          Walter drives through the small busy streets of the East
          Village.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK CITY, EAST VILLAGE, PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          Walter pulls into a parking garage. He gets out and takes a
          ticket from the attendant. He grabs his bag and briefcase
          from the back seat.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET, EAST VILLAGE - NIGHT
          
          He walks down the street, taking in the sights and sounds of
          the city.
          
          
          EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER
          
          Walter walks out of a liquor store with a SMALL BROWN BAG.
          
          
          EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME
          
          Walter arrives at a classic tenement building. He looks up at
          the building as if inspecting it.
          
          He takes out his keys. He opens the door and walks in.
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME
          
          Walter walks into the well-lit but dingy foyer.   A YOUNG MAN
          brushes by him.
          
                       10
          
          
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, FOURTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
          
          He arrives at the second floor and stops in front of a door.
          He unlocks the door and walks in.
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter steps into the apartment and drops his bags. He
          immediately notices that the kitchen light is on. Something
          is not right.
          
                              WALTER
                    Hello?
          
          He turns on the living room light and crosses to the kitchen
          table and sets the brown bag down. It's then that he notices
          some fresh flowers on the kitchen table. He looks slightly
          confused. He looks around the apartment. There is an UPRIGHT
          PIANO along one wall.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Hello?
          
          There is no answer. He walks down a LONG HALLWAY and looks in
          the kitchen. Nothing. He walks over to the FIRST BEDROOM and
          looks inside. There are signs of someone living there. He
          looks in the SECOND BEDROOM. He sees nothing.
          
          Suddenly he hears the sound of running water from the
          bathroom. He notices a light under the door. He walks to the
          bathroom and listens. A faucet is turned and the water stops
          running. He opens the door and looks in.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - SAME
          
          A YOUNG BLACK WOMAN is soaking in the bath tub.   She see's
          Walter and screams.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - SAME
          
          Walter screams too and then slams the door, stepping back
          into the hallway.
          
                              YOUNG BLACK WOMAN
                    Stay away from me!
          
          She has a West African accent.
          
                    11
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    It's OK. I'm not going...
          
                              AFRICAN WOMAN
                    Leave me alone! My boyfriend is
                    coming home!
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm not going to hurt you.
          
                              AFRICAN WOMAN
                    Who are you? What are you doing in
                    here!?
          
                              WALTER
                    This is my apartment.
          
                              AFRICAN WOMAN
                    What do you mean? This apartment
                    does not belong to you. How did you
                    get in?
          
                              WALTER
                    My name is Walter Vale. I have
                    keys. It's my...
          
          Suddenly Walter is pushed up against the wall. Hard.
          
                              MAN'S VOICE
                    What the fuck?!
          
          A very angry, YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN is in Walter's face.
          He grabs Walter violently by the collar and shakes him.
          
                              YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
                    Who are you?! Zainab?!
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I'm in here! He is crazy!
          
                              WALTER
                    Stop it! I am not...
          
          The Young Middle Eastern Man slams him against the wall. It's
          more of a warning shot then a violent act. Walter is
          terrified.
          
                               YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
                    Shut up!
          
                               WALTER
                    OK. OK.
          
                 12
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB (O.S.)
                        (In French)
                    Tarek. What is happening?
          
                              TAREK
                        (In French)
                    Are you OK?
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    I'm fine.
          
                              TAREK
                        (In French)
                    Who is this?
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    I have no idea! I was in the bath
                    and he was just standing there.
          
                              TAREK
                        (Shaking Walter)
                    Did you touch her?! Did you touch
                    her?!
          
                              WALTER
                    No! No!
          
          Zainab opens the door.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    He didn't touch me! But how did he
                    get in? He said he has keys.
          
                              TAREK
                    Do you have keys?
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes! Yes! I have keys. It's my
                    apartment.
          
          Tarek stares at Walter, trying to make sense of it.
          
                               ZAINAB
                        (in French)
                    What does he mean it's his
                    apartment?
          
                              TAREK
                    I don't know! Show me your keys!
          
                    13
          
          
          
          Walter reaches into his pocket and holds up his keys.
          
                              WALTER
                    This is my apartment. I've owned it
                    for twenty-five years.
          
                              TAREK
                    So why haven't you been here!?
          
                              WALTER
                    I live in Connecticut. I haven't
                    used it in a long time.
          
          Walter is starting to get through.
          
                              TAREK
                    Are you friends with Ivan?
          
                              WALTER
                    Ivan? Who is Ivan?
          
          Tarek is getting nervous.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    I knew this would happen! He
                    probably called the police.
          
          This catches Tarek's attention.
          
                              TAREK
                        (to Walter)
                    Did you call the police?
          
          Walter hesitates.
          
                              WALTER
                    No.
          
                              TAREK
                    You didn't call the police?
          
                              WALTER
                    No.
          
          Tarek looks like he might belt Walter. Instead, he lets him
          go and quickly backs up. He paces while trying to gather his
          thoughts. Walter doesn't move. Zainab runs into the bedroom.
          
                              TAREK
                    And you don't know Ivan?
          
                    14
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't know Ivan. Who is he?
          
                              TAREK
                    He rented us this place. He said it
                    belonged to his friend who was out
                    of town.
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't know who he is but this is
                    my apartment. I assure you.
          
          Tarek looks at Walter for a long moment. It's clear that he's
          telling the truth.
          
                               TAREK
                    Shit!
          
                              ZAINAB (O.S.)

                    I told you not to trust anyone. You
                    never saw a contract.
          
                               TAREK
                    Enough! OK. Look. We don't want any
                    trouble. We will get out of your
                    apartment. This is all a mistake.
                    I'm sorry.
          
                               WALTER
                    OK.
          
                              TAREK
                    We will leave, OK?
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes. OK.
          
          Zainab emerges from the bedroom. She is dressed.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    Where are we going to go?
          
                              TAREK
                        (In French)
                    I don't know but we have to go.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    I know we have to go. I am not
                    stupid!
          
                      15
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    Are you OK?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. I'm just going to sit down.
          
                              TAREK
                    Of course. Please.
          
          Walter nods and then slowly walks down the hallway and sits
          down. He is clearly shaken. Tarek shuts the front door.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry if I hurt you. Are you
                    sure that you're OK?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. I'm OK.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. Well, we'll pack up and get
                    out.
          
          Tarek walks back toward the bedroom. Walter tries to catch
          his breath.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - LATER
          
          Walter is sitting on the couch with a glass of wine. Tarek
          enters and sets down a bag. He picks up TWO AFRICAN DRUMS
          next to the piano and places them by the front door.
          
          Zainab enters from the bedroom mumbling something in an
          African dialect. She drops a bag and crosses back to the
          bedroom.
          
                              TAREK
                    I know I'm in trouble when she
                    starts speaking Wolof.
          
                              WALTER
                    How long have you lived here?
          
                              TAREK
                    Two months. We will pay you if you
                    want.
          
          Walter doesn't respond. Zainab emerges from the bedroom again
          with the last bag.
          
                       16
          
          
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                        (To Zainab)
                    Is that everything?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I think so. Do you want to check!?
          
          He hands her a SMALL PLASTIC BAG from a local grocery.
          
                              TAREK
                    Here is the coffee you wanted.
          
          She snatches it without a word.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                        (To Walter)
                    OK. So we'll go. I am sorry again.
                    Thank you for your understanding.
                    Good bye.
          
                                WALTER
                    Good bye.
          
          They turn and exit. Walter gets up and walks over to the
          front door and locks it.
          
          He stands by the front door trying to process the events.
          Then something catches his attention.
          
          
          WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter walks to the window and picks up a handcrafted,
          decorative FRAME off of the sill. It is a PHOTOGRAPH of Tarek
          and Zainab. They are hugging each other and smiling. Walter
          looks down onto the street.
          
          He sees Zainab and Tarek exit the building and cross the
          street. Zainab's cart tips on the curb and the contents spill
          out onto the sidewalk. Tarek quickly moves to help her.
          Zainab yells at him.
          
          Walter watches as they finally collect their belongings and
          move down the street.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - LATER
          
          Tarek has set his bags down in front of a closed store. He is
          talking in a very agitated tone on his cell phone. Zainab
          stands by silently.
          
                    17
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                        (In Arabic)
                    Look I know. Come on man, it'll
                    just be for a night or two until we
                    figure something out. OK.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek?
          
                              TAREK
                        (In Arabic)
                    Can you check and call me back?
                    OK. Thanks.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek?
          
                              TAREK
                    What!?
          
          Zainab points. Walter is standing there holding the framed
          photograph.
          
                              WALTER
                    You left this at the apartment.
          
          Tarek walks over and takes it.
          
                              TAREK
                    Thanks.
          
          Walter nods.
          
                              WALTER
                    Do you know where you're going to
                    stay tonight?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah.
          
          The lie is obvious. They are stuck. Walter just nods again.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter takes some books out of his briefcase. He crosses to
          the bookshelf and sets them down. He notices a small stack of
          CD's sitting on a shelf. He picks one of them up and stares
          at the CD for a long moment.
          
                              TAREK
                    You like classical music, huh?
          
                     18
          
          
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
          Walter sets down the CD.
          
                              TAREK
                    Me too. Do you play piano?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No.
                        (Beat)
                    Do you?
          
                              TAREK
                    Me? No. I play the djembe. Well,
                    thanks again for letting us stay.
                    You saved me a lot of trouble.
          
          Walter nods.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    See you in the morning.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. Good night.
          
          Tarek goes to bed. Walter resumes his work.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Walter is lying in bed, unable to sleep. He can hear Tarek
          and Zainab whispering and laughing.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, TAREK AND ZAINAB'S ROOM - SAME
          
          Tarek and Zainab are lying in bed together.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Stop it, Tarek. He'll hear us.
          
                              TAREK
                    Trust me. He's asleep.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    You don't know that.
          
                              TAREK
                    So let him hear. The guy probably
                    needs some excitement.
          
                    19
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I think he's probably had enough
                    for one night.
          
          Tarek nuzzles her. Zainab laughs but pushes him away.
          
                                 ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    Tarek. No!
          
          Zainab sits up in the bed. Tarek relents and rolls onto his
          back.
          
                              ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    What are we going to do, Tarek?
          
                               TAREK
                    I don't know. We'll figure it out
                    tomorrow. Who knows? Maybe he'll
                    let us stay. He's not really using
                    the place.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't want to be his roommate!
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. OK. So we'll figure it out in
                    the morning. I promise, habibti.
          
          Zainab shakes her head.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Do you still love me?
          
          Zainab looks at him.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    No.
          
                                 TAREK
                    Really?
          
          Zainab rolls over and straddles Tarek.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. I don't love you.
          
          She kisses Tarek.
          
                              TAREK
                    Not even a little?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    No.
          
                    20
          
          
          
          She kisses him again.
          
                              TAREK
                    So what is this?
          
          She gets very close to his face.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    It's your punishment.
          
                              TAREK
                    But what about our roommate?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Shhh.
          
          She kisses him long and hard. They start to make love.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
          
          Jacob walks outside with Sprinkles.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Walter is tying his tie in the mirror.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - LATER
          
          Walter walks out of his bedroom and runs into Zainab who is
          leaving her bedroom at the same time. It's obvious that she
          was trying to avoid Walter.
          
                              WALTER
                    Good morning.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Morning.
          
                              WALTER
                    I made some coffee.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Thank you.
          
                              WALTER
                    Have a good day.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Goodbye.
          
                       21
          
          
          
          Walter leaves.

          The Kimmel Center towers over Washington Square Park.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY - DAY
          
          Walter is listening to the speaker.
          
                              SPEAKER
                    That will be on the last day of
                    conference. I hope you can all
                    attend. And now I'd like to welcome
                    my distinguished colleague and
                    the winner of John Bates Clark
                    Award, Stephen Kriegman.
          
          STEPHEN KRIEGMAN strides to the podium. He is a good deal
          younger then Walter.
          
                              STEPHEN KRIEGMAN
                    Thank you, Shiva. Good morning.
                    It's a pleasure to be here.
          
          
          INT. NYU BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
          
          Walter mingles at a reception. He is listening to another
          COLLEAGUE tell a story.
          
                              COLLEAGUE #1
                    And so I just stood up and walked
                    out!
          
          The group laughs. Stephen Kriegman approaches and talks to
          the COLLEAGUE.
          
                              STEPHEN KRIEGMAN
                    Jamie!
          
                              JAMIE
                    Stephen, how are you?
          
          Walter walks off.
          
          
          INT. NYU BANQUET HALL - LATER
          
          Walter eats dinner in a large, well appointed banquet room.
          Walter listens as a CHATTY MAN talks.
          
                    22
          
          
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER
          
          Walter is walking up the stairs carrying a briefcase. He
          passes a MIDDLE-AGED MAN who is walking down the stairs with
          a SMALL DOG on a leash.
          
                                 MIDDLE-AGED MAN (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.
          
          Walter stops and turns.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MIDDLE-AGED MAN
                    Are you Mr. Vale?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MIDDLE-AGED MAN
                    I thought so. How are you? It's me,
                    Jacob Konigsberg. Do you remember
                    me?
          
          Walter doesn't.
          
                              JACOB
                    I used to live here with my mother.
                    Your wife used to give me piano
                    lessons.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh. Right.
          
                              JACOB
                    It has been a long time. I thought
                    that maybe you sold the place. Oh.
                    This is Sprinkles.
                        (To the dog)
                    Say "hi", Sprinkles. Is your wife
                    here with you?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. She passed away.
          
                              JACOB
                    What?! No! I had no idea. I'm so
                    sorry. She was such a nice lady.
                    And I just loved listening to her
                    play.
          
                     23
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    How's your mother?
          
                              JACOB
                    She moved to Florida. Now I live
                    here. It's nice. There are a lot of
                    new faces. I hardly know anyone
                    anymore. But I have Sprinkles so...
          
                              WALTER
                    Nice to see you, Jacob.
          
                              JACOB
                    You too, Mr. Vale. Goodbye. Welcome
                    back.
          
          Walter nods and keeps walking.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Walter walks into the apartment. No one else is there.
          
          He sets down his case and walks toward his bedroom but stops
          at Tarek and Zainab's door, which is closed. He listens.
          Nothing.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Walter is reading over and "rehearsing" the paper that he has
          to present.
          
                              WALTER
                        (Sotto)
                    It is important to distinguish
                    between both our current political
                    assessment and our...It is
                    important to distinguish between
                    our current political assessment...
          
          He stops and crosses out the world "both". He continues
          reading.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is practicing the piano. He continues to struggle. He
          sits back and takes a break. He notices the drum next to the
          piano. He looks at it for long moment and then continues
          playing.
          
                       24
          
          
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, WALTER'S BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is lying in bed awake. He listens as Tarek and Zainab
          come home.
          
          
          EXT. NEWSSTAND - MORNING
          
          Walter buys a newspaper.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
          
          Walter is back at the conference. He is listening to a
          presentation by a GERMAN ECONOMIST.
          
                              GERMAN ECONOMIST
                    However, we do find that financial
                    globalization can be beneficial
                    under the right circumstances.
                    Empirically, good institutions and
                    quality of governance are crucial
                    in helping developing countries
                    derive the benefits of
                    globalization.
          
          Walter checks his watch. He is obviously bored.
          
          
          EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - LATER
          
          Walter is sitting in the park and eating some Indian food
          from a local cart vendor. He finishes and drops it into the
          garbage can. He checks his watch and starts to head back
          toward the conference when a SOUND catches his attention.
          
          
          EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - LATER
          
          Walter watches two young AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN drumming on
          BUCKETS with reckless abandon.
          
                              MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    We should have them come play
                    inside.
          
          Walter turns. THREE COLLEAGUES from the conference are
          standing next to him.
          
                                 COLLEAGUE #1
                    Coming in?
          
                    25
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. In a minute.
                        (Holding up his cell
                         phone)
                    I have to make a call.
          
                              COLLEAGUE #1
                    See you inside.
          
          Walter nods as the guys walk off. Walter watches them go. He
          turns and watches the drumming again.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter arrives on the top floor. He can hear the drum being
          played. He stops in front of his apartment. He listens for a
          moment and then slowly opens the door.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Tarek is playing his drum in his T-shirt and underwear. He
          sees Walter and finishes with a flourish.
          
                              TAREK
                    Hey Walter. Welcome home.
          
                              WALTER
                    Hi.
          
          Tarek casually gets up and puts on his pants.
          
                              TAREK
                    You're home early.
          
                              WALTER
                    It was a half day.
          
                              TAREK
                    How was the conference?
          
                              WALTER
                    Fine.
          
          Tarek buttons his pants.
          
                              TAREK
                    Sorry about the pants. I've been
                    playing like this since I was a
                    kid.
          
          Walter nods.
          
                      26
          
          
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Hey. I think I might have a lead on
                    a place in Brooklyn.
          
                              WALTER
                    That's good.
                    You can keep practicing if you
                    like.
          
                              TAREK
                    Really? It won't bother you?
          
                               WALTER
                    No.   It's fine.
          
                              TAREK
                    Great. Thanks. I'll keep my pants
                    on.
          
          Tarek laughs. Walter smiles.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Hey, Zainab's going to make dinner
                    if you want to eat with us later.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. Thank you.
          
          Walter walks into his bedroom. Tarek watches him go and then
          starts playing again.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is lying down on his bed reading through his paper.
          His foot is tapping to the rhythm of the drum.
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Walter and Zainab are sitting at the dinner table finishing
          their meal. Tarek is on the phone in the living room speaking
          in Arabic. He hangs up and rejoins the table.
          
                              TAREK
                    I'm sorry. That was my mother. If I
                    don't call her every day she thinks
                    something happened to me.
          
          
          Walter pours himself some wine. He offers some to Tarek.
          
                     27
          
          
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Yeah. I'll have a bit. Thanks.
          
          Zainab shoots Tarek a glance. Walter misreads it.
          
                              WALTER
                    Are you sure that you wouldn't like
                    some?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't drink.
          
                               TAREK
                         (Jokingly)
                    She is a good Muslim. I'm a bad
                    one.
          
          Walter nods. Zainab gets up and starts to clear the table.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Are you finished?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. Thank you. Here, let me...
          
                              ZAINAB
                    It's the least I can do.
          
          Her comment is more of an indictment than a pleasantry.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well, thank you for the dinner. It
                    was very good.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    You're welcome.
          
          She leaves the room.
          
                              TAREK
                    So what's the conference about?
          
                              WALTER
                    Economic Growth in Developing
                    Nations.
          
                               TAREK
                    That's us.

                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    So have you written some books?
          
                              WALTER
                    Three. I'm working on my fourth.
          
                              TAREK
                    Four books?! Great. My father was
                    a writer. A journalist.
          
                              WALTER
                    Is he still writing?
          
                              TAREK
                    No. He died. Before we left Syria.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm sorry.
          
                                 TAREK
                    So am I.
          
          Zainab enters.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek. It's eight-thirty.
          
                              TAREK
                    Oh. We have to go.
                        (To Walter)
                    I have a gig tonight.
          
          
          Zainab starts to put on her coat.   Tarek picks up his drum.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Walter, you can come if you want.
          
          Zainab shoots Tarek a glance.
          
                               WALTER
                    I have to get some work done but
                    thank you.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. Well maybe another time
          
                                 WALTER
                    OK.
          
                                 TAREK
                    Bye.
          
                      29
          
          
          
          Tarek and Zainab leave. Walter watches them go and then looks
          around the empty apartment.
          
          
          INT.    WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
          
          Tarek and Zainab are walking down the stairs.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                           (In French)
                       Why did you invite him?
          
                                 TAREK
                           (In French)
                       We're staying in his apartment.
                       What could I do?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                           (In French)
                       Well I would have been the one
                       stuck sitting with him while you
                       played your drum.
          
          Tarek turns and looks at her very seriously.
          
                                 TAREK
                       You know you are very sexy when
                       you're mad at me.
          
          Zainab can't help but smile. Tarek starts to wrap his arms
          around her.
          
                                 WALTER (O.S.)
                       Hello.
          
          Tarek and Zainab stop in their tracks, already three flights
          down. They both look up the stairwell. Walter is looking down
          on them.
          
                                 WALTER (CONT'D)
                       If you don't mind, I think I will
                       come.
          
          Tarek and Zainab share a quick look.
          
                                 TAREK
                       Cool.
          
          Walter disappears back into the apartment. Zainab looks at
          Tarek. He shrugs.
          
                    30
          
          
          
          
          INT. SMALL RESTAURANT - LATER.
          
          Tarek's Jazz Trio is playing. Walter and Zainab sit at a
          small table in the back. Walter is rapt. Zainab is sketching.
          She looks up from her pad and watches him before returning to
          her drawing.
          
          
          EXT. SMALL RESTAURANT - LATER
          
          Walter and Zainab are standing outside on the empty street.
          There's an awkward silence.
          
                              WALTER
                    He's very good.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes.
          
                              WALTER
                    The whole band is very good.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes.
          
          And then nothing. Finally Tarek emerges.
          
                              TAREK
                    Sorry guys. Let's go.
          
          They walk down the street.
          
          
          EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY
          
          Walter is sitting in the park and eating PIZZA. This time he
          is sitting directly across from the two African American
          drummers.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter walks into the apartment and sets down his briefcase.
          He notices Tarek's drum sitting in the middle of the room.
          
                              WALTER
                    Tarek?
          
          No one answers. Walter walks down the hallway a bit.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Tarek?
          
                       31
          
          
          
          Walter walks back into the living room and takes off his
          coat. He removes some papers from his briefcase and then he
          notices the drum again.
          
          He sits down in the chair next to Tarek's drum. He takes the
          drum between his legs and he hits it a few times.
          
          Then he starts to play. He stops and then he plays again.
          This time he is slightly more successful at finding a rhythm.
          He closes his eyes and bobs his head. He's really getting
          into it.
          
          He opens his eye's open and Tarek is standing in front of
          him. He has headphones around his neck. Walter jumps.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Oh. Hi.
          
                              TAREK
                    It sounded good Walter.
          
          Walter immediately stands.
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. Well. I was just...I'm sorry
                    if I...
          
          Tarek walks over and grabs another chair from the kitchen
          table.
          
                               TAREK
                    Don't be sorry. That's what it's
                    there for.
          
          Tarek sets the chair down and grabs the other drum from
          beside the piano.
          
                               TAREK (CONT'D)
                    I was lying on my bed listening to
                    my music and then I was like
                    "what's the crazy rhythm I'm
                    hearing?".
          
          Tarek sits down with the other drum facing Walter.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Sit. Come on. I'll show you.
          
          Walter hesitates and then sits down.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Just put your feet flat on the
                    ground.
          
                   32
          
          
          
          Walter adjusts his feet.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Now take the drum between your
                    legs. Like this.
          
          Tarek grabs the drums with his knees. Walter follows.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Now you want to lift the inside
                    edge off the ground with your
                    ankles. Like this.
          
          Walter watches Tarek and follows suit.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Great. Feel OK?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. Now Walter, I know you're a
                    very smart man but with the drum
                    you have to remember not to think.
                    Thinking just screws it up. OK?
          
                                 WALTER
                    OK.
          
                              TAREK
                    Now just give it a couple of bangs.
          
          Walter gives it a couple of hard bangs.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Not so hard. You're not angry at
                    it.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh. Right.     Sorry.
          
          He bangs it a few more times.
          
                              TAREK
                    Better. Did you think?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No.
          
                    33
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    Good. Now one more thing, Walter.
                    You listen to classical music so
                    you think in fours. One. Two.
                    Three. Four. Da. Da. Da. Da. This
                    is an African drum. So we are gonna
                    play in three's. Tat. Tat. Tat. You
                    have to forget your classical.
                    Leave it behind. Tat. Tat. Tat.
                    One. Two. Three. Come on. Follow
                    me.
          
          Tarek bangs out a simple bass beat. Walter joins in.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Good. Good ear. Now keep going.
          
          Walter loses the beat.   Tarek keeps playing.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Don't worry. Start again.
          
          Walter tries again. And again. And then finally he gets it.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Yeah! There it is. OK. Good. Now
                    keep it going and I will do this.
          
          Tarek riffs off of Walter's bass beat.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Yeah. That's it. Keep it going.
          
          
          EXT. STREET FAIR - DAY
          
          Zainab is closing up her booth. Another VENDOR walks by and
          says good bye. Zainab smiles and nods good bye.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK - STREET
          
          Zainab is walking home with her supplies. Two NEW YORK POLICE
          OFFICERS are talking to THREE YOUNG HISPANIC KIDS. Zainab
          hesitates for the slightest moment before lowering her head
          and walking past.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Zainab enters the apartment and sees Walter drumming. His
          shirt is unbuttoned exposing his white undershirt. He stops.
          He is breathing very hard and sweating.
          
                     34
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Hello.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Hello. Where is Tarek?
          
          She places her items down on the kitchen table and takes off
          her coat. She looks around the apartment.
          
                               WALTER
                    He went out. To look at another
                    apartment.
          
          She just looks at him with the drum. Walter is still out of
          breath.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Are you OK?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. Tarek is teaching me the
                    drum. I'm practicing. Don't worry,
                    I'll keep my pants on.
          
          Zainab looks shocked. Walter's attempt at levity has fallen
          short.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    What?
          
                              WALTER
                    Nothing. I was just...nothing.
          
          Zainab nods and walks into the kitchen.
          
          
          INT. JAZZ CLUB - LATER
          
          Tarek is playing with his band. Walter is at the bar
          watching. He is unconsciously tapping along on the bar.
          
          
          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - SAME
          
          Tarek, Walter, and Darren - the saxophone player - sit at a
          table by the window, eating.
          
                              TAREK
                    Hey Walter, what time are you done
                    tomorrow?
          
                 35
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    I have to present a paper at
                    eleven. I should be done by twelve-
                    thirty.
          
                               TAREK
                    Cool.
          
                              DARREN
                        (To the waiter)
                    Hey man, could we get another order
                    of this?
                        (To Walter and Tarek)
                    I love this food.
          
                              TAREK
                    That's good. Because the Chinese
                    are taking over the world.
          
                              DARREN
                    That's not gonna happen.
          
                              TAREK
                    It's already happening. One day our
                    kids will be going to China for
                    jobs. Ask Walter.
          
          Darren and Tarek look at Walter.
          
                              DARREN
                    You think that's true?
          
          Walter is put on the spot.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well...if China continues to
                    threaten the wage earners in the
                    first-world economies by keeping
                    wages down, then it's really just a
                    matter of time. What they buy they
                    inflate. What they sell they
                    deflate. But then you have to ask
                    the question `who's paying the
                    cost?'. And the answer is the
                    Chinese people.
          
          Beat.
          
                               TAREK
                    You see?
          
          Tarek continues eating.

          INT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
          
          Walter is presenting his paper.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - LATER
          
          Walter is walks out of the building talking to a FEMALE
          COLLEAGUE.
          
                              TAREK (O.S.)
                    Hey, Walter!
          
          Walter and the Female Colleague turn. Tarek is standing a few
          feet away holding both drums.
          
          Walter nods and says good bye to the Colleague who looks a
          bit confused. Walter walks over to Tarek.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    How did the presentation go?
          
                              WALTER
                    Fine. Thanks.
          
                              TAREK
                    Cool. Guess what? I found an
                    apartment in Brooklyn. We can move
                    in on Monday.
          
                              WALTER
                    That's good.
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. It's small but it's a nice
                    building. I just hope Zainab likes
                    it.
          
                              WALTER
                    I think she will as long as no else
                    lives there.
          
          Tarek laughs.
          
                              TAREK
                    I think you're right. Come on,
                    let's go. You should take off the
                    name tag.
          
                              WALTER
                    Oh. Yeah. Thanks.
          
                    37
          
          
          
          Walter takes off his name tag and they start to walk.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Are you hungry?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. I'm starving. Do you like
                    shwarmas?
          
                              WALTER
                    Uh...yeah. I like sharmas.
          
                                 TAREK
                    Shwarmas.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yeah.
          
          They walk across the park.
          
          
          INT. FALAFEL STAND - LATER
          
          Walter and Tarek are finishing lunch. Tarek reaches into his
          bag and takes out a SMALL BAG.
          
                              TAREK
                    Here. This is for you. For letting
                    us stay.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Thank you.
          
          Walter takes it and opens it. It's a CD.
          
                              TAREK
                    It's Fela Kuti. You know him?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No.
          
                              TAREK
                    You don't know Fela? Oh, man!
                    Walter, you are in for a treat. He
                    started the whole Afro-Beat
                    movement. And his drummer Tony
                    Allen was just scary, man. You want
                    to play drums, you have to listen
                    to this.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. I will.
          
                     38
          
          
          
          A HANDSOME ARAB MAN walks past with a PRETTY BLONDE WOMAN.
          Tarek sees him and waves.
          
                                 OMAR
                           (In Arabic)
                       Hey Tarek. How's it going?
          
                                 TAREK
                           (in Arabic)
                       Good, Omar. How are you?
          
                                 OMAR
                           (In Arabic)
                       Not bad. It's fall in New York, you
                       know? How's the band?
          
                                 TAREK
                           (In Arabic)
                       Good. Playing a lot. New
                       girlfriend?
          
                                 OMAR
                           (In Arabic)
                       New friend.
          
                                 TAREK
                           (In Arabic)
                       You have a lot friends
          
                                 OMAR
                           (In Arabic)
                       I'm a very nice guy. Au revoir.
          
                                    TAREK
                       Au revoir.
          
          Omar walks off. Tarek shakes his head.
          
                                  TAREK (CONT'D)
                       The Lebanese. Bunch of playboys.
                       You ready?
          
                                    WALTER
                       Yeah.
          
          They pick up their drums and leave.
          
          
          EXT.    NEW YORK STREET FAIR - LATER
          
          Zainab is talking to two UPPER EAST SIDE WOMEN who have
          stopped at her stall.
          
                    39
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. I made it.
          
                                 UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    How much?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Thirty-five dollars.
          
                              UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    Will you take thirty?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. thiry-five.
          
                              UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    OK. I know my daughter will think
                    it's "cool". Here.
          
          She hands her the money. Zainab takes it and drops it into a
          small pouch.
          
                              UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    Where are you from?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Senegal.
          
                              UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    Oh. I was in Cape Town two winters
                    ago. It was just beautiful.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (Handing her the bag)
                    Thank you very much.
          
                                 UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    Thank you.
          
          The Woman walks away. A young Israeli man, ZEV is sitting at
          a nearby stall selling T-shirts.
          
                              ZEV
                    How far is Senegal from Cape Town?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Far.
          
                              ZEV
                    I told a guy I was from Israel
                    yesterday and he asked if I had
                    ever visited the Holy Land.
          
                     40
          
          
          
          Zainab smiles. Zev sees someone over Zainab's shoulder.
          
                              ZEV (CONT'D)
                    Hey, look who it is. What's up
                    Tarek?
          
          Tarek and Walter are approaching.
          
                               TAREK
                    Zev!   How are you?
          
                                 ZEV
                    Good man.
          
                                 TAREK
                    Hey honey.
          
          He kisses Zainab.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Hello. Hi, Walter.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Hi.
          
                              TAREK
                    How's business?
          
                              ZEV
                    Ahh. You know.
          
          Walter looks at the Zainab's jewelry.
          
                              TAREK
                    Her stuff is great, right? She made
                    me this?
          
          Tarek holds up his wrist, revealing a bracelet.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    You should make one for Walter.
          
          Zainab nods noncommittally.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    So Walter and I are going up to the
                    park to play for a little bit. OK?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek, I told you we have to pick
                    up my new table today. He said he
                    would only hold it for today.

                              TAREK
                    I know. I know. No problem.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek. You always say "no problem"
                    and then you are late or you
                    forget.
          
          Tarek smiles.
          
                              TAREK
                    I know. I will not be long. We'll
                    go up and play and then we'll come
                    back to help you. I promise,
                    habibti.
          
          He kisses her and starts to walk away.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. It's always "habibti" when you
                    want your way. It closes at five
                    p.m. Not Arab time, Tarek.
          
                              TAREK
                    No. Not Arab time. Real time,
                    habibti.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Don't "habibti" me.
          
          They turn and start to leave.
          
                              WALTER
                    What does habibti mean?
          
                              TAREK
                    Habibti? It means "beloved one".
          
                              WALTER
                    Does she know that?
          
          Tarek laughs.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY - LATER
          
          Tarek and Walter are waiting for the subway. A CHINESE
          MUSICIAN is playing on the opposite platform.
          
                              TAREK
                    He's been playing here for a long
                    time.
          
                      42
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Is he good?
          
                              TAREK
                    I have no idea but it's cool.
                    I always wanted to play down here.
                    It's supposed to be good money.
          
                              WALTER
                    So why haven't you?
          
          Tarek shrugs.
          
                              TAREK
                    Maybe some day we can do it
                    together. Split the profits.
          
          Walter watches the Chinese Musician.
          
          
          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER.
          
          Walter and Tarek stand in front of the DRUM CIRCLE    in
          Central Park.
          
                              TAREK
                    What do you think?
          
          Walter sizes it up and makes his assessment.
          
                              WALTER
                    I think I'll just watch.
          
                              TAREK
                    Come on, Walter.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    It's easy. You just wait until you
                    feel it. Let's go.
          
          Tarek joins the drum circle. Walter lingers.
          
          
          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER.
          
          Walter is on the edge of the Drum Circle, waiting to "feel
          it". Tarek is next to him playing away.
          
          Tarek looks at Walter and nods. Finally Walter starts to
          play. Slowly at first, but then he starts to really commit.
          Tarek encourages him with a smile.
          
                       43
          
          
          
          
          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER
          
          Tarek and Walter are leaving the park. Tarek checks his
          watch.
          
                                 TAREK
                       Shit, we have to get home. Zainab
                       is gonna kill me. I'm on Arab time
                       again.
          
                                 WALTER
                       What is Arab time?
          
                                 TAREK
                       It means I'm late by an hour. All
                       Arabs are late by an hour. It's
                       genetic. We can't help it.
          
          
          EXT.    72ND STREET SUBWAY STATION - LATER
          
          Tarek and Walter hurry down the stairs of the subway station.
          
          
          INT. 72ND STREET SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter and Tarek approach the turnstile.     They can hear the
          train arriving.
          
                                 TAREK
                       That's our train!
          
          They pick up the pace. Walter puts down his drum to take out
          his METROCARD. Tarek quickly picks it up.
          
                                 TAREK (CONT'D)
                       I got your drum. My card is empty.
                       Can you swipe me?
          
          Walter swipes his card for Tarek to pass through and then he
          swipes his own turnstile.
          
          Walter passes through. Tarek struggles a bit with both
          drums. He gets halfway through when the turnstile bar locks.
          He's stuck.
          
                                 TAREK (CONT'D)
                           (Laughing)
                       Hey. You paid for the drum and not
                       me. Here take this.
          
                    44
          
          
          
          Walter takes Tarek's drum and Tarek quickly ducks under the
          turn style that Walter just paid for.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                        (Re: the train)
                    I think we missed it. Zainab is not
                    going to be happy if...
          
          Suddenly a MAN takes Tarek by the arm.
          
                              MAN
                    Excuse me, sir. Could you please
                    step over here.
          
          Tarek reacts by pulling his arm away.
          
                              TAREK
                    What are you doing?
          
                              MAN
                    NYPD. Could you please step over
                    here?
          
          He reaches for Tarek again who instinctively moves his arm
          again which agitates the Cop. Another COP enters into the
          action.
          
                              COP #2
                    Just step over here, pal.
          
                              TAREK
                    Please, what do you want...
          
                              COP #1
                    You jumped the turnstile.
          
                              TAREK
                    I did not jump it! I paid. I paid!
                    It just didn't work.
          
          Walter steps up.
          
                              WALTER
                    Sir, I did pay his fare.
          
                              COP #2
                    Could you step back please?
          
                              WALTER
                    But I paid this man's...
          
                              COP #2
                    Sir, stand over there.
          
                    45
          
          
          
                              COP #1
                        (To Tarek)
                    Can I see some ID.
          
          Tarek takes out his wallet. He shows them an ID CARD. Walter
          steps back to the wall and sets the two drums down. Cop #2
          stands between him and the action. Walter can barely make out
          what is being said.
          
                              COP #1 (CONT'D)
                    You got anything else, Tarek.
          
                              TAREK
                    No.
          
                              COP #1
                    Where are you from?
          
                              TAREK
                    Syria. Why?
          
          Tarek is starting to panic. The two Cops share a look.
          Another train passes. Cop #1 asks Tarek a few more questions
          which Walter cannot hear.
          
          Suddenly Cop #1 starts to handcuff Tarek.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Why? I'm sorry. What did I do?
          
          Walter steps forward to intervene.
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't think that's necessary.
          
                              COP #2
                    Well we do. You can come down to
                    the station and make a statement.
          
                              WALTER
                    But he didn't mean...
          
                              COP #2
                    Sir, that's all I'm saying. Now
                    step back or we are gonna take you
                    in too.
          
                              WALTER
                    Where are you taking him?
          
                              COP #2
                    Ninth Precinct.
          
                      46
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    Walter take the drum. Tell Zainab
                    what happened but don't let her
                    come for me. I will call you.
          
          The two Cops lead Tarek away. Walter watches helplessly.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Don't let her come! I will call
                    her!
          
          Walter watches him go.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Walter enters and shuts the door and Zainab is sitting on the
          couch working on her jewelry.
          
          She stops when she sees Walter standing alone, holding the
          two drums.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Where is Tarek?
          
                              WALTER
                    He was arrested.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    What?!
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. In the subway.
          
          Zainab immediately starts to panic.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Arrested?!
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. It was just a
                    misunderstanding. They said he
                    would be released later tonight.
          
          
          
          
          Zainab really starts to lose it. Her reaction is more than
          Walter was prepared for.
          
                    47
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB
                    How could this happen? He knows
                    better! He would not do anything
                    wrong.
          
                              WALTER
                    He didn't. I'm sure we it will be
                    OK.
          
          She begins to pack up her work.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. It won't be OK.
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes it will. I went down to the
                    precinct and made a statement.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (Snapping at Walter)
                    That doesn't matter! He is
                    illegal! As am I! We are not
                    citizens. Do you know what that
                    means? Do you?! Of course you
                    don't. How could you?
          
          She picks up her things and walks down the hall to her room.
          Walter sits, stunned.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is talking on his cell phone and pacing.
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. His name is Tarek Khalil.
                    Khalil. K. H. A. L. I. L. That's
                    right. Yes. I came down and made a
                    statement. They said he would be
                    released. That was six hours ago.
                    Well when should we know? Tomorrow?
                    Why? But he...OK. OK. Thank you.
          
          Walter hangs up.
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
          
          Walter walks out of the police station. He crosses the
          street. Zainab is standing there.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Well?
          
                     48
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    They've moved him.
          
                                ZAINAB
                    To where?
          
                              WALTER
                    To a detention center in Queens. He
                    was turned over to immigration.
                    They said we can see him during
                    visiting hours tomorrow night from
                    five to ten.
          
          Zainab shakes her head.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I can't visit him or I will end up
                    in that place too.
          
          Zainab fights to restrain her emotions. She turns and walks
          away. Walter watches her go.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Zainab's bedroom light is on.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, TAREK'S & ZAINAB'S ROOM - SAME
          
          Zainab is sitting on her bed and talking on her phone.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. We are going tomorrow. The
                    appointment is at eleven. I don't
                    know, he found him. What? No. I
                    don't want to. I just don't, Tarek.
                    Yes. I've already called him. I
                    know. I know. I just want you to be
                    here with me, Tarek.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK, DOWNTOWN - DAY
          
          A sea of skyscrapers near One Center Street.
          
          
          INT. DOWNTOWN OFFICE BUILDING, ELEVATOR BANK - DAY
          
          Zainab and Walter exit an elevator and walk down the hall.
          
                    49
          
          
          
          
          INT. LAW OFFICE - LATER
          
          Walter and Zainab talk to an, MR. SHAH, an INDIAN IMMIGRATION
          LAWYER who is jotting down notes. He is clinical, almost cold
          in his approach.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Zainab, you're also undocumented,
                    right?
          
                                ZAINAB
                    Yes.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    You know you can't visit Tarek at
                    the detention center, right?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. I know.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    How long have you known Tarek?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Almost a year.
          
                                MR. SHAH
                    Mr. Vale?
          
                                WALTER
                    A week.
          
                                MR. SHAH
                    A week?
          
          Walter nods.
          
                              MR. SHAH (CONT'D)
                    Does Tarek have any family living
                    here?
          
          Walter looks to Zainab.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    His mother lives in Michigan.
          
          This is news to Walter.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    She's also undocumented, correct?
          
          Zainab hesitates.
          
                 50
          
          
          
                              MR. SHAH (CONT'D)
                    It's OK. This is all confidential.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes, she is.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Does she know that Tarek is in
                    custody?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. Tarek told me not to tell her.
                    He doesn't want to worry her.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Has he ever been convicted of a
                    crime?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. He has had no trouble. He is a
                    good person.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Do you know if they ever applied
                    for asylum?
          
          Walter looks at Zainab. She is very uncomfortable.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. When he first arrived from
                    Syria. But he didn't get it.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    When was that?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Seven years ago.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    And did they appeal it?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't know.
          
          Mr. Shah jots something down.
          
                              WALTER
                    Why wouldn't they appeal it?
          
                    51
          
          
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Fear of being deported. It used to
                    be that when your asylum case was
                    denied, they let you go until your
                    appeal. A lot of people didn't
                    bother with it. Getting denied once
                    was enough to spook them.
          
                              WALTER
                    So what happens if that's the case?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Then there may be a final order of
                    deportation on him which means he
                    won't even go before a judge this
                    time. He'll just be deported.
          
                               ZAINAB
                    They had to leave Syria! They had
                    no choice!
          
          This is also news to Walter.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Look, one step at a time. Let me
                    talk to him then we'll have a
                    better idea of his status and what
                    our options are.
          
                              WALTER
                    Is there anything I can do?
          
                                 MR. SHAH
                    Visit him.
          
          The lawyer slides a card across the table. Walter takes it.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY
          
          Walter rides the subway. He looks down at the lawyer's card.
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS - LATER
          
          Walter emerges from the subway into a very industrial
          neighborhood. Factories and fences. He checks his piece of
          paper and starts walking.
          
                    52
          
          
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS - LATER
          
          Walter is still walking. The area is very deserted. He stops
          and tries to locate a street address amongst the anonymous
          factories. He checks his sheet of paper and continues
          walking.
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
          
          Walter is standing in front of the DETENTION CENTER. It looks
          like most of the other factories around it but perhaps with a
          bit more barbed wire.
          
          He presses a button and the automated door slowly opens. He
          walks inside.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER
          
          Walter walks into a small brightly lit waiting room. A few
          SODA MACHINES and TWELVE BLUE PLASTIC CHAIRS. In one corner
          is a guard booth with THREE GUARDS. One FEMALE GUARD is
          wearing a Muslim headdress. Walter approaches the window and
          waits in line. The other people waiting comprise a mix of
          nationalities: African, Latin American, Chinese, Indian.
          
          The Guard talks to a MAN in front of Walter. The Man has a
          Slavic accent.
          
                              GUARD
                    That detainee has been moved.
          
                                SLAVIC MAN
                    To where?
          
                              GUARD
                    I don't know.
          
                              SLAVIC MAN
                    He was here yesterday.
          
                              GUARD
                    But now he's not. That's all I
                    know. You can call ICE. The number
                    is on the wall. Next. Sir, step
                    aside please.
          
          The Slavic Man reluctantly steps aside, staring at a piece of
          paper. Walter steps up to the window. He sets a piece of
          paper on the window sill.
          
                      53
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Hi. I'm here to see Tarek Khalil.
          
          The Guard takes it.
          
                              GUARD
                    You been here before?
          
                                WALTER
                    No.
          
                              GUARD
                    Can I see your license please?
          
          Walter takes out his wallet.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
          
          Walter is let through a large metal door. There is an X-RAY
          MACHINE immediately in front of him.
          
          Walter empties his pockets and steps through.
          
          Walter waits for the sliding metal door to open. It does and
          he steps into a small room. The door slides shut and he is
          alone in the small white room until a door on the other side
          slides open.
          
          He steps through and walks down a small hallway. On the left
          side of the hallway are small, glassed in, meeting rooms for
          lawyer consultations.
          
          Walter enters into a large bright room. It resembles a prison
          visitation room. Along the perimeter of the room is a clear
          fiberglass wall with twenty-five small cubicles. Each cubicle
          has one seat and a phone. On the other side of the fiberglass
          is another seat and a phone.
          
          Walter looks around the room at the VISITORS and DETAINEES.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is still waiting. After a moment a door opens and
          Tarek walks out wearing a blue jump suit. He sees Walter and
          smiles.
          
          They each move toward the other and settle into a vacant
          seat. They both pick up the phone as they sit down.
          
                              TAREK
                    Walter. Thank you for coming.
          
                    54
          
          
          
                                 WALTER
                    Of course.
          
                              TAREK
                    How is Zainab?
          
                              WALTER
                    She's upset. I have a letter from
                    her.
          
                              TAREK
                    You can't give it to me. It has to
                    be sent to me by mail. But you can
                    put it up to the glass.
          
          Walter hesitates.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Go ahead. Open it and place it up
                    to the glass so I can read it. It's
                    OK. It's allowed.
          
          Walter complies. He sets down the phone so that he can press
          the letter up against the glass. Tarek reads the letter.
          
          Walter looks around the room, trying to give Tarek some
          privacy. He watches the various immigrant families speaking
          to one another. Tarek taps the glass and points to Walter's
          phone. Walter picks it up.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Thank you, Walter.
          
          Walter nods as he folds up the envelope and places it back
          into his coat.
          
                              WALTER
                    How are they treating you?
          
                               TAREK
                    OK. The place is very depressing.
                    There is no privacy. The lights are
                    always on.
          
                              WALTER
                    Do you need anything?
          
                              TAREK
                    No. I just want to get out of here.
          
                              WALTER
                    Zainab and I met with a lawyer
                    today.
          
                    55
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    Yes. What did he say?
          
                              WALTER
                    He is going to stop by to see you
                    tomorrow.
          
          They both sit for a moment. Unsure what to say next. Finally
          Walter's curiosity gets the best of him.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Tarek, Zainab said you were denied
                    asylum.
          
                              TAREK
                    You mean when we came here? Yeah.
          
                              WALTER
                    Did you go to your deportation
                    hearing?
          
                               TAREK
                    Yeah.
          
                               WALTER
                    You did?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. We did everything they told
                    us to.
          
          Walter can only nod, unsure of what else to say.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Hey, could you tell Darren? I
                    didn't call him.
          
          A GUARD walks past and taps Tarek on the shoulder and speaks
          to him. We can't hear what is being said.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                        (To Walter)
                    I have to go. They have to do a bed
                    count. Usually, I can visit for one
                    hour. Can you come tomorrow?
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              TAREK
                    Good. And tell Zainab I will call
                    her as soon as I can.
          
                    56
          
          
          
          Walter nods. Tarek gets up.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Goodbye, my friend.
          
                               WALTER
                    Goodbye.
          
          Tarek walks away. Walter watches him go.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/ KITCHEN
          
          Walter and Zainab are sitting at the kitchen table. Zainab is
          holding her letter.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Did you ask him if he went to his
                    hearing?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. He said that he did.
          
          Zainab stands up.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Walter, I'm going to leave now. I
                    have a cousin in the Bronx. I will
                    stay with him for now.
          
                               WALTER
                    You don't have to leave. You can
                    stay here.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I think it's best if I leave. When
                    Tarek calls me then I will tell
                    him. You know how to reach me if
                    you need to. Is it OK if I leave
                    Tarek's things here for now? My
                    cousin's place is not very big.
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S BUILDING - LATER
          
          Zainab walks away from the apartment.
          
                       57
          
          
          
          
          INT. SMALL BAR - NIGHT
          
          Walter drinks at the bar and watches Tarek's band play
          without Tarek.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - MORNING
          
          Walter practices the drum.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
          
          Jacob walks Sprinkles in front of the apartment building.
          Walter walks outside and waves hello as he walks past.
          
          
          INT. QUEEN'S DETENTION CENTER, VISITORS ROOM - LATER
          
          Darren and Tarek are talking. Walter sits and listens.
          
          
          INT. CAFE - NIGHT
          
          Walter eats alone.
          
          
          EXT. STREET CORNER - MORNING
          
          Walter buys the morning paper from a kiosk. He walks to the
          corner and waits to cross the street. A large group of
          CHINESE TOURISTS led by a TOUR GUIDE step up next to him. He
          is surrounded by them.
          
          
          INT. QUEEN'S DETENTION CENTER, VISITOR'S ROOM - SAME
          
          Tarek talks to Mr. Shah.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY
          
          Walter is playing the drum. He finishes with an "end beat".
          He looks around the quiet apartment.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - DAY
          
          Walter is waiting for Tarek. The visiting room is empty.
          Suddenly the door opens on the detainee side of the glass and
          a VERY YOUNG LATIN WOMAN walks out tentatively. She almost
          looks absurd in the oversized blue jumpsuit.
          
                    58
          
          
          
          She looks at Walter, unsure if she is supposed to approach
          the glass and talk to him. Walter just stares back, also
          unsure of what to do. They are caught in awkward moment.
          Finally Walter manages a nod. She nods back and smiles. It is
          the innocent smile of a child.
          
          Suddenly a female guard appears in the doorway and beckons
          the Young Girl back inside. The Young Girl looks at Walter
          one last moment before disappearing behind the door.
          
          
          INT. QUEEN'S DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is talking to Tarek.
          
                              WALTER
                    But I thought you said you went to
                    the hearing.
          
                              TAREK
                    We did. I remember it.
          
                              WALTER
                    So why is there a final order on
                    you? Did he say?
          
                              TAREK
                    No. He didn't know yet. He just
                    said that unless he can find a way
                    to reopen the case quickly they're
                    going to deport me.
          
                              WALTER
                    Maybe you should call your mother.
                    She might have...
          
                              TAREK
                    No. I don't want her to worry. I
                    can handle this.
          
          Tarek shakes his head.
          
                              WALTER
                    Did he say anything else?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. Three years ago I was working
                    for some guy who said he was going
                    to sponsor me for my green card but
                    then he turned out to be jerk. But
                    the lawyer said that might allow us
                    to reopen the case. I don't even
                    understand it.
          
                 59
          
          
          
          Walter nods.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Walter, there are guys who have
                    been in here for years! I can't do
                    that Walter. I'll go crazy.
          
                              WALTER
                    He's trying to deal with the case
                    as quickly as possible.
          
          Tarek goes silent.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Tarek. I have to go back to
                    Connecticut. I'll be reachable by
                    phone if you need me for anything.
          
          Tarek's mind is racing. He shakes his head.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. Just please...don't forget
                    about me in here.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I won't.
          
                              TAREK
                    Are you still practicing?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              TAREK
                    You should go back to the drum
                    circle.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (Quickly)
                    No.
          
          Tarek laughs.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. But listen to that Fela CD.
                    That will help you, I promise.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I will.
          
                              TAREK
                    So show me what you've been working
                    on.
          
                    60
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    What?
          
                              TAREK
                    Show me. On that. Come on. I need
                    some music, man.
          
          Tarek points to the shelf in front of Walter.
          
                              WALTER
                    Now?
          
                              TAREK
                    Don't worry. They can't arrest you.
                    At least not yet.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK.
          
          Walter looks around and then cradles the phone in his
          shoulder and starts to bang a simple beat on his counter top.
          Tarek watches and listens for a moment.
          
                              TAREK
                    Ah. There it is. Good. Good. You
                    are getting better.
          
          And then he joins in. The two men continue to play together.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Walter is packing his suitcase. Suddenly there is a knock at
          his door. He exits the room.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter opens the door. Standing there is a strikingly
          attractive forty-five year-old ARAB WOMAN. She seems startled
          to see Walter.
          
                              WALTER
                    Hello.
          
                               ARAB WOMAN
                    I'm sorry. I must have the wrong
                    apartment.
          
          She starts to walk down the hall.
          
                              WALTER
                    Can I help you?
          
                     61
          
          
          
                              ARAB WOMAN
                    I'm looking for my son.
          
                              WALTER
                    Are you Tarek's mother?
          
                                 ARAB WOMAN
                    Yes.
          
                              WALTER
                    Oh. This is Tarek's apartment.
                    I...share the apartment with him.
          
          The Arab Woman is cautious.

                    He did not mention that he lived
                    with someone.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm not here very often. I live in
                    Connecticut.
          
                              ARAB WOMAN
                    Is Tarek here?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. He's...uh...he's not here. But
                    please come in.
          
          Mouna hesitates.
          
                                 WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Please.
          
                                 ARAB WOMAN
                    Thank you.
          
          Mouna walks into the apartment. She stands by the door.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm Walter. Walter Vale.
          
                              ARAB WOMAN
                    I'm Mouna Khalil. I'm sorry to
                    show up unannounced but my son
                    calls me everyday. He has not
                    called me now for five days. I have
                    tried his cell phone but he does
                    not answer.
          
                              WALTER
                    Would you like to sit down?
          
                 62
          
          
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Thank you.
          
          Mouna sits.
          
                              WALTER
                    Would you like something to drink?
                    Coffee or water?
          
                              MOUNA
                    No. Is my son alright, Mr. Vale?
          
                              WALTER
                    Tarek was arrested. He's being held
                    in a detention center in Queens.
                    They are trying to deport him.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Where is Queens?
          
                              WALTER
                    It's not far from here. Twenty
                    minutes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You have been there?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. I saw him yesterday. He's OK.
          
                              MOUNA
                    How did this happen?
          
                              WALTER
                    He was stopped in the subway
                    station. He didn't do anything
                    wrong.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I would like to go there. To
                    Queens.
          
                               WALTER
                    OK. But Mrs. Khalil. The lawyer
                    mentioned that...I don't think that
                    you can...
          
                              MOUNA
                    I know I can't visit Tarek, Mr.
                    Vale. I just want to see where they
                    are holding him.
          
                      63
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. I can take you if you'd like.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Thank you.
          
                              WALTER
                    Let me get my coat.
          
          Mouna nods. Walter leaves. Mouna breathes deeply in an
          attempt to control her emotions. She looks around the
          apartment and spots Tarek's drum. The sight of it is almost
          enough to push her over the edge.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY - LATER
          
          The Chinese Musician is playing on the platform. Mouna and
          Walter are watching him.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY CAR - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna are sitting side by side on the subway.
          
          
          EXT. SUBWAY STATION, QUEENS - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna exit the subway station and walk down the
          empty street.
          
                              WALTER
                    Have you been to New York before,
                    Mrs. Khalil?
          
                              MOUNA
                    No. Tarek wanted to come to New
                    York to play music. I did not want
                    him to go but...do you have
                    children, Mr. Vale?
          
                              WALTER
                    I have a son. He lives in London.
          
                              MOUNA
                    And your wife?
          
                              WALTER
                    My wife passed away.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    I'm sorry.
          
                       64
          
          
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS STREET - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna stop across the street from the detention
          Center.
          
                                 WALTER
                    That's it.
          
                              MOUNA
                    This is where the prison is?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. That's it.
          
          Walter points to the Detention Center.
          
                              MOUNA
                    It does not look like a prison.
          
                              WALTER
                    I think that's the point.
          
                              MOUNA
                    How many people are in there?
          
                              WALTER
                    Tarek said about three hundred.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    There is a coffee shop on that
                    corner. It's not very nice but...
          
                              MOUNA
                    I'll wait there. Here.
          
          She takes a letter out of her bag and hands it to Walter.
          
                                 MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.
          
          Walter turns and walks into the facility. Mouna lingers,
          taking in the building.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITATION ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is waiting for Tarek. He is watching as a LATIN WOMAN
          holds her BABY up to the glass as her HUSBAND taps on it from
          the other side.
          
          Finally a door opens and Tarek walks out. He waves and
          smiles. Walter picks up his phone. Tarek picks up his.
          
                    65
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    Walter, I thought you were leaving.
          
                               WALTER
                    I was.   Tarek, your mother is here.
          
          This stops Tarek cold.
          
                              TAREK
                    What? My mother?! Where?
          
                              WALTER
                    She is waiting outside.
          
                              TAREK
                    When did she arrive?
          
                               WALTER
                    Today.
          
                              TAREK
                    Oh man. Why did she come? She can
                    do nothing for me.
          
                              WALTER
                    She said she hadn't heard from you.
          
                              TAREK
                    Walter. Listen to me. She can not
                    stay here. She doesn't know anyone
                    in New York. I'm sorry but you must
                    get her to go back to Michigan.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. OK. Here. I have a letter from
                    her.
          
          Walter takes it out and puts it up to the glass.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS, DINER - LATER
          
          It's a dingy place occupied by truck drivers and factory
          workers. Mouna sitting in a booth clutching a cup of tea. She
          looks very out of place.
          
          Two DETENTION CENTER GUARDS enter and sit down in a booth.
          Mouna watches them. An Arab Waiter is cleaning the counter.
          He keeps looking at Mouna.
          
                              WAITER

                        (In Arabic)
                    Ah. I knew it. I am from Egypt.
                    Alexandria. I'm Nasim. Why are you
                    here?
          
                              MOUNA
                        (In Arabic)
                    I am visiting my son.
          
                              NASIM
                        (In Arabic)
                    He is in detention.
          
                                 MOUNA
                           (In Arabic)
                    Yes.
          
          The Waiter shakes his head.
          
                              NASIM
                        (In Arabic)
                    It's a bad place. I'm lucky. I have
                    a green card.
          
          He nods to the Guards.
          
                              NASIM (CONT'D)
                        (In Arabic)
                    They're the ones taking care of
                    your son. They come here everyday.
                    They don't tip.
          
          Mouna is uncomfortable.
          
                              NASIM (CONT'D)
                        (In Arab)
                    Don't worry. They can't understand
                    us.
          
          Walter enters and walks over to Mouna's booth.
          
                   67

                    Hello, sir.
          
          Walter nods and sits down. He hands Mouna her letter.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    How is he?
          
                              WALTER
                    He's good but he's concerned about
                    you being here.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I will not leave.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mrs. Khalil, I'm not sure that your
                    being in New York will do any good.
                    We have a very good lawyer working
                    on Tarek's case...
          
                              MOUNA
                        (Politely but forceful)
                    Mr. Vale, I cannot go back to
                    Michigan knowing that my son is in
                    that building. Even if I can't see

                    So you two know each other?
          
          There is an awkward pause.

                    Oh. Tarek. He is very nice. And so
                    is his girlfriend. They are both so
                    polite.

          Mouna nods and heads into the building.
          
                              JACOB
                    Oh sure. We need to go on our walk

                              WALTER
                    You're not imposing. Please. I
                    would like you to stay.

                    Again, thank you. But I will
                    manage. Goodbye.
          
          Walter finally steps aside and opens the door.
          
                               MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Goodbye.

                    Mrs. Khalil?
          
          She turns. Walter is standing at the top of the stairway.
          
                               WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Please. I was with Tarek when he
                    was arrested. He was in the subway
                    in the first place because of me.
                    Please. Stay. Even if it's just for
                    the night.
          
          Walter's plea is heartfelt. Mouna looks at him and then she
          looks down the stairs for a long moment, considering her
          options.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, TAREK'S ROOM - LATER

          Walter walks out of his bedroom. He hears talking from the
          living room. He walks down the hall and sees Mouna sitting on
          the couch in the living room, talking on her cell phone in

          Walter pours a cup of coffee. He notices two newspaper's on

          Hayat, an Arabic newspaper. He picks up the Financial Times
          and reads the front page. Mouna enters.

                    I can't really tell. He wants me to

                              WALTER

                    Then they should have sent you a

                    You sure?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. I would remember this.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Did you move?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. Eventually we had to. But we
                    had our mail advanced.
          
          Mr. Shah is satisfied.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Well, it wouldn't be the first time
                    that happened. And pre 9/11 it
                    wasn't much of a priority tracking
                    people down.
          
          Mouna bristles at the implied connection.
          
                              WALTER
                    So if they didn't get the letter
                    then does this help us?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    It keeps our chances alive. If they
                    got it and just ignored it then we
                    couldn't push to reopen the case.
          
                              MOUNA
                    So you can help him?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    It's still a long shot. Like I
                    said, the Government's approach has
                    changed radically.

                    It's very black and white now.
                    Either you belong or you don't.
                    Which means a lot of people who
                    have been living here for years are
                    suddenly being swept up and thrown
                    into detention.
                        (He starts writing)
                    Tarek's lucky. Most of them don't
                    even have lawyers.
          
          Mouna blanches.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Lucky?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                        (Without looking up)
                    Relatively speaking. We just have
                    to move quickly to get an emergency
                    stay from the board of immigration.
                    Then, we'll stick with the motion
                    to reopen pending his green card
                    application.
          
          Mouna and Walter share a look. They're lost.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Can you explain what that means?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Actually, I don't have the time
                    right now. I have to be in court
                    very shortly
          
                              MOUNA
                    How long will he be in detention?

                        (Without looking up)
                    I can't predict that. I'm sorry but
                    I am gonna have to wrap this up.
          
          Walter looks at Mouna. Mouna stares at the Mr. Shah.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Do you have children, Mr. Shah?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Yeah. Two kids. And for what it's
                    worth my uncle was deported after
                    raising a family here for twenty-
                    three years. If I can get Tarek
                    out, I will.

                    There. In the middle.

                    The black woman? That is Zainab?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    She is very black.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET FAIR - LATER
          
          Zainab is sitting at her table when Walter approaches. Zainab
          smiles. She is genuinely surprised and happy to see him.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Walter?
          
                              WALTER
                    Hi Zainab. This is Mouna Khalil.
                    Tarek's mother.
          
          Zainab blanches.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Oh.
          
          She quickly stands up.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Hello, Zainab.

                    It is a pleasure to meet you, Mrs.
                    Khalil.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Please. Call me Mouna.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    OK. I'm sorry. I did not know you
                    were coming.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Neither did I.
          
          Mouna looks at her for a long moment. Then she inspects her
          jewelry. Zainab is uncharacteristically nervous.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Your jewelry is very beautiful.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Thank you.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Do you have time for coffee or a
                    walk?
          
          Zainab looks around at her table.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. I would like that. But I have
                    to watch my table.
          
          Mouna and Zainab both turn to look at Walter.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET FAIR, - LATER
          
          Walter is sitting behind Zainab's table in the fair. It's a
          long way from the classroom. A FEW YOUNG WOMEN walk past and
          browse Zainab's jewelry. They look at Walter who just nods.

                    I'm living with my cousin. He has
                    two kids. And his mother. I mean
                    his wife...I'm sorry, I am very
                    nervous.

                                 MOUNA
                    Why?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't know. Have you spoken with
                    Tarek?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. He called me this morning. He
                    is doing all right.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I wish that I could see him. Just
                    for a minute.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Me too. How long have you been
                    here?
          
                               ZAINAB
                    Two years. I was in detention when
                    I first arrived. Three months. It
                    was horrible. I would probably
                    still be there but they closed the
                    facility for poor conditions. They
                    released some of the women on
                    parole because we were...low risk.
                    I met Tarek one year later.
                        (Beat)
                    I am sorry for what happened with
                    Tarek. I hope you do not blame me.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Blame you?     No. I do not blame you.
          
          Zainab starts to break.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek was doing nothing wrong. I
                    miss him so much. I don't know what
                    I am going to do without him.
          
                              MOUNA
                    He said the same thing about you.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    He did?
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Yes.

                    Zainab, I would like you to do
                    something for me.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    What?
          
                              MOUNA
                    I would like you to show me
                    something that you and Tarek liked
                    to do. Some place that you like to
                    go.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Like what?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Anything. Whatever you want.
          
                             ZAINAB
                    OK. But maybe we should get Walter
                    first.
          
          They both smile at the thought of Walter still at Zainab's
          table.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna walk down the street listening to Zainab who
          is wheeling her jewelry supplies behind her.
          
          
          EXT. STATEN ISLAND FERRY - LATER
          
          Walter, Mouna and Zainab are standing at the railing of the
          Ferry which is making its way across the harbor.
          
          The STATUE OF LIBERTY looms large; the ferry route providing
          a perfect vantage point.
          
                              MOUNA
                    So what is in Staten Island?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't know. We never got off. We
                    just would go to the other side and
                    then come back.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Why?
          
                 80
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB
                    It's free. And it felt like we were
                    going somewhere.
          
          Mouna smiles.
          
                              ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    That is where the towers were. I
                    never saw them but Tarek did.
          
          Zainab crosses to the other railing and points.
          
                              ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    And over there is the Statue.    And
                    behind that is Ellis Island.
          
          Zainab smiles.
          
                              ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    Sometimes Tarek would point at the
                    statue and jump up and down like we
                    were arriving to New York for the
                    first time. It was very funny.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Can you go up in the Statue?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. I think so.

                    You haven't been?
          
                              WALTER
                    No.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Oh.
          
          Walter's cell phone rings. He looks at it.
          
                               WALTER
                    Excuse me.
                        (Into the phone)
                    Hello? Oh. Hi Charles.
          
          He walks away from the Mouna and Zainab.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    What's that? Yes. I'm still in New
                    York actually. I stayed down here
                    to do some research. What's that?
                    Oh. I'm on a boat. Yes, a boat.
                              (MORE)

                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Listen Charles, I'll explain when I
                    see you but I have to go right now.
                    I'll call you back. Goodbye.
          
          Walter hangs up the phone and rejoins Mouna and Zainab.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
          
          Walter is visiting with Tarek. Another detainee walks behind
          Tarek and taps him on the shoulder. Tarek nods hello and then
          keeps talking to Walter.
          
                              TAREK
                    You went on the ferry?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              TAREK
                    My mother too?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. She liked it.
          
                              TAREK
                    Did Zainab tell you how we used
                    pretend we arriving in New York for
                    the first time?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. She told us.
          
                              TAREK
                    You know they don't even let us
                    outside here. They just cut a hole
                    in the roof in one place.
          
                              WALTER
                    Really?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. It's crazy stuff.
          
          Tarek looks around the room.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    And they seemed to get along?
                    Zainab and my mother?
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes. I think your mother likes her
                    very much.
          
                 82
          
          
          
          Tarek smiles. Then it fades.
          
                              TAREK
                    My mother's not going home, is she?
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't think so.
          
                              TAREK
                    I know she's thinking about my
                    father. He spent seven years in
                    jail in Syria for something he
                    wrote in the newspaper. By the time
                    they released him he was very sick.
                    He died two months later. That's
                    when we came here.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm sorry.
          
                              TAREK
                    She thinks the same thing is gonna
                    happen to me.
          
          Tarek thinks for a long moment. He shakes his head.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    You know I have never seen them
                    together. Zainab and my mother.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET, NIGHT
          
          Walter and Mouna are walking home.
          
                              WALTER
                    Are you hungry, Mouna? We can stop
                    for dinner.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I would prefer to cook if you don't
                    mind?
          
                                 WALTER
                    OK.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Should we stop at a market?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. That's probably a good idea.
          
                    83
          
          
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - LATER
          
          Mouna is preparing dinner. Walter comes in and takes a bottle
          of wine out of the refrigerator.
          
                              WALTER
                    Would you like a glass of wine?
          
                              MOUNA
                    No thank you.
          
          Walter pours his glass.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mouna? I need to go back to
                    Connecticut tomorrow. For work. I
                    told Tarek.
          
                              MOUNA
                    How long will you be gone?
          
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't know yet. I'll try to make
                    it back to visit Tarek as soon as I
                    can.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You don't have keep visiting him,
                    Walter. I'm sure you are busy.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'll see what I can do.
          
                              MOUNA
                    OK. Dinner will be ready soon.
          
          Walter walks out of the kitchen.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Mouna and Walter are eating in silence.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Do you go to Broadway, Walter?
          
                              WALTER
                    Broadway? Uhm. No. I haven't been
                    in a long time.
          
                 84
          
          
          
                              MOUNA
                    Tarek sent me the CD for "Phantom
                    of the Opera" for my birthday. The
                    music is lovely. Have you seen it?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. I haven't.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I haven't either but I think I know
                    every word.
          
          Walter smiles. Silence.
          
                              WALTER
                    Tarek is teaching me the drum.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Really? How is it going?
          
                              WALTER
                    Well, I sound a lot better when
                    he's playing with me.
          
          Mouna laughs.
          
                              MOUNA
                    How is your teaching going, Walter?
          
          Walter seems caught off guard by the question.
          
                              WALTER
                    My teaching?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well...I have a lighter schedule so
                    I can work on my book.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Your book? What is it about?
          
                              WALTER
                    Well, it covers quite a bit, so
                    it's hard to explain.
          
          Walter drinks his glass of wine.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Are you almost finished?
          
                    85
          
          
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm close.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You don't like to talk about your
                    work?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. It's just a bit complicated.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Why is that?
          
          Walter is agitated.
          
                              WALTER
                    It just is. It's just not a process
                    that's easy to talk about with
                    someone who's not a writer.
          
          Walter's cheap shot lands. Mouna is stung.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I didn't mean to pry.
          
          There is an awkward silence.
          
                              WALTER
                    I shouldn't have spoken to you like
                    that.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    It's OK.
          
          Walter picks up the wine bottle and fills his glass.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Walter is sitting on the edge of his bed and takes off his
          shoes. He pauses.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING
          
          An empty New York street. Mouna and Walter round the corner
          walking together. She is holding his briefcase. Walter is
          carrying the drum and his duffle bag.
          
          They arrive at the Parking Garage. Walter hands a ticket to
          the GARAGE ATTENDANT. He takes his briefcase from Mouna.
          
                       86
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Thank you. You have my number if
                    you need anything.
          
                               MOUNA
                    I'll be fine. Thank you. Have a
                    safe trip.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well good bye.
          
                               MOUNA
                    Goodbye.
          
          Mouna turns and walks down the street. Walter's car arrives.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - LATER
          
          Walter pulls into his driveway. He gets out of the car. He
          opens the trunk and takes out his bag and then his drum.
          
          
          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CLASSROOM - LATER
          
          Walter walks into the lecture hall. He sets his briefcase
          down.
          
                              WALTER
                    Good afternoon.
          
          He takes out some papers and opens them.
          
          
          EXT. NEW LONDON - LATER
          
          Walter is stopped at a traffic light in town.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S CAR - SAME
          
          Walter sees Karen walking toward him. She is talking on her
          cell phone and does not notice him. Walter just watches her
          pass without saying a word.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Walter sits in his office working. He stops and listens to
          the silence.
          
                       87
          
          
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter pours himself a drink and wanders around the empty
          house.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter opens the front door and walks outside.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter walks onto the front lawn and looks around the sleepy
          neighborhood. He listens to the quiet. It's a stark contrast
          from New York.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter roots through his briefcase and pulls out the FELA
          KUTI CD. He slips the CD into the stereo. He presses play.
          FELA KUTI's, "DON'T GAG ME" blares over the speakers.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, PIANO ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is sitting in a chair and playing the drum along with
          the Fela song. He is only wearing a T-shirt and boxers.
          
          
          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
          
          Charles talks to Walter. They stand up and shake hands.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          Three MOVERS are carefully removing the piano from Walter's
          house as Walter and Barbara Watson look on.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S CAR - DAY
          
          Walter drives back down the highway. The Fela Kuti music is
          playing. He is tapping on the steering wheel.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S BUILDING, STAIRWELL - LATER
          
          Walter walks quickly up the stairs to the fourth floor. He
          seems to be moving with a little more pep.

          As he approaches his door, he hears music emanating from his
          apartment. It's a PIANO SONATA. The music stops him in his
          tracks. He listens for a couple of moments. Finally he walks
          inside.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter enters to find Mouna mopping the floor.   Fresh flowers
          are on the table. She sees Walter and smiles.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Walter.

                    I did not expect you so soon. I
                    was just cleaning a bit. I hope you
                    don't mind.
          
                              WALTER
                    No. Thank you.

                    I like this CD very much.   The
                    music is lovely.
          
          She picks up the CD.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Is it your wife?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    She was beautiful.

                    Thank you.
          
          Mouna sets down the CD. She notices Walter's glasses.
          
                              MOUNA
                    These are different glasses?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.

                              WALTER
                    Yes. Thank you.
          
          Walter leaves. Then he returns.
          
                                 WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Mouna?
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Yes.
          
                              WALTER
                    I was wondering if...Thursday night
                    ... Do you have plans?
          
          Mouna laughs.
          
                              MOUNA
                    No, Walter, I have no plans.
          
                               WALTER
                    Well, I thought that...we might do
                    something.
          
          
                                 MOUNA
                    OK.
          
                                 WALTER
                    OK.
          
          Walter nods and walks toward his room. Mouna watches him go
          and smiles.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITATION ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter and Tarek are talking. Tarek is very anxious.
          
                    90
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    They keep moving people.
          
                                 WALTER
                    To where?
          
                              TAREK
                    I don't know. I think to other
                    detention centers. Two Moroccan
                    guys were just moved. They had no
                    idea. Suddenly they were just gone.
          
                              WALTER
                    Has anyone said anything to you?
          
                              TAREK
                    No one in here knows anything. I'm
                    not a criminal. I have committed no
                    crime. What do they think? I'm a
                    terrorist? There are no terrorists
                    in here. The terrorists have money.
                    They have support. This is not
                    fair!
          
                                 WALTER
                    I know.
          
                              TAREK
                        (Angrily)
                    How do you know?! You're out there!
          
          Tarek's question stops Walter in his tracks. Tarek tries to
          regain his composure.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm sorry.
          
                              TAREK
                    It's just... I'm starting to wonder
                    if I'm ever going to get out of
                    here. I sit in here at night and I
                    keep thinking about Zainab.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    I just want to play my music and
                    live my life. What's so wrong about
                    that?
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK CAFE - DAY
          
          Walter, Mouna and Zainab are sitting at a cafe. Walter is on
          his cell phone.

                        (Into the phone)
                    OK. OK. Please do. Thank you. Bye.
          
          He hangs up.
          
                              MOUNA
                    What did he say?
          
                              WALTER
                    He would make some calls but they
                    can move him to another facility at
                    their discretion.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    What facility? Where?
          
                              WALTER
                    He said it could be anywhere.
                    Upstate. Pennsylvania. There is
                    even one in Louisiana.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Louisiana? Where they had the
                    floods?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    That's so far.
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah.
          
          
          
                              MOUNA
                    Did the lawyer say anything else?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. No he didn't know anything
                    else.
          
                              MOUNA
                    No one seems to know anything. It
                    feels like Syria.
          
          
          INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
          
          Darren and the Bass player are playing. They have a new

          Mouna walks along the street. She stops at a small CLOTHING

                              WALTER
                    I am. You look very nice.

                    That's wonderful. Thank you. I am

                    I have to say that show was really

                    Yeah. It was kind of scary.
          
          The both smile. A WAITER approaches and picks up their
          plates.

                    Yes.
          
                              WAITER
                    How is everything?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Very good. But I think I would like
                    a glass of wine.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm sorry. I didn't even think to
                    ask.
          
                              MOUNA
                    It's OK. It's not every night that
                    you see The Phantom.
                        (To the Waiter)
                    I'll have a cabernet.
          
                              WALTER
                    Two please.
          
                                 WAITER
                    Certainly.
          
          The Waiter leaves.
          
          
                              WALTER
                    I haven't been to theatre in a long
                    time.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Me neither. There is a place in
                    Syria called Maaloula. It is a huge
                    outdoor theater. It's beautiful.
                    We used to take Tarek there to see
                    concerts.
          
          The Waiter sets down the two GLASSES of wine.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Cheers.

                    Cheers.
          
          They clink glasses and drink.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mouna, I've taken a leave of
                    absence for the rest of the
                    semester.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Really? Why?
          
          Walter is suddenly self-conscious.
          
          
          Walter is suddenly self-conscious.
          
                              WALTER
                    I just thought I might spend some
                    more time in New York.
          
                               MOUNA
                    Walter, you do not have to do this
                    for Tarek.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I want to.
          
                              MOUNA
                    But you have to be in Connecticut.
                    You have your teaching. And your
                    book.
          
                              WALTER
                    It's fine really.
          
                              MOUNA
                    This is not your problem, Walter.
                    It's OK that you are busy.
          
          Her simple words strike a chord with Walter.
          
                               WALTER
                    I'm not busy. Not at all.
                        (Beat)
                    Mouna, the truth is I haven't been
                    doing any work for a long time.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You just presented your paper at
                    the conference.

          He is beginning to unravel.
          
                              WALTER
                    I didn't even write it. I just read
                    it. I've been teaching the same
                    course for twenty years. It doesn't
                    mean anything to me. None of it
                    does. I pretend. I pretend that I'm
                    busy. That I'm writing. Working.
                    But I'm not doing anything.
          
          Walter trails off.
          
                                 WALTER (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Don't be. I appreciate you telling
                    me this.
          
          The Waiter returns and pours some more water.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Walter, what would you do if you
                    didn't teach?
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't know.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I think that is exciting. Not to
                    know.
          
          Walter considers this as if for the first time. He smiles.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mouna, what do you do?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Do you mean for work?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I work in a car dealership. I take
                    care of the accounting.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Really?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. It's very exciting.

          Walter smiles.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Mouna and Walter walk into the apartment. Mouna takes off her
          coat.
          
                              MOUNA
                    What time is it?
          
                              WALTER.
                    Twelve thirty.
          
                              MOUNA
                    No?! Is it?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    My God. Twelve-thirty! I have not
                    been up this late in a long time.
          
                              WALTER
                    I think that happens a lot in New
                    York.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Thank you, Walter. That was a very
                    nice evening. It's the most fun
                    I've had in a long time.
          
                              WALTER
                    I told Tarek I was going to take
                    you. He was very happy about it.
          
          Mouna is touched by the comment. Her mood shifts.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Good night, Walter.
          
                              WALTER
                    Good night.
          
          And with that she turns and walks into her bedroom.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Walter wakes up. He checks his watch. He notices that his
          phone is blinking. A message. He picks it up and listens to
          it.

                    Damn it!
          
          He throws open the door and hurries into the...
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Mouna is sitting at the table.
          
                              WALTER
                    There's a message from Tarek.
                    Something's wrong.
          
                              MOUNA
                    What did he say?
          
                              WALTER
                    Just that they were moving him. He
                    didn't know what it meant.
          
          Without another word, Mouna is up and putting on her coat.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK TAXI - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna ride in the cab. Walter is on the phone.
          
                               WALTER
                    Well when do you expect him back?
                    Can you have him call me the minute
                    he is? It's an emergency. Thank
                    you.
                         (He hangs up.)
                    He's still in court.
                         (To the CAB DRIVER)
                    Can you hurry please?
          
                              MOUNA
                    I hate this feeling.
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna get out of the cab. Walter rushes in. Mouna
          waits outside.

                    Hello. I'm here for bed 38. Tarek
                    Khalil.
          
          The MALE GUARD checks the computer screen. Walter waits.
          
                              MALE GUARD
                    He is no longer with us.
          
                              WALTER
                    What does that mean?
          
                              MALE GUARD
                    I'm not sure.
          
                              WALTER
                    You're not sure? Was he moved to
                    another facility? Another state?
                    What?
          
                              MALE GUARD
                    I don't know. I just know that this
                    detainee is no longer in the
                    facility.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well can you ask someone who does
                    know?!
          
                                MALE GUARD
                    Hold on.
          
          The Guard picks up the phone and dials. He has a long
          conversation that Walter cannot hear.
          
          There are a few other visitors in the waiting room. They
          watch Walter.
          
                                MALE GUARD (CONT'D)
                    Sir?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. Did you find him?
          
                              GUARD
                    He's been removed.
          
                              WALTER
                    Removed? To where?
          
                                GUARD
                    Deported.

                    What? When?
          
                              GUARD
                    He was deported this morning.
          
                              WALTER
                    He...how can that be? Is there any
                    way to contact him?
          
                              GUARD
                    I don't know. I don't think so.
          
                              WALTER
                    You don't think so? What kind of
                    answer is that?!
          
                              GUARD
                    I'm sorry, sir. That's all the
                    information that I have. Now please
                    step away from the window. You can
                    call the ICE if you have any
                    further questions. The number is on
                    the wall.
          
          Walter's wheels are spinning. He is helpless. He looks around
          the room at all of the other immigrants visiting friends and
          family members. They are watching him with blank faces.

          Walter doesn't move. He checks his watch.
          
                              GUARD (CONT'D)
                    Sir. For the last time, step away
                    from my window.
          
          Finally, Walter turns and starts to walk out of the detention
          center.
          
          He reaches the exit and then spins around and storms back
          toward the guard booth. He completely loses control.
          
                              WALTER
                        (Angrily shouting)
                    You can't just take people away
                    like that! Do you hear me?! He was
                    a good man. A good person! He had a
                    life here! You can't just take
                    away whoever you want!
                              (MORE)
          
                      101
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    It's not fair! We are not just
                    helpless children! Do you hear me?!
          
          The Guard just stares back blankly. The other visitors watch
          in disbelief. They are unaccustomed to this type of outburst
          as is Walter who now stands trembling in the middle of the
          room.
          
          It's as if something inside him snapped. Something that he
          has been holding on to for a long time. He is suddenly
          adrift. Unsure of what to do next.
          
                              MOUNA (O.S.)
                        (Gently)
                    Walter.
          
          Walter turns. Mouna is standing there. He looks at her.
          Helpless.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Walter. Let's go. There is nothing
                    we can do. Let's go.
          
          Walter looks a bit lost. He looks back at the Guard who just
          stares back at him.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Come on, Walter.
          
          She reaches out and takes Walter's hand. And then she leads
          him out.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK TAXI - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna ride in a taxi. They are both depleted.
          Mouna shakes her head.
          
                              MOUNA
                    He did nothing wrong.
          
          She is overwhelmed by the events. She breaks down and starts
          to cry. Walter puts his arm around her.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET FAIR - DAY
          
          Walter watches as Mouna tells Zainab. Zainab buckles and hugs
          Mouna.
          
                   102
          
          
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Walter is looking out the window. Mouna walks out of the
          kitchen and turns out the light. She walks over and stands
          next to Walter.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Walter, I need to go back to Syria.
                    I should to be there for Tarek.
          
                              WALTER
                    When are you going to leave?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Tomorrow. I already bought a
                    ticket. It's best for me to be
                    there as soon as possible.
          
          Walter just looks at her. The news is piercing.
          
                              WALTER
                    You won't be able to come back
                    here.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    I know.
          
          Beat.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mouna. I'm sorry.
          
          Mouna smiles warmly.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Good night, Walter.
          
          Mouna leans in and kisses him gently on the cheek. She turns
          and walks toward her room. Walter watches her go and then
          looks back onto the street.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is lying awake in bed. There is a knock at the door.
          He sits up.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
          The door opens and a shaft of light cuts across the room.
          Mouna stands in the doorway.
          
                    103
          
          
          
          Walter stares at her for a moment and then turns down the bed
          sheets. Mouna walks over and lies down next time. Walter
          pulls the sheets back over her.
          
          They sit in silence for a long moment holding each other.
          
                              MOUNA
                    It's my fault. What happened to
                    Tarek. I did receive the letter
                    telling us to leave. I threw it
                    away. I never told him.
          
          Walter can only listen.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    We were here for three years by the
                    time the letter arrived. I had
                    found a job. Tarek was in school.
                    Everyone told me not to worry. That
                    the government did not care. And it
                    appeared to be true. And then,
                    after time, you forget. You think
                    that you really belong.
          
          Walter gently touches her.
          
                              WALTER
                    It's not your fault.
          
          He puts his arm around her and she collapses into him.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    It's not your fault.
          
          They lie together.
          
          
          INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Mouna and Walter are sitting in the airport.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Have you visited your son in
                    London?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. Not yet.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You should visit him.
          
          Mouna takes a small decorative pouch out of her purse.
          
                   104
          
          
          
                                 MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Here.
          
          Walter takes it and opens it. It's a WRIST BAND from Zainab's
          collection.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Zainab and I picked it out
                    especially for you.
          
                              WALTER
                    Thank you. It's very nice.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Let me see.
          
          Mouna puts it on Walter's wrist.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I like it.
          
                              MOUNA
                    So do I. You look cool.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Cool?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. You are very cool, Walter.
          
          Walter smiles. Mouna checks her watch.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    I should go.
          
          The both stand up.
          
          
          INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, SECURITY CHECKPOINT - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna arrive at the security check point. Mouna
          sets down her bag.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Thank you, Walter. For everything.
          
          She leans in and they hug long and hard.
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't want you to go.
          
          Mouna kisses him.
          
                    105
          
          
          
                              MOUNA
                        (She whispers)
                    I don't want to go, habibi.
          
          Then she picks up her bag and walks off. Walter watches her
          go. She turns and waves. Walter waves back and then she
          disappears into the security check point.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY
          
          Walter walks quickly along the street with his drum.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter approaches the subway and enters.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter swipes his card and walks down into the subway.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter walks along the subway platform. He stops about midway
          and sits down on a bench.
          
          The uptown subway train enters and obscures our view of him.
          
          Finally the train pulls away. Walter is still sitting but now
          he is playing his drum.
          
          He is fully committed.
          
          Another train wipes frame.
          
          
          EXT. STREET FAIR - DAY
          
          Zainab sits behind her table, staring straight ahead. We hold
          on her for a long moment and then...
          
                                                        CUT TO BLACK
