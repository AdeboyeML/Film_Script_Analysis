               JOHN LETOUR, forty, light sleeper. Never meant to be a drug 
               dealer, it just came along. He's been other things: messenger 
               boy, cab driver, model, postal clerk, doorman, nightclub 
               shill -- never meant to be them either. Now he's a D.D. Drug 
               dealer.

               JOHN LETOUR, well-groomed, khaki slacks, leather jacket, 
               tippet-like scarf, belt pouch, "Beatle" boots, a shadow 
               drifting in and out of other shadows, New York, day, night: 
               watching, listening, rarely speaking -- nonexistent, seen 
               only by those he sees. His face an affable blank. Make of it 
               what you will. The eyes flicker; the hands shift discreetly. 
               A map of calculation.

               Once he had a drug problem. Life turned a page. Today he 
               follows instructions: he sleeps light -- one eye open, 
               anticipating. JOHN LETOUR, D.D., loner, voyeur, has been 
               drifting toward an unknown destination. At mid-life the 
               destination draws near. The circle tightens. The dealer is 
               anxious. The destination is love.

               NIGHT IN THE LIFE

               CREDIT SEQUENCE: New York by night. JOHN LETOUR nestles in 
               back of a blue car service sedan, face reflected in the 
               window. Neon mixes with steam, street people with tourists, 
               young dates: each with a different agenda, a hidden purpose.

               His beeper goes off. He clicks it, checks the digital message. 
               The DRIVER stops at an uptown corner. LETOUR opens the 
               curbside door, motions to the DRIVER he'll be back in "ten" 
               minutes. He enters the video laundromat, a twenty-four-hour 
               video rental/laundromat/tanning salon.

               Inside, he meets a RETRO-YUPPIE (J. Crew Division) in the 
               "Classics" section. They exit.

               On the sidewalk, money is exchanged for a packet. LETOUR 
               pockets the uncounted cash. The YUPPIE mouths goodbye, eager 
               to put distance between him and LETOUR. JOHN checks his 
               beeper, stops at a pay phone, dials.

               JOHN LETOUR re-enters the sedan; the DRIVER heads downtown. 
               High-rises give way to Tudor City. Uncollected trash lines 
               the curbs. LETOUR eyes a PEDESTRIAN; PEDESTRIAN looks back. 
               Later. Three a.m. The streets are dark. LeTour's car passes 
               a glowing Korean market.

               LETOUR narrates from diary:

                                     LETOUR
                              (voice over)
                         Labor Day weekend. Some time for a 
                         sanitation strike. Everybody crazy 
                         to stock up. They decide to score at 
                         the last minute and want it now. 
                         Never fails. The faces look alike. 
                         You gotta use memory tricks: each 
                         has some peculiarity -- it keeps you 
                         sharp. A D.D. told me when a drug 
                         dealer starts writing a diary it's 
                         time to quit. I started writing after 
                         that. Not every night -- now and 
                         then. Just to burn off the night. 
                         Fill up one book, throw it out, start 
                         another.

               The sedan drives on. End credits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HOMEBASE

               Four a.m.: streets empty. LeTour's sedan drops him off near 
               a ten-story West 80s apartment building. JOHN gives the DRIVER 
               a forty-dollar tip (standard procedure), turns the corner. 
               He presses the intercom; a buzzer unlocks the door. He enters 
               the lobby, walks past English reproduction furniture toward 
               the elevators. Presses the button.

               Penthouse C door opens. ANN lets JOHN in with a smile.

               ANN, forty-four, striking in a tailored dress, greets him 
               with a wet kiss. Her hair is coiffured, her face made up. 
               She is John's employer, mentor, confidante, Mother Hen: she 
               keeps the books. Her ingenuous demeanor belies sterner stuff: 
               she's been in the drug business fifteen years.

               Ann's apartment is a jumble of sensibilities: dark green 
               walls, zebra-skin sofa, Haitian wall friezes, framed magazine 
               photos of Paramahansa Yogananda, Liz Taylor, the Duke of 
               Windsor -- paintings stacked behind an oversized urn. A bird 
               flits in its cage. One corner of the living area is devoted 
               to a fledgling cosmetics business: Macintosh computer, 
               billboard of trade paper clippings and ads, herbal samples, 
               reference books, color charts.

               ROBERT, fifty, slight, waves hello as JOHN locks the door. 
               Gay, hip, worn, he's John's "co-runner."

               They work -- and eat -- out of Ann's apartment. Take-out 
               tins of Indian food are stacked amid crystals, tarot cards, 
               glasses, and vitamin bottles. No sign of drugs, drug 
               paraphernalia, or money.

                         Sad what ten years without sex can 
                         do.

               Repartee: the plumbing of family feeling.

               JOHN unzips his belt pouch, walks toward the bedroom to 
               deposit the night's earnings.

                         These Wall Street kids deal with 
                         fake money all day, they think cash 
                         is a theoretical concept -- like it 
                         doesn't apply. I see 'em at two, 
                         shudder to think at nine they're 
                         buying and selling -- turned me off 
                         the stock market.

                         C's. I'll pick up anything that comes 
                         in.

               LETOUR turns to leave.

                                     ANN
                         Sleep tight.

                              (laughs)
                         Yeah -- big kiss.

               He throws two kisses, exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               JOHN'S APARTMENT

               First light reflects across the Hudson as LETOUR walks west 
               on 22nd Street toward his Chelsea apartment building. A 
               delivery truck passes uncollected garbage. He enters a 
               nondescript doorway. Inside his studio apartment, JOHN sits 
               at a second-hand table writing in a composition book. He 
               drinks from an eight-ounce glass of white wine, continues.

               The room has little personality; Ann's apartment has enough 
               for two. Nails indicate where pictures once hung; a boombox 
               sits on the linoleum floor amid cassettes, books 
               (Autobiography of a Yogi, The Secret Doctrine), fashion 
               magazines, a stack of unopened CDs. A futon is unrolled 
               beneath the room's sole decoration, a poster of a human foot 
               advertising a forgotten photo exhibit. Wine bottles -- Chenin 
               Blanc. Precious little to show for forty years.

               LeTour's narration resumes as he writes:

                                     LETOUR
                              (voice over)
                         "Labor Day." "Union Movement" -- 
                         there's a contradiction in terms. I 
                         know about long hours. It's worse 
                         when I'm off -- I just walk and walk. 
                         Where am I going? There's an element 
                         of providence to it all. Like rolling 
                         numbers. Luck. You're walking down 
                         the street, some guy that looks maybe 
                         a little like you does a stick-up 
                         four hours ago, there's an APB 
                         description out and a cop pulls you 
                         in cause he's cold and wants to go 
                         inside -- they grab your stash. Your 
                         number's up. You're busted for 
                         nothing. For bad luck.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               JEALOUS

               Five p.m. A Clinton transient hotel.

               Inside hotel room, LETOUR meets with JEALOUS, a twenty-five-
               year-old drug intermediary in leather jacket. JOHN counts 
               hundred-dollar bills, hands them to JEALOUS.

                                     JEALOUS
                         Are they "faced"?

                                     LETOUR
                         Don't bore me.

               JEALOUS rearranges the hundreds:

                                     JEALOUS
                         Is it so much work to face them the 
                         same direction? You don't do it, I 
                         got to. It's time -- my time --

                                     LETOUR
                              (overlap)
                         Jees --

                                     JEALOUS
                         We've been through all this.
                              (LETOUR shrugs)
                         This nineteen-gram shit is a drag.

                                     LETOUR
                         We pay you more, you put up with 
                         more. White drugs for white people. 
                         Twice the price, twice the safety.

                                     JEALOUS
                         I can't believe Ann's been working 
                         as long as she has -- never busted. 
                         She's something.

                                     LETOUR
                         Never made any big money either.

                                     JEALOUS
                         Sure.

                                     LETOUR
                         She blows it.

                                     JEALOUS
                         You believe that? What you gonna do 
                         after she quits? How long you been 
                         with her?

                                     LETOUR
                         She always says that. We'll see, 
                         Jealous.

                                     JEALOUS
                         She's out. You should pick up her 
                         trade. You're too old to be a go-

                         No way. I'm not the management type. 
                         I get in charge, I'll start using 
                         again -- not for me. I know music 
                         people. I'm gonna get in recording.

                         Yeah.

               LETOUR reaches for the door.

                         What?

                         Normally this wouldn't matter to

                                     LETOUR
                         Why?

               THE NIGHT BEGINS

               Ann's apartment. Eight p.m. She opens the door for LETOUR, 
               kisses him, goes back to the phone. Mantra muzak plays as 
               JOHN locks door, heads toward bedroom. Inside bedroom, MTV 
               glows silently as ROBERT, wearing a black turtleneck, works 
               at a desk amid tools of the trade: digital scale, "hot box," 
               Deering grinder, block of manite, pure cocaine, pills, felt 
               pen. ROBERT scissors glossy magazine paper (Elle) into neat 
               quarters, folds each into gram-size "bindels" -- envelopes. 
               Red satin drapes the ceiling.

                                     ROBERT
                         Jack.

               JOHN kisses him atop the head.

                                     ROBERT
                         You pick up from Jealous?

                                     LETOUR
                              (passes bag)
                         Yeah, nineteen grams after four times 
                         last night. We're certainly not his 
                         favorite people.

                                     ROBERT
                         We don't make the laws. Nineteen is 
                         carrying, twenty is dealing. Let him 
                         be stupid.

                                     LETOUR
                         He took my hundreds.

                                     ROBERT
                              (stands)
                         Take over for a while. I'm getting 
                         contact high.

                                     LETOUR
                              (sits)
                         Who's Her Majesty talking to?

               ROBERT flips through cable channels as JOHN grinds cocaine.

                                     ROBERT
                         The Ecstasy connection. From Arizona. 
                         She's trying to get them to come 
                         here -- or, better, Europe.

                                     LETOUR
                         That's where the money is.

                                     ROBERT
                         All mark-up -- the "Big One."

                                     LETOUR
                              (laughs)
                         Don't dress.
                              (beat)
                         You really think she means it?

                                     ROBERT
                         That's what she says. New Year's Eve 
                         and out -- no Acid House, no product, 
                         no deliveries.

                                     LETOUR
                         That's just her mouth talking.

                                     ROBERT
                         Next year -- strictly Akasha.

                         Cosmetics. That's what Ann's calling 
                         the company now --

                         -- this week. I don't get it -- 
                         marigolds, violets, sage -- why'd 
                         anyone pay to put weeds on their 
                         face?

                         Why'd anyone pay to put them up their 
                         nose? I like cosmetics. I need 
                         cosmetics. You should come in with 
                         us.

                         You forget: she hasn't asked me.

               ANN hangs up, calls:

               They simultaneously kiss her cheeks.

                         The face cream. Almond, marigold, 
                         chamomile, egg, aloe -- the "Almilk" 
                         formula. I remixed it.

                         Thai. We haven't had Thai in a while.

               The phone rings. Ann's voice repeats a recorded message:

                                     ANN'S VOICE
                         "Hello. This is Ann. If you leave a

                         sooner than you think."

               Answering machine beeps. MAN'S VOICE speaks from the tiny 
               speaker: "Ann, this is Ed. Call me. 749-2876."

                         The night begins.

               The phone rings again: another message as ANN examines the

               Rain falls on LeTour's car near an East Side luxury high-
               rise. The door opens to Eddie's apartment: severe decor, 
               once chic, now dated. EDDIE, thirty-two, is a mess: puffy 
               face, sweaty shirt, pinched lips -- on a drug jag.

                                     LETOUR
                              (nods)
                         Robert said he sold you a quarter 
                         yesterday.

                                     EDDIE
                              (slurs)
                         Some friends came over. How much is 
                         that? Fourteen-hundred?

               LETOUR nods as EDDIE, employing diminished skills, counts 
               from a roll of twenties. JOHN looks around: full ashtrays, 
               porn tapes, empty vodka bottles -- there have been no 
               "friends."

                                     LETOUR
                         Eddie. Look at yourself. Sit down. 
                         I've known you, what, like eight 
                         years?

                                     EDDIE
                              (counting)
                         Yeah...

                                     LETOUR
                         Knew you from the other job, the one 
                         before the last one you fucked up. I 
                         knew your wife -- remember her? We 
                         used to sit and talk and talk --

               Pressures EDDIE into chair.

                                     EDDIE
                              (whining)
                         You don't know what she was like --

                                     LETOUR
                         This is no good. I'll sell you a 
                         gram and some downs, but I ain't 
                         gonna put you in the emergency room. 
                         Cool it. Go to bed. Sleep it off.

               John's beeper goes off.

                                     EDDIE
                              (stands)
                         You charge $200 for what goes for 
                         ninety on the street -- and you're 
                         not gonna sell?

                                     LETOUR
                              (clicks beeper)
                         So go to the street.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'll call Ann.

                                     LETOUR
                         Go ahead. You know what she'll say. 
                         Phone's over there.

                                     EDDIE
                              (irrational)
                         I'll tell the fucking cops.

                                     LETOUR
                              (flashes cold)
                         Fuck you. That's it. You're out.
                              (turns to leave)
                         Don't call again. Catch you next 
                         lifetime.

                                     EDDIE
                              (contrite)
                         Please, Tour, I'm sorry. You're right. 
                         I didn't mean that. I'm quitting 
                         anyway. I'll take the gram. Sorry.

                                     LETOUR
                              (turns back)
                         Okay.

                                     EDDIE
                         Two hundred?

               LETOUR nods.

               EDDIE counts $200 as LETOUR takes a gram from his pouch, 
               gives it to him.

                                     LETOUR
                         You got downs?
                              (EDDIE nods)
                         One more thing. I gotta use the phone.

               EDDIE pockets the envelope as JOHN, checking his beeper, 
               walks to the phone.

               Later. LETOUR sits in an Upper West Side apartment as an 
               earnest MID-TWENTIESH MAN, wearing undershorts, snorts a 
               hefty line, offers a rolled dollar bill as he talks. LETOUR 
               declines.

                                     MID-TWENTIESH MAN
                              (continuing)
                         ...but -- if there's no God, how can 
                         man conceive of him? The idea of God 
                         presupposes the existence of God. 
                         That's the Ontological Argument. 
                         Anselm. Twelve hundred. Fourteen 
                         hundred -- I'm not sure --

                                     LETOUR
                              (checks his watch)
                         I've got to go.

                                     MID-TWENTIESH MAN
                              (gesturing)
                         Let me finish. Okay, if the idea of 
                         God is implanted by God -- the sensus 
                         divinitatus, the sense of the divine -- 
                         what is the role of human thought? 
                         Not faith, thought...

               LETOUR's mind drifts. His diary voice overlaps:

                                     LETOUR
                              (Voice over)
                         Everybody wants to talk. It's like a 
                         compulsion. My philosophy is: you 
                         got nothing to say, don't say it. 
                         They figure you can tell a D.D. 
                         anything, things they would never 
                         tell anyone else. He understands. Of 
                         course they're stoned to start. If I 
                         could tie together all the hours of 
                         coke talk I've heard, that would be 
                         a lot of string. It was Robert's 
                         idea to add twenty-five dollars to 
                         home deliveries cause it's such a 
                         hassle. Fifty is more like it.

               Later. Narration continues as sedan drives through rain. 
               Later. A Tribeca loft. LETOUR swaps drug jargon with TWO 
               N.Y.U. STUDENTS at an impromptu party. Attractive ingenues 
               drift by. TRENDY TWOSOME, blasted, sways, to techno-rap.

               Business done, LETOUR turns to leave. The FIRST STUDENT grabs 
               his shoulder:

                                     FIRST STUDENT
                         C'mon, Tour, stick around.

                                     SECOND STUDENT
                         Yeah.

                                     FIRST STUDENT
                         There's only four of us and like 
                         seven of them -- and we're paying 
                         for the dope. See her, over there, 
                         the blonde, long hair, yellow skirt? -- 
                         she's gonna model for Elite.

               DOWNTOWN NYMPH, sixteen going on seventeen.

                                     LETOUR
                              (smiling)
                         Me? I'm an old man. She'd break me 
                         like an old horse.

                                     SECOND STUDENT
                         Shit, dude --

                                     LETOUR
                         Nah. Thanks anyway.
                              (checks watch)
                         I gotta go. Have fun.
                              (heads toward exit)

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FACE FROM THE PAST

               LeTour's sedan heads down Lexington Avenue. It rains unabated. 
               Puddles glisten; red taillights refract on the windshield. 
               JOHN rests in back, a bag from Enhancements beside him.

               Pedestrians, well-dressed and casual, desperately wave for 
               taxis amid sacks of garbage. No use: nothing for blocks.

               John's sedan stops for a midtown light. LETOUR looks out the 
               window, sees a WOMAN vainly hailing a cab. He looks again. 
               She turns her head. He recognizes her.

                                     LETOUR
                              (to DRIVER)
                         Carlos. Wait a second.

               He leans over, opens the far door, calls:

                                     LETOUR
                         Marianne! Marianne! Hop in! I'll 
                         give you a ride.

               MARIANNE JOST, thirty-five, stylish in short black hair and 
               long black coat, steps closer, looks through the rain.

                                     LETOUR
                         John. John LeTour.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (recognizes him)
                         John?

                                     LETOUR
                         Get in. You're getting soaked.

               She ducks inside, slams the door.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (awkward)
                         Hi...

               The car moves on.

                                     LETOUR
                         Where are you going?

               MARIANNE wipes rain from her cheeks; her expression deepens: 
               cautious, suspicious. No reply.

                                     LETOUR
                         I didn't know you still lived here.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (second thoughts)
                         Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. 
                         I should get out.

                                     LETOUR
                         Don't be crazy. It's pouring.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I'm not supposed to be around --

                                     LETOUR
                              (completes sentence)
                         -- former drug associates.

                                     MARIANNE
                         It's four years I'm clean. No alcohol, 
                         no cigarettes, no nothing.

                                     LETOUR
                         I heard. I'm happy for you.

                                     MARIANNE
                         It's still not easy.

                                     LETOUR
                         I know. Mar, you don't need to avoid 
                         me. I'm straight -- two years. It 
                         came that time. I tried to tell you. 
                         I wrote. I called.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (looks around)
                         I should get out.

                                     LETOUR
                         Honest.

                                     MARIANNE
                         But you're dealing.

                                     LETOUR
                         No. I stopped.

                                     MARIANNE
                         What's in the bag?

                                     LETOUR
                         Almond oil. You can check.
                              (opens bag)
                         Look.

               She does: Enhancements Almond Oil. John's beeper goes off! -- 
               he punches it.

                                     LETOUR
                         Shit.

                                     MARIANNE
                         What's that for? In case someone 
                         needs almond oil in the middle of 
                         the night?

                                     LETOUR
                         I still deal a little, but I'm 
                         straight -- that part's true. Believe 
                         me.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (to DRIVER)
                         Stop here. Now. Stop!

                                     LETOUR
                         I won't say anything. I promise. 
                         I'll just sit here. I'll just give 
                         you a ride.

               The car pulls over. MARIANNE opens the door, gets out.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Goodbye, John.

                                     LETOUR
                         Where do you live?
                              (door slams)
                         Mari...

               She fades into the rain. JOHN watches, aching.

                                     DRIVER
                         Sir?

               The sedan continues uptown.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               John's apartment. Pre-dawn. His diary lies open on the desk. 
               LETOUR sits clothed on the futon, drinking white wine. He 
               pages through a cheap, half-filled photo album. He touches 
               snapshots, 3×5's from another time:

               -- JOHN and MARIANNE, arm in arm, on a Florida beach

               -- MARIANNE, surprised by the camera, snorting coke at a 
               party

               -- JOHN, MARIANNE, and ANN posing, smiling, same party

               -- JOHN and MARIANNE kissing over birthday cake, same party

               -- MARIANNE IN MOROCCO BAZAAR

               -- JOHN blowing a kiss in Fez airport

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PSYCHIC HEALING

               LeTour's narration continues over embossed card on an entry 
               table: Teresa Aronow, Psychic Reading, 37 Jones Street, New 
               York, N.Y. 10012, (212)473-4297. VOICES under narration:

                                     TERESA
                              (out of shot)
                         Coffee?

                                     LETOUR
                              (out of shot)
                         Thanks.

                                     TERESA
                              (out of shot)
                         Black?

                                     LETOUR
                              (out of shot)
                         Yeah.

                                     TERESA
                              (out of shot)
                         Here.

               JOHN accepts a coffee mug, sits on a sofa across from TERESA. 
               Sunlight falls through crocheted curtains.

               TERESA ARONOW, fortyish, professionally young, is compact, 
               demure; she wears business jacket and skirt, patterned blouse. 
               Nothing about her is remotely paranormal -- nothing except, 
               of course, her "aura." The "Other Side." Her voice is at the 
               same time soothing, piercing.

               Teresa's West Village consultation room is startlingly 
               mundane: a bourgeois walk-up. Upholstered furniture, Tiffany 
               objêts d'art, framed photos of her husband and children -- a 
               trip to Capri. A twenties portrait of Madame Blavatsky, above 
               the fireplace, centers the room.

                                     LETOUR
                         I'm not sure how this works.

                                     TERESA
                         Have you ever been to a psychic 
                         before?

                                     LETOUR
                         No, but I've, well, I've heard about 
                         it.

                                     TERESA
                         Do you need advice? John?

                                     LETOUR
                              (nods)
                         No... it's not that... I don't know -- 
                         I just decided to come. I thought...

                                     TERESA
                         Be comfortable.
                              (smile)
                         How did you hear about me?

                                     LETOUR
                         A recommendation. Somebody from work. 
                         Two hundred dollars, right?

               TERESA nods. JOHN tucks cash into an envelope, places it on 
               the coffee table.

                                     TERESA
                         It's a lot of money?

                                     LETOUR
                         I don't care.

                                     TERESA
                              (explaining)
                         I look at you. I give you my 
                         impressions. I feel your "vibrations" -- 
                         I don't like that word, it sounds 
                         phony, but I can't think of anything 
                         better.
                              (watching)
                         You're anxious.
                              (he shrugs)
                         More than usual. Your aura is very 
                         strong. I feel a very strong vibration 
                         from you. A change is coming. You're 
                         worried about money. You say you 
                         don't care about money but that's 
                         not true.

                                     LETOUR
                         Yeah.

                                     TERESA
                         Your livelihood is endangered. You're 
                         worried about the future. You don't 
                         have much money saved. What will you 
                         do?

                                     LETOUR
                         I don't know.

                                     TERESA
                         I see a woman who has betrayed you.

                                     LETOUR
                              (smiles)
                         My mother?

                                     TERESA
                              (cuts him short)
                         Who will betray you.

                                     LETOUR
                         Not... I...

                                     TERESA
                         Keep it in mind. I have a strong 
                         feeling about this woman, a woman 
                         close to you, she will betray you. 
                         You're in the entertainment business, 
                         aren't you?

                                     LETOUR
                         Yes.

                                     TERESA
                         But you're not happy. You want to do 
                         something else. Is it music?

                                     LETOUR
                         Yes...

                                     TERESA
                         You have a talent for music.

                                     LETOUR
                         As a child.

                                     TERESA
                         You still have it. It's strong. I 
                         see music in your future. A career 
                         opportunity will come in the music 
                         field. Take it. It won't seem 
                         promising. Take it anyway.
                              (pause)
                         You're full of stress. Are you 
                         exercising?

                                     LETOUR
                         No. I --

                                     TERESA
                         You should exercise more. You must 
                         let go of this stress. It's not good 
                         for your health. I'm not saying you're 
                         going over to the other side, but 
                         it's not good for you. You're still 
                         drinking, aren't you? You have a 
                         drinking problem?
                              (he shrugs)
                         It's interfering with your health 
                         and your life too. You've had other 
                         problems. Drug addiction.

                                     LETOUR
                         Yes.

                                     TERESA
                         This was very important in your life.

                                     LETOUR
                         Yes.

                                     TERESA
                         You are in the balance. Everything 
                         you do -- positive or negative -- in 
                         this life is a drop that will carry 
                         over in the next. Every act, every 
                         decision matters.

                                     LETOUR
                         Teresa?

                                     TERESA
                         What is it?

                                     LETOUR
                         I'm thirty-eight years old.
                              (beat)
                         Forty.

                                     TERESA
                         You're young.

                                     LETOUR
                         I have trouble sleeping.
                              (TERESA waits)
                         Look. What do you see around me? Is 
                         there anything? Is it dark? Have I 
                         run out of luck? Is there luck?

                                     TERESA
                         I see a glow. Everything you need is 
                         around you. The only danger is inside 
                         you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MONEY CHANGER

               Ann's apartment. The night has already begun. ANN sits on 
               the floor beside a YOUNG HASID counting money. He wears 
               Orthodox garb: black hat, black coat, peyas. Tibetan bells 
               reverb from speakers as the Bergmanesque cambist runs faced 
               twenty-dollar bills through a battery-operated counting 
               machine, places stacks of cash on the floor. ROBERT returns 
               a call from the kitchen; LETOUR emerges from the bathroom, 
               wiping his hands.

                                     ANN
                              (to LETOUR and ROBERT)
                         Your pay's on the table.

               JOHN walks to the cosmetics corner, finds an envelope with 
               his name on it, looks inside: $500 in twenties. He pockets 
               the money.

               LETOUR sits as HASID double-checks the total: cash covers 
               the available floor space.

                                     YOUNG HASID
                              (dialogue punctuates 
                              action)
                         One hundred thirty-one, let's make 
                         it 130-$13,000, hundreds for small 
                         bills. One percent commission, $130 
                         to you -- add tens or whatever if 
                         you want.

               Opening a satchel, he removes bound $100s, counts off 130 as 
               ANN adds up commission in small bills. He loads the satchel:

                                     YOUNG HASID
                         Same time?

                                     ANN
                              (nods)
                         Two weeks -- don't run. Stay a while. 
                         We'll order kosher. We'll tell you 
                         dirty stories. We'll talk Zionism.

               The HASID laughs. He likes her.

                                     YOUNG HASID
                              (passes hundreds)
                         I'm late already. I only come 'cause 
                         I like you. Sure you're not Jewish? 
                         I don't want to see you hurt. Find a

               TIS turns, steps away. LETOUR walks down the long corridor. 
               Curious, reflective, he slows past open doors. Friends, 
               family, patients sit in blue light. Each room a drama.

               He heads down a duplicate corridor. A VOICE turns his head:

                                     RANDI
                         John!

               He turns to see RANDI JOST, thirty, Marianne's younger sister. 
               She wears running shoes, jeans, red sweater.

                         Mom. She's back in. Didn't Marianne 
                         tell you?

                                     RANDI
                         She's sleeping. She sleeps most of 
                         the time. She'd like it, though. She 
                         still talks about you.

                                     LETOUR
                              (sad)
                         I'm so sorry. She's a terrific woman. 
                         I was crazy about her. God.

               MARIANNE, head down, approaches. Looking up, she finds herself 
               unexpectedly beside JOHN and RANDI:

                                     RANDI
                         It's John. What a coincidence.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (gathering herself)

                         Yeah.

                                     RANDI
                         She would be so happy to see John.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I don't think that would be a good 
                         idea.

               An awkward silence: RANDI doesn't get it.

                                     LETOUR
                         You both look so tired.

                         The hospital lets us stay in her 
                         room.

                         Let me buy you some coffee or 
                         something -- the cafeteria's 
                         downstairs. It helps to talk.

                                     RANDI
                         You go, Marianne, it's my turn with 
                         mom.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I shouldn't.

                                     RANDI
                         Go. You haven't eaten. Go on.
                              (nudges her)
                         Go on.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I...

                                     RANDI
                         Bring me a coffee.

               MARIANNE acquiesces.

                                     LETOUR
                         This way.
                              (to RANDI)
                         Kiss your mother for me.

               JOHN escorts MARIANNE toward the stairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Hospital cafeteria. JOHN and MARIANNE carry trays to a formica 
               table, molded chairs. He mixes sugar in his coffee as she 
               sets out her salad, diet soda, to-go coffee.

               An awkward moment. MARIANNE scans the fluorescent room: 
               doctors, nurses, relatives.

                                     LETOUR
                         I like your mom.

                                     MARIANNE
                         She liked you. You know this will 
                         happen someday, but when it does... 
                         Your mother -- that was a shock.

                         Your father?

                                     MARIANNE
                              ("no")
                         Not this time. His new wife -- he'll 
                         make it to the funeral.

                                     LETOUR
                         What have you been doing? Where do 
                         you live?

                                     MARIANNE
                         It's...
                              (deciding)
                         I don't want you to know about my 
                         life.

                                     LETOUR
                         Anything? You married? Have children? 
                         A dog?
                              (smile)
                         House plants?

                                     MARIANNE
                         Details just open the door.

                                     LETOUR
                         The door to what?
                              (no answer)
                         It's not like we're strangers. We 
                         were married.

                                     MARIANNE
                         We were not.

                                     LETOUR
                         There was a ceremony.

                                     MARIANNE
                         He wasn't even a minister. He was an 
                         astrologer.

                                     LETOUR
                         He was also a minister. "Universal 
                         Harmony."

                                     MARIANNE
                         He was a Pisces.

                                     LETOUR
                         You're a Pisces.

                                     MARIANNE
                         It was not legal.

                                     LETOUR
                         In the eyes of Jeanne Dixon we're 
                         still --

                                     MARIANNE
                         I was on the cusp.

                                     LETOUR
                         We were happy.

                                     MARIANNE
                         We were miserable. We were either 
                         scoring or coming down -- mostly 
                         coming down.

                                     LETOUR
                         There were good times. Area, out on 
                         the street, laughing, dancing with 
                         friends -- we were magical.

                                     MARIANNE
                         You took off for three months without 
                         telling me and called once. That's 
                         how magical we were. You were an 
                         encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies -- 
                         I heard them all. Nobody could clear 
                         a room like you, John. And the 
                         friends, you may have noticed, turned 
                         out to be mine, not yours. I envy 
                         you. A convenient memory is a gift 
                         from God.

                                     LETOUR
                         You exaggerate.

                                     MARIANNE
                         In rehab they call this "euphoric 
                         recall." You only remember the highs, 
                         never the lows.

                                     LETOUR
                         We were happy.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I was drowning.

                                     LETOUR
                         It wasn't me --

                                     MARIANNE
                         You watched --

                                     LETOUR
                         You jumped --

                                     MARIANNE
                         You did nothing -- "It wasn't your 
                         business, you weren't responsible" -- 
                         you still think like that.
                              (shakes head)
                         Actions have consequences; so do --

                                     LETOUR
                              (overlap)
                         I --

                                     MARIANNE
                         -- inactions.

                                     LETOUR
                         I didn't --
                              (MARIANNE smiles)
                         I meant well.

                                     MARIANNE
                         You always meant well.

                                     LETOUR
                         We were in love?

                                     MARIANNE
                         Yes.

                                     LETOUR
                         We were happy?

               She doesn't answer. He slides his hand across the table. She 
               notices his gold and onyx ring.

                                     LETOUR
                         You bought it for me. It's inscribed 
                         inside.

               She pushes his hand away. Details open doors.

                                     LETOUR
                         Ann's quitting. I've got to find 
                         something else to do.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Ann? I'll believe it when I see it.

                                     LETOUR
                         It's true.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Are you really straight?

                                     LETOUR
                         Yeah.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Let me see your eyes.

               JOHN leans forward, eyes open. She presses up an eyelid, 
               examines one iris, the other:

                                     MARIANNE
                         Eyes are deceiving.
                              (beat)
                         Congratulations.

                                     LETOUR
                         If I could do that, I could do 
                         anything.

                                     MARIANNE
                         What do you mean?

                                     LETOUR
                         We could do anything. We could start 
                         over.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (bangs her head)
                         What was that? I think I heard 
                         something.

                                     LETOUR
                         I'm serious.

               An INTERCOM VOICE announces visiting hours will end in five 
               minutes.

                                     MARIANNE
                         You're crazy.

                                     LETOUR
                              (gestures to room)
                         This is crazy.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I have to get back.

               JOHN nods, checks his watch -- he's late too. They exchange 
               "last looks"; MARIANNE stands.

                                     LETOUR
                         I'll walk you.

               He stands, follows.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NEW DIARY

               Later. LeTour's sedan pulls up near Palio, a midtown 
               restaurant.

               JOHN steps around garbage bags, enters.

               Inside, JOHN "maps" bar, greets the MAÎTRE D'. LETOUR spots 
               the FRENCH (LaCroix and Montana) COUPLE in the dining section, 
               catches the man's eye. He nods to the MAÎTRE D', makes his 
               way toward their table.

               He joins the FRENCH COUPLE, declines a drink, exchanges 
               drugs/money amid air kisses.

               Late night. Fog hangs over 22nd Street: Chelsea's deserted. 
               Homeless men behind windbreaks of trash.

               John's apartment. He writes bareback at the desk. He completes 
               his composition book diary mid-sentence, closes it, discards 
               it. He lifts a new book from the floor, opens it on the desk, 
               continues.

               He fills his glass with wine:

                                     LETOUR
                              (voice over)
                         I can always find another way to 
                         make a living. I never planned this 
                         in the first place -- not like Ann. 
                         She came up to sell, have parties, 
                         make contacts. She was so glamorous. 
                         I just wanted to be around her. She'd 
                         sit up listening to coke stories. 
                         Now it's me and Robert. The whole 
                         crowd was the same age. Everybody's 
                         younger now. She made me.

               LETOUR pulls his weekly pay from his pants, puts five twenties 
               in an envelope. He addresses the envelope. "Linda Wichel, 
               1012B-2 A Street, Sacramento, California," stamps it.

               Dissolves: (1) LETOUR vanishes from his desk, (2) materializes 
               fetally on his futon, bareback, slacks, boots, anxious, 
               awaiting sleep.

               LeTour's diary contains parallel columns of names: one headed 
               "People Who Are Left Handed," the other, "People Whose Eyes 
               Don't Match."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CÔTE BASQUE

               Midday. JOHN, wearing a black tweed jacket, tie, khaki slacks, 
               mails the Sacramento letter, enters CÔTE BASQUE, a hoity-
               toity 55th Street restaurant.

               Midmeal. ANN and LETOUR sit in a prominent booth; power moguls 
               confer quietly. A deferential WAITER brings fresh berries, 
               retrieves empty salmon plates.

                                     ANN
                         You have any money saved?

                                     LETOUR
                         There's some. Not much. A thousand 
                         or two. Maybe more -- I'm not sure.

                                     ANN
                         What do you do with your money?

               The CHEF stops by, asks if the meal was satisfactory. ANN 
               assures him it was, kisses his hand. The CHEF nods, gratified. 
               JOHN resumes the conversation:

                                     LETOUR
                         I don't know. It's not that much in 
                         the first place -- as you know.

                                     ANN
                              (counterpoint)
                         It's tax free --

                                     LETOUR
                         Rent, utilities, phone, tips, CDs -- 
                         what about your money?

                                     ANN
                         Kitty Ford once told me, "Ann, the 
                         only person I know that lives as 
                         well as you is my grandmother." All 
                         the money I've made, all the money 
                         I've spent -- it never adds up. This 
                         last two years cosmetics' been taking 
                         everything.

                                     LETOUR

               GENERAL HOSPITAL

               Afternoon. St. Luke's. LETOUR, wearing tweed jacket, walks 
               down the corridor, checks room numbers. A NURSE passes. He 
               stops at a room, pushes the door a crack, peeks inside, 
               quietly enters.

               Inside the hospital room, MRS. JOST, sixty-five, lies sedated, 
               attached to IV tubes and a respirator. Flowers wreathe the 
               bed.

               RANDI sleeps in a chair by the window.

               LETOUR looks from MRS. JOST to RANDI and back again: a vibrant 
               woman reduced to a shell. He soundlessly eases into a vacant 
               chair.

               His mind goes back.

               RANDI twists fitfully in her chair. A stuffed bear peeks 
               over family photos on the window sill.

               MARIANNE steps into the doorway, stops, frozen -- watching 
               the tableau: JOHN, RANDI, her mother. Her face is ravaged: 
               the death watch has taken its toll. LETOUR reaches his arm, 
               touches the hospital bed.

               MARIANNE tiptoes behind JOHN. He turns, stands.

                                     LETOUR
                              (soft)
                         I'm sorry. I...

               She puts her finger to her lips. He nods. She steps closer, 
               holds him politely. His cheek nestles in her neck.

               They turn toward the door, step into the corridor, walk arm 
               in arm as if supporting each other.

                                     LETOUR
                              (after a moment)
                         I always thought my father would die 
                         first. He would die, then my mother 
                         and I would reconcile. Just her and 
                         me. I hated him for living.

                                     MARIANNE
                         It's like a joke. It's not a real 
                         feeling. It's like a feeling of a 
                         feeling.

                         me popping in and out of the john 
                         getting loaded.

                         I miss you.

               They stop. She kisses him.

                                     MARIANNE
                         You tried to kill me. You took ten 
                         years of my life one way or another.
                              (he kisses her)
                         I couldn't hate my mom -- I was too 
                         busy hating you.

                         I thought I was just killing myself.

               She runs her hands under his shirt, up his back.

                                     LETOUR

                                     MARIANNE
                         What it felt like.

                         What this tasted like.

               He slips his hands under her blouse, caresses her breasts.

                                     LETOUR
                         I see you and my heart starts 
                         thumping.

                         John.

               They kiss deeper, bodies grinding. The painful present fades. 
               A NURSE approaches with WHEELCHAIR PATIENT. She tries to 
               pass one side of JOHN and MARIANNE, tries the other side, is 
               blocked again. The NURSE stops, stares at their soap opera.

               Sensing her glare, JOHN and MARIANNE, hands over and under 
               each other, stop, look to the NURSE: embarrassed -- yet 
               blissful.

                                     LETOUR
                         Excuse us.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LETOUR and MARIANNE are all over each other. The pain of the 
               moment, the pain of the past are subsumed by passion. Blind, 
               welcome sexuality.

               Naked, they kneel facing each other on the bed, faded bleeding 
               heart tattoo on his bicep:

                         Let's disappear.

               They smack their sweaty bodies, tumble yelping to the carpet, 
               kiss indiscriminately:

                                     LETOUR
                         Kiss, kiss, kiss.

                         Together.

               Later: night. They lie nude in a scramble of twisted sheets 
               and mattresses. Street lights cast horizontal shadows. LETOUR 
               crawls over, falls upon Marianne's breast. She wakes up, 
               looks at JOHN, looks out the window, returns to slow sad 
               reality.

               MARIANNE stands, pulls on her panties.

                                     LETOUR

               She dresses before responding:

                         This is the end. It was wonderful.

                         not see me, you will not call me 
                         again. I'm happy for you. I wish you 
                         the best. I'm leaving. I'm going 
                         back to the hospital. I shouldn't 
                         have left -- but I don't regret it. 
                         Please dress and leave as soon as

                         It's my fault.

               MARIANNE, clothes askew, exits.

                                     LETOUR
                         I love you.

               LETOUR is alone. He pulls his pants on. Looking for his socks, 
               he peruses Marianne's personal things. He examines her 
               cosmetics, her underclothes. He dabs her perfume on his cheek.

               Buttoning his shirt, he retrieves his beeper from suit jacket. 
               Activated, it disgorges messages. He checks his watch: 9:00 
               p.m.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Nine-thirty: Ann's apartment building. Trash stacked high.

               LETOUR presses the buzzer.

               LETOUR, exhausted, unfocused, enters Ann's apartment. ANN is 
               immediately upon him:

               AU BAR

               LeTour's sedan waits between limos.

               Inside, JOHN passes the MAÎTRE D', looks around: he's known 
               here. Au Bar, a restaurant/club open 9:00 p. m. to 4:00 a. 
               m., caters to the young, the rich, the European.

               He spots TIS with THOMAS, twenty-five, his handsome trainer, 
               and TWO MODELS at a second-floor table. They exchange nods.

               LETOUR scans the room: suspicion is second nature.

               A laughing man (GUIDONE) at the bar catches his eye. He seems 
               to blend: Italian, twenty-eight, silk suit, impeccable hair, 
               accent -- but something's not right. His black shoes have 
               rubber soles. LETOUR looks for a gun bulge, dirty hands. The 
               ITALIAN turns; LETOUR glimpses his face: too pale. The ITALIAN 
               averts his eyes. Glancing back, LETOUR walks up the stairs 
               to Tis' table.

                                     TIS
                         Tour, sit. Take a rest. LeTour, this 
                         is Gabri, Tasha -- you know Thomas. 
                         They're here for a show.

               The MODELS respond in respective accents. THOMAS extends his 
               hand. JOHN shakes, remains standing.

                                     LETOUR
                         Enchanté.
                              (to TIS)
                         How'd it turn out?

                                     TIS
                              (to GABRI)

                              (to LETOUR)
                         What?

               GABRI and TASHA buzz.

                         St. Luke's.

                                     TIS
                         No problem, but -- can you believe 
                         this? -- she's out of the hospital 
                         in one day, calls me up, wants to 
                         "get together." Some people are just 
                         born for losing. Want to go in back?

                                     LETOUR
                         Not now.

                                     TIS
                         Huh?

                                     LETOUR
                         Look at the bar. Black-haired guy, 
                         late twenties, brown suit, drinking 
                         tonic?
                              (TIS nods)
                         He's casing you. Not me, you. 
                         Undercover, whatever -- he's on you.

                                     TIS
                         You know him?

                                     LETOUR
                              (shakes head "no")
                         Just a feeling. You holding?

                                     TIS
                         No. Need help?

                                     LETOUR
                              ("no")
                         Leave a message. Robert or I will 
                         come by later.

                         Forget it. It wasn't for me anyway.

               THERE IS A DIRECTION

               The blue sedan drives west past Times Square, turns north on 
               Eighth Ave. A plastic wall of trash stretches toward the 
               river. Port Authority hustlers -- male, female -- cruise as 
               TRANSIT COPS whack an emaciated CRACKHEAD. JOHN, lit by neon, 
               lowers his power window.

               John's apartment. Night. He writes in his diary, drinks.

                                     LETOUR
                              (voice over)
                         I feel my life turning. All it needed 
                         was a direction. You drift from day 
                         to day, years go by. Suddenly there 
                         is a direction. What a strange thing 
                         to happen halfway through your life.

               He goes to the phone, dials. A voice answers:

                         Just a moment.

               A pre-recorded message comes on:

                                     HOTEL MESSAGE
                         "Welcome to the Paramount. Your party

                         -- please do so after the beep."

               LETOUR hangs up, carries the phone to the boombox. He dials 
               again, presses 'Record,' holds the receiver to the mike, 
               records the hotel message, hangs up.

               First light slants from the window. LETOUR lies clothed on 
               the futon, boombox by his ear. He presses "Play" and "Rewind," 
               running the tape over and over, listening, re-listening to 
               Marianne's voice: "Marianne Jost." "Marianne Jost." "Marianne 
               Jost.")

                                                                    CUT TO:

               unshaven in T-shirt and slacks, sets the phone on the desk 
               beside his open composition book. He pauses, dials.

                                     MEDICAL VOICE
                              (out of shot)
                         You're welcome.

               JOHN hangs up, paces, sits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DIRTY LAUNDRY

               Afternoon. Chelsea laundromat. Mothers and maids gossip, 
               sort clothes. Hispanic radio underscores the whirl of 
               machines.

               LETOUR, unshaven, shoves dirty clothes into a washer. He 
               counts out quarters, starts the machine.

               Heading toward a vacant chair, he spots a MAN out the window. 
               It takes a second to place the face: it's the "Italian" from 
               Au Bar in street clothes. He watches JOHN watching him.

               LETOUR walks outside, approaches GUIDONE on the sidewalk:

                                     LETOUR
                         Can I help you, officer?

                                     GUIDONE
                         What?

                                     LETOUR
                         I hope I haven't made a mistake. You 
                         are a cop, aren't you?

                                     GUIDONE
                         Yes.

                                     LETOUR
                         Could I see a badge?

               GUIDONE eyes LETOUR with disdain: the contempt of a cop for 
               a dealer, of youth for middle age.

                                     GUIDONE
                              (shows credentials)
                         Bill Guidone.

                                     LETOUR
                         What is it?

                                     GUIDONE
                         You think you're invisible, don't 
                         you? You think we don't know you, 
                         LeTour -- that's the name you use, 
                         right?

                                     LETOUR
                         My father's a partner in a powerful 
                         law firm. If you have anything in 
                         mind, do it by the book.

               GUIDONE elbow-stabs LETOUR, kicks his shin. Wincing, 
               retreating, JOHN staggers, regains his balance.

                                     GUIDONE
                              (in his face)
                         You? Who the fuck cares about you? I 
                         could grind you right here! -- maybe 
                         I will! -- and nobody would give a 
                         fuck! You're not worth the paperwork. 
                         I look like Narcotics? I'm Homicide -- 
                         I'm investigating the Park murder.

                                     LETOUR
                              (acquiescent)
                         I don't follow the news.

                                     GUIDONE
                         Downtown's interested how a Barnard 
                         honors student with fancy parents 
                         got a quarter of uncut coke on her 
                         when she was murdered. I mean, we 
                         just don't see this girl cruising 
                         Alphabet City trying to score. 
                         Somebody sold her, somebody upscale 
                         and classy -- you're classy, I hear -- 
                         and that somebody knows something we 
                         need to know.
                              (hand inside LeTour's 
                              shirt, pinching his 
                              tit)
                         Delivery boy!

                                     LETOUR
                         I wish I could help. I don't even 
                         know who's president.

                                     GUIDONE
                         Let me put it this way. Here's my 
                         card
                              (hands card)
                         Ask around, take a week or so. Call 
                         me. Tell me something I don't know. 
                         Either that, leave town, or get your 
                         ass busted day in, day out.

               LETOUR examines the card.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FUNERAL HOME

               Evening. LETOUR, shaven, in black tweed jacket, white shirt, 
               black tie, crosses Amsterdam Avenue, enters Plaza Memorial 
               Chapel.

               Inside funeral home, JOHN checks the letterboard for Mrs. 
               Jost's name. An arrow directs him.

               Nondenominational muzak. Senior citizens whisper off-screen.

               Walking, he sees MARIANNE, dressed in black. She sees him, 
               turns to him; her face hollow, desperate:

                                     MARIANNE
                         Get out.

                                     LETOUR
                         Marianne...

                                     MARIANNE
                              (emotion rising)
                         Every time you come into my life 
                         something terrible happens. I thought 
                         I was rid of you. How'd you get here? 
                         I don't want you here! I don't want 
                         you around me, I don't want you around 
                         my mother! Damn you!

                                     LETOUR
                         Marianne...

                                     MARIANNE
                              (wild)
                         Get out!

               A PLAZA MEMORIAL EMPLOYEE approaches. RANDI, in black, 
               intervenes, pulls JOHN toward the door. MARIANNE YELLS from 
               behind: "Out!" Outside, they stop midsidewalk.

                                     LETOUR
                         I didn't...

                                     RANDI
                         I'm sorry. That's the way it is. You 
                         shouldn't have come. Marianne has 
                         been up all night, crying and crying. 
                         She wasn't there when Mother passed -- 
                         died -- she blames herself. It 
                         wouldn't have made any difference. 
                         She just slipped away. Marianne's -- 
                         I'm worried --

               A CRACKHEAD strides past trash ramparts, cursing, demanding 
               money: "Fuck white devil, fucking the black, give the fucking 
               money, white fuck...," etc.

                                     LETOUR
                         It's...

                                     RANDI
                         Don't try.

                                     LETOUR
                         How are you?

                                     RANDI
                         Me?

                                     LETOUR
                         Yes, you. I can't think of anything, 
                         but if there was anything I could 
                         do...

                                     RANDI
                         Thanks. I'm okay -- I guess. I mean, 
                         we've been expecting it. It'll hit 
                         me later.

                                     LETOUR
                         I saw her.

                                     RANDI
                         Who?

                                     LETOUR
                         Your mother. I came in the room. You 
                         were sleeping. I just watched.

                                     RANDI
                         Oh.
                              (beat)
                         I'd better get back. Marianne's 
                         probably flipping out.

               She re-enters the funeral chapel.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ON A ROLL

               Eight p.m. LETOUR, direct from Plaza Memorial, enters Ann's 
               apartment. ANN, coiffured and made up, gestures to take-out 
               tins:

                         called. He said before ten. He said 
                         you were right.

                         An undercover cop. Not a narc. The 
                         Park murder. Jealous was straight on 
                         that -- you hear anything?

                                     ROBERT
                         Remember the time that cop called 
                         here? Wanted to know if we had "nose 
                         candy"?
                              (laughs)
                         Ann says, "John Candy?" "John Candy?"

               ANN looks at JOHN, approaches:

               The kitchen phone rings. A voice follows the pre-recorded 
               message:

               INTERVENTION

               Eddie's high-rise apartment. EDDIE is worse, if anything. 
               He's been scoring on the street: broken pipes and vials crunch 
               underfoot.

               EDDIE and LETOUR argue ("Fuck you!" "Fuck you!"). EDDIE spits, 
               pushes TOUR, JOHN pushes back. Eddie's feet tangle. He trips, 
               FALLS. A bottle SMASHES.

               JOHN goes to the phone, checks Eddie's directory, dials.

                                     EDDIE
                              (on floor)
                         You gotta get permission? Check with 
                         Mama?

                                     LETOUR
                         I'm calling your brother.

                                     EDDIE
                         Huh?

                                     LETOUR
                         Yeah, the lawyer in Bronxville. I'm 
                         gonna ask him to come over.
                              (EDDIE protests)
                         You've told me so much about him.

                                     EDDIE
                              (panicked)
                         No, don't. Please, I'll give you 
                         money, anything. He doesn't 
                         understand. Whose side are you on?

                                     LETOUR
                              (on phone)
                         Is this Martin Jeer?
                              (beat)
                         Thank you.

               EDDIE, woozy, tries to stand.

                                     EDDIE
                         I shoulda never called.

                                     LETOUR
                              (to EDDIE)
                         I recommend Hazelden. It has the 
                         best all-around program.
                              (on phone)
                         Martin Jeer?
                              (beat)
                         I'm here with your brother Ed.
                              (beat)
                         Yeah, in the city. I'm afraid there's 
                         a medical emergency. You're going to 
                         have to come.

               EDDIE lurches toward LETOUR. JOHN -- flash of anger -- 
               bootkicks him in the head! Eddie's cheek hits the carpet.

                                     LETOUR
                              (on phone)
                         He'll be here.

               JOHN, cooling down, measures his breaths. A spring can only 
               be wound so tight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LEXINGTON AVENUE

               LETOUR walks from his sedan around the corner to the Lexington 
               Avenue entrance to Grace Towers, a pre-war apartment building. 
               In the lobby, he gives his name to the SECURITY GUARD, is 
               directed to the express elevator.

               He exits on the thirtieth floor; footsteps muted by thick 
               carpet.

               Victorian prints on dark blue walls. He looks about, 
               approaches a door, presses the buzzer.

               THOMAS opens the door; JOHN enters Tis' opulent apartment.

               Salle and Clemente hang on the walls; New York twinkles 
               outside panoramic windows. A pipe and syringe lie atop art 
               books. TIS, in jogging sweats, comes from the bedroom to 
               greet him.

                                     TIS
                         Tour, just in time. We were out. 
                         Nineteen, right?

                                     LETOUR
                         Thirty-eight hundred -- got any 
                         hundreds?

                                     TIS
                         Some, not the whole thing.
                              (to THOMAS)
                         You got hundreds?

                                     THOMAS
                         No.

               LETOUR hands him a plastic bag of gram envelopes. TIS opens 
               a packet, pours the contents on the coffee table.

                                     TIS
                         I like that about Ann. Always takes 
                         the time to grind it. If you do it, 
                         do it right.

               JOHN hears footsteps, turns to see MARIANNE stumble out of 
               the bedroom! She looks terrible: shoeless, blouse out, hair 
               undone, bruise on her forehead -- perhaps she fell against 
               something -- hands trembling.

                                     TIS
                              (to MARIANNE)
                         Looks like you could use some help.
                              (MARIANNE looks up, 
                              sees JOHN, goes pale)
                         Mari, this is Tour. You got any 
                         hundreds?

               JOHN stares speechless: the girl who won't talk to him because 
               he's a dealer. MARIANNE bolts back into the bedroom, SLAMS 
               the door!

                                     TIS
                         Not the talkative type. Haven't seen 
                         her in years. You know her, don't 
                         you?
                              (no answer. TIS counts 
                              the money, offers 
                              it. LETOUR is frozen)
                         Why they call me? What a nightmare.
                              (extending money)
                         You want it or not?

                                     LETOUR
                              (vacant)
                         Yeah.

               LETOUR pockets the cash. TIS, his arm on John's elbow, "walks" 
               him to the door:

                                     TIS
                         See you later.

               TIS nudges JOHN to the corridor, closes the door behind him. 
               JOHN looks toward the elevator; TIS, behind the door, calls 
               "Marianne!"

               Time cut: LETOUR stands in the elevator, red floor numbers 
               flashing past, blank eyes mirrored in dark glass.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FALL FROM GRACE

               JOHN exits Grace Towers, walks past a limo toward Lexington 
               Avenue. Rounding the corner, he sees his blue sedan. He looks 
               at the cash, repockets it. He continues slowly, each step a 
               separate task.

               LETOUR reaches for the door handle. A scream pierces traffic 
               noise. A car screeches, another. Voices call out.

               LETOUR steps back, listens. He retraces his steps, turns 
               onto Lexington Avenue. The SECURITY GUARD, walkie-talkie in 
               hand, clusters on the sidewalk with the limo driver, two 
               pedestrians. A cabbie jumps from his taxi, joins the confusion 
               ("My God!"). A siren approaches. John's beeper goes off.

               Drawing closer, LETOUR sees the partial bloodied shape of a 
               broken body on the sidewalk: he recognizes Marianne's skirt. 
               A squad car brakes with a screech. TWO COPS converge, climb 
               over trash, clear the crime scene:

                                     FEMALE COP
                         Get back!

                                     MALE COP
                         Who saw it? What happened?
                              (the FEMALE COP bends 
                              over Marianne's body)
                         EMS is on the way.

                                     FEMALE COP
                         Too late --

               A second squad car pulls up. JOHN turns away, walks around 
               the corner.

               LETOUR opens the car door, closes it, sits inside. A wailing 
               ambulance flashes past, speeds up Central Park West.

               LETOUR doesn't react. Beeper re-beeps; he disconnects the 
               battery.

               The driver, CARLOS, twenty-five, Hispanic, shirt starched, 
               turns, looks, thinks, says:

                                     CARLOS
                         Where to?

                                     LETOUR
                         What?

                                     CARLOS
                         Where to, sir? Where are we going?

                                     LETOUR
                         Nowhere just now. Wait.

                                     CARLOS
                              (after a moment)
                         You want me to wait here?

                                     LETOUR
                         Yes.

               Pause. More police cars. The EMS siren starts up; the 
               ambulance speeds downtown past LeTour's sedan. No reaction. 
               CARLOS turns off the engine.

                                     LETOUR
                         Downtown.

                                     CARLOS
                         Yes.

               CARLOS starts the car, pulls into traffic.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               John's apartment. Late night. LETOUR, barefoot, T-shirt, 
               slacks, stands flat against the wall.

               WINS broadcasts twenty-four hour news on the boombox. ("Give

                         from a posh Grace Towers apartment

                         The incident happened about ten p.m. 
                         According to the sources on the scene 
                         there was no one else in the posh

               Teresa's door. No answer. Knocks again. Again.

               Noises from inside. A sleepy voice:

                                     TERESA
                              (out of shot)
                         Who is it?

                                     LETOUR
                         John. John LeTour. Can I see you?

                                     TERESA
                              (out of shot)
                         What time is it?

                                     LETOUR
                         It's important, Teresa.

                                     TERESA
                              (out of shot)
                         Call. Make an appointment.

                                     LETOUR
                         Open the door. You're awake anyway.
                              (no answer)
                         Teresa.

               TERESA, wearing oriental bathrobe, unlatches the door. JOHN 
               enters, turns to her. The door closes.

                                     LETOUR
                         Read me. What do you see?

                                     TERESA
                         Do I know you?

                                     LETOUR
                         We had a session last week. What do 
                         you see?

                                     TERESA
                              (remembering name)
                         John?

                                     LETOUR
                         Yes. Look at me.

               TERESA takes a moment to concentrate.

                                     TERESA
                         Step back.
                              (he does)
                         Again.
                              (he does)
                         Death.

                                     LETOUR
                         Someone I knew died tonight.

                                     TERESA
                         This was not an accident. This person 
                         was murdered.

                                     LETOUR
                         Am I in danger?

                                     TERESA
                              (beat)
                         There is danger around you. It's 
                         very close. I'm sleepy.

                                     LETOUR
                         What should I do?

                                     TERESA
                         I can't see it.

                                     LETOUR
                         Please.
                              (she shrugs)
                         Am I lucky?

                                     TERESA
                         Yes. Don't be afraid. Go home.

               TERESA shuffles toward her bedroom -- the "reading" is over.

                                     LETOUR
                         What do I owe you?

                                     TERESA
                         Nothing. Forget it. Let me sleep.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SNITCH

               Mid-morning. LETOUR, still awake, walks past towering Chelsea 
               trash.

               He passes a newsstand. Tabloids feature yearbook photo of 
               MARIANNE; the headline: "Fall from Grace."

               LETOUR walks to a pay phone, takes out Guidone's card, inserts 
               a quarter, dials.

                                     POLICE SWITCHBOARD
                              (out of shot)
                         Ninth Precinct.

                                     LETOUR
                         Bill Guidone, please. Homicide.

                                     POLICE SWITCHBOARD
                              (out of shot)
                         Hold on.

               JOHN, suspicious, looks around. GUIDONE speaks:

                                     GUIDONE
                              (out of shot)
                         Guidone.

                                     LETOUR
                         This is John LeTour. Remember me?

                                     GUIDONE
                              (out of shot)
                         Laundromat. Your father's got 
                         connections.

                                     LETOUR
                         You said I should ask around, tell 
                         you something you didn't know.

                                     GUIDONE
                              (out of shot)
                         I thought you'd call.

                                     LETOUR
                         It ain't much, but it's something.

                                     GUIDONE
                              (out of shot)
                         Go on.

                                     LETOUR
                         A girl died last night. Lexington 
                         Ave.

                                     GUIDONE
                              (out of shot)
                         The jumper. Druggie.

                                     LETOUR
                         The news said she was alone in the 
                         apartment when she went out -- she 
                         wasn't. It's a cover-up. There was 
                         someone else.

                                     GUIDONE
                              (out of shot)
                         Who?

                                     LETOUR
                         Who lives in the apartment?

                                     GUIDONE
                              (out of shot)
                         You there?

                                     LETOUR
                         That's all I know. You asked me to 
                         tell you something. I told you 
                         something.

               Hangs up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A LITTLE SLEEP

               Noon. LETOUR enters a West Village apartment building.

               He presses an intercom button. Robert's voice answers:

                                     ROBERT
                              (out of shot)
                         Who is it?

                                     LETOUR
                         Jack. Let me in.

               The door buzzes.

               ROBERT opens the door to his overdecorated apartment. JOHN 
               looks around. TONY, Robert's younger, unattractive lover, 
               sips coffee at the table.

                                     ROBERT
                         Where have you been? We were worried.

                                     LETOUR
                         I need some sleep -- not much. I 
                         don't want to go home just yet. A 
                         little sleep first. Can I crash here? 
                         Nice place.

                                     ROBERT
                         It's hideous. I did it years ago. 
                         I've got to throw everything out. 
                         You haven't been here?
                              (noticing TONY)
                         Oh, Jack, this is Tony. I told you 
                         about him. You should talk. He's the 
                         lapidopterist -- gems.

                                     TONY
                              (corrects him)
                         Lapidarian.

                                     ROBERT
                         Same thing.

                                     LETOUR
                         Can I?

                                     ROBERT
                         Sure.

                                     LETOUR
                         What do you know about Tis? What's 
                         his relationship to Ann?

                                     ROBERT
                         They go way back -- before me. Did 
                         you cross him?

                                     LETOUR
                         No.

                                     ROBERT
                         Don't. He's Ann's Ecstasy connection. 
                         She needs that score. What happened?

                                     LETOUR
                         Nothing.

                                     ROBERT
                         Don't mess with him.

                                     LETOUR
                         Is he dangerous?

                                     ROBERT
                         Everybody's dangerous. We heard what 
                         you did to Eddie. Ann thought it was 
                         great. She was afraid that was why 
                         you didn't come back.

                                     LETOUR
                         It was something else. Tell me if 
                         you hear anything.

                                     ROBERT
                         About what?

                                     LETOUR
                         Tis.

                                     ROBERT
                         Tis who? Ann says you want a chart 
                         done.
                              (beat)
                         What's wrong?

                                     LETOUR
                              (internal)
                         Ah...

                                     ROBERT
                              (sympathetic)
                         You down?

                                     LETOUR
                              (nods)
                         Yeah...
                              (culling thoughts)
                         You ever think about it?

                                     ROBERT
                         What?

                                     LETOUR
                         That it'd be like this -- like, your 
                         life, you... that it would turn out 
                         this way? --

                                     ROBERT
                         Compared to what? My thinking this 
                         or that is going to make any 
                         difference? There's a plan unfolding. 
                         "Will my plane crash?" "Does life 
                         have meaning?" -- why ask me? 
                         Thinking's a fear of living, negative 
                         living; living's something else. 
                         You're afraid. Let the plan unfold. 
                         Stop. Stop, live one day -- one day --

               Words blur to jargon. LETOUR cuts in:

                                     LETOUR
                         -- Robert --

                                     ROBERT
                         -- day at a time.

                                     LETOUR
                              (touches ROBERT)
                         You've lost your fucking brain.

                              (laughs)
                         I'm a drug dealer.

                                     LETOUR
                         Got a tub?

                                     ROBERT
                              (gestures)
                         Yeah.

                                     LETOUR
                         Great.

               Turns to bathroom.

                                     ROBERT
                         There's a plastic bottle of bath oil 
                         in the cabinet. Yellow. Use it -- 
                         tell me what you think. It's a new 
                         formula.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               JUMP-OFFS

               Six p.m. LETOUR, shaved and bathed, rides a cab uptown, past 
               Harlem, past 158th Street. He motions to the DRIVER; the 
               taxi stops at a blue door between retail stores begging for 
               renovation. TEENAGE LATINOS hang out. LETOUR gives the CABBIE 
               a twenty. LETOUR walks to the blue door; the YOUTHS stop, 
               watch. He knocks on the door. A PUERTO RICAN DOORMAN in white 
               leather pants and a heart-shaped diamond ring opens the door, 
               looks him over. JOHN reaches into his pouch, removes a gram 
               envelope, hands it to him. The DOORMAN takes a taste, buzzes 
               him through a door hand-lettered "Jump-Offs."

               Inside Jump-Offs, a cocaine "spot," every eye turns to JOHN: 
               the only Anglo in a Hispanic after-hours club. Tough young 
               faces, each with a style and two inches of attitude. Willie 
               Colon plays on the jukebox.

               Searching, LETOUR recognizes a face, walks over:

                                     LETOUR
                         Manny.
                              (MANUEL, thirtyish, 
                              Puerto Rican, looks 
                              closer, trying to 
                              place LETOUR)

                                     LETOUR
                         C-C.

                                     LETOUR
                         How's product?

                                     LETOUR
                         I got a problem. I need a piece.

                                     MANUEL
                         Piece? Piece of what? Piece of candy?

                                     LETOUR
                         A gun.

                                     MANUEL
                         When?

                                     LETOUR
                         Now. Anything.
                              (MANUEL is silent)
                         Am I speaking too fast?

                                     MANUEL
                         How much you spend?

                                     LETOUR
                         The rate. What you got?

               MANUEL calls over a TEENAGE DOMINICAN, explains the situation 
               in Spanish. The DOMINICAN replies; MANUEL turns back to JOHN:

                                     MANUEL
                         He's got a 64 Smith-son. Detective 
                         Special. Nobody wants 'em. Fresh 
                         from a cop.

                                     LETOUR
                         How much?

                                     MANUEL
                              (consults DOMINICAN)
                         Four -- including me.

                                     LETOUR
                         You're fucking me.

                                     MANUEL
                              ("so what?")
                         Street price.

                                     LETOUR
                         Where is it?

                                     MANUEL
                         Sigame.

               They lead him to an even darker back room. The DOMINICAN 
               retrieves an automatic pistol from a trash pail, hands it to 
               MANUEL. JOHN counts cash from Tis' roll; MANNY hefts the 
               piece.

                                     MANUEL
                         The hundreds -- Franklins.

               Bills and guns exchanged.

                                     LETOUR
                         How do you use this?

                                     MANUEL
                         Automatic.

                                     LETOUR
                         I don't have much use for a gun. 
                         Never used one like this.

                                     MANUEL
                              (translates for 
                              DOMINICAN)
                         Cono!

               The DOMINICAN laughs; LETOUR takes his measure.

                                     LETOUR
                              (businesslike)
                         What do you do?

                                     MANUEL
                         Simple. You put the bullets in --
                              (inserts cartridge)
                         you point it at the bad guys, pull 
                         the trigger and they fall down!

               MANNY repeats this for the DOMINICAN ["bang, bang!"]; they 
               laugh again. LETOUR eases the .38 into his crotch. MANNY 
               turns, exchanges Latin hug:

                                     MANUEL
                         Vaya con Dios.

                                     LETOUR
                         -- Dios.

               JOHN exits, works his way through the club.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OUT WITH THE OLD

               John's apartment. Seven p.m. LETOUR, sweating, bareback, 
               tucks the .38 under his futon.

               He takes a bottle of cologne from the bathroom, pours it 
               over his hair, face, and torso, rubs it in.

               Licking his finger, he removes Marianne's gold and onyx ring 
               with a tug. His finger stings. He opens a window, throws the 
               ring full force into the junk-strewn courtyard. He shakes 
               his torso; cologne glistens.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               JOHN AND RANDI

               Interior, Plaza Memorial Chapel. LETOUR enters the "viewing 
               room," motions to RANDI. She follows him.

               They slip into a door, enter the embalming room: stainless 
               steel table surrounded by surgical cabinets.

               They embrace, disengage. JOHN looks: Randi's exhausted face 
               mirrors his.

                                     LETOUR
                         Have you been to the police station?

                                     RANDI
                              (nods)
                         She was back on drugs. Really back. 
                         They're gonna bring her here too. My 
                         God.
                              (he comforts her)
                         I thought she was playing for 
                         attention.

                                     LETOUR
                         I didn't know.

                                     RANDI
                         You're not to blame. Don't blame 
                         yourself. You weren't responsible. 
                         She was always -- she loved you.

                                     LETOUR
                              (wipes tear from her 
                              cheek)
                         She loved you. You were what she 
                         wanted to be.

                                     RANDI
                         She scared me.

               JOHN pulls a Polaroid from his pocket.

                                     LETOUR
                         Look. Do you recognize anyone?

               The picture features ANN and TIS: side by side at a dinner 
               party.

                                     RANDI
                         Tis.

                                     LETOUR
                         You know him?

                                     RANDI
                         His father's a lawyer. Did some tax 
                         things for Mom. He was at the 
                         hospital. What's that smell?

                                     LETOUR
                         It's me. Cologne. I'm a sucker for 
                         that cheap airplane stuff. Did 
                         Marianne mention him yesterday?

                                     RANDI
                              ("no")
                         It was his apartment. What are you 
                         thinking?

                                     LETOUR
                         I don't know.

                                     RANDI
                         She jumped.
                              (LETOUR hangs on every 
                              word)
                         You loved her, but she -- this sounds 
                         terrible but it's true -- she was... 
                         she ruined everything... bad luck.

                                     LETOUR
                              (heard enough)
                         When's the funeral -- your mother's?

                                     RANDI
                         Tomorrow. Will you come?

                                     LETOUR
                              (vague)
                         Well, I got this thing to do. It's -- 
                         I don't know if I can get away.

                                     RANDI
                         Try? For me.

                                     LETOUR
                         I'll try.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               the wheel, anonymous. Outside, SANITATION WORKERS toss sacks 
               of trash into garbage trucks: the strike is over.

                         You know, when we first started out 
                         of the place on Greene Street. Before 
                         deliveries, when you were still using. 
                         It was open house every night but 
                         Sunday. We had everything: uppers, 
                         downers, meth, six kinds of hash, 
                         all in that trousseau, remember? You 
                         could get in for a gram, stay all 
                         night -- everybody, music people, 
                         movies, Wall Street, fashion -- even 
                         politics. I think like five marriages 
                         came out of those parties, babies --

                         Oh. Okay.

               The sedan continues south. It turns, stops in front of John's 
               Chelsea apartment building.

               JOHN hops out, goes in.

               Inside John's apartment he -- a man possessed -- pulls his 
               black tweed from the closet, throws it on the futon. He rolls 
               up his shirt, reaches under the futon, removes the .38.

               He straps the gun to his back, wraps duct tape around his 
               chest, end to end over the .38. He tucks in his shirt, puts 
               on the jacket, checks the mirror to see if the gun shows: it 
               doesn't. A pause to appreciate.

               LETOUR closes his diary, throws it out the window: a trifle. 
               He slaps cologne on his cheeks -- annointing; heads toward 
               the door.

               Outside, LETOUR emerges, walks quickly to the car, plops 
               beside ANN. The sedan drives off. Back seat:

                         Okay.

                         Tis there?

                         Twelve-oh-four.

               They go to the elevators, wait with CHATTY CARD COLLECTORS 
               [Pete Rose this, Pete Rose that].

               Twelfth floor. ANN and JOHN step out of the elevator, look 
               for 1204.

               LETOUR, a step behind, is all eyes, all ears.

               ANN checks the number, rings the bell.

               THOMAS lets them in the standard issue suite, locks the door.

               LETOUR was right: it's a set-up. THOMAS and a TEENAGE CUBAN 
               stand either side of them, waistbands conspicuously bulging. 
               No TIS. JOHN turns to ANN:

                                     LETOUR
                              (Jesus-to-Judas)
                         Ann.

               ANN's confused, then furious: she had no part in the "set-
               up." In fact, she doesn't even know it's a set-up.

               Bursting rage, she turns on THOMAS, YELLS:

                                     ANN
                         I told you greasy fucks I don't deal 
                         with guns! I see guns, I walk! How 
                         dare you?

               She slaps THOMAS, pulls the 9mm from his waistband, throws 
               it to the carpet.

               The CUBAN watches bewildered, gun drawn, awaiting 
               instructions. Now ANN's on him:

                                     ANN
                         And you, beaner, whoever the fuck 
                         you are, kiss my fat ass!
                              (she spits on his 
                              shirt, knees him in 
                              the crotch, yanks 
                              his gun, throws it 
                              beside the gut-
                              clutching CUBAN. She 
                              crosses the room, 
                              YELLING:)
                         That's it! TIS! Shitball! I know 
                         you're fucking there! Let this be a 
                         lesson! You wanna deal, you gonna 
                         apologize for this!

                         Let's go.

               THOMAS and the CUBAN TEEN retrieve their guns; ANN unlocks 
               the door.

                                     THOMAS
                              (pointing gun)
                         Hold it! Stop right there.

               She turns defiantly. TIS enters from bedroom:

                                     TIS
                              (to THOMAS)
                         No!
                              (to ANN)
                         Sorry about the guns. My fuck-up. I 
                         was just trying to make a point -- I 
                         apologize.

               TIS looks to THOMAS and the CUBAN: they lower their weapons. 
               He only means to threaten LETOUR.

                                     TIS
                              (about THOMAS and 
                              CUBAN)

                         We'll make the deal tomorrow -- same 
                         terms. Ann. Sorry. Go on, leave, 
                         you're upset. I just need to talk to 
                         Tour a second. About a police matter.
                              (to LETOUR)
                         Right?

                              (to ANN)
                         Go on.

               She hesitates.

                                     TIS
                         Tour and I need to get our stories 
                         straight. Somebody's talking to the 
                         police. The guns were for emphasis, 
                         to make a point, dumb --

               ANN gets it. Fear hits:

                              (a command)
                         Thomas.

               THOMAS fixes his gun on ANN.

                                     TIS
                              (to ANN)

                         I had nothing to do with Marianne -- 
                         she jumped: she was there, then she 
                         was gone.
                              (nods ANN to leave)
                         Nothing will happen to Tour.

               ANN computes, bolts out, flees, SCREAMING at the top of her 
               lungs:

                                     ANN
                              (out of shot)
                         Fire! Fire! Fire!

               The fire bell rings.

               THOMAS, TIS, and the CUBAN stare dumbfounded.

               LETOUR reaches behind his shirt in the confusion, yanks out 
               the .38 with a painful rip, turning, fires point-blank into 
               the Cuban's chest. BLAM! Shirt fabric flares, flies: the 
               CUBAN falls with blank expression.

               THOMAS, off guard, wheels and fires wildly at LETOUR.

               JOHN fires back. Both are hit. TIS ducks into the bedroom.

               THOMAS and LETOUR fire again, again -- hitting, missing. A 
               bullet hits its mark: THOMAS, frozen, grabs his blood-spurting 
               throat, slumps to floor.

               LETOUR bleeds from the stomach and shoulder. His shirt soaks 
               red; he struggles to stand. CUBAN and THOMAS -- both dead. 
               LETOUR checks the .38: five rounds fired -- one left.

               LETOUR staggers into the bedroom, finds TIS frantically 
               searching an open suitcase. Off-screen VOICES under the fire 
               bell.

                                     TIS
                              (desperate)
                         I didn't --

               LETOUR steps to TIS, aims, shoots him barrel to forehead. 
               Exit debris hits the wall. He is dead.

               Off-screen screams of guests are countered by commands from 
               hotel security: "Get down!" "Get back!" Fire horns and sirens 
               reverb from the street.

               LETOUR, losing consciousness, sits bedside. Gun slips from 
               his hand.

               Deflating, he drifts back-first to the bedspread. Blood 
               spreads. His eyes are open.

               POLICE VOICES approach.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EVERY GRAIN OF SAND

               Prison waiting area. ANN, wearing a wool suit, waits among 
               black/Hispanic FRIENDS and RELATIVES. The first scene without 
               LETOUR: she sits quietly. A CORRECTIONS OFFICER instructs 
               the visitors to proceed.

               ANN walks through a concrete corridor, finds the visiting 
               area.

               LETOUR, in prison fatigues, sits at a table. He sees her, 
               smiles.

               ANN sits down. This is not her first visit.

                                     LETOUR
