          TITLE CARD
          
          A narration accompanies this passage: "The events depicted
          herein were believed have taken place in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.
          All manner of record as they might pertain to these events
          have been seized by the Department of Justice"
          
          INT. VAN -- NIGHT
          
          Wall-to-wall surveillance set-up. Two FBI AGENTS: DONALD
          CARRUTHERS 30's and RICHARD MESSNER 30's, man the post,
          staring at video monitors. Both hold telephoto images; shaky,
          long lens shots of a mansion some distance away. Messner
          tacks photographs to a corkboard on the van wall. One is
          labeled "Subject SIDNEY K. SERNA: UNDERBOSS/Sparazza Family."
          
          The other is labeled "Subject VICTOR "BABY BUZZ" PADICHE
          LIEUTENANT/Sparazza Family." Voices begin emitting over the
          van's speakers.
          
                                   SERNA (V.O.)
                       Buzzy...Buzz...?
          
                                     PADICHE (V.O.)
                       Yeah...Sid?
          
                                   SERNA (V.O.)
                       You got clicks, anything?
          
                                   PADICHE (V.O.)
                       Nah, nuthin' on my end--
          
                                   SERNA (V.O.)
                       --Okay...hang on, I gotta move--
          
          Messner rides a digital console, tweaks frequency.
          
                                   MESSNER
                           (keying mic)
                       Zoom and pan please.   Stay tight.
          
          ON THE MONITORS: The image pans, follows a figure moving
          behind the mansion's windows, entering a back bedroom.
          
                                   SERNA (V.O.)
                       Alright, now Buzzy-- this is, this
                       is it, here, okay, so listen to me
                       careful and wait till I'm finished
                       'cuz we got no room for slop.
          
                                     PADICHE (V.O.)
                       I'm here.
          
          Messner adjusts the record level, V-U meters spike, modulate.
          The figure on the monitors paces the room. WE SEE it's Serna.
          
                                                   2.
          
                      SERNA (V.O.)
          Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just
          gotta outta there--
          
                      PADICHE (V.O.)
          --he's doing it then, huh--
          
                      SERNA (V.O.)
          --yeah, now lemme finish, I was
          eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay
          this thing out, since the information
          might be a little loose--
          
                      PADICHE (V.O.)
          --okay, g'head--
          
                      SERNA
          So what I heard downstairs there is
          that they got a guy, some Swede,
          real badass, supposedly a "specialist"
          and they're bringing him over. Now
          he ain't coming cheap-- so, I'm
          thinkin' we jump, do this in the
          next day or so, get to Israel before
          the Swede can, we got chits, y'see?
          We're in a power position. Grab
          him, ransom him back, pick up that
          nut, we're that much closer to having
          our own thing.
          
                      PADICH (V.O.)
          --I see that, yeah, s'smart move,
          for us anyway.
          
                      SERNA (V.O.)
          Trust me, we keep our mouths shut,
          go about our thing, play the part,
          nobody suspects us.
              (feedback distorts)
          The old man's on the fade Buzzy,
          fuck him, y'know? And that hurts, I
          don't like saying that, but hey, our
          livelihood, our lifeboat, y'get?
          
                      PADICHE
          No question, no, you're right. We
          gotta do what's good for us now.
          
                      SERNA (V.O.)
          Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
          
                      PADICHE (V.O.)
          Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think
          they'll kick ransom for that little
          prick, assuming we get to'm.
          
                                                                     3.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline,
                    yet and before I get to it, one more
                    thing I heard, little curious, should
                    probably bring it up...Primo wants
                    Israel's heart. The actual thing,
                    the organ.
          
          Pause. Feedback. The agents trade looks. Carruthers grabs
          a cellphone, dials, patches a feed for the party on the other
          end to hear.
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    ...Jesus...what for?
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    --who can say. He's off his onion,
                    y'know, he's old school Sicilian,
                    this is how they hate.
          
                                PADICHE   (V.O.)
                    Wow.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm
                    back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out
                    m'self, no extra charge. My thing
                    is, we crew up, let's not fuck
                    around, someone's cousin, some Zip
                    off the boat from Naples, let's get
                    pros, people who know how to behave.
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm
                    thinking might be good for this.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Chances are, they're gonna get into
                    some shit too, hafta put people down.
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    That's not a problem. Are we goin'
                    outta pocket ourselves?
          
                                SERNA
                    Yeah, I can front this.
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    Well just so I got a quote in my
                    head. What's the rate for the Swede?
          
                                SERNA
                    That's the punchline, y'ready?
          
                                PADICHE
                    Shoot.

                                 PADICHE (V.O.)
                    No shit.

          Neon-framed doors fly open as a slicked-back chump with a
          store-bought tan strides out onto the strip, swinging underage
          bar-bait on each arm. He's all strut and punk swagger,
          grinning like a geek who just struck gold.

                    Buddy Israel, nicknamed "Aces" Born
                    a bastard, mom Laverne chased the
                    pipe dream from a Dairy Queen in
                    Kansas City to the Vegas stage. Two
                    months after stepping off a Greyhound,
                    she gets knocked up by some hood.

          INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT (PAST)
          
          A row of chorus girls, gilded like gold-flaked flamingos,
          rubbing coca-butter on bare midriffs. THE CAMERA FINDS
          Buddy's mother LAVERNE, prominent bulge, seriously pregnant,
          she's arguing with her employers, trying to suck in her belly,
          yelling "bullshit, you just have to light it right..."
          
                                DUPREE (V.O.)
                    Biological abandons her and the
                    showgirl thing goes sideways so she
                    winds up working as a magician's
                    assistant to make extra cash.

          Second rate dive bar. Laverne Israel assists a pompadour-
          maned MAGICIAN on stage. In the lounge, sitting on a
          stripper's lap, a young Buddy plays with a deck of cards.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:

          Bamboo-style ceiling fans circulate cigar smoke and shitty
          attitudes. At a billiard table in the back: JACK DUPREE,
          40's, third generation Bail Bondsman, talks with HOLLIS
          ELMORE, 30's and "PISTOL" PETE DEEKS, 30's, ex-Vegas vice
          cops. As Dupree speaks, WE SEE the scenes behind the story:

                     ...And young Buddy learns everything
                     about cards from this Mandrake

                     gambler and got caught dealing bottom-
                     deck at a mob-owned poker parlor.
                         (beat)

                     of hand shit onto Aces and the kid
                     is sick with it...By the age of twelve
                     Buddy Israel is positively prodigal
                     with a deck of cards. By sixteen,

                    keeping company with major muscle.
                    And it goes to his head in a big way

          approval to approach...Sparazza, turning, seeing the man,
          summoning him over with a feeble finger wag. The man reaches

          BUDDY ISRAEL, bathrobe, boxers, bags under his eyes. He
          absently shuffles cards, pulling aces as if by touch,
          telepathy. He gazes out at the snow-packed peaks. Behind
          him; post-bacchanalia...the ugly morning after. Prostitutes,
          passed out cold in a tangle of crotchless panties and stiletto

          His bathrobe brushes over, terrycloth catching one of the
          hooker's wigs, tugging it free. Israel looks down, zooming
          in on her scalp, sees dandruff and scars, gags disgust and
          disdain. He steps, the wigs pulls. He stops and slips the
          bathrobe off, letting it fall rather than pull her wig the
          rest of the way off and ruin what illusion remains.
          
          He shuffles, begins dropping Aces on their bodies like dead
          enemy soldiers. One of his bodyguards enters; a bulging,

                    Now, the money question...To whom
                    does that stain belong?
          
          Hugo, gameface falling apart...Israel prods him.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    C'mon, somebody was banging one of
                    these skanks, sans rubber--
                        (beat, assesses girls)
                    -which is terrifying in its own right-
                    pulled out, let 'er rip and ruined
                    the last gift my mother gave me before
                    she died.
                        (snatching up coat)
                    The way I see it, it's the same as
                    if she was dug up, three months dead
                    and it was shot right on her rotting
                    corpse, 'cuz that's how it defiled
                    this feels!
          
          Hugo. Long pause.   Big dumb blush.
          
                                HUGO
                    Do you want me to say I did it?
          
                                ISRAEL
                    I was kinda hoping, yeah.
          
                                HUGO
                    Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Only if you really, truly mean it.
          
                                                                      23.
          
          Hugo, swallowing, pressures on. The phone begins to ring.
          
                                HUGO
                    ...I'm sorry...
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
          
                                    HUGO
                    I am.   Yeah.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Without peer?
          
                                HUGO
                    I-- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
          
          Cards dance, Israel's hands moves at lightspeed, he reaches
          into Hugo's shirt front and pulls a playing card out...Joker.
          
                                ISRAEL
                        (showing him the card)
                    No. Be sure. Be resolute.    You stand
                    alone on that summit.
          
          The phone rings. Hugo, wobbly, what-to-do...? Buddy fires
          all fifty-two cards into his face. The beast barely blinks.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    Get the phone, it might be Gill,
                    then get out of my sight.
          
          Hugo, furtive look to the floor, all those scattered cards,
          then, back to the boss, "should I?"
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    No. The cards can stay there. Get
                    The Goddamn Phone.

          A cellphone being lifted, revealing Special Agent Carruthers.

                    Yes Sir. Go ahead.

                    We're three miles from The Nomad

          He clicks off. Messner occupies the passenger seat, reviewing
          surveillance tape, portable headphones on, mini-DAT player
          in his lap. He listens to the following excerpt:
          
                                                                       24.

                    --so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this
                    in the next day or so, get to Israel
                    before the Swede can--
          
          Messner pulls the headphones off.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Anything on the Swede?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Only the mention made in that phone
                    call. There's no Swedish hitman of
                    any renown, much less one with a
                    million dollar day rate.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Maybe he's that good. Never been
                    caught, no criminal record.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Maybe.
          
          Messner, sets the gear on the floorboard, stretches. He
          turns over photographs of Victor Padiche and Sidney Serna.
          (the same ones that were tacked to the corkboard of the
          surveillance van in the opening)

                    I tell you, engineering this kind of
                    play against Sparazza, going to the
                    lengths these guys are going
                    to...they're playing some long odds.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    And a very bad gamble.
          
                                MESSNER

          INT. CHOW SHACK BUFFET -- MORNING
          
          Tahoe's "First and Finest" all seasons Buffet. THE CAMERA
          FINDS: A slicker older cat in a Guyabera shirt, mid-fifties,
          spotted skin, sun damaged, pocked with pre-cancerous black.
          We recognize him from the mugshots and surveillance video:
          It's VICTOR PADICHE. Sykes and Watters enter FRAME. Padiche
          stands, greeting them, smiling-cigarette-stained-dentures...
          
                                                                      25.

                    Girls, wonderful, here, sit.
          
          Watters scoots in right next to Sykes, gets comfy. Sykes
          seems a put off by the proximity, ignores it for the moment.
          
                                PADICHE (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Okay, so...you're here, really nice
                    isn't it? Brisk weather, but nice.
                        (as WAITRESS approaches)
                    Coffee? Anything? I didn't want to
                    order for you.
          
                                WATTERS
                    No, we're cool.
          
                                PADICHE
                    Fabulous.
                        (to Waitress)
                    I'm fine sweetheart, thanks.

                    Okay, so...welcome to the south shore!
                        (big smile, then)
                    So, just jumpin' right in, just in
                    terms of this thing, our thing. I
                    spoke to Lorenzo this morning, he
                    says y'got somethin' more or less
                    put together, plan'a attack and me
                    and my associate Mr. Serna, who I
                    can put on the phone hear, we'd
                    love t'hear it.
          
          Watters and Sykes, non-responsive, staring...

                    soup t'nuts or 'nuthin' like that, I
                    jus' like t'hear the broad strokes,
                    y'know, so we can get an idea--
          
          Sykes and Watters look at one another, wordless exchange,
          then;
          
                                WATTERS
                    Pussy.
          
          Awkward beat, Padiche, head cocked, did I hear that right...?
          
                                PADICHE
                    Wha'?

                                                                      26.
          
          Watters, shaking her head, correcting him.
          
                                   WATTERS
                    Pussy.

                                   PADICHE
                    --Uh...
          
          Another beat. The girls let him dangle. Watters, lewd sneer,
          looks almost lustfully at Sykes as she says the following;
          
                                WATTERS
                    Israel likes pussy...
          
          Padiche, recovering, nodding, nervous.
          
                                PADICHE
                    ...Oh...uh-huh, yeah--
          
          Sykes squirms under Watters lascivious gaze, but manages:
          
                                SYKES
                    And we like that he likes...
          
          Yet another beat.    Padiche, wanting desperately to contribute.
          
                                   PADICHE
                    ...Pussy?
          
                                   SYKES
                    Correct.
          
          Padiche, big nod going from one girl to the other, he-get's-
          it-but-not-really.
          
                                   PADICHE
                    ...Fabulous.
          
          He extends his hand.   WE TRACK IT ACROSS IN C.U. as it meets

                    Okay, good, good, c'mon, c'min.
          
          Reed and Dupree shake.   Reed glances out in the hall before
          closing the door.
          
                                REED (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                        (to Dupree)
                    Where's your third? This was a
                    troika, no?
          
          Dupree, finding a seat, almost under his breath.
          
                                DUPREE
                    He's...fuckin'...he's comin'...
          
          As Elmore appears, Reed almost closes the door on him--
          
                                REED
                        (extending hand)

                                 ELMORE
                    Hollis.   Elmore.
          
          They shake. Dupree shoots a look at Elmore, not pleased.
          Elmore, pissy, leans against the wall, arms crossed.
          
          Reed, wound out, worn thin, half drunk-- his bedspread is
          papered with writs, summons, notaries, etc: Everything to
          make Buddy Israel's return to custody legally binding. He
          sits on the edge of the bed, reaching for a pack of smokes
          on the nightstand, finding a half empty glass of scotch.

          Reed, digging a cigarette out of his pocket.

                    Pretty much a panty-waste, trembling
                    little faggot-fairy when I smell
                    trouble-- and I don't say this to be
                    self-deprecating, I just don't have
                    much of an opinion about myself, I
                    mean, shit, I wish I was a lot more
                    like you guys, barfighters, big
                    swinging dicks, gettin' it done.
                    Sadly.

                    This is it. It's...disgusting.

                    Okay, I'm babbling, I do this when I
                    drink, forgive the rants, let's get
                    at it here. This wanted felon fucking

          Dupree smiles, pats Reed on the shoulder, don't-sweat-this...
          
                                DUPREE
                    Rip, my right hand to God, we're
                    gonna go in and recover this asshole
                    and everybody's gonna leave the
                    theater grinning. Trust me.

          Reed, white-boy high-five, excruciatingly un-hip. Deeks and
          Elmore literally have to look away. Dupree can barely bear
          it.

                    I'm a lawyer, y'know, I need to hear
                    these things, little boosts, helps
                    allay my fears, I pass that piece of
                    mind along to my partners.

                    past that you should know about...His
                    hangers-on, these idiots Israel
                    runs with, they're all "packing heat"
                    "strapped" whatever the phrase is.
                    Point two, Israel likes hookers, so
                    you might run into a harem up there.
                    Point three: He binges between a six-
                    to-seven thousand dollar a day cocaine
                    habit that nobody knows about, so he

                    be high. He also drinks, self-
                    medicates, the whole cliche, y'know?
                    The strung out hasbeen jerkoff snitch
                    drunk. The seven-layer loser.
                        (beat, exhales)
                    I'm praying he puts up a fight,
                    please, please, please, rape him if
                    possible, I'll-pay-the-extra-whatever--
          
          Nobody knows what to make of Reed, as he giggles, nods,
          smokes, nods, drinks-- he looks at all of them, a sudden
          unexpected wave of enthusiasm seizing him.
          
                                REED (CONT'D)
                    Yeah-yeah-yeah. Fucking hell, this
                    feels GREAT! YEAH!? DOESN'T IT!
          
          Reed begins laughing like a complete fucking loon, like he's
          just lost it completely. It's paralyzingly uncomfortable.
          Then, just like that, he stops, grabs an envelope.
          
                                REED (CONT'D)
                        (hands envelope over)

          Reed hands the envelope to a smiling Dupree.

          Israel, furious, screaming at an immense black man standing
          in front of him: SIR IVY, his steadfast second-in-command:
          The presence of a Pimp, the mien of a Mack.
          
                                 SIR IVY
                    Calm down.
          
          Israel gets up in Ivy's grill. A phone begins to ring.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Don't tell me to "calm down" Ivy! I

                    HUGO GRAB THAT! I JUST PAGED GILL!
          
          Hugo rushes for the phone.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    Look at the attention we're getting.
                    It's all bad...
          
                                                                    30.
          
          Hugo, hand cupped over the phone, butting in.
          
                                HUGO
                    Hey-- It's him, it's Gill.
          
                                SIR IVY
                        (gesturing to hookers)
                    ...We got these tricks going in and
                    out, we're partying like the shit
                    might go stale, what did you think
                    was gonna happen?
          
          Israel, walks toward Hugo.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Fifty grand gouge. South shore
                    hayseeds, this is why I never play

                                SIR IVY
                    We're hot, and they're losing a whole
                    floor's worth of business saying
                    it's "under construction."
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling
                    out that kinda bread for this
                    shithole, this is a junior suite in
                    Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he
                    should have his cell on, I need an
                    update.
                        (to Hugo)
                    Get the Russian up here, have him
                    clean this place, floor to ceiling
                    and get us packed .
                        (points to hookers)
                    ...And send out for some new skeeze,
                    the sun's up, these ones are starting
                    to stink...
          
          Hug hands the phone to Israel, pulling his own cell, dialing.
          Ivy looks around at the collapsed hookers, strewn about the
          place, his face registering the appropriate disgust. Then:
          
                                SIR IVY
                    BEANIE!
          
          Some of the girls start at the sound of Ivy's big Barry White
          baritone. They rise, groggy, burping up last night's
          debauchery. Mascara-smeared, hangover-hindered the girls
          rise as BERNARD "BEANIE" ALFONSE, protector #2, pops in; A
          sumo-sized brother with a diamond-studded smile.
          
                                BEANIE
                        (addressing the girls)
                    Alright ya'll, that's the call, we
                    had our fun, pack it in, pro-ceed to
                    the front. Les' go, les' go--
          
                                                                      31.
          
          Beanie starts herding hookers, Ivy positions himself at the
          door, pulls a flashroll, fingers hundred dollar bills.
          Israel, phone to his ear, retires to the bedroom for privacy.

                      About cocaine...and the amount you're

                      They concluded, as I have, that you
                      are showing signs of severe cardiac
                      distress...so much so, that a massive

          Ivy and Beanie, marshalling the mass hooker exodus. Ivy
          paying the gals as they exit the suite. One YOUNG HOOKER
          bringing up the rear, stumbles in her stripper heels, shaky,
          tries to take another step, slips, trips, falls-- smacks
          face first into a glass coffee table, shattering it.
          
                                BEANIE (CONTD)
                    Damn girl, look out now!
          
          The other Hookers; gape jawed, mild shock, mild amusement.
          Beanie plucks the fallen woman up, shakes her off, straightens
          her out, pulls off the offending heels.

                    when you try to get around in 'em?
          
          The hooker, covered in glass dust, stuck with shards,
          teetering, too out of it to care.

                    Buddy, nobody knows about your
                    condition, or your drug use. Why
                    you lied to me, knowing that I'd
                    find out anyway, I'll never know,
                    but it imperative now that I see

                    That's not possible. I told you.
          
                                 DR. GILL
                    There are certain meds, certain
                    intravenous measures that can
                    counteract some of the damage you've
                    done, but I'd have to administer
                    them myself.

                       to be amputated because severely
                       constricted blood flow has brought

          girl takes umbrage, hurls her purse at them, rushing into

                    We're sitting on Sparazza for what?

                                MESSNER
                    Based on what we had, I thought
                    Sparazza was a mid-level player at
                    best and it turns out he's this mob
                    relic, running the show out west.

          Messner flips the file, finds a page paper-clipped with a

                                MESSNER
                    But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed
                    Heller. Why not go after him, guns
                    blazing' for that one?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Heller was buried in agency lore,
                    anytime an operative failed or was
                    perceived to have failed, Hoover
                    blackballed their memory. Look at
                    Ness.

                    Yeah, but the Untouchables took down
                    Capone. Heller got shot and killed.
                    The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza
                    walked.
          
          Messner sits back, kills the remainder of his coffee, gazing
          out the window, watching sightseers stream by. Carruthers
          glances at his watch.

                    What about the hotel staff obstructing

                    Tampering with a witness extraction

                    Your attitude sucks.
          
                                ELMORE
                    I been accused of worse.
                        (glancing at uniforms)
                    What do we got...?
          
          Dupree, dubious, does he continue...?   Fine. Fuck it.
          
                                DUPREE
                    Two security levels, the one we're
                    going in under the guise of, hotel
                    security, has restricted access.
                    They're mostly there to monitor the
                    lobby, handle disturbances on the
                    different floors and toss out drunks.
                        (beat)
                    There's a thirty-five member employee
                    rotation going from graveyard to day
                    shift. If we split up, we can blend
                    in and enter unnoticed. Once we're
                    inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
          
                                  ELMORE
                    Then what--
          
          --A Plymouth Barracuda passes by, brakes hard, reverses.
          The trio stop talking, look over...and then their lives end.
          Bad intentions blaze from the driver's side, machine-gun
          bursts-- Dupree is hit flush, dead on his feet, his dying
          thought, cut comically short; "I had that car in high scho--
          
          Deeks, shredded where he stands, his body absorbing a
          fusillade of rounds traveling at twice the speed of sound.
          One creases Elmore's skull, another blows out Deeks' back,
          fragmenting, claiming three fingers from Elmore's left hand.
          The three of them fall in weird, waterlogged flops, no dying
          breaths, no death rattles, just lights out...just like that.
          
          Several seconds pass. Then the car door opens and The Tremor
          Brothers, like circus clowns, clamber out in a cloud of gun
          and reefer smoke. LESTER TREMOR, the dandruff-caked,
          pockmarked middle brother is the first out. He shakes off
          the cold, yawning, stretching, revealing all manner of tattoo.
          
                                                                    39.
          
          The Tremors' youngest brother, the Baby-Huey sized JEEVES
          TREMOR bumbles out, pulling at his crotch. He unzips & rips,
          baptizing the Cuda's tire with a truly prodigious piss.
          DARWIN TREMOR climbs from the car, the eldest brother, straw
          boss, brains of the outfit. He looks down at the dead men,
          seems saddened by their state. Some remorse maybe? Maybe so.
          
                                JEEVES TREMOR
                        (still pissing)
                    Luvin' that, rat-tat-tat-tat, clean
                    as a nun's snatch on Kristal Nacht!
          
                                LESTER TREMOR
                        (stops singing)
                    Shut up fuckass, them spirits ain't
                    vacated yet, s'keep quiet.
          
                                JEEVES TREMOR
                    Them spirts can kiss my Chinese ass.
          
                                LESTER TREMOR
                    ...YOU AIN'T NO CHINESE!
          
          This exchange prompts Jeeves to turn and urinate on Lester.
          Lester squeals war cry, launching a wild windmill barrage on
          his behemoth little brother. Jeeves ignores the hydrant-
          like urine stream soaking them both and starts swinging back.
          
          Darwin kneels down over the dead Jack Dupree, taking Jack's
          face in his hand and squeezing back and forth, adding his
          own words in what amounts to a freakish ventriloquist act.
          
                                DUPREE (DEAD)
                    ...I forgive you Darwin.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Shoot, I appreciate that man.
          
                                 DUPREE
                    If I needed your I.D. and your car
                    and me and my brothers were wanted
                    by the law, I woulda killed you to
                    get 'em too.
          
                                  DARWIN TREMOR
                    You woulda?
          
                                DUPREE
                    Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong
                    place at the wrong time. So don't
                    feel so bad dude.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Damn...alright then.
          
                                DUPREE
                    I don't mind now anyway.
                                (MORE)
          
                                                                      40.
          
                                DUPREE (CONT'D)
                    You know, up here in Heaven, it's
                    beautiful. Way better than fuckin'
                    Hawaii or any place like that.
          
          Darwin's eyes begin to well, the tears coming slowly. In the
          background, Lester and Jeeves beat e ach other ruthlessly.
          
                                   DARWIN TREMOR
                    Really?
          
                                DUPREE
                    I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm
                    gonna get laid by some fine ass angels
                    and then go hang out with Jesus and
                    them.
          
          Darwin wipes his eyes.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Man, that's great.
          
                                 DUPREE
                    I got it made in the shade Amigo.
                    Hey, I'll see you up here some day,
                    don't worry.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    You think so?
          
          Darwin uses his thumb and forefinger to make it appear as
          though Dupree we're smiling up at him.
          
                                   DUPREE
                    I know so.
          
          Darwin smiles back down   at the corpse, wiping his nose on
          his sleeve. He reaches    down and pulls out Dupree's wallet.
          He spots the bondsman's   license, eyeballs the bail papers:
          He sees the name ROBERT   ISRAEL in bold type. Puts it together.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Damn Jack...you was after the same
                    sacka shit as us...Small world.
          
          Darwin continues the pat down, pauses, pulls the envelope
          with fifty grand inside, fingers fresh bills. With his free
          hand he manipulates Dupree's dead mouth one last time.
          
                                DUPREE
                    Don't tell your asshole brothers you
                    know about it, that money is for you
                    old boy.
          
          Darwin, a nod of acknowledgement for the dead Dupree.
          
                                                                      41.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    I appreciate that pard...I wish I
                    coulda been a better friend.
          
          Darwin stands, His eyes move to the guard's uniforms, still
          laid out across the trunk...he looks over at his two brothers,
          Jeeves now with a Lenny-like hammerlock on Lester's head.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Alright enough grabassin' goddamit!
                    We need t'get over t'that hotel.
          
                                WATTERS (V.O.)
                    We're already here baby.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL AND CASINO -- LOBBY -- MORNING
          
          Watters is once again on her cellphone to Lorenzo.
          
                                WYMAN (O.S.)
                        (on the phone)
                    So everything's cool then?
          
                                WATTERS
                    We sat down with Padiche, he tried
                    to get some details which we wasn't
                    gonna give up, but it's all good.
                    We goin' check Sis in first, 'fore I
                    check in across the street.
          
          Sykes arrives at the reception counter when the elevators
          open-- and Israel's Hookers, post-brawl bruised, bloodied
          and barefoot, come staggering out.
          
          They slur insults at the security team, broken heels slung
          over their shoulders, wigs misaligned, miniskirts mangled.
          Sykes trades looks with Watters as if assessing something,
          nodding almost imperceptibly to one another. Watters then
          winks, something sexual there...it gives Sykes the shivers.
          
          The Hookers are surrounded by a horde of hotel staff and
          summarily whisked away. Watters joins Sykes. The WOMAN
          behind the counter checking Sykes in, looks up to see Watters.
          
                                 WOMAN
                    Will you be needing a room with two
                    double beds?
          
                                SYKES
                        (quickly)
                    No, we're not together.
          
          Watters, a grin.
          
                                WATTERS
                    C'mon baby, don't be shy.

                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                        (to woman)
                    Just one bed please.
                        (beat, to Sykes smiling)
                    Although if we sweat that one up, we
                    goin' need some clean sheets.
                        (As Sykes pulls away)
                    C'mon Girl, you know I'm playing!
          
          Sykes looks uneasily at the counter woman, who keeps her
          eyes locked on the computer in front of her.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                        (over her shoulder to
                         the departing hookers)
                    ..If ya'll let hoochie like that
                    stay up in here, ya'll must be burning
                    sheets by the ton.
          
          The woman just smiles that monstrously insincere "I'm here
          to help!" smile, offering nothing in response.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                    You just goin' grin? Y'ain't goin
                    comment on that, at all? Trampy ass
                    skeezers, doin' damage they ain't
                    even smart enough to see. That don't
                    gall you at all?
                        (beat, closer)
                    Bitches like those are the same ones
                    runnin' feminism right to the brink
                    girl. Bitches like that the reason
                    mafuckas don't take our species
                    seriously. We jus' meat for male
                    consumption, we jus' pieces a'ass
                    and pussy, somethin' pretty in
                    lipstick and eye liner can suck cock.
          
          Sykes, embarrassed, nudging Watters, knock-it-off...
          
                                WATTERS (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Bitches like that make me weep for
                    what could be-- if we could all,
                    sisters everywhere, black, white,
                    yellow and brown, put our shit down
                    one time, unified front, the force
                    of the female race, mobilized, moving
                    as one...
          
          The woman, smile severely strained, the pro-feminist diatribe
          falling on decidedly deaf ears. An awkward beat, then;
          
                                SYKES
                    I'm gonna need a mini-bar key too.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
                                                                       43.
          
          A mini-bar being opened. A hand reaching in, extracting two
          small bottles of Jack Daniels whiskey and a bottle of seltzer.
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL ROOM -- LOWER FLOOR
          
          The figure crosses the room, pouring the seltzer onto a towel.
          He kneels down, dabbing a spot on the carpet, fresh spill,
          deep red, indelible.. The seltzer doesn't bring it up. The
          stain remains, smeared now but unmistakable...blood.
          
          The figure stands. In the bathroom behind him, we see a body,
          male, late-50's, trussed up, hung by his feet over the tub
          and bled out. The figure walks in, takes a Polaroid, turns
          it upside down near the man's face and fires off a photo.
          
          He crosses back into the bedroom. The resulting photo is
          tucked into the corner of a dresser mirror as it develops.
          As the figure sits, WE PAN OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          LAZLO SOOT: world class assassin slash master of disguise.
          The slowly developing polaroid depicts the same face that we
          now see in the mirror. Soot touches up the putty and plastic
          appliances on his face, smoothing, sealing...
          
          He takes up a small micro-cassette recorder, rewinds, pushes
          play. A butler's uniform, steamed and pressed, hangs on the
          door. He takes it down and begins changing into it.

                    --Keep calm.
          
          He glances over at the bed. The dead man's voice crackles
          back over the recorder.
          
                                DEAD MAN (ON RECORDER)

                    --Say your name. Then say "How can I
                    be of assistance."
          
          Soot, back to the mirror, buttoning his collar, straightening
          his cuffs, smoothing out the creases.
          
                                DEAD MAN (ON RECORDER)
                    I don't understand.
          
                                 LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)
                    I didn't ask for your understanding.
                    I asked you to say your name, followed
                    by the phrase "How can I be of
                    assistance."
          
          Beat. Soot looks down at the Silencer-fitted 9mm pistol lying
          on the vanity.
          
                                                                         44.

                    Last chance.
          
          A pause, then:
          
                                DEAD MAN (ON RECORDER)
                    My name is Vitoli. How can I be of
                    assistance.
          
                                   LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)
                    Thank you.
          
          A muffled gunshot sounds. The recorder abruptly shuts off.
          Soot, gazing at his reflection now, rewinds the recorder,
          replays, listens, gauging the man's vocal patterns-- rough
          Baltic accent, throaty warble, excessive smoke & booze
          exposure, tracheal damage. Tough to match. He rehearses one.
          
                                SOOT
                    My name is Vitoli. How can I be of
                    assistance.
          
          He grimaces, grabs cigarettes off the bureau, lights, wails
          smokestack, puffing three at once, bellows-like lungfuls--
          He grabs an aerosol can from the same bureau, strafes the
          back of his throat, pops the tops on the bottles of Jack,
          kills them both, gags, sputters, recovers, adjusts himself.
          Suddenly, the phone begins to ring. Soot stops, stares.
          
          After another ring, he lifts the receiver,
          
                                SOOT (CONT'D)
                        (into phone, cautious)
                    This is Vitoli. How can I be of
                    assistance.
          
          Hugo Croop's voice booms from the earpiece.

          Israel, sequestered to his bedroom, lying on a baby-grand
          piano, its legs inexplicably sawed off during the previous
          night's hedonism. In his hands, the de riguer deck of cards,
          restlessly shuffled and reshuffled...Cocaine has been lovingly
          cut and arranged in neat, snortable rows atop the piano.

          Buddy's rubs his chest-- grimacing-- he lays back on the
          piano, hoists a vial of blow, presses a nostril, does a bump.

          S.A. Gerald Diego, alias Pasquale Acosta, speaking   with "Bill"
          SECURITY SUPERVISOR for the Nomad. Banks of video    monitors
          surround them, displaying the various gaming areas   and VIP

                                ACOSTA
                        (to Bill)
                    Can I speak to you privately?
          
          The Supervisor nods, dismisses his staff, calls after one.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Gary, let's get our personnel up in
                    the catwalk over twelve, that stickman
                    has been acting odd and I don't like
                    the rolls that table has been getting.
          
                                  EMPLOYEE
                    Got it.
          
          Acosta waits for the door to close, leaving only himself and
          the supervisor in the room.

                                ACOSTA
                    It's gotta be tough keeping an eye
                    on everything.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    And everybody, all the time. Yeah,
                    it's a chore.
          
          Acosta laughs, keeps it loose.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    So, Bill, if I understand this right,
                    you currently have your penthouse
                    floor under construction?
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    That's correct.
          
                                ACOSTA
                        (points to monitors)
                    But with these down, doesn't that
                    pose a major security concern if, as
                    you say, you have to keep an eye on
                    everything at all times?
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Well, we were worried about dust and
                    debris from the work being done
                    ruining the cameras, so--
          
                                ACOSTA
                    --so you shut them off?
          
          The Supervisor, quick to amend.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Yes, but no-- we have personnel
                    stationed at both ends of that hall,
                    twenty-four hours a day.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    What kind of personnel?

          Colt .380 autos, religiously kept, strictly range-fired.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR (V.O.)
                    Right now? A six man security force,
                    plus a member of our Butler staff.
                    So seven men total.
          
          CUT BACK TO SCENE:
          
                                                                      49.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    You have a butler working that floor?
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          Vitoli, aka Lazlo Soot, stepping onto a lower-floor elevator,
          pushing a service cart tucking the 9mm into his waistband.
          
          CUT BACK TO SCENE:
          
          The Supervisor sputters-- stammers, realizes he just slipped.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Uh-- well, yes, uh just in terms of
                    the men up there now, my team, he's
                    serving lunch and dinner and just
                    doing general upkeep so--
          
                                ACOSTA
                    So there are no guests staying on
                    that floor?
          
          The Supervisor makes a big show of the headshake "no...."
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    No. None at present.
          
          Acosta grins, takes a step closer.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    C'mon Bill...you've got some Sultan
                    up there, one of your whales, big-
                    spender, likes a lot of space, you
                    cook up this "construction" thing...?
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    No, no, no. We've been looking to
                    renovate that area of our hotel for
                    some time now. The security team is
                    only present to preserve floor
                    integrity, due to the roof access.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Is your security team armed?
          
                                 SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Of course.   Yes.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    And who has access to that floor?
          
          The Supervisor...something like suspicion in his eyes. The
          secure "hotline" begins to ring. The Supervisor looks over
          at the phone, then back at Acosta...the unflappable pro.
          
                                                                       50.
          
                                ACOSTA (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Bill, listen, I can ask you now and
                    you can answer me, or I can drag you
                    up to San Francisco and depose you
                    in front of a federal judge. Because
                    that's where we're headed here.
          
          Bullshit, but it sounds good.   The Supervisor starts for the
          ringing hotline.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    I'm sorry, but I'm going to need to
                    see your identification again. We're
                    covering some sensitive material
                    here and I need to safeguard myself,
                    I'm sure you can understand.
          
          Acosta, reaching into his coat.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Of course, but if you could just
                    tell me who has access to that floor--
          
          The Supervisor touches a pass key that he wears on a chain
          around his neck as he moves to answer the phone.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    --I hold the sole pass key and
                    personally relieve the shifts myself.
                    Now if I could get your ID we can--
          
          --Acosta, coming out of his coat, fake ID in hand, the
          supervisor reaching for it and the ringing phone
          simultaneously-- suddenly a six-inch, spring-loaded stiletto
          blade explodes from Acosta's sleeve, piercing the ID-- pinning
          it to the Supervisor's chest.
          
          A surprised grunt from the man as blood begins to pour from
          his punctured sternum. The blade retracts. The phone sits
          trembling in the Supervisor's hand, --a voice-- Carruther's,
          tinny and barely audible, warbles from the other end-
          
                                VOICE
                        (over phone)
                    Hello? This is Special Agent Donald
                    Carruthers of the FBI, I need an--
          
          Acosta takes the phone from the stunned Supervisor, replacing
          it on the console. The Supervisor, still confused by the
          exchange, wanting to speak, but unsure of what to say...He
          gazes down to the red blossom fanning across his shirt front.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Is...that...blood?
          
          Acosta pockets his ID as he yanks the pass key off the
          Supervisor's neck. His natural accent returns.
          
                                                                     51.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Yes it is and right now it's filling
                    your lungs. In less than a minute,
                    you'll asphyxiate and pass out. You
                    shouldn't be feeling any pain now.
          
          The Supervisor's knees begin to buckle, nervous system slowly
          shutting down. Acosta steadies him, easing him to the floor.
          
                                  ACOSTA (CONT'D)
                    Close your   eyes. Think of something
                    wonderful.    Don't make this face the
                    last thing   you ever see.
                        (beat,   in Spanish)
                    Heaven may   hold it against you.
          
          The Supervisor, unblinking, an almost childlike clarity there.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    ...Am I really dying...?
          
          Acosta, deadpan.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Bill--
                        (out of respect)
                    Willliam...
                        (pause)
                    We're all dying...
          
          Bill the supervisor almost smiles as he breathes his last
          breath...Acosta checks for a pulse, then drags his body toward
          a service closet. As he passes one of the video monitors...
          
          ...WE SEE ON-SCREEN: The Employee entrance, grave and swing
          shifts on their way out, day shift on it's way in. Mixed in
          with this personnel rotation, each doing his inconspicuous
          best...The Brothers Tremor.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. EMPLOYEE ENTRANCE -- DAY
          
          Darwin, Lester and Jeeves, clad in full security attire,
          standing apart so as not to appear together, heads down,
          hands shoved into their pockets.
          
          Darwin bird-dogs both his brothers, monitoring their movement,
          using hand signals and some bizarre inbred semaphore to
          communicate with them. They pass through and punch in,
          signing time sheets. The surrounding security staff oblivious
          to the new faces. The brothers enter the lower floors, moving
          through the hotel's fitness center and indoor pool.
          
          A kid does a cannonball as they pass as we...

          A clouded bog-- coming to-- consciousness, then, retching,
          gagged gasps, throat ablaze with bile, liquid clearing
          convulsed lungs, breath in burning spasms-- not enough air.
          
          EXT. LAKE --DAY
          
          Elmore sits up in the sub-zero shallows of Lake Tahoe with a
          start, stripped naked, shaking uncontrollably, his skin a
          deep bruised blue. Dull pain quickly defines-- pinpoints,
          bores in, bone deep...Death can't hurt this much.
          
          He gets his breathing under control, the onset of hypothermia
          turning his fingertips black-- his left hand, lighter three
          digits-- he looks, comprehension sparks but can't catch-- he
          stares impassively at the ragged space, for the moment, he
          doesn't seem to mind their absence. He gropes the side of
          his head, bullet-graze, blood congealed by the cold, the
          concussion he suffered has left a massive migraine behind.
          
          He crawls from the water, muscles cramping, knotting up. He
          reaches the sand, unable to pull himself up any further. He
          turns back, sees the bodies of Deeks and Dupree, face down,
          the lazy lake tide gently lifting and lowering them...
          
                                MESSNER (V.O.)
                    Double homicide, gunshot vics, both
                    of 'em dumped in the lake. That's
                    where the Sheriff's task force is.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. CAR -- DAY
          
          Carruthers and Messner, hectic, speeding through the south
          shore of Lake Tahoe, cellphones pinned to their ears.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (back into his phone)
                    Deputy, have you made any ID's?
          
                                CARRUTHERS

                    --Miss, I've been transferred and I
                    was disconnected. No one is answering
                    and I need someone from security to
                    pick up that line. It's urgent.
          
          Messner, nodding as he listens.
          
                                MESSNER

                    on speaker, I have Agent Carruthers
                    in the car with me.
                        (beat to Carruthers)
                    You need to hear this.
          
                                                                    53.
          
          Messner clicks over, the deputies voice fills the car.

                    Dupree, appears to be a bondsman out
                    of Las Vegas. He was just rolled
                    and printed by our medical examiner.
          
          Messner and Carruthers trade looks.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Was there anything recovered?
          
                                SHERIFF DEPUTY (O.S.)
                    We found a handwritten receipt in
                    his pocket for what looks like uniform
                    rentals. The name and phone number
                    of the rental house wasn't listed,
          
                                MESSNER
                    What kind of uniforms?
          
                                SHERIFF DEPUTY (O.S.)
                    Receipt wasn't specific, the uniforms
                    were just listed as maroon in color.
          
          Carruthers mashes the floorboard, brakes smoke, power swerve,
          slicing the rented Taurus across four lanes of traffic.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Alright, deputy, we'll be there as
                    soon as possible, until we arrive, I
                    need you to limit physical access
                    and restrict movement to and from
                    the crime scene. Clear?
          
          Messner clicks off.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Maroon uniforms?
          
                                MESSNER
                    Yeah. Have you been able to get
                    through to the Nomad's security?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    No.
                        (beat, decision)
                    I'm going over there. You take the
                    car from there, get out to the lake.
          
          Carruthers pushes 110mph, barreling toward the Nomad, blowing
          through traffic-- Both men pull out IFB/earpiece apparatus,
          plugging in, checking their signals.
          
                                MESSNER
                    You going up to the Penthouse alone?

          Carruthers pulls a .45 from his holster, driving with his
          knees now, he jacks the slide, checks for a chambered round.
          
                                 CARRUTHERS
                    Yeah.
          
          The slide releases--

                    Why?
          
                                SYKES
                    'Cuz we don't need to draw any more
                    shit down on our heads. We hit
                    whoever's between us and Israel. I
                    don't want to dead the whole floor
                    and I don't want to be killing women
                    no matter how they make a living.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Wait, I'm getting some fucked up
                    feedback off that earpiece--
          
          Sykes pulls her earpiece, adjusts something, re-inserts it.
          
                                 SYKES
                    Better?
          
          WHIP PAN TRANSITION TO:
          
          INT. HORIZON HOTEL AND CASINO -- SAME
          
          The Hotel just across the street from the Nomad. Watters on
          a headset, talking to Sykes, looking out the window.
          
                                 WATTERS
                    Much.
          
          On a room service tray near Watters; scanners monitor calls
          and in-house transmissions within The Nomad.
          
                                SYKES
                    What are you hearin' right now?
          
          Watters adjusts one of the scanners, searching for a signal.
          
                                                                       55.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin'
                    about a fed being in the building.
          
          INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO
          
                                 SYKES
                    A Fed?   Like FBI?
          
                                WATTERS
                    It's just a little casino inspection,
                    don't trip, he's alone.
                        (beat, then)
                    Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
          
          Sykes checks her reflection, makes sure her holsters aren't
          peeking out, weapons adequately conformed to her curves.
          
                                SYKES
                    When them tricks hit the lobby, holla
                    at me and I'm gonna meet them on the
                    way up, blend in. Once I get inside,
                    I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head
                    and back out hot. Anybody's fucks
                    with that program, y'break 'em off.
                    They get gully--
          
                                WATTERS
                    I'mma grip and rip girl.
                        (holding up a red-
                         tipped bullet)
                    I got some handloads here ready to
                    cut heads.
          
                                SYKES
                    Jus' remember, this is more rescuin'
                    shit than rampagin' shit...What are
                    you shootin'?
          
                                WATTERS
                    ...Girl, y'know I had to bring big
                    mamma through.
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          
          A .50 Caliber sniper-rifle on a tri-pod, jutting just past
          the window, zeroed ut on the Penthouse level of the Nomad.
          
                                SYKES
                    You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin'
                    t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the
                    moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna
                    get that grimy?
          
                                WATTERS
                    The try t'wild out on my boo and
                    it's on and crackin'! I'm layin'
                    niggas out.
          
                                                                    56.
          
                                SYKES
                    Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I
                    wish they made this more sheer.
          
          Watters puts her eye to the scope, scans, finds SYKES in
          the crosshairs across the way, adjusting her outfit. Watters
          settles on her, watches...something vaguely creepy about
          this bit of voyeurism. She nuzzles the Barrett close.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Mmmm. I tell you, I snuggle up with
                    big girl here and my pussy start
                    t'drip.
          
          Sykes grimaces.    Watters sees it, smiles to herself.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                    ...So you heard from Keith? He still
                    fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned
                    girl?
          
                                SYKES
                    I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for
                    that sorry ass nigga.
          
                                WATTERS
                    He a dog babydoll. He a great dane.
                    I tried to tell y'after ya'll first
                    date. He hit that ass one time, his
                    interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
          
                                SYKES
                    You know I burned all his shit. All
                    that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic,
                    I burned his turntables too. They
                    was like three-thousand brand new.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on
                    some other scrub. We got one another,
                    s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
          
          Sykes says nothing for a moment, Watters just watches her
          through the crosshairs, her finger idly flicking the trigger
          in a strangely perverse gesture. Finally:
          
                                SYKES
                    Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I
                    want you t'tell me straight up, since
                    I got my suspicions and y'know I
                    ain't one t'talk circles...you gay?
          
                                  WATTERS
                    What!?
          
                                SYKES
                    Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
          
                                                                        57.
          
                                 WATTERS
                    Damn!   Why you trippin' like that?
          
                                SYKES
                    --I don't know, I feel like you always
                    pushin' up on me, gettin' close and
                    I love you baby, in every way you
                    can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
          
                                WATTERS
                    I ain't even goin' dignify that.
                    You my road dog. We threw up sets.
                        (beat, lets it sit)
                    Plus you stank.
          
                                SYKES
                        (laughing now)
                    Fuck you.
          
          Watters spots something outside, grabs a pair of binoculars,
          looks down...BINOCULARS P.O.V.: Four obvious CALL GIRLS
          disembarking a taxi, mylar-colored micro-minis, fuck-me heels,
          cheap shoulder bags. They smoke, laugh, chit-chat.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Alright girl, the ho train has
                    arrived. Four of 'em.
          
          Sykes, grabbing her bag, dropping spare clips inside and
          starting for the door.
          
                                SYKES
                    ...I'm on my way out, I'm just gonna
                    hang in the hallway until they start
                    up in the elevators.
          
          Watters loads a red-tipped round into the breach of the Fifty.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Just get in there and do your thing
                    baby...mamma gots you.
          
          SNAP ZOOM ON BULLET as she slams the action forward, loading
          the round WE SMASH CUT TO BLACK.
          
          ...Dial tones over black.   A phone rings. A voice answers.
          
          FADE UP ON:
          
          A reel-to-reel machine activates, begins to record-- A sticker
          on the pick-up spool reads: "PROPERTY OF THE F.B.I."
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          MONTAGE
          
          The players take their places. Over these images WE HEAR:
          
                                                                    58.

                    Nah, nuthin' on my end--
          
          Vitoli, aka Lazlo Soot: arriving at the Penthouse level,
          exchanging nods with the security team, pushing his service
          cart out of the elevator and down the hall, through a metal
          detector, which goes off. Vitoli/Soot shrugs, gestures to
          his stainless steel cart. The security team wave him through.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    So how we lookin'?
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    Good. This thing's on track, looks
                    like it's gonna get done.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)

          Pasquale Acosta: Now wearing the nametag of "Bill" the
          recently deceased Security Supervisor. He buttons his red
          blazer, hanging the penthouse pass key around his neck as he
          moves through the lobby, carrying a small briefcase.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    That's what we're countin' on. What'd
                    they say when you went for specifics?
          
          The Tremor Brothers: Duffel bags straining with the horrible,
          shit inside. They move toward a service elevator, swapping
          pill bottles, downing overdose amounts, repeating "Mein Kampf"
          recitations as they push the elevator's call button.

          Hollis Elmore: Frantically ringing the alley delivery doorbell
          of a local Souvenir Shop-- naked, frozen, delirious, near-
          death, he has dragged himself there.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been

                                PADICHE
                    Well, uh-- damn, alright, so he's
                    headed in, does that-- where does
                    that leave us?
          
          Agent Messner: Watching as the bodies of Dupree and Deeks
          are hauled from the lake by Sheriff's personnel. He walks
          the shoreline, searching for clues, on his cellphone, trying
          to reach Security at the Nomad.

          Agent Carruthers: Plugging in his headset as he reaches the
          front of the Nomad, leaping out, rushing inside, holstering
          his gun for the moment.
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    So we gotta get t'Israel pretty quick
                    for this to fly, yeah? I think?
          
          Georgia Sykes; Pulling a small revolver from her garter-
          holster, annoyed, rubbing the chaffed area, reaching the
          elevator, leaning back against the wall, waiting.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Basically-- it'd really be the best

          Ivy unbuttons his coat. A .50 Cal rides in his shoulder-rig.
          Israel averts his eyes. Ivy lets the moment load up...then;

          Acosta has fully assumed the identity of the murdered security

          Acosta steps behind Carruthers, blocking himself from view.

                                SYKES
                    ...Faggot-ass redneck...
          
          Darwin's smile turns scowl as the elevator doors slide shut.
          
                                WATTERS
                    What'd you say?
          
                                SYKES
                    Not you. Some assholes on the
                    elevator...are these bitches on a
                    permanent smoke break or what? Why
                    the fuck they call'm "working girls."
          
          Watters grabs her binoculars; sees the four prostitutes snub
          cigarette butts and start to head inside.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Alright, the ho train is exiting the
                    station. They're coming to you...
          
          Sykes waits a beat, then reaches for the call button to signal
          another car. WE FOLLOW HER FINGER to the "up" button and--
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          A blackened fingertip, trembling, barely enough force behind
          it to hold a delivery bell button down.

          The parking lot teems with local news trucks. Passerby's
          crowd the police line. Messner is on his cellphone, incensed,
          confused. A Sheriff's DEPUTY flanks him.

                    without the slightest inkling as to
                    why they're here. Is that correct?
                    Am I misinterpreting that or--

                    No, I'm not blaming any one person,
                    this is Bureau directive. But Agent
                    Carruthers is the SAC and he's out
                    of cell range at the moment, so I
                    can't contact him to--
                        (listens, frustrated)
                    Very well. I need to get Deputy

                    as possible.
          
          One of the Crime Scene Recovery TEAM MEMBERS approaches,
          hands Messner a printout. A faxed, blown up rendering of a
          Nevada Driver's license...We recognize the face.

                                CS TEAM MEMBER
                    Hollis Elmore, resident of Las Vegas,
                    formerly with the P.D. there. He's a
                    known associate of Dupree's.
          
          The CS Team Member holds an evidence bag aloft.

                    We found these washed up on shore.
          
          Messner takes the bag, gawks, can't quite make out the
          contents.
          
                                MESSNER
                    What are these?
          
                                CS TEAM MEMBER
                    Elmore's fingers. Whorls are in bad
                    shape from the frostbite, but we got
                    a good pull for latents, positive
                    ID.
                        (beat, nod to bag)
                    Those were shot off.

          A limo arrives, the Swede disembarks, black valise in tow.
          A group of Sparazza henchmen surround him, spiriting him
          toward a nearby stairwell, anxious to avoid the police.

          Doc Gill and Hugo, sitting in their car, a little leery at
          the heavy police presence. Hugo takes up his cellphone.

                    Is there anything you need?
          
          Gill shakes his head "no" as Hugo dials. Gill retrieves his
          own phone as he climbs out, dialing, moving to the trunk.
          
                                DR. GILL

          He clicks off, Hugo is completely unaware of the call he
          just made. Gill pops the trunk, removing his medical bag

          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- SAME
          
          The phone rings, Beanie moves to answer it, tossing his balled
          up Versace shirt to Soot/Vitoli.
          
                                BEANIE
                        (looking back)
                    That's a silk blend B, six-hundred

          Soot nods, unfurls a laundry tote, sticks the shirt inside,
          hand moving within the bag--

                    roll an' shit all over it--
          
          --Beanie, turning, reaching down for the ringing phone when--
          THWAP-- something plunks him hard from behind-- he's knocked
          forward by the force of the impact-- startled-- instinctively
          slapping at that area-- thinking something stung him.
          
                                BEANIE (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck!?
          
          He looks around, alarmed, head on a swivel, hand probing the
          pain, not aware of the blood coursing from that spot,
          streaming down his back...The phone continues to ring.
          
          Then Beanie hears the small metallic warble of something
          rolling around on the floor behind him, gradually settling.
          A sensation overtakes him...and he grows very still with it.
          
          He looks down at his hand for the first time...sees blood
          there, reaches up with that same hand and finds the tattered
          hole right above the base of his spine-- small wisps of smoke
          drifting up out of the wound...He turns, numb...and sees
          what looks like a spent shell casing, just ejected, coming
          to rest on the tile...The phone continues to ring.
          
          His eyes track upward to Vitoli the Butler, holding a silenced
          9mm-- aim still held...And that's when it dawns on Beanie...
          ...He's just been shot in the head.
          
                                BEANIE (CONT'D)
                        (almost to himself)
                    Aw hell no you ain't just do that...
          
                                                                    69.
          
          Three more soundless shots from the 9mm put a humane end to
          these proceedings-- blowing Beanie's body over a sofa chair.
          His three-hundred plus pound frame slides to an unceremonious
          halt in the remnants of the shattered coffee table.
          
          Israel's calf-skin coat lies near Beanies dead body, a pool
          of blood surrounding it, soaking through and all the while...
          The phone continues to ring.

          Ivy and Israel, oblivious to what's gone on, fifty feet away.

                    What did you say to Mecklen?
          
          Israel looks from the ringing phone-- to the gun in his bag--
          no good-- Ivy will kill him before he clears the bedspread.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    That's probably him now...

                    assume the shit is rhetorical...so
                    assume I already know.
          
          Ivy lets that .50 caliber hang like intimidation itself.
          Israel looks over at the ringing phone, then back at Ivy.
          He slowly withdraws the deck of cards from his robe pocket,
          begins shuffling at lightspeed, firing them across his body,
          left to right, right to left.

          He does, snatching a card cold from the deck, turning it to
          Ivy.

          confidential package he received earlier: PHOTOS of a post-
          op Primo Sparazza, plastic surgery shrink-wrapped, his face
          swollen and deformed, dozens of photos, dozens of dates.

                    twist your shit up...
          
          He scans the surgical reports, specific sentences and words
          pop: "MALIOFACIAL DISORDER" "DEGENERATIVE BONE DISEASE"
          "BULLET FRAGMENTS" He keeps reading...

                    ...It ain't nothin' compared to what
                    I 'bout to do here. Believe that.
          
                                ACOSTA/BILL (V.O.)
                    I don't believe this.

          "Bill" aka Pasquale Acosta, hitting a walkie-talkie against
          his leg, checking for a signal-- faking the whole affair.
          
                                ACOSTA/BILL
                    Battery's completely dead.
          
          Carruthers, behind him in the elevator, checking his cellphone--
          
                                                                    71.

                    Forget it, you won't get a signal in
                    here. Have to wait.
          
          Carruthers, annoyed, stowing his cellphone.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                        (re: wall phone)
                    Can't you use the line in here to
                    contact your people.
          
                                ACOSTA/BILL
                        (not missing a beat)
                    No, these phones are hardwired
                    directly to maintenance. Once we
                    reach the penthouse, I can call down
                    and have the system taken off-line.
          
          Carruthers, absent nods, anxious. Acosta/Bill, back to
          futzing with his walkie-talkie-- going so far as to remove
          the battery-- --And that's when Carruthers sees it...Bill's
          fingers, flesh mottled at the tips, horribly scarred over--
          
          --something clicks --memories fire --photostrobic...

          CUT BACK TO SCENE:
          
          Carruthers' expression goes black...
          
                                LOCKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    When he was caught by the SAS in
                    Northern Ireland and imprisoned, he
                    chewed off his fingertips to the
                    bone before he could be printed and
                    ID'd by Interpol.
          
          Carruthers stares at those fingers, backs against the wall,
          hand moving slowly toward his waist-- suspicions pique.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Can't maintenance do that?
          
                                ACOSTA/BILL
                    Do what?
          
          Carruthers unclips his belt holster.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Shut the elevators down.
          
                                                                       72.
          
          Acosta...sensing it...keeping his back turned.
          
                                ACOSTA/BILL
                    An emergency shut down of our entire
                    elevated lift system? No sir. That
                    has to be handled by my staff.
          
          Carruthers gets a hand on the stock of the .45 on his hip.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    How long have you worked here?
                        (beat)
                    Bill.
          
          A long, drawn silence...then, static emits from Bill/Acosta's
          belt-- his walkie-talkie was working all along. Jig's up.
          
          Acosta spins back-- spring-loaded blade firing from his sleeve--
          Carruthers clears his holster-- Acosta closes the gap-- blade
          flashing, passing through Carruthers' hand, slashing tendons,
          shearing bone, hot butter.--
          
          Carruthers screams-- grip gone, gun tumbling-- instinct kicks--
          his good left hand hauls the .45 out of mid-air, clutches,
          squeezes-- BLAM! Acosta's abdomen eats the blast, burps
          blood-- Carruthers, a severed hand tucked under his chin,
          held in place-- he extends, pulls, fires again-- Ricochets
          clip overhead fluorescents, fixtures catch strays-- shatter--
          glass filament explodes-- razor slivers rain down.
          
          Acosta, struck, slumping-- a silver automatic appearing from
          his other sleeve, trigger finding finger just as the last of
          the lights flicker and die-- A beat sustained-- just hard
          breathing and fluid hitting the floor-- Everything goes stiff--
          
          --the two take silent aim in the pitch black and fire
          simultaneously, blazing away-- emptying their weapons into
          each other from inside three feet-- Gunblasts illuminate
          ghoulish features, muted screams covered in gore...
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL -- UPPER FLOOR -- SAME
          
          Georgia Sykes, concerned, finger to her ear, picking up
          something off her IFB earpiece: Muted gunshots, static-
          scrambled ...it's the sound of Carruthers and Acosta, ending
          one another's lives in the lift below...
          
                                SYKES

          Watters sweeps the penthouse level with her rifle scope.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Are you anywhere near the penthouse?

                                SYKES
                    No, but that definitely sounds like
                    shots and I don't where it's comin'
                    from--
          
                                WATTERS
                    --It's your IFB, somebody else has
                    got an earpiece, you're picking up
                    their signal--
          
                                SYKES
                    --I thought we had secure frequency.
                    Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't
                    goin' off right now.
          
          Watters hears something crackle over one of the scanners...
          a transmission to Nomad security staff...
          
                                WATTERS
                    ...Oh, fuck these fools...
          
          Sykes looks up to see the elevator has reached her floor.
          
                                SYKES
                    What's wrong?
          
                                WATTERS
                    Security's locking down the elevators.
          
          Sykes looks at the elevator doors in front of her as we...
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. ELEVATOR CAR -- SAME
          
          The Tremor Brothers, waiting arrival on the penthouse, armed
          to the teeth, each one tethered with an array of pistols,
          rifles, knives, hatchets, hacksaws; the tools of their trade;
          to be implemented in the most godless manner imaginable.
          
          Muzak drifts in over the speakers, when suddenly the car
          lurches, cables catch, brake boxes shriek and the elevator
          car comes to abrupt stop. The Brothers exchange looks as
          power is cut and they are plunged into darkness...An emergency
          recording sounds from the elevator's ceiling speaker.
          
                                WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Please remain calm...Elevator service
                    has been temporarily suspended and
                    will resume momentarily...
          
          The recording defaults into a maddening loop...then, the
          sounds of someone unzipping a bag in the dark, hands moving
          objects around, metal clanks off metal as the bag is rummaged.
          A brilliant flash, hot white to iridescent red as a road
          flare is struck, showering Darwin Tremor with a deluge of
          sparks as he holds it aloft.
          
                                                                    74.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Les' get at it then.
          
          Lester and Jeeves, effortless aplomb; the speed and dexterity
          of a seasoned pit-crew. Lester pulls a torque wrench from
          the bag, pops the panel bolts on the elevator's power box
          and strips the electrical wiring in seconds--
          
          Jeeves removes a gas-powered generator from their Mary Poppins-
          like carry-all carpet bag. He primes the pump, yanks it to
          a sputtering start and feeds the AC lead to his brother.
          Lester takes it, locates the service override conduit and
          ties in. Darwin admires this deft display of skill from his
          idiot brethren. As the elevator's power cycles back on we...
          
                                                             ...CUT TO:
          
          INT. BATHROOM -- DAY
          
          Light switch flipped on, revealing the shrunken, shriveled,
          fetal-like form that is Hollis Elmore being carried by MARGIE
          TURLOCK, 63, part-time RN, full-time souvenir shop owner. A
          substantial, tank of a woman, Margie manhandles Elmore,
          dropping him into a lukewarm bath, brimming with grey water.
          
                                 MARGIE
                    Okay sweetie, now I'm a registered
                    nurse and this was my bath not a
                    half hour ago, so it ain't as hot as
                    it could be, but we're gonna get you
                    all toasty warm in no time--
                        (beat, to boy)
                    Warren, Warren-- go on an' get grandma
                    her hot blanket and her heating bag,
                    the one in there under the sink in
                    my bathroom.
          
          Warren sniffs, licks lovingly on an ice cream sandwich, but
          never bites it.
          
                                   WARREN
                    Slower Nana.     Talk slooooooeerrrrr.
          
          Margie indulges her grandson, no end.
          
                                MARGIE
                    Okay Shug...Grandma needs you to go
                    in--
          
          --Warren begins to smile, a snarl of misshapen yellow teeth,
          smeared with chocolate, bracketed by chrome-colored braces.
          
                                MARGIE (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Oh, you little foxy, trying to fool
                    your Nana! You heard me didn't you!?
                                (MORE)
          
                                                                        75.
          
                                MARGIE (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                        (beat)
                    Now Boogie, Grandma needs her big
                    helper boy now, go on an' get those
                    things and grandma'll rub your feet!
          
                                WARREN
                    My karate feet? My crazy Karate
                    kick feet!!
          
          Warren puts the ice cream sandwich in his mouth and begins
          hopping up and down, kicking, striking the wall with great,
          disturbing ferocity. Margie cackles at this.
          
                                MARGIE
                    You little angel-butt! Grandma'll
                    rub those feet forever!
          
          Elmore, struggling against imminent death, watching this
          display with increasing dread. He scans the sink basin--
          sees it lined with anti-depressants; Ritalin, Thorazine, etc
          Warren keeps throwing hard roundhouse kicks into the wall.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    Oh you silly-sil! Never mind,
                    Grandma'll get it!
          
          Margie marches off and Warren immediately rushes over to
          the tub, placing himself directly over the inert Elmore and
          assuming a martial arts stance. He opens his mouth to speak
          and the ice cream sandwich tumbles out, landing in the tub.
          
                                WARREN
                        (barking out)
                    Bow to your opponent!
          
          Warren bows before he squares up and begins methodically
          delivering a "Kata" of punches and kicks...violently and
          expertly snapped within millimeters of Elmore's face. Elmore,
          helpless to raise his arms or defend himself, stares in horror
          as the boy, his glasses beginning to fog and drip with
          perspiration, works himself into a furious lather.
          
                                ELMORE
                        (trying to speak)
                    Pl-- kid, st-- stop...
          
          Elmore holds up his stump   of a hand,   pinky wagging in pathetic
          plea-- no use-- Warren is   in a state   of unhinged, near-animal
          frenzy-- his eyes wild, a   small, yet   prominent erection
          beginning to poke through   his karate   gee...
          
          Margie returns to the bathroom, scolds her grandson.    He
          squares up on her, feigning a blow to her face. She     clouts
          him, hard backhand, big flabby arms restraining him,    hauling
          him out of the bathroom. He bleats like a butchered     sheep.
          
                                                                      76.
          
          Elmore, left alone, stark naked, shaking-- he turns his head,
          gazing into the other room-- a newscast plays on the

                    today as authorities speculate as to
                    the apparent disappearance of a third.
                    The names of the victims are being
                    withheld, pending notification of
                    family members, but Action Seven has
                    learned that one of the deceased,

          WE SEE Hugo and Doc Gill, ducking down, Hugo still has the
          phone to his ear. As they approach a rear stairwell with a
          door that reads: "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY: PENTHOUSE LEVEL"
          two FEDS descend, chaining and bolting the door.

          Israel readies the playing card behind his back, slips it
          between his index and middle finger-- Ivy shakes his head.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    All that slight a'hand you can do

          toward Ivy, surgical strike, right eye, blood bursting at

          Ivy, doubled over-- he drags the .50 cal from its holster
          and lets fly-- FIRING. Big bore rounds rip right through
          the wall, punching dinner-plate sized holes in the plaster.
          Israel goes to the ground as Ivy, bleeding, blazes away--

          They assume quasi-combat stances; six idiots, crab-crawling
          their way across the room. Soot stays prone, plays scared,
          realizes that his rubber appliance nose has come loose, tries
          to adjust it-- can't, has to hide his face, burying it in
          his sleeve, wiping more make-up off in the process--
          
          Mustache is on point, pistol trained.    He spots Soot cowering.

          Soot shakes his head a vigorous "no" as Mustache and his men
          turn their attention to the bedroom.

          Ivy, down on one knee, depth perception shot, trying to
          reload, bullets slipping through blood-slicked fingers--
          Israel lies on the floor behind the bed, breathless, chest
          heaving, frantically trying to pull the small automatic pistol
          out of his overnight bag.
          
                                MUSTACHE

          One of the bodyguards spots the body of Beanie, lying dead
          in the remnants of the coffee table.
          
                                SECURITY MEMBER #1

                        (back to Mustache)
                    He shot Beanie!
          
                                ISRAEL
                    What?
          
          Ivy hears this, let's the gun slide from his hand, standing,
          eye swollen to a bleeding slit.
          
                                MUSTACHE
                    GET ON THE GROUND!
          
          Ivy, looking past them, seeing Beanie's lifeless body, laying
          there. Israel peers out, sees the same thing.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Jesus Christ...
          
          Two of the bodyguards rush to Beanie, bending over his body,
          checking for vitals. Ivy, suspended in the doorway, stunned.
          One of the security team looks back; no good...he's gone.
          Just then, the phone stops ringing.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                        (looking up at Ivy)

          Ivy, shocked, dismayed. Israel, starting to see his sweetheart
          deal with the Feds go up in smoke. He immediately mobilizes.
          
                                      ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                              (to Mustache)
                       Hey!
                           (pointing to Ivy)
                       Get him out-- muscle him if you have
                       to. Take him down the quietly, use
                       the service exit. Then get back up
                       here and we'll handle the rest of
                       this.
                           (off Mustache's look)
                       What? Is there somebody else in
                       there?
          
          Soot, from the other room, careful to keep his face concealed.

                       Eees Vitoli.
          
          Israel, a grimace...two too many people involved. Israel
          nods, thinking, does a bump of coke, right out in the open.
          
                                   ISRAEL

                       Okay Vitoli, listen these last few
                       minutes make you a material witness,
                       do you understand what that means?
          
                                   VITOLI

                                   ISRAEL
                       You do know what that means!
                       Tremendous, that's the attitude.
                           (beat, clutching chest)
                       Alright, Vitoli, hang tight for half
                       a tic, we've got a special sort of
                       "clean-up" we gotta do here, alright?
          
          Soot nods.
          
                                   ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                           (to Mustache)
                       What's he doing, is he getting this?
          
          Mustache, glancing over at Soot, seeing him nod.
          
                                   MUSTACHE
                       Yeah, he's nodding.
          
                                   ISRAEL
                       Good. Now Move.
          
                                                                       81.
          
          Mustache and his men brace Ivy, taking advantage of his
          disorientation and dismay and swiftly escorting him out.

          They amass around the elevator, taking care to double handcuff
          Ivy now. Mustache pushes the call button. It fails to light.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:

          one of the lifts appears to be ascending
          
                                SECURITY TEAM
                    Wait...one of 'em looks like it's on

                                MUSTACHE
                    What about the other four?   Are they
                    out?
          
          He keeps hitting the call button, but it won't light.

          INT. HALLWAY -- FOURTEENTH FLOOR -- SAME
          
          Sykes, trying to pry the elevator doors open.
          
                                SYKES
                    It ain't dead! Quit saying that
                    shit!
          
          INTERCUT WITH:
          
          INT. HORIZON HOTEL -- TOP FLOOR -- SAME
          
          Watters pours herself a glass of Chablis from the mini-bar.
          
                                                                       82.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Girl, I just saw muzzle flashes comin'
                    out that suite. S'probably where
                    you heard that shootin' earlier,
                    somebody jus' downed Israel. He
                    dead, our play is dead.
          
          Sykes, getting some separation on the elevator doors, pulling
          her 9mm, using it like a crowbar.
          
                                SYKES
                    I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
          
                                WATTERS
                    C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it
                    for a lil' bit, play some craps.
                        (beat, probing)
                    ...Maybe spend the night?
          
          Sykes, struggling, when the doors suddenly retract on their
          own...She's staggered by what she sees in the elevator,
          tripping back, heels catching, dumping her on her ass--
          
                                SYKES
                        (just above whisper)
                    ...oh...damn...
          
          She sits up, stupefied...cordite and pistol smoke drift out
          of the open elevator doors like a funeral dirge. The sound
          of a bone-saw emanates from within.
          
          INT. ELEVATOR CAR
          
          Carruthers and Acosta...wartorn, shot to hell, post-battle
          standoff, just staring, weapons emptied, bodies bullet-
          punctured, leaking life...both are breathing, but just barely.
          
                                WATTERS (OVER HEADSET)
                    What is it...?
          
          Filament and glass dust cover everything. Blood streams in
          steaming fissures, floating spent shell casings and
          fluorescent shards cover the floor of the car.
          
          Acosta, clinging to life itself, clutching the whirring bone
          saw, trying in vain to reach Carruthers. Sykes wades forward,
          wary, Glock vise-gripped.
          
                                SYKES
                    ...Shhhhhhit...girl, there's these
                    two dudes, just sittin' here in this
                    elevator, all shot up...
          
                                WATTERS
                    What?
          
                                                                       83.
          
                                SYKES
                        (beat, looking around)
                    They musta been beefin' big time
                    with one another, cuz this shit, got
                    way past words, whatever it was.
          
                                WATTERS
                    ...What are they doin' right now...?
          
          Sykes, glancing from Carruthers to Acosta. A beat.
          
                                 SYKES
                    Right now?
                        (beat)
                    ...Dying.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. "LAKEY'S SOUVENIR SHOPPE" -- KITCHENETTE -- DAY
          
          Elmore, seated, wrapped in quilts and heated blankets,
          shivering horribly, lips blackened, flexing brittle fingers
          on his good hand, trying to restore feeling, teeth clattering
          like ten thousand tea cups. Margie Turlock enters, arms
          loaded down, grandson Warren hot on her heels, a set of
          Nunchukas under his arm...
          
          ...Elmore, palpable hatred, pure bile for the boy.
          
          Margie sets the assortment of goods down on the table in
          front of Elmore; tourist-themed hats & sweatsuits from the
          shop, a pair of thermals, a collection of pill bottles and
          what appears to be an old Vietnam-era ammo box.
          
                                MARGIE
                    So them fellas were your friends
                    then? The ones that was shot and
                    tossed into the lake? Were they police
                    officers too?
          
          Elmore nods, rifling the pile in front of him, going for the
          pills. Margie pulls a pot of coffee off the stove, pours a
          mug. Sets it down in front of him.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                        (motioning to pills)
                    Them was left over from my
                    hysterectomy, so they're a few years
                    old, might be outta date.
          
          Elmore eyes the labels; Vicodin, Vioxx...morphine-based.
          Nice...Just numb it all.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    You sure you don't want me to call
                    an ambulance honey?
                                (MORE)
          
                                                                    84.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    I think it's crazy you not going
                    in...y'got what looks like hypothermia
                    and real bad frostbite. They could
                    wind up amputatin' if y'don't get it
                    treated.
          
          Warren sits in the chair next to Elmore and begins mimicking
          him, shaking epileptically, doing his doofus bit, tucking
          three fingers away, waving a stump, belly-laughing...
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    Warren! Now you go and practice
                    your nunchucks now, leave us be for
                    a bit Shug.
          
          Warren scowls, getting up, in super-slow motion, making sounds
          with his mouth as he stands, robotic whirs, buzzes, clicks--
          Margie chuckles at her grandson, she can't help it--
          
          Then, in a blur, Warren snaps, abruptly slamming the nunchakas
          on the table, the rebounding portion of the weapon almost
          hitting Elmore in the face. He bolts the room before Grandma
          can scold him, his titters echoing off like taunts...
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    ...M'sorry about that boy, his momma
                    abandoned him going on a year now,
                    his daddy, my boy Dale-- Gulf War
                    vet, s'over in the Reno-Washoe
                    Correctional facility-- got some
                    "clarity" issues. He did some home
                    invasion sodomy-torture type stuff,
                    wrote a buncha bad checks, got hisself
                    consecutive life terms-- shipped off
                    to Soledad there in California.
                        (beat, scribbles
                         something down)
                    --reminds me, I got that care package
                    I need to send off--
                        (beat, continues lament)
                    Anyhoo, m'husband Bill took the
                    coward's route, n'committed suicide
                    by hangin' 'bout nine months back.
                    Ever since then, little Boogie there's
                    been the man'a the house!
                        (beat, gnarled grin)
                    And we make a darn cute couple I
                    think!
          
          Margie, cackling again-- the facade of sanity showing serious
          signs of strain...Elmore pulls the ammo box across the table.
          Stenciled on the side: "177th Airborne Division -- Charlie
          Company - Reckon" He cracks the lid.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    I don't think that's been opened
                    since my husband died.
          
                                                                    85.
          
          Inside, army memorabilia and bric-a-brac; patches, service-
          tags, dog-earred b&w polaroids, ancient titty mags, (which
          make Margie horribly uncomfortable) Saigon bottled beer and
          most importantly, a .357 Colt Python.
          
          Elmore lifts it, looks it over, feels the heft, drops the
          chamber-- it's loaded. He sifts some more, palms loose bullets
          at the bottom of the box. He cracks a blackened grin, rolling
          the pistol's chamber and snapping it shut as we...
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          A padlock being locked and secured.
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL:
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL -- LOBBY
          
          Elevators and access doors locked down indefinitely. Casino
          and hotel patrons file out in less than orderly fashion.
          Craps players, pissed that their "hot streaks" have been cut
          short, harangue police and sheriff's personnel in passing.
          Barflys and blackjack habituates, accustomed to staying in
          one spot for months on end, have to be manually removed.
          
          The four call girls, trying to argue their way past security
          and onto one of the elevators, realizing they're not getting
          anywhere near the Penthouse level. Messner coordinates the
          Nomad's exodus, continually adjusting his earpiece, trying
          to contact Carruthers, two agents flank him.
          
                                 MESSNER
                         (to agent)
                    I want you to locate Agent Carruthers
                    now.
                         (beat, to another
                          agent)
                    The guests that aren't able to leave
                    need to be confined to their suites.
                    And under no circumstances are they
                    to venture out, for any reason. Have
                    the staff make calls to that effect.
          
          The pimply Casino Employee is at the center of an intensive
          on-spot interrogation being conducted by a group of agents.
          Messner arrives, stares at the kid.
          
                                MESSNER (CONT'D)
                    This him?
          
                                FBI AGENT
                        (nodding, then to kid)
                    Alright Ricky, I want you to explain
                    to Agent Messner exactly what
                    happened and do it slowly please.
          
          The kid, head bobbing, gnawing fingernails, cuticles mangled.
          
                                                                      86.
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah, ye-- I-- uh, there were,
                    earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
          
                                MESSNER
                    --Agent Carruthers. Do you know where
                    is he now?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    He uh-- he asked about-- I'm-- he
                    wanted to know whic-- what floor
                    security was on, then I saw him get
                    on the elevator with the other agent.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (quick, thrown)
                    Wait a minute, what other agent?
                        (beat, to others)
                    What other agent?
          
                                FBI AGENT
                    I have no idea. It wasn't anybody
                    from our office.
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    He said he was from San Francisco.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Did he give you his name?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah, uh-- it was Spanish-somethin'
                    Garcia, or Diego, uh--
          
                                MESSNER
                        (to other agents)
                    --run both those names through the
                    D.C. database. Call San Francisco,
                    see if they've got anybody in the
                    field doing collateral inquiries for--
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    --he was wearing one of our jackets.
          
          Messner stops cold.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Who?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    The other agent. He said he was here
                    to do an inspection and later, when
                    he got on the elevator with the other
                    guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing

          Messner turns, bores in on the kid, no more bullshit now.

                                MESSNER
                    This man wearing the jacket identified
                    himself as an Federal agent?
          
                                   CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Uh, yeah.
          
                                   MESSNER
                    You're sure?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah, he had the badge and everything.
                    It said "FBI" on it.
          
                                MESSNER
                    And when you saw him later, he was
                    wearing one of your security jackets--
          
                                   CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah.
          
                                MESSNER
                    And that didn't seem odd to you?
          
          The kid glances around, oops-- my mistake-- tries to amend.

          Israel, sickly, face bloodless, sitting down on a couch,
          setting the small handgun down on the table next to him. He
          digs at his chest now, in considerable pain, rotating his
          arm around, trying to rouse it.

                    this out...
          
          He takes out his cellphone, dialing Morris Mecklen. Soot
          appears behind him, easing the 9mm out of his waistband and
          resuming his stalk...ever...so...slowly.

          Suddenly, the stairwell doors are flung open, revealing Hugo
          and Gill. All guns whip simultaneously to that spot.

          Sykes turns back to him, moving over to his now still form--
          blood drenched, barely conscious, eyes flittering like black
          flies...she kicks the bone saw from his hand. It spins to a
          gradual stop. She leans over him...the stiletto blade he
          used to dispatch "Bill" and hack Carruthers digits off has
          retracted back into his sleeve.
          
          Sykes begins patting him down, moving dangerously close to
          that sleeve, her neck hovering right above that spot--

          off ice inside, pulls surgical tools from it-- scalpel,
          forceps rib-spreader, etc., He arranges them pre-op style.
          He removes a phone from his jacket, hits "Send" waits, says:

          Israel turns back, sees this demented version of Vitoli aiming
          at gun right in his face. Israel's breathing suddenly cinches
          up tight, his pulse triple-timing. He turns back to Gill.

          She glances down at Carruthers, sees his IFB in his lap,
          realizes that's where the voice is coming from. Plugs it
          into her ear.
          
                                MESSNER'S VOICE (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Stay low, breach on my mark...
          
          Sykes, covering Carruthers' IFB, whispering into her own.

          INT. HORIZON HOTEL -- TOP FLOOR -- SAME
          
          Watters, re-targeting, bringing the Barrett .50 to bear on
          the lower floors, sighting down from the top, counting back
          to fourteen, settling, locking off the tripod, gazing through
          her scope... HEARTBEAT BUILDING STILL, becoming more erratic.
          
          WATTERS POV: Fourteenth floor, big glass windows, drawn
          curtains...she nuzzles the eyepiece, finger slipping
          delicately inside the trigger guard...waiting.

          INT. ELEVATOR CAR -- SAME
          
          With Sykes attention diverted, Acosta begins slowly moving
          his hand toward his pant leg, reaching for a hidden ankle-
          holster as we--
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          --Mustache and his men, hands going to their rigs, shoulder
          and waist. A handcuffed Ivy watches with them as the elevator
          doors open and a big plume of black smoke vacates the car,
          eerily cast light burns blood red within, infernal, hellish.
          Now, another pull engine leaps to life from inside the car,
          this one gnarled and guttural, winding out...a chainsaw.
          
          HEARTBEAT JACKHAMMERING NOW. Out of control.
          
          The sound falls away, leaving only the runaway throb of the
          beating heart as we--

          THE HEARTBEAT crescendos wildly, out-of-control...

          HUGO -- Looking on in horror as Israel collapses.
          
          DOC GILL -- Rushing to Buddy's aide.
          
          SOOT -- Bringing the 9mm up, leveling it on Hugo.
          
          CAMERA MOVES OUT INTO THE PENTHOUSE HALLWAY PAST:
          
          MUSTACHE -- Sensing grave danger, his gun being drawn. His
          m
           en following suit.
          
          IVY -- Pulling away from his captors, looking for cover.
          
          DARWIN TREMOR -- Stepping from the elevator, strapped with
          a
            sawed-off pump shotgun in one hand, a vintage elephant gun
          in the other, looking for lives to end.
          
          s
          LESTER TREMOR -- Chainsaw snarling, spewing oil, psycho smile
           preading viral across a pockmarked face.
          
          JEEVES TREMOR -- Sledgehammer in a scabbard on his back,
          h
           olding WWII era German "Potato-Masher" grenades, gripped
          like drumsticks, pins pulled. He hurls them.
          
          CAMERA MOVES PAST THEM, DOWN ELEVATOR SHAFT TO:
          
          SYKES -- Pulling extra clips from her handbag, securing them
          under her garter belt, dumping her heels in favor of hose.
          
          ACOSTA -- Pant leg lifted, moving panther-quiet, tortoise-
          slow, unfastening the snap on his ankle-holster.
          
          c
          CARRUTHERS -- Near death, eyes locked on Acosta, his mortal
           ombatant, trying desperately to reach his own ankle holster.
          
          MESSNER -- Watching as his team moves into place around the
          e
           levator. Checking his own piece, flicking off the safety.
          
          CAMERA MOVES OUT THE WINDOW AND UP TO:
          
          WATTERS -- In the Hotel window across the way, sniper-rifle

           nug to her shoulder, eye on the scope, waiting for the word.
          
          CAMERA MOVES THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE UP TO AND INSIDE EARPIECE
          
          Inside the earpiece at 10000x normal magnification; micro-
          sound condensers and circuits the size of skyscrapers. Then,
          a voice makes the landscape tremble, like the trump of God:
          
                                SYKES
                    Bring it.

          Back out of the earpiece, down through the scope, over the
          barrel of the rifle...BOOM...A .50 caliber bullet is birthed.
          
          CAMERA TRAVELS BACK TO:
          
          The fourteenth floor window of the Nomad detonates with
          concussive ferocity-- creating a hailstorm of shattered glass
          that sweeps the length of the hallway, engulfing cops and
          feds whole.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          Another round tears in after it, exploding a gilded ceiling
          stanchion, sparking off the rebar, tripping the sprinkler
          system, dousing the corridor-- everybody runs for cover.
          
          One of the AGENTS, wounded, summons another elevator.
          Messner, undeterred, advances on the elevator containing
          Sykes and Carruthers.
          
          CAMERA TRAVELING BACK
          
          Sykes, Glock ready to rock, about to move. Acosta, pulling
          a pistol from his ankle-rig, preparing to backshoot Sykes.
          
          CAMERA ASCENDS BACK UP THROUGH SHAFT
          
          Chaos. Carnage. Full blown bloodbath. Heavily-armed men on
          an overkill override. Mustache and Co., waging close quarters
          warfare with the Brothers Tremor. Bullets blaze, bodies
          drop, everything burns--
          
          CAMERA CONTINUES PAST SCENE TO:
          
          Soot, shooting Hugo several times-- Hugo falling back,
          confused by the abrupt pain, baffled by the appearance of
          blood. Gill, overtop of Israel, trying to force feed him
          nitro-glycerin tablets. Buddy goes into full cardiac arrest.
          
          Disparate sounds collide now, swell to a great tumult-- an
          incomprehensible crescendo of explosions and chainsaws and
          gunshots and screams as we--
          
          CUT TO BLACK

          HARD CUT UP ON:
          
          All of it happening at lightspeed. Watters, reloading,
          watching as leaden contrails of gunsmoke pour from the
          pulverized fourteenth floor. She resumes her assault.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          Messner, a few feet from the car containing Sykes. More
          sniper fire rakes the hallway. Another elevator arrives,
          opens...call girls inside. They snuck up somehow, past
          security... The gunplay gets them spooked, scared-- they
          scramble from the car-- cops and feds try to stuff them back
          inside the elevator as rounds continue to rain down.
          
          One of the girls catches a hard ricochet, wig leaping off
          her head as a bounced bullet punches through her skull-- she
          crumbles, instant casualty. Messner hardly notices, moving
          instead toward the other elevator car.
          
                                MESSNER
                    THIS IS THE FBI! THROW YOUR WEAPON
                    OUT! SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!

                        (whispering into IFB)
                    Are these feds fake or for real girl!
          
          Carruthers, pawing feebly at her, moaning-- trying to warn
          her-- she shrugs him off.
          
                                WATTERS

                    these mafuckas off my as--
          
          BANG-- Sykes squeals, spins back, feels numbness spread over
          her legs and lower trunk, knows she's been shot.
          
                                                                       97.

                       We're out girl! I'm shot! I'M SHOT!--
          
          ACOSTA fires again, bullet ripping through her studded
          bustier, gouging kevlar, nicking ribcage-- embedding into
          the IFB receiver on her hip, ruining it. Sykes falters--
          tries to raise her gun--
          
          Acosta raises his aim to her head, about to deliver the coup
          de grace-- Messner appears now, sees Acosta, sights him when--
          
          BLAM!BLAM!    BLAM!!
          
          Acosta's chest explodes, he slumps, the gun sliding away--
          Messner swings wide on the car to reveal:
          
          Carruthers, smoking gun, trembling aim, exposed ankle
          holster...empty. Sykes, kevlar burning, smashed round still
          hot, she tries to pull her vest off, finds her newly paralyzed
          arm uncooperative. Messner, advancing now, keeping an eye
          on his partner as he moves toward the car.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       LADY, SHOW ME YOUR HANDS RIGHT NOW!
          
                                   SYKES
                       I NEED MY HANDS MOTHERFUCKER! I'M
                       HIT! KILL ME OR LET ME BE!
          
          Messner enters the elevator, rushes to the doomed Carruthers.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       How bad?
          
                                   CARRUTHERS
                       Mortal.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       No.
          
                                   CARRUTHERS
                       Yeah.
          
          Messner takes his partner under the arms, lugging him into
          the open hallway, stripping off his shirt. Carruthers severed
          hand nearly falls away from the rest of his arm.
          
          Acosta spits blood from the lungs-- his breathing now a bog
          of pinched snorts and gurgles.
          
                                   MESSNER
                           (re: Acosta, yelling
                            to the others)
                       SECURE THIS SUSPECT!
          
          TWO FEDS enter to remove Acosta from the car-- he lets out a
          guttural yelp as they hoist him-- real pain or playing possum,
          
                                                                       98.
          
          impossible to tell...As his legs clear the elevator doors,
          they slowly close on the wounded Sykes.
          
          Messner, tries to prevent them from closing, can't-- gazes
          up at the digital counter as the elevator continues its ascent
          to the Penthouse level...
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Sykes, riding up, wounded, vulnerable, trying to reach the
          control panel to stop the car. She keys her now useless IFB.

          hitting the hallway, double-timing to the stairwell...She
          has no idea that she's lost radio contact with Watters.

          Plaster and debris everywhere, sprinklers tripped, most of
          Mustache's team shot, shredded or burnt to a crisp. Pieces
          of building and bodies either waterlogged or fully ablaze.
          Mustache and Darwin play duck and cover, exchanging fire.
          Jeeves, out of grenades, sledgehammer swinging, crushing
          wall studs, scattering remaining security team members.
          
          Ivy, sheltered, having survived the opening salvos, gets
          ahold of a gun from a chainsaw-shorn former security member;
          Lester sees Ivy arming himself, blitzes him-- chainsaw
          snarling, revved out, sending fantails of gristle and chipped
          bone everywhere. Less than fifteen feet separate them.
          
          Ivy fires, shots deflected off the blade's teeth, seconds
          from getting gutted-- he adjusts his aim high, emptying the
          gun into Lester's chest, bullets blazing haywire, blowing
          out between Lester's shoulders, stopping a hard charge cold.
          
                                                                       99.
          
          Lester, lopsided, bullet-dazed, drools blood...then dies.
          Ivy dumps his clip, searches for another-- the chainsaw falls,
          stalls.
          
          Jeeves, hefting the sledgehammer like a hayseed John Henry,
          looks over as his older brother's life come to an end. He
          reacts badly.
          
                                JEEVES TREMOR
                    LESTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
          
          Jeeves buries the sledge in a wall, takes up the chainsaw,
          rips the pullcord, resumes the charge--
          
          Ivy, finds a clip, slams it in the stock, points, pulls--
          trigger-stick, hammer-jam. He falls to his back, scurrying
          away, trouble finding traction, soles slipping-- he keeps
          pulling the trigger. Jeeves straddles him from above, raises
          the saw like a great wooden stake, about to bring it down--
          
          --BAM!
          
          Ivy's automatic discharges. The round splits the saw's gas
          tank, spritzing fuel, dousing Jeeves-- A beat before the
          tank suddenly arcs, exploding, lighting Jeeves up like a
          four-hundred pound bonfire, bouncing him off the walls; a
          human Hindenberg, fully engulfed. He flails, burns, howls,
          falls...molten fat melts off his body like lard butter...
          
          Darwin, dismayed, both brothers down...He moves on Mustache,
          dispatches him with detached efficiency, snapping his neck
          clean. He then starts toward Ivy, who's trying desperately
          to crawl out of there.

          Soot's gun has jammed. He clears it efficiently, patiently
          reloading the weapon as Doc Gill, in panic mode, performs

          being tended to by a team of agents. In the b.g. Cops and
          Feds gather near the window, searching for the assailant,
          binoculars and rifle scopes strafing the Horizon hotel across
          the way, concentrating at the open window near the top floor.

          WATTERS, running up the hallway, past alarmed maid service
          and hotel staff. She reaches the lower floor window and
          raises the scope to her eye, searching for Sykes--
          
                                WATTERS
                    Girl, where are you-- talk to me...how

          WATTERS POV
          
          She sees the Feds and Cops in the Nomad window across the
          way. Smoke clears, her field of vision through the scope
          expands, sharpens.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                    Georgia goddamn baby, please talk to
                    me, please say somethin' so--
          
          --And that's when she spots the call girl, face obscured,
          lying dead from a headshot in the hallway...her heart
          sinks...and she assumes the worst: Sykes is dead.

          She flicks to full-auto and opens fire right through the
          glass in front of her-- big gas-ejected shells pop from the
          breach like bowling pins-- the gathered throng across the
          way in the Nomad window seem to vaporize in a violent collage
          of heat, blood and building chunks-- Watters bucks big sobs,
          blasting away with the Barrett...

          a black bra and mini-skirt, blood dribbling over her midriff,
          deep indentation near her sternum-- big yellow bruise in
          bloom-- the bullet didn't penetrate...her elevator arrives
          at the penthouse level and as the doors open we--

          Darwin, looming over Ivy, about to bring the sledge down
          squarely on his skull-- the elevator doors open in his
          periphery... He looks over, sees Sykes standing there, barely
          clothed, wet with blood, gun in her hand...and grins.
          
                                                                      101.
          
          Sykes, seeing Darwin standing over Ivy, holding a sledgehammer--
          recognizes him as the perv from earlier. She levels the Glock,
          stepping out of the elevator, steadying herself against the
          wall, steadying her aim on Darwin's head.

          Then, the sound of an helicopter intrudes, rotor thrum,
          building steadily, growing louder-- the floor seems to shake
          as the chopper approaches-- nervous eyes dart-- nobody moves.

          a flush headshot. Gill, frantic, rapid chest compressions
          on Israel, who gags, starts, coughs, heart back up and
          beating. His watery gaze moves from Gill to Soot, who know
          stands overtop of him, aiming the 9mm down at him.
          
          Israel averts his eyes...the end has come. He looks over
          and sees his lamb-skin coat, lying there, soaking in Beanie's
          blood, ruined beyond recognition. A tear escapes his eye.

          the ceiling begins to tremble and shake...the sound of a
          helicopter filling the air.

          ...sees that the bag containing Elmore's severed fingers has
          fallen from his pocket. Doesn't remember hanging onto them.
          He replaces them in his pocket. Looks down at his dead

          diving in as the doors close--
          
          Sykes, stumbling toward Ivy. He sees she's injured, scoops
          her up like a new bride-- she places something in his

          it-- agents approach, combat crouches, MP-5's at arms.

          Commotion and confusion swirl. The Agent, unsure, searching
          for some confirmation-- can't find it, dismisses them and
          rushes into the Penthouse. Sykes and Ivy slip out the exit.

              (taps her gun)
          Straight rockin' heat and slayin'
          niggas--
          
                      SIR IVY
          For real?
          
                      SYKES
          Mmm-hmm...and your boy very well
          mighta been one of 'em.
          
                      SIR IVY
          True?
          
                      SYKES
          Like a mafucka.
          
                      SIR IVY
          That takes some of the sting out.
          
                      SYKES
          I probably woulda busted on you too
          ...and what a shame that woulda been.
          
                      SIR IVY
          I feel like I know you girl. I feel
          like I've known you forever.
              (beat, smiles)
          You gonna lemme see your scars?
          
                      SYKES
          You do the right thing. Sit with me
          while I heal, let it develop slow.
          
                                                                   105.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    What were you doin' here anyway?
          
                                SYKES
                    'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy
                    Israel.
          
          This gets Ivy's biggest grin.
          
                                SYKES (CONT'D)
                    Damn baby girl, you makin' a nigga
                    fall hard now.
          
          He reaches the seventeenth floor, rounds the corner, nearly
          runs into Messner, has a gun thrust in his face.
          
                                MESSNER
                    F.B.I. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST! PUT HER
                    DOWN, GET UP AGAINST THAT WALL!
          
          Sykes recognizes him and in a blink has a gun under his chin.
          
                                SYKES
                    Don't play out this string, 'cuz
                    it's real short I didn't do your man
                    downstairs. I found him that way.
                    Now whether or not you believe that
                    ain't the least bit important. We
                    either goin' work this out and live,
                    or stay doin' the shit we been doin'
                    and die. Now I got no beef with you,
                    or wit ya'll bureau...so you better
                    off jus' movin' on & lettin' us be.
          
          Messner, eyes moving from Ivy to Sykes. Stalemate, no sense
          pushing. He moves past them, hits the stairwell exit on
          eighteen. Ivy and Sykes resume their trek down the stairs.
          
          INT. HALLWAY -- PENTHOUSE FLOOR
          
          Messner, bashing in from the stairwell. WHIP PAN OVER TO
          REVEAL: The Swede, still accompanied by the Sparazza goons,
          arriving in the elevator at the same time.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. ELEVATOR
          
          Darwin, on his way down, rolling around on the floor of the
          car, covering himself in congealed blood and bullet casings,
          slicking back his hair, losing the security jacket, splashing
          yet more blood on himself. Satisfied, he snatches Carruthers'
          F.B.I. credentials up off the floor...and waits.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          INT. HORIZON HOTEL -- FOURTEENTH FLOOR -- SAME
          
          The elevator arrives at the far end. A small asian man
          carrying a stack of clean towels steps off and starts down
          the hall-- sees Watters, sees the .45 trained on him-- does
          an abrupt about face and disappears back inside the car.
          
          Watters lowers the gun, wipes tears, the area around her is
          littered with spent .50 caliber shells. The fourteenth floor
          of the Nomad is now empty. Sirens wail in the distance.
          Down below, Watters can see a bevy of law enforcement
          personnel streaming toward the Horizon. She slowly takes
          the Barrett off the ledge, begins breaking it down, glancing
          up at the Penthouse of the Nomad as we...
          
                                                             ...CUT TO:
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT -- SAME
          
          Director Locke waits. Messner and The Swede appear in the
          doorway. The Swede nods to all concerned and starts toward
          Israel. Doc Gill acknowledges the Swede.
          
                                DR. GILL
                    Dr. Ingstrom, he's had a mild cardiac
                    episode and recurring arrhythmia,
                    I've given him 60cc's of Nobuneatol...
          
          The Swede kneels down next to Israel, dropping his black
          valise, cracking it open. Messner, dazed, dumbfounded, sees
          Locke.
          
                                MESSNER
                    ...Deputy Director Locke?
          
          Locke approaches, lays a comforting arm on Messner, guiding
          him to a chair.
          
                                 LOCKE
                    Here. Sit.   Please.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (pointing to Swede)
                    This is him? The hitman hired to
                    kill Israel? He's a doctor?
          
                                LOCKE
                    Difficult to explain everything now...
                        (beat, toward Israel)
                    And much larger issues loom.
                        (beat)
                    I'm sorry about Carruthers...Damndest
                    thing to have to die for.
          
          The Swede, working on Israel, shaking his head, something's
          wrong. He stands, crosses to Locke, silently confers.
          
                                                                   107.

                        (to The Swede)
                    Very well.
                        (to other Agents)
                    Take Mr. Israel to the roof, he'll
                    be traveling with us.
          
          Suddenly, Soot breaks from his captors, sprinting for the
          shattered Penthouse windows, launching himself-- a swan dive
          out into the open air-- He hangs there for a moment, an
          aesthetically striking form; like Lazarus cast against a
          cobalt blue sky, backlit by the sun from the lake below--
          
          --till gravity grabs, pulls-- plummeting him toward earth,
          sending him headlong into the vast expanse of concrete below.
          This startlingly event is dismissed by mutual shrugs and a
          collective lack of concern.
          
          Messner is absolutely agog.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (to Locke, forceful)
                    What the hell-- What is this!? People
                    died. Agent Carruthers is dead!

                    We have to transport Mr. Israel to

                    The gulfstream is standing by on the
                    jetway at Tahoe International. I'm
                    sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing
                    anymore information. Return to
                    Washington. You'll be debriefed in
                    the coming days.
          
          Locke says no more-- starts out of the Penthouse with the
          Swede, Dr. Gill and Buddy Israel in tow. A Bureau forensics
          team arrives to quietly tag and bag the dead...Messner stands
          there, absolutely agog.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Hives of activity. Cordons and crime scene lockdowns like
          onion layers, multiple law enforcement agencies, confounded,
          confused-- too many cooks, too many kitchens. Nobody knows
          who the hells in charge. Local paramedics and EMT's cart
          out the wounded. Coroners and M.E.'s cart out the dead.
          
          Reporters and national news outlets crowd police barricades
          outside, competing for coverage, as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Acosta is wheeled through the lobby, hooked up to IV and
          oxygen, looking ghastly, like something exhumed. He catches
          the eye of the pimply casino employee and manages a wink.
          
                                                                   108.
          
          He's flex-cuffed to the gurney and pushed against the wall
          for the moment as the Agents move off to deal with the recent
          appearance of Lazlo Soot-- whose body has been unceremoniously
          splattered over the parking lot.
          
          As the Agents depart, Acosta peers down at his shackles;
          simple plastic binding rods-- he smiles...a moment later the
          stiletto blade fires from his sleeve as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Darwin Tremor staggering out of an open elevator, blood-
          sodden, head down-- FBI badge held aloft for all its worth.
          Playing it up, free pass, Agents rush in, hold him upright,
          help him toward a line of awaiting ambulances outside as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Ivy and Sykes, being released from the stairwell, cut chains
          sliding off-- Ivy holds up pilfered FBI creds. Rampant
          confusion makes the moment possible. He's waved through,
          carrying Sykes, looking every bit the good Samaritan.
          
          Sykes, a mess of mascara, adorned in her unmentionables,
          looking every bit the prostitute she appears to be-- she
          spots the woman at the counter from earlier. The woman gazes
          back, jaw agape. Sykes can only shrug...if you can't beat
          'em-- join 'em. She and Ivy cross the lobby as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Messner...morose, exiting another elevator with the sheet-
          draped body of Carruthers on a gurney. Gandersen, the Nomad
          owner, spots him, starts over, looks to unleash, gets close
          enough to catch Messner's expression. Sees it in his
          eyes...enough dead bodies for one day. Messner continues
          moving through the lobby, hears the chopper taking off as--
          
          CAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL:
          
          Through the clear glass atrium of the Nomad, the Bell-Ranger
          goes airborne against an impossibly clear winter sky, banking
          south toward Las Vegas.
          
          CAMERA TILTS DOWN TO REVEAL:
          
          The Horizon hotel across the way: The Fourteenth floor window.
          
          INT. HORIZON HOTEL -- FOURTEENTH FLOOR -- DAY
          
          Watters, gear stowed, seemingly indifferent about the level
          of law enforcement heading up her way, about to launch an
          Alamo-like last stand in honor of her fallen sista.
          
          She hears commotion erupt from outside as survivors begin
          filing from the building. She takes up the Barrett, gazing
          through the scope, looking, looking, looking...stops...holy
          shit...it's her. It's Sykes.
          
                                                                   109.
          
          And she's alive and being carried by a man, a big gorgeous
          black man that she's gazing upon with utter love and longing.
          A boulder-sized lump takes shape in Watters throat; betrayed,
          backbit-- tears come to fast to contain, too many to control.
          
          Numbed...the sensation leaving her fingers, she finds herself
          racking the bolt on the Barrett and gazing through
          crosshairs...taking aim on Ivy's head. Behind her, the
          elevator arrives, an a dozen armed cops, hoo-rah from it,
          hustling the length of the hall, descending down on her--
          
                                WATTERS
                        (whispering)

          BOOM!
          
          EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE -- NOMAD HOTEL -- SAME
          
          A gunshot in the distance followed by shrieks-- Darwin Tremor
          snaps his head around at the sound, moving past platoons of
          Cops and Feds now rushing that way. His I.D. is out,
          affording him easy egress. He hops the stairs up, top level,
          Barracuda parked at the rear of the lot. As he approaches...
          
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hey...
          
          Darwin glances over at...Hollis Elmore, standing there, skin
          horribly discolored, disease afflicted. He wears a hooded
          tourist sweatsuit; "Ta-Hoe, Ta-Hoe It's Off To Fun We Go!"
          stitched in cursive across the front. He's holding the Colt
          Python against his hip.
          
                                ELMORE
                        (nodding to Cuda)
                    That your car?
          
          Darwin, a beat, what-to-do...hillbilly-acumen in overdrive.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    No, I'm confiscating it.
                        (holding up badge)
                    F.B.I.
          
          Now Elmore raises the Colt with his good hand, advancing on
          Darwin, moving gingerly, his legs not quite there...
          
                                ELMORE
                    You're F.B.I.?
          
          Darwin tries to stay tight, composed.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    That's right...and I'd advise y'ta
                    lower your weapon sir.
          
          Elmore keeps coming.
          
                                                                   110.

                    Ww...uh...
          
                                ELMORE
                    Three men were ambushed and shot,
                    two died and had their bodies tossed
                    into the lake, the other has severe
                    hypothermia, possible dementia and
                    will probably be a multiple amputee
                    by week's end...if he even lives
                    that long.
          
          Darwin, uh-oh...
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    No, I ain't even heard abou--
          
          --Oops.

                        (even more menace)
                    You "ain't"--
                        (beat, teeth clenched)
                    You have any idea how close to death
                    I've been? You understand that I'm
                    dying now? That I've survived bullets
                    and frostbite and raging fever--
                        (holding up hand)
                    missing fingers and every fucking
                    imaginable horror in between?
          
          Darwin...speechless...he's done.
          
                                ELMORE (CONT'D)
                    And I'm asking you now, "Is that
                    your car" and you can't even come
                    clean and do me the decency of a
                    straight answer, with the fucking
                    state that I'm in!?
          
          Elmore, that Colt looking like a cannon this close to Darwin.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Yeah, shit-- hell, you're right. I'm
                    sorry.
          
                                ELMORE
                    You shot me and murdered my friends.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    I did. We-- yeah, I know.
          
                                                                   111.
          
                                ELMORE
                    And threw us into the lake.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Pretty much, yep.
          
          Elmore, still nodding.
          
                                ELMORE
                    And this is your car, isn't it?
          
                                   DARWIN TREMOR
                    Mmm-hmm.
          
                                ELMORE
                    But there were more of you?
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Yeah, m'brothers...They didn't make
                    it.
          
                                   ELMORE
                    Two of 'em?
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                        (nods, tears flow)
                    Thass' right.
                        (beat, wiping eyes)
                    I got other brother's though, so it
                    ain't so bad.
          
                                ELMORE
                    You were here huntin' a man named
                    Israel, weren't you? Your name is
                    Tremor.
          
          Darwin gazes up at Elmore, some fraternal bond forms.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    I was. It is...That who you was here
                    for? Israel?
          
          A pause. Elmore nods.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
                    Well...we both got beat out then,
                    didn't we?
          
          Darwin, slowly lowering the Colt.
          
                                ELMORE
                    Yes we did...
                        (long pause, then)
                    Now, give me your car keys. And get
                    the fuck out of here.
          
          Darwin, sifting through his pockets, tossing Elmore the keys.
          
                                                                     112.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    S'fair...lemme just grab somethin'.
          
          Elmore brings the Colt back up.   Darwin, hands up, hold on--
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
                    No, no, no, I'm done with all that.
          
          He reaches in, pulls a joint off the dashboard, forages,
          finds matches, lights up, starts off.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
                        (to 'Cuda)
                    Probably needs to be tuned. Air
                    filter's old. Plugs might be bad.
                    Heater and AC ain't worked in forever.
                        (seeing Elmore waver)
                    There's some good drugs in the glove
                    box there, homespun, keep you smiling,
                    semi-lucid at leas'...
                        (beat, puffing away)
                    Well, God's speed t'ya then. Sorry
                    'bout all that. S'way a'the world
                    though, winners and losers y'know.
                    S'way it's always goin' be...
          
          Darwin, walking away, taking huge hits off that joint,
          traipsing down the steps, getting stoned out of his mind.
          Elmore, considering, re-considering, looking at that Colt.
          
                                ELMORE
                    ...Oh, fuck that...
          
          --As he back shoots Darwin with all six rounds from the
          Python, blowing holes through him. Darwin goes lop-sided,
          legs failing, lit-joint still smoking in his mouth as dies
          standing, only to fall like cut timber seconds later.
          
          Elmore acts quickly, sliding into the 'Cuda and starting it,
          that big block Hemi roaring to life under the hood.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. NOMAD HOTEL AND CASINO -- DAY
          
          Pedestrians and passerbys drawn to the commotion at the Nomad,
          the bottleneck bogs traffic down, making it impossible to
          move. Elmore crouches low as police and emergency personnel
          cross in front of the car... Slowly, the crosswalk begins to
          thin and then finally clear...save a single man:
          
          Messner...standing right in front of the Barracuda, staring
          at the tires, staring at Elmore. The two lock eyes as he
          moves around to the driver's side, reaching into his pocket--
          
          --Elmore lifts the Colt up off his lap, putting his heavily
          bandaged hand on the wheel. Then he sees Messner's FBI creds,
          clipped to his belt-- can't tell if this one's legit.
          
                                                                   113.
          
          He sets the Colt down on the floorboard as Messner walks up,
          pulling a plastic bag from his pocket: The one containing
          three severed fingers. He glances down at Elmore's mummified
          left hand, holding out the bag for him to take.
          
          Elmore, unsure, accepting the bag, seeing what's inside,
          embarrassed by it-- he sets it down on the seat next to him.
          
                                 MESSNER
                     Your friends were taken to Carson
                     City Memorial, they're going to be
                     autopsied and shipped back for burial.
          
                                 ELMORE
                     I'll take care of it.
          
          Messner, nodding. A beat.
          
                                 MESSNER
                     Who owned this car?
          
          Beat.
          
                                 ELMORE
                     The ones that killed 'em.
          
          Beat.   Messner nods.
          
                                 MESSNER
                     Where are they now?
          
          Elmore looks up at him-- what does it matter...
          
                                 ELMORE
                     I just want to go home man...I just
                     want to go home and forget this
                     fucking place even exists.
          
                                 MESSNER
                     Where's that? Home.

                     Las Vegas.
          
          Messner, a thought, then:
          
                                 MESSNER
                     You're injured...Let me drive.
          
          CUT TO BLACK
          
          FADE UP ON:
          
          INT. CEDARS SINAI -- LAS VEGAS NEVADA -- DAY
          
          Messner walks in, cleaned up, pressed suit, no tie. He badges
          himself past the front desk. An ORDERLY approaches.
          
                                                                      114.

                    floor?
          
          Messner nods.
          
                                ORDERLY (CONT'D)
                    Very well.

                    You can take that stairwell up, the
                    I.C.U. is at the end of the hall.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. CEDARS SINAI -- THIRD FLOOR -- DAY
          
          Messne exits the stairwell. Droves of Feds and justice
          department types crowd the third floor hallway, around the
          I.C.U. The mood is subdued. The Swede exits a per-op suite,
          dressed in scrubs and a surgical gown, talking with Dr. Gill,
          who is also dressed for surgery.
          
          Messner searches the hall for a familiar face...finds
          it...Locke, far end, talking with an aide.
          
                                LOCKE

                    Basic bullet points-- despondent
                    over the turn his career had taken,
                    troubles with the law, history of
                    substance abuse and so on--
          
          The aide sees Messner approach. Locke follows her eyes, turns.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Where's Israel?

                    --no, we need to handle it now.
          
          Locke, angered, handing his clipboard to the aide, taking
          Messner by the arm, leading him away.
          
                                LOCKE

          A gun is in Locke's side now-- against his ribs-- he looks
          down, stunned...Now it's Messner who's leading him away.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       You're going to tell me why no call
                       was made to inform us that the Israel
                       situation had been "altered." Why I--
                       and my friend and partner, whose
                       body is going into a furnace tomorrow,
                       were not sufficiently apprised of
                       Bureau movement on this matter.
          
          Locke, pale, shook up.

                           (jams gun into ribs)
                       The Swede isn't a hitman, is he?
                       He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't
                       want Israel's heart for a trophy, he
                       wanted it for a transplant...why?

          side of the room, sits the shrunken figure of Primo Sparazza.
