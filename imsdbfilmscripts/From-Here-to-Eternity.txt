                         LONG SHOT
          The quadrangle of Army buildings is quiet and deserted. A
          broken-down taxi drives in at one corner and slowly makes its
          way around the quadrangle. SUPERIMPOSED over shot is the
                         LEGEND:

          The taxi pulls up across the street from camera. A soldier
          gets out, pulls two heavily loaded barracks bags after him.
          He pays the driver, hoists the bags to his back, moves toward
          camera. The taxi drives away slowly. The soldier walks toward
          steps leading to a low building. He is PREWITT (called "PREW"
          for short), 22 years old, well-built, good-looking. He wears
          an enlisted man's uniform and on the sleeves are marks where
          chevrons have been removed. He pauses, looks up over the
          door. CAMERA PANS UP to sign which reads: ORDERLY ROOM - G
          COMPANY, 219TH REGIMENT.

          A small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs
          out of the screen door and into shot. He is wielding a frayed
          broom. This is PRIVATE ANGELO MAGGIO. He is violent and funny
          and sour and friendly. He sees Prewitt's legs but not his
          face, speaks as he sweeps a cloud of dust off the porch.

          TRUCKING SHOT ALONG COMPANY STREET
          Prew walks slowly down the raised porch alongside the street.
          He takes the mouthpiece of a bugle from his pocket, jiggles
          it idly, a habit of his. He comes to the Dayroom, glances
          through the screen door, goes in.

                         MEDIUM SHOT
          The Dayroom has a pool table, ping-pong table, a radio, etc.
          Moth-eaten, upholstered chairs line both walls. The place is
          empty as Prew enters. He looks around casually, sees the pool
          table in an alcove. He moves over to it, puts the bugle
          mouthpiece in his pocket, picks a cue from the rack on the
          wall. He switches on the light, chalks the cue.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
          The triangle of balls is already racked on the table. Prew
          addresses the cue ball, shoots and breaks the rack solidly.
          He watches the balls hurry around the table.

          The voice is brawling, brash, vigorous. Prew turns slowly.
          CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to INCLUDE FIRST SERGEANT MILTON WARDEN,
          almost at Prew's elbow. He is thirty-four, big and powerful,
          has a neatly-trimmed moustache.

          Class, is at the clerk's desk, opening it, taking out papers,
          etc. Prew sits on a bench as Warden goes over to Mazzioli.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Maggio has swept his way over to Prew. He stops sweeping now,
          stares at the other man as if still incredulous.

          In b.g., Warden has turned from Mazzioli and is looking at
          Prew. Prew looks back coolly, answers Maggio thoughtfully.

          Prewitt, Mazzioli and Maggio spring to attention. The screen
          door bangs and CAPTAIN DANA HOLMES enters shot. He wears
          cavalry boots and spurs. He is about forty, unsure of
          himself, therefore always too certain with his men. He nods
          pleasantly.

          in various parts of the room. Prew and Choate are lying on

          The men are grouped around Holmes. He is pressing hard to
          pretend equanimity. The Sergeants appear somewhat baffled but

          The MONTAGE consists of a continuous stream of SUPERIMPOSURES
          depicting Prew's growing humiliation and exhaustion at the
          hands of the non-corns. Mingling with the background shots
          are VARIOUS ANGLES of CLOSEUPS of Prew. As the speed of the
          sequence increases, the stubborn smile on his face gives way
          to hurt, bitterness, anger... Over shots we occasionally hear
          stray shouts of the non-corns as they belabor Prew, but for
          the most part these and other dialogue are obliterated by
          MUSIC. The MONTAGE can be selected and created from the

          stretches through the mess hall. A blanket is spread over a
          table and behind it sits Holmes, flanked by Warden and
          Mazzioli. In front of Holmes is a pile of greenbacks and a
          cigar box filled with silver. He is paying out the man at the

          evidence of having already accomplished a little substantial
          drinking. The sound of loud piano playing is heard from
          within. A sign over the door reads: NEW CONGRESS CLUB - SOFT

          sophisticated-looking woman with upswept hair, wears an
          evening gown with a corsage of orchids. The piano music,
          louder with the opening of the door, continues through all of
          the following. The pianist is hammering out "I Don't Want To
          Set The World On Fire" (or a similar hit of 1941).

          hostesses. Several couples are dancing. The man at the piano

          couch. This is LORENE. There is an innocent, child-like look

          langorous tango coming from the jukebox. Maggio keeps
          switching his style as he tries to get out of the range of

           I'd been married to Captain Dana E.
           Holmes two years. Only he was a
           First Lieutenant then. Back at Fort
           Bliss. We lived right on a little
           lake where we could fish and swim
           and be alone, our 'dream
           cottage'... I'm sure you must be
           able to picture it. It was off on a
           back road, four miles from the
           highway. Two miles from a neighbor
           and a telephone....

           I hadn't been married long when
           I knew my husband was stepping

           something else to hope for. I think
           I was almost happy that night the
           pains began. Even though they were
           weeks too early, a whole month too
           early. I remember Dana was putting
           on that dapper silk gabardine
           uniform he used to wear. He was
           going to an officer's 'seminar.' He
           was kidding me about false labor. I
           didn't think it was humorous. I
           told him to get home early, to
           bring the doctor with him. He
           smiled tenderly and told me about
           the psychic reactions of women to
           pregnancy. But never fear, he'd be
           back early. And maybe he would
           have... if the 'seminar' hadn't
           been with the hat-check girl in one
           of the night clubs.

           He was only a little drunk when he
           came in... at five a.m. He looked
           alarmed when he saw me. I guess it
           was because of my screams. I was
           lying there on the floor, you see --
           No, don't say anything. I'm not
           finished yet. Of course, the baby
           was dead. It was a boy. But they
           worked over me at the hospital and
           fixed me up fine. They even took my
           appendix out, too. They threw that

          Raucous, hammering music sweeps away the melancholy blues. On
          the floor of the gym Dhom is punching the bag. In a corner of
          the raised ring Ike Galovitch is skipping rope. In the center
          of the ring Thornhill and Henderson are sparring. Holmes
          hovers beside them, issuing instructions in a strident voice.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW
          He is in fatigue clothes, on his knees, scrubbing the floor.
          There is an expression of stubborn hate on his face. Above
          his head in the shot are Galovitch's feet jumping the rope.
          In b.g. of shot is Wilson, seated near ring.

           instead down there!
                         
          A fine spray of spit accompanies the words and showers over
          Prew but he keeps about his work.

          MEDIUM SHOT IN RING
          There are two water buckets near Galovitch. He skips near one
          of them, kicks it. The bucket falls on its side and dirty
          water spills over the ring and down onto Prew.
                         
                          GALOVITCH

           on fatigue detail, not vacation.
                         
          Prew climbs into the ring, gets on his knees, starts to swab
          up the canvas. He is nearly finished when Galovitch
          "accidentally" kicks over the second bucket.

          Prew suddenly stands, no longer able to contain his rage. He
          throws his sponge and scrubbing brush on the ring floor.

          Prew is hunched under the seventy-pound pack as he plods
          along. He is sweat-soaked, puffing, dog-weary. Galovitch's
          bicycle is just behind him; he runs the wheels up on Prew's

          A jeep rounds a curve a couple of hundred yards above and

          The jeep is driven by an enlisted man. Sitting next to him is
          MAJOR GENERAL SLATER. Galovitch hops off the bike and he and
          Prew snap to attention. General Slater leans out of the
          vehicle. He seems puzzled and interested by the odd sight of
          the two men.

          An aged Chinese, at least seventy-five, OLD CHOY has a long
          white beard and wears a black skull cap and an embroidered
          robe. He is motionless, surveying the pandemonium which we
          hear over shot: the sounds of men laughing, talking and
          shouting blend with jukebox music blasting Chattanooga, Choo
          Choo. YOUNG CHOP, Old Choy's son, passes; he is thirty, white-

          DISCLOSING the small beer-house; it has unpainted cement
          walls and a cement floor; the only thing that might be called
          decorative is the jukebox. The place is crowded with men from
          Schofield, a raucous assemblage; everyone is drinking beer
          and the smoke hangs in thick layers. At a table near the door
          sit Prew, Maggio, Clark, Anderson, Treadwell and Mazzioli. At
          a corner table behind a forest of beer bottles and cans are
          Warden, Stark, Karelsen and Chief Choate.

          Fatso drops the knife. It clatters on the floor. There is
          another audible whoosh of breath from the room.
                         
                          WARDEN

          He drops the beer bottles on a nearby table, strides to his
          own table. The room settles back, still hushed. Warden has
          broken the mood of certain death, but Fatso, still facing
          Maggio, bites off his words with sadistic, ominous venom.

          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN'S TABLE
          Warden stands beside the table, watching. He seems satisfied
          as Fatso moves away from Maggio. Still standing, he raises
          his half-filled bottle of beer, drinks.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE
          Maggio drops onto the stool, sidles it over to the table. He
          half-whispers to Prew.

          Prew leans over and picks the knife off the floor.

          In b.g. Warden puts down the beer bottle and stalks towards
          the door. Maggio and Prew turn to watch him pass.

          as Prew carves out. Choy's is on a wide road across from the
          entrance to the Post. Prew looks around for Warden, sees him
          off to one side. CAMERA MOVES WITH Prew as he goes over to
          him.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          leaning against the building, undergoing a delayed reaction
          to the fierce moment in Choy's. He is white-faced, sweating
          heavily. He looks as if he's going to be sick.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          astonished yet appreciative that under Warden's confidence

          Prew holds out Fatso's knife. Warden is beginning to get
          control of himself; he manages a weak smile.
                         
                          WARDEN
           You keep it, kid. Keep it for a
           souvenir.
                         
          Prew puts the knife in his pocket. They stare at one another
          a few moments, each inarticulate, each wanting to express
          some deep emotion of respect.

          Warden studies Prew thoughtfully. Prew turns to go back into
          Choy's.

          find his voice.

          Though Prew is overjoyed he is somehow unable to say
          "thanks"; Warden grins broadly at him.

          The others tense at the word "Stockade," glare at Leva as if
          he had no right to mention it. Their fear of the place, now
          that it is imminent even for another soldier, is shown on

          and Galovitch. Thornhill, in b.g., puts down the comic book
          and comes over to them during following.

          He steps on Prew's hand. As Prew jerks away from the heavy
          shoe Galovitch hauls him up by his fatigue shirt. Thornhill
          steps between them.

          Galovitch rips off his shirt, bursting some of the buttons as
          he does. Stripped to the waist, his whole appearance seems to
          change; he looks as he did in the ring, a hard-muscled prize
          fighter.

          the fighters. Prew is a skillful boxer, moving around
          Galovitch quickly and cleverly. Galovitch is more lumbering
          but not awkward. His heavy blows stagger Prew several times.
          Prew drives his attack at his opponent's body. He never
          throws a punch at the other's head.

          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          A fear, not born of cowardice, is reflected on Prew's face as
          he sets himself, stares at Galovitch. He seems haunted by the
          memory of Dixie Wells.

          unmarked but grunting now from Prew's constant jabs at his

          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          Prew gets to his feet. As Galovitch comes to him, Prew feints
          for the stomach, then throws a hard right to Galovitch's
          face. It hits him flush on the nose. Blood spurts. The crowd
          roars.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Galovitch, surprised and hurt, throws up his hands. Prew
          drives both fists to his solar plexus. Galovitch drops his
          guard. Prew smashes him in the face and Adam's apple.
          Galovitch falls to his knees, hawking and choking.

          The whole nature of the fight has changed. Galovitch, hurt
          and reeling, rushes Prew, bull-like, head down, defense wide
          open. Prew dodges easily, slamming hard with rights and lefts

          The American flag, the General's flag and the Division flag
          are the only colorful elements in a rather severe office.

           --- In addition to inefficiency
           in administering his command and
           neglect of duty, Captain Holmes has
           been guilty of indefensible cruelty
           to the aforesaid Private Prewitt.
           This extended to instigating and
           encouraging wholly unauthorized and
           discreditable tactics to force the
           soldier to join the inter-regiment
           boxing team. These findings are the
           result of personal investigation by
           the Inspector General and are
           corroborated by numerous members of
           G Company.
                         
          Colonel Williams puts his report on the General's desk.
          Holmes' face reflects a weary resignation as if underneath he
          has really expected something like this for a long time. He
          makes no move to speak. The General is angry clear through.

           Holmes, the first thing I ever
           learned in the Army was that an
           officer takes care of his men. It
           seems to be the first thing you
           forgot. It's monstrous to think of
           anybody like you in command of
           troops. And believe me, you won't
           be for long. My only regret is that
           we have to keep you in uniform
           until a court martial is concluded.

          sentence or two. Her hand falls to her side. Holmes sits on
          the bed heavily. The bluster bleeds out of him. He shakes his

          Henderson, Leva, Stark and Karelsen and Corporal Wilson. Ross

          polka-dotted with holes. He tosses out shirts, shorts, etc.,
          digs underneath them. He pulls out a quart bottle of whisky;
          it is untouched. Warden smiles with relief. He lifts the

          b.g. men of the loading detail are scurrying around.
          Lieutenant Ross runs into shot. CAMERA PANS him across the
          quadrangle toward the barracks.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT NEAR BARRACKS
          Lieutenant Ross is hailed by the loading detail -- about ten
          men. He grabs a BAR and ammunition from them and runs into
          the barracks. The loading detail is working feverishly, same
          carrying ammunition into the barracks, others picking up
          empty clips as they are thrown from the roof and hustling
          them toward the Supply Room.

          He is working hard, passing out ammunition to members of the
          loading detail. But he shakes his head dourly as if the whole
          thing is still very unofficial.

                         FULL SHOT
          As before, pandemonium -- but controlled and efficient. The
          men are hoarse from shouting, red-eyed, puffing from
          excitement and exertion. Two Jap planes swoop past and the
          full-throated umbrella of fire lets loose. Lieutenant Ross
          clambers onto the roof, stooping under the burden of the BAR
          and loading clips. The men greet him with a concerted cheer.

          Ross looks around the roof, nods with evident approval, claps
          Warden on the shoulder.

          INCLUDE Karelsen at the other side of the chimney, firing the
          machine gun. Two soldiers hang onto the bucking legs of the
          tripod. Two Jap planes pass in b.g. of shot, zoom off into
          the sky.

          deposits him on his rear.

          Friday Clark, blowing the Cavalry Charge madly, abandons the
          megaphone as he sees the plane coming. He drops on his chest,
          hugging the bugle. The plane passes. Clark jumps up
          instantly, resumes blowing the Charge.
                         
          LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF JAP PLANE

          MEDIUM SHOT PREW
          There are improvised blackout curtains over windows and the
          glass doors. The radio is on, volume low, and an announcer
          (not the one of the morning) is droning out an account of
          Pearl Harbor. Prew, still on the couch in his pajamas, looks
          as if he has just struggled to wakefulness. He listens to the
          radio for a few moments in confused disbelief. He shakes his
          head vigorously as if to throw off his grogginess. He shakes
          his head again, slowly, more knowingly now, nodding as if he
          remembers something from the broadcast of the morning. Then
          as if all of it hits him suddenly and fully and terribly he
          wrenches himself off the couch. He looks around at the dimly
          lit room.

          He goes to the blackout curtains, peeps out. Then he turns
          back to listen to the radio. Abruptly, he runs into the
          bedroom.

          LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM SIDE OF HIGHWAY
          The headlights pass along the road as the jeep moves on out
          of sight. As its sound fades we hear Prew's heavy breathing,
          are barely able to distinguish his figure in the darkness. He
          is crouched, watching the car go down the highway. We hear
          his thoughts. The voice is labored and agonized.

          We see nothing but the strip of road, then Prew+s figure is
          visible, bent low, weaving a little. As he approaches the
          camera, he is taught square in the twin beams of dimmed
          headlights which flash on from the side of the road. Now we
          see that a jeep is parked near camera, heading in the
          opposite direction from the jeep which passed before. It is
          also manned by three MPs. There is a startled cry from Prew.

          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          looking toward the jeep, blinded by the blazing light. He has
          the appearance of a terrified animal. There is a wildness, a
          senselessness about him. The blotch of blood oozes and
          spreads over his shirt. He picks up a rock from the road.

          a crash of glass and one headlight winks off. Prew runs
          across the road and onto the golf course.

          MOVING SHOT SHOOTING FROM JEEP
          Prew, in a skirmisher's zigzag, is trying to elude the
          spotlight. He is about twenty yards in front of the jeep. He
          heads for a high sandtrap. The spot is full on him as he
          reaches the lip of the trap. He turns, yells something back
          at the jeep. It is barely heard over the sound of the jeep.

          gunfire from the jeep hits him. He falls sideways into the
          trap, rolls over on his back, The jeep moves into the shot,
          crawls half-way over the trap, stops, its spotlight pouring
          down on Prew. His eyes are open, looking up to the sky.

           There's a legend. If they float in
           toward shore, you'll come back some
           day. If they float out to sea, you
           won't.

           I won't come back. I had to get

           was killed on December seventh.

           He was a bomber pilot. He tried to
           taxi his plane off the apron and
           the Japs made a direct hit on it.
           Maybe you read about it in the
           papers. They awarded him a Silver
           Star. They sent it to his mother.
