  A large metal door SLAMS SHUT.

                      OFFICER (O.S.)
            Single file - stay to the right of the
            line...

  FADE IN:

  INT. POLICE STATION - WITNESS VIEWING ROOM - DAY

  PAN ACROSS the frightened faces of NINE WITNESSES, eyes fixed
  straight ahead.  A POLICE OFFICER walks slowly past each -
  FOOTSTEPS ECHOING in their fear.

                      OFFICER
            Take your time.  Take a good look.

  He passes a nervous SAFEWAY CASHIER in uniform.

                      SAFEWAY CASHIER
            Ah, a-are you sure they can't see us?

                      OFFICER
            Two-way mirror, ma'am.

  He passes a UNIFORMED CHEERLEADER, an OLDER WOMAN, then a
  FACTORY WORKER, who removes his "Lincoln, Local 186" cap and
  wipes his nervous brow.

                      FACTORY WORKER
            But they're trained killers.  A guy at
            the plant says, "In 'Nam they could
            smell ya!"

                      OFFICER
            This is the United States of America,
            Sir.

  Officer reaches the end of the line - presses an intercom.

                      OFFICER (CONT'D)
                (into intercom)
            Face front.

  Witnesses react - GASP - avert their eyes!

  INT. POLICE STATION - LINE UP - DAY

  The source of their fear - FIVE UNIFORMED CHEERLEADERS
  against the suspect wall.  They look like deer caught in
  headlights. 
  A sixth cheerleader, DIAN WESTON, is helped up the steps. 
  One thing separates her from the rest - SHE'S SIX MONTHS
  PREGNANT.

                      DIANE
                (friendly, to female officer)
            I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am, but is
            this going to take long?  It's game
            night.

                      OFFICER
                (on intercom)
            Picture in three --

  Like saying "walk" to a dog, the girls instantly smile.

                      OFFICER (CONT'D)
                (on intercom)
            -- two, one...

  FLASH WHITE to INDIVIDUAL MUG SHOTS (with CREDITS) over
  LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL SONG.

                                     MATCH DISSOLVE WHITE INTO:

  A LIGHT hanging above a table.

                      FBI AGENT (O.S.)
            ...a heinous crime has been committed
            here...

  CAMERA CRANES DOWN TO:

  INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

  CAMERA TRACKS EYE LEVEL around the table where an FBI AGENT
  (mid-40's, black suit), sits across from LISA JANUSCH
  (cheerleader from the witness side) - pretty, in a man-made
  way - bitchy in a B-squad Cheerleader way.  Other black
  suited AGENTS stand in the room.  CHEERLEADER MUG SHOTS cover
  the table.

                      FBI AGENT
            ...and testifying in such a case is a
            serious matter.  Should you decide your
            testimony would jeopardize your personal
            safety.

            Look, "Sipowitz", I said I'd tell you
            everything - I was just hoping to finish
            up before menopause kicks in.

  She smiles sweetly to the agent, then pushes Diane's MUG SHOT
  toward him.

                      LISA (CONT'D)
                (dropping smile)
            Let's start with the one who thinks her
            shit don't stink.  Diane Weston.

  Foggy, heart-shaped mirror.

            She's like a goddamn poster child for
            high school.

  A HAND ENTERS FRAME and WIPES CLEAR the mirror, REVEALING
  DIANE (pregnant cheerleader in opening - not pregnant now).

                      DIANE
                (to self in mirror)
            Morning, sunshine.  Remember, these are
            the best days of your life.

  She starts to leave - then comes back.

                      DIANE (CONT'D)
            -- so far!

  She bucks her chin in the mirror and smiles - she's beyond
  adorable.

                      LISA (V.O.)
            If I wasn't such a lady, I'd tell you
            what a bitch she really is.

  Sign reads "CHEERLEADING TRYOUTS."  PAN DOWN a long line of
  HOPEFUL GIRLS.

                      LISA (V.O.)
            She's the A-squad captain - stole the
            title from me.  You should charge her
            with that...

  END ON 

  Diane, pompoms on hips, smiles toward the camera.  A SIGN on
  the floor in front of her reads: "SQUAD MEMBER."  A SIGN to
  her left reads: "CHALLENGER".

  BRUCE, an effeminate young man, bounds up behind the
  "CHALLENGER" sign - putting his pompoms on hips.

                      DIANE
            Hey, Bruce!  You look cute...

                      BRUCE
                (off clothes)
            Tommy Hilfiger.  I'm hoping fourth
            year's a charm.

  He crosses his fingers and arms.  Diane smiles.  LISA runs in
  frame and SHOVES Bruce to the ground.

                      LISA
            Outta my way, fag.  I'm up.

  Humiliated, Bruce RUNS O.S.  Lisa takes his place, looks
  straight ahead and smiles, pompoms on hips.

                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            This really should have been my year.  I
            had a lotta work done - I-I mean,
            y'know, I'd done a lotta work over the
            summer.

  Diane can't take her eyes off Lisa.

                      DIANE
            Lisa?...  Is-is that you?

  LISA'S STUDENT I.D. drops INTO FRAME - her nose is big, she
  has no chin.  

                      LISA
                (looks straight ahead)
            I lost a little weight.

  I.D. LEAVES FRAME

                      LISA (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            You could tell it made her nervous.

  Diane shakes her head in disbelief and turns forward.

                      DIANE/LISA
            Ready?
                (pompoms snap to waist)
            Okay!

  POMPOMS SNAP TO THIGHS and the CHEER BEGINS.  

  Diane is effortless as she glides, jumps and smiles through
  it - clearly better than Lisa.

                      LISA (V.O.)
            But they have to, y'know, spread the
            talent around, so I've been on the B
            squad for four years.

  Lisa pushes the rest of the mug shots toward the FBI agent.

            Now, the squad as a whole?  They're
            closer than Carolina cousins.  Some
            people say they're, like, lezbos or
            something.  But that's mostly just the
            yag-offs in band...

  FIVE PAIR of LEGS with MATCHING ANKLETS and WHITE KEDS dangle

            ...truth is, they're so close - they all
            get their monthly visit from "Aunt Rose"
            at the same time.

  A HAND REACHES UNDER the first stall, PASSING A BOX OF
  TAMPONS to the next stall - and so on down the line.

                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            First, there's Hannah Wold...

  FIRST STALL DOOR

  HANNAH WOLD, a large, pretty girl in uniform, exits and
  crosses to the mirror.

                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            She's their base.  Strong as an ox. 
            She's like this Uber-Christian - doesn't
            say much.  I mean, if she wasn't kinda
            pretty, you'd go, "Hey, who's the tard?"

  NEXT STALL DOOR

  CLEO MILLE, pretty, starlet-type, wears plenty of make-up. 
  She lifts the front of her uniform sweater, holds it with her
  teeth.

                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Then, there's Cleo Miller...

  She opens her purse, pulls out a gel breast and stuffs it in
  one cup of her bra.

                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Number one - not a natural blonde.

  She REPEATS for the other breast, then pulls her sweater
  down.

                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            I know.  I've been in the locker room
            and seen south of the border.  Number
            two --
                (whispers)
            She has to see the school shrink.

  Cleo lifts the back of her skirt - REVEALING CONAN O'BRIEN'S
  face SILKSCREENED on her underpants (thought bubble above his
  head reads "Friday... I love Cleo.").  She KISSES HER HAND
  and plants it on his/her cheek.

            Kansas, when she sees something going on

  We see this - still in MRS. HILL'S POV.

                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Jury said, because the majority of women

  She then starts an obsessional frenzy of "whiting out" spots
  all over her Keds.  DIANE exits the final stall and takes
  away Lucy's white-out.

 INT. LINCOLN HIGH - GYMNASIUM - DAY

  PRINCIPAL SMITH, a man who burned out long ago, stands behind
  a microphone on a small stage as he's done for 45 years. 
  The LINCOLN HIGH "FIGHTIN' LOG" MASCOT (looks like an angry
  Tootsie Roll with legs and overly muscular arms) stands
  beside him, pantomiming everything he says.  STUDENTS fill
  bleachers on either side.

            The school year started off like normal. 
            Principal Smith gave his pep talk --

                (reading from a list)
            ... and if you are approached to buy
            drugs, let someone you trust know.  If
            you are thinking of harming yourself or
            others, let someone know.  If it burns
            when you urinate, have milky seepage or
            are being touched by an uncle - let
            someone know...

  Mascot looks at him, tries to pantomime.

                      LISA (V.O.)
            The A-squad performed...

  GYM LIGHTS GO DARK.  STUDENTS SCREAM.  DRUM CORP. and BRASS
  BAND start "ROCK & ROLL PART II" by Gary Glitter.

  The SPOTLIGHT RACES around the gym before it hits center
  court.  The A-squad springs to their feet for an amazing
  cheer/dance - strong, sexy, acrobatic, non-traditional.

                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Now, I know it's my duty to give you all
            the facts, so I have to say that their
            cheer blew like a bulimic after
            Christmas dinner.  Their blatant
            disregard for National High School
            Cheerleading Association rules made me
            sick.  "Basket toss flips and wolf wall
            pyramids over two people high are
            strictly prohibited."  I made a complete

  As the squad nears CAMERA/Jack, SUDDENLY Diane's Ked-clad
  foot comes INTO FRAME and SMASHES INTO CAMERA/Jack.

  DIP TO BLACK

  IRIS OPEN.  DIANE hovers over CAMERA/Jack, apologizing,
  looking angelic.  A-squad surrounds her.  Suddenly a frantic
  mascot breaks through, tips his log head back - IT'S BRUCE
  (from try-outs) - mouthing "NOOOOOO!"  He pulls CAMERA/Jack
  UP.

  Mascot/Bruce as he drags his prize quarterback out of the
  gym.  Jack and Diane's eyes never separate.

            Jack was fine - oh man, was he fine.  It

            a Christian virgin run the board.  Your
            kind is pure of heart - the devil won't
            dick with you.

                      HANNAH
                (looking down)
            Well technically, I don't think I'm a
            virgin anymore.

  Squad REACTS!

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)
            Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm
            pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.

                      KANSAS
            Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that
            starts with "at church camp" ain't
            leading to the big "O."

                      CLEO
            That's not true.  Those pictures of
            Christ - all sweaty and bare-chested on
            the cross - always kinda made me hot.

  Squad just stares at her.

                      KANSAS
            Anyway, last time I checked, you still
            had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And
            I know she ain't seen the lord on all
            fours - so I'm just saying.

                      DIANE
            Well, I want to know what happened --

                      HANNAH
            Okay, one night, around sunset, I went
            horseback riding with the nuns.  They
            went every night.  And, well, we're
            trotting pretty hard, y'know?  The hard
            leather saddle, pounding between my
            legs...

                      CLEO
            I just got a little squishy...

                      HANNAH
            All of a sudden, I feel... I feel... I
            feel just super alive...
                (whispering)
            "down there."  I swear I thought it was
            the second coming.

                      KANSAS
            Nope.  Sounds more like the first.

                      DIANE
                (taking the hand-piece)
            I'll just ask the question myself... "Is
            Jack Bartlett interested in me?"

  As the hand-piece starts to move on the board, we:

  INT. JACK'S SPLIT-LEVEL - GARAGE - MORNING

  Jack (with a red Ked print on his cheek) stands with THREE
  FOOTBALL PLAYERS looking under the hood of his '75 GTO. 
  They've all got one hand in back pocket, the other wrapped
  around a beer.

                      FOOTBALL PLAYER #1
            You do the bondo yourself?

                      JACK
            Yeah.

                      FOOTBALL PLAYER #2
            Sure-is-sweet.

                      FOOTBALL PLAYER #1
            What'll she do?

                      JACK
            Never opened her up.

                      FOOTBALL PLAYER #2
            S-weet.

                      JACK
            Who was the girl who kicked me in the
            head yesterday?

                      FOOTBALL PLAYER #1
            Diane Weston.

                      FOOTBALL PLAYER #2
            Now she sure is sweet.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

  INT. LINCOLN HIGH - AUDITORIUM - DAY

  SIGN hangs above the stage.  "HOMECOMING KING AND QUEEN
  CANDIDATES."  A row of STUDENT CANDIDATES, including Jack,
  Diane and Lisa, sit behind a BUTCH GIRL at the podium.

                      LISA (V.O.)
            Look, I'll be honest with you.  Most of
            us realized we didn't have a whore's
            chance in heaven with Jack the day of
            candidate speeches.

  As the Butch Girl concludes her speech, she holds a sign over
  her head which reads, "4-H - A WAY OF LIFE!"

  INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATER

  A GEEKY GUY stands at the podium.

                      GEEKY GUY
            As the A.V. Club candidate, I think, for
            the first time in fifty years, we should
            say --
                (nervous)
            NO to a football player as king!

  Two HIGH-PITCHED MALE VOICES cheer O.S.

                      GEEKY GUY (CONT'D)
            Vote brains over braun!

  A FOOTBALL flies INTO FRAME, hitting Geeky Guy on the
  FOREHEAD.

  INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATER

  Jack stands at the podium, unable to speak because the CROWD
  IS CHEERING!  He's handsome as hell, sweet and genuine.  You
  can't help but love him and you really want to fuck him.

                      LISA (V.O.)
            It was the first time most of us even
            heard Jack speak.

                      JACK
            Whoa...Thanks, uh - WOW.  Uh, hey,
            alright...okay, uh --

                      LISA (V.O.)
            We weren't disappointed.

                      JACK
            Guys!  Hey, guys!  Shut up a minute.

  The crowd QUIETS down.

                      JACK (CONT'D)
            Well, uh, I think it just really rocks
            that the football team picked me as
            their, y'know, uh, candidate.

  FOOTBALL PLAYERS AD-LIB "Yeah!  Whoa  Kick ass!"

                      FEMALE VOICES
            We love you, Jack!

                      JACK
            Hey, well, I love you lunch ladies!

  Audience LAUGHS.

                      JACK (CONT'D)
            I just want to say that there are only
            three things I want in life - to someday
            become a senator of this great state...

  Audience CHEERS.

                      JACK (CONT'D)
            I want to lead the Lincoln High Fightin'
            Logs to victory at the homecoming game --

  Audience CHEERS!

                      JACK (CONT'D)
            Okay, okay... Uh, and I... I want to go
            to the homecoming dance with Diane
            Weston.

  STUNNED SILENCE.  Diane stares at him.  Lisa looks pissed. 
  The school SUDDENLY ERUPTS with CHEERS!  Jack turns to Diane.
  She runs up to the podium.  They hug and kiss.

                      LISA (V.O.)
            Ucht!  They were like friggin' Barbie
            and Ken, but without the pink, remote
            control Corvette.  Overnight people were
            going, like --

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

  INT. SCHOOL - DAY

  Average GIRL faces CAMERA - MOUTHING:

  INT. GEEKY GUY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

  Geeky Guy sits alone, typing frantically at his computer,
  stopping occasionally to push up his glasses.

                      LISA (V.O.)
            I'm sure it gave the internet whacks
            something to talk about besides Agent
            Scully and their most recent wet dream.

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

  INT. LINCOLN HIGH - AUDITORIUM - DAY

  Jack and Diane are still in a love-lock.

                      LISA (V.O.)
            Now, I'm not one to gossip, but I think
            Jack and Diane got so close so fast
            because they discovered how much they
            both loved...

  MUSIC UP:

  INT. LINCOLN HIGH HALL - CLOSET - DAY

  QUICK TWO-SECOND CUTS

  CLOSE ON

  Janitorial Closet Door.  An excited Diane and Jack meet in
  front of it, kiss and roll into the closet.

  INT. WRESTLING GYM - DAY

  A CLIMBING ROPE hangs in the middle of the shot.  Suddenly a
  disheveled Jack slides down.  A beat later, Diane follows. 
  They kiss and part ways - dropping hands at the last minute.

  INT. SCHOOL HALL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

  CLOSE ON

  Door.  Red-faced Jack and Diane peek out, look to see they're
  alone, kiss good-bye, then head off in opposite directions. 
  DOOR CLOSES to reveal a sign "Principal Smith."

  EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

  It's COLD and LOUD.  Starting on his own 10 YARD LINE, Jack
  takes the hike, looks left, right - pumps once - twice -
  NOTHING.  He bursts through the line, dodging - weaving -
  leaping over his opponents.

  ON THE CLOCK

  15 seconds...

  ON THE A-SQUAD

  holding their breath, pompons at the ready.  Mascot runs past
  them, pantomiming "nervous" to the crowd by biting his nails
  and knocking his knees.

  ON JACK

  as he reaches the line of scrimmage.  There's ONE DEFENDER
  LEFT.  Jack fakes left, right - takes the tackle - but
  manages to roll out of it!  HE-COULD-GO-ALL-THE...

  ON THE CROWD

  They're going wild!

  ON THE A-SQUAD

  running along the sideline - Diane leading the way!

  ON JACK

  he looks right - sees Diane and mouths "I love you!"

  JACK'S POV

  Diane mouths "I love you!"

  DIANE'S POV

  Jack makes the touchdown, spikes the ball, and starts a slow
  run toward us - arms outstretched.  WE run toward him in SLOW
  MOTION.  SUDDENLY a WALL OF PLAYERS enter frame and tackles
  him in celebration.

  END MUSIC.

                      LISA (V.O.)
            Now, right about here's where the real
            shit started to hit the fan... Don't
            worry - I'll clean this up a bit if I
            have to appear in court -- especially if
            we're on "Court TV."
					  
 INT. DIANE'S SPLIT-LEVEL - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

  SFX: DOORBELL

  DENNIS WESTON (Diane's Dad) opens the door while DEEDEE
  (Diane's Mom) FLASHES a PHOTO of a surprised Jack and his
  parents.

                      DEEDEE
            Well, there's a Christmas card.

                      DENNIS
            Come in, come in...

  All enter the FOYER.  Jack looks gorgeous in his tux.  His
  parents are just like Diane's - mid-40's housewife and middle
  management drone.  Their children are their lives.

                      DENNIS (CONT'D)
            Say Jack, why don't you go light a fire
            under Diane.

                      JACK
            I'm on it, Mr. Weston.

  Jack smiles and bounds up the stairs - two at a time.

                      DEEDEE
            Oh - say, where're my manners.  I'm
            DeeDee - you can remember me because of
            my double "D's."

  She LAUGHS with Dennis as if it's the first time she's said
  it.  We see where Diane gets her perk - and her body.

                      DENNIS
            And I'm Diane's Dad, Dennis.  Do not try
            that after one of my Screwdrivers!

  Dennis and DeeDee LAUGH again.

                      DEEDEE
                (recovering)
            Whoooo - now who wants some pigs-in-a
            blanket?

  INT. SPLIT-LEVEL - DIANE'S BEDROOM - LATER

  ANGLE ON

  Vanity mirror.  Diane is putting on lip gloss - she looks
  beautiful in her gown.  We see JACK ENTER in the b.g.  She
  turns.  He reacts to her beauty.

                      DIANE
            Hi, Jack.

                      JACK
            Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? 
            We're supposed to go to the homecoming
            dance tonight.

  Diane LAUGHS.  They move in for a hormonally driven kiss.

  INT. SPLIT-LEVEL - LIVING ROOM - LATER

  All are seated.  The women are enjoying pigs-in-a-blanket
  while the men suck back screwdrivers.

                      LISA (V.O.)
            I obviously wasn't there the night they
            all met, but it was probably a super
            goober fest.

  DeeDee enthusiastically MOUTHS the following:

                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                (mocking DeeDee's voice)
            "Your Jack's one heck of a good football
            player."

  Jack's Dad MOUTHS the following:

                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                (mocking Jack's Dad's voice)
            "I don't know how he can concentrate
            with your lovely Diane cheering on the
            sidelines?!"

  They all LAUGH.

                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            "Ha, ha, ha, ha..." Ucht!

  Jack and Diane enter the holding hands.  DeeDee goes crazy
  FLASHING PHOTOS.  All AD-LIB adoration.

                      JACK
            Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  I have an
            announcement.

  Jack puts his arm around Diane - they're beaming.

                      JACK (CONT'D)
            Me and Diane, uh... we decided we're
            going to get married.

  The parents react with shock, then absolute joy!  DeeDee
  starts to cry - turning the CAMERA on HERSELF.

                      DEEDEE
            Oh, oh, mother of the bride - I'm
            allowed!

                      DIANE
            But not before... I have our baby.

  All FREEZE - the calm before the shit storm.  Suddenly,
  Jack's Mom throws her head back and lets out a BLOOD CURDLING 
  SCREAM.

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

  JACK AND DIANE'S STUNNED FACES

  PULL BACK to REVEAL we're:

  INT. JACK'S GTO - MINUTES LATER

                      DIANE
            ... so when your dad said, "I never want
            to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you
            think he meant forever or just until
            your mom wakes up?

                      JACK
            I don't know... And what the hell was
            that sound she made right before she hit
            the coffee table.

                      DIANE
            Well, if I had to guess...
                (convincing self)
            I'd say that was the sound of a mother
            saying good-bye to her little boy and
            hello to a young man who's going to be a
            daddy of his own...
                (getting an idea, cradling his
                 face)
            Jack, do you know what I see here?

                      JACK
            Spit from your dad?

                      DIANE
                (wiping his hair)
            I see a flower.  And y'know, even the
            most beautiful flowers still grow from
            dirt.

                      JACK
            Yeah.

                      DIANE
            So, while we're knee deep in right now -
            and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the
            long run, we're going to grow strong
            from this.

                      JACK
            Y'think?

                      DIANE
            I sure do.

  BEAT.

                      JACK
                (trust and love in his eyes)
            Diane, I've loved you ever since I first
            saw you -- right before you kicked me in
            the head.

                      DIANE
                (touched)
            Oh, Jack...

  As they move in for a kiss, we:

                                                      WIPE TO:

  A SEA OF BALLOONS FLOATING UP THROUGH FRAME.  LOUD MUSIC UP.

  INT. LINCOLN HIGH - GYMNASIUM - LATER

  Jack and Diane are on stage, wearing crowns and large velvet
  robes - they turn and wave!  They won!  They appear to be
  floating on a sea of balloons.

                                                      WIPE TO:

  A SEA OF BALLOONS FLOATING DOWN THROUGH FRAME.

  INT. LINCOLN HIGH - GIRLS' BATHROOM - HOMECOMING NIGHT

  FIVE PAIR of LEGS with HIGH HEELS dangle from the STALLS. 
  (We've seen this shot before.)  MUSIC from the dance presses
  through the walls.  A HAND REACHES UNDER the first stall,
  PASSING A BOX OF TAMPONS to the next stall.

                      LISA (V.O.)
            Diane must've told her squad that night.

  BOX OF TAMPONS CONTINUES down the line - UNTIL THE LAST
  STALL.  Diane's hand comes down and pushes the TAMPONS BACK.

                      DIANE
                (in last stall)
            No thanks - don't need one.

  FIRST STALL DOOR FILES OPEN, followed by the SECOND, THIRD -
  it sticks, Kansas climbs over - and FOURTH!  (Cleo exits
  fixing her gel breast.)  The squad surrounds Diane's stall
  door.  She finally exits.

                      DIANE (CONT'D)
                (looking at everyone a beat)
            So...

  Stunned silence.

                      LISA (V.O.)
            I'm sure they were thrilled.  I mean, if
            Diane said jump, they'd say "Double
            Dutch," "Shoot the Moon," or "Split
            Russian?"

  Suddenly, everyone starts talking at once.

                      CLEO
            Holy shit.

                      LUCY
            You just became a statistic!

                      KANSAS
                (suddenly happy)
            Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!

                      HANNAH
            But you're not married.

                      CLEO
            Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or
            you were pregnant... You had it, threw

            Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need
            for an abortion?

                      HANNAH
                (suddenly freaked)
            What?!  No!  Not an abortion!  My church
            can arrange for you to go to Oregon and
            take care of a "sick aunt" for nine
            months.  Then they put your baby good
            home and you come back - a little dazed
            and puffy - but everything's fine!  Oh
            please, Di, don't be a whore and a
            murderer!

  All FREEZE - no one can believe she just said that.

  INT. LINCOLN HIGH - GUYS' BATHROOM - HOMECOMING NIGHT

  Jack and a bunch of FOOTBALL PLAYERS in tuxes stand at the
  urinals, BACKS TO CAMERA.

                      JACK
            Hey, guys?  Uh, I got Diane pregnant.

                      FOOTBALL PLAYER #1
            What?!  Well - all right!

  He HIGH-FIVES Jack with his free hand.

                      FOOTBALL PLAYER #2
            You nailed Diane Weston?  I'd never wash
            my Johnson again!

  He HIGH-FIVES Jack on the other side with his free hand as
  the OTHER FOOTBALL PLAYERS also HIGH-FIVE each other.  They
  all freak out when they realize they are touching each other
  while PEEING.

  INT. LINCOLN HIGH - GIRLS' BATHROOM - HOMECOMING NIGHT

  All still stare at Hannah

                      HANNAH
            I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. 
            I just hear it so much at church - it
            kinda came flying out of my head.

                      DIANE
            I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to
            get an abortion.  I mean, I always
            planned to get married and have kids -
            I'm just going a little out of order. 
            Kinda reminds me of another young lady
            who found herself "with child,"
            unmarried, on a long road, with no place
            to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long
            time ago.  But no matter what, she held
            her head high and said... "Pappa don't
            preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa
            don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my
            baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." 
            The great one...

  All take hands and lower their heads.

  REVERSE ANGLE

  Jack and Diane sit in front of an older LOAN OFFICER'S desk. 
  SIGN READS: "Your home for home loans."  Loan officer looks
  over papers as Jack and Diane look excitedly at one another. 
  Diane takes Jack's hand.

                      LOAN OFFICER
            I'm sorry.

                      DIANE
            What?!  But all our paperwork's there. 
            My school records, Jack's football
            records...

                      LOAN OFFICER
            Let me explain something...

                      JACK
            Diane.  Hold on a minute.  I think I
            know where this is going.
                (sotto, to loan officer)
            I'm willing to put up the papers for my
            Mustang - she's got a few miles on her,
            but she looks great.

                      LOAN OFFICER
            I'm sure, son, but --

                      JACK
            Okay!  Stop twisting my arm!  I'll throw
            in the speakers.

                      LOAN OFFICER
            Look, kids, why don't you just have your
            parents come i n and get a loan?  Then
            they could give you the money.

                      DIANE
                (building from a slow burn)
            With all due respect, Jack and Diane
            Bartlett...

  They exchange a smile, first time saying this.

                      DIANE (CONT'D)
            ...do not accept charity.  We are two
            young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not
            want a handout.  We want a hand-up. 
            Give us food and we will be hungry
            tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you
            plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own
            food and... and, uh, then cut it, and -
            uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're
            interested in giving us a home loan, I
            will sit back down.  If not, have a nice
            day, Ma'am.

                      LOAN OFFICER
            Sorry.  My hands are tied.

  Diane makes a dramatic exit, taking a handful of M&M's from
  her desk.  The squad, (previously unidentified) lounging in
  the central bank of couches, follows her.

  It's a semi-furnished shit-hole.  The ONLY WINDOW looks out

            Fine.  Just remember, I manage the

            it.  So, like, I don't care if shit

            and if there's, like, packages outside
            my door?  Leave 'em the hell alone.

  MUZAK UP.  A worried Diane, now showing slightly under all
  black warm-ups, is writing on her notepad as she walks down
  an aisle.  Suddenly, in the B.G. CROSS AISLE, an ecstatic
  Jack, in "Video Barn" uniform, WHIZZES PAST, riding his cart. 
  Arms out at his sides.

                      JACK
            I'm on top of the world!

  Seeing Diane, he tries to stop, but can't and continues past. 
  A SECOND LATER, he scrambles back and rides up to her -
  tossing more boxes into the already FULL CART.

                      JACK (CONT'D)
                (holding box of cookies)
            Hey, Di, if we have a girl, we should
            dress her like Little Debbie!

  Jack pulls alongside Diane and kisses her.  She notices the
  full cart.  It'll cost a fortune.

                      DIANE
            Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.

                      JACK
                (positively giddy)
            But Di, all this food reminds me of how
            much I want to teach our baby.

  He tosses more cereal in the cart.  Diane looks at her
  notepad, then starts to return items to the shelves WITHOUT
  JACK NOTICING.

                      JACK (CONT'D)
            Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain
            Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your

            guess they're for me."  But your baby
            brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops
            are, like, a million times better.  I'm
            going to save our kid all that pain.

                (yelling to the store)
            I love this lady!

  He kisses her as SHE SLIPS ANOTHER BOX on the shelf.

                      DIANE
            Jack, I think I should get a job.

                      JACK
                (rubbing her belly)
            But we agreed your job is running the
            baby machine...

            I know, but that was before.

                      JACK
            Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby
            machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and
            get a place in line.

  He kisses her again and runs off.  Diane watches him - the
  love in her eyes quickly turns back to worry and she starts
  to put everything back on the shelves: cookies, cereal,
  chips, ice cream - oh, that struggle, but it goes...

  INT. SAFEWAY CHECK OUT STAND - LATER

  ANGLE ON AISLE

  Diane emerges with an almost empty cart.  Just milk, peanut
  butter, bread and a large roast are all that remain.

                      JACK (O.S.)
            Hey, Di!

  Diane turns to see Jack, a couple aisles over, holding out a
  LITTLE KID WITH GLASSES.

                      JACK (CONT'D)
                (in a funny voice)
            Hello, I'm the little professor. 
            Wouldn't it be cute if ours looked like
            this?!

  A WOMAN RUSHES over and ANGRILY grabs her kid back from Jack,
  punches him and storms off.  Diane rushes in line, ditching
  the roast in a gum rack beside the check-out.

  As she struggles with it, she notices a WOMAN at the LINCOLN
  SAVINGS AND LOANS BRANCH (inside the Safeway at the end of
  the check-out aisles) putting out a HELP WANTED sign.

  INT. JACK'S MUSTANGE - MOMENTS LATER

  Jack drives as Diane devours a king size Snickers bar.

                      JACK
            I never knew you dreamed of working in a
            grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are

                (mouth full of Snickers)
            Mmm-hmmm...

  Unseen by Jack, Diane slips her hand out the partially open
  window, releasing a PAGE from her NOTEPAD.

            Why do they call it morning sickness?

  In the UNFOCUSED B.G., Diane opens her door and crawls out,
  about to toss her cookies.  In the F.G., the LIST settles on
  the road: FROM THE BEAUTIFUL MIND OF DIANE is a pre-printed
  on the top.  Diane wrote "Monthly Income" column which totals
  "$525."  Her "Monthly Bills" column totals "$845."  "ONE
  MONTH LEFT" is scribbled at the bottom.

  CLOSE ON 

  Jack and the social retards.

                      JACK
            ...she's in my hands, right?  Moist to
            the touch.  It's at that moment I think
            I control her - she's mine.  But it's a
            false illusion, like in "Backdraft."  No
            man controls fire!  She's ready, I'm
            ready, she's ready, I yell, "One-fifty
            four, forty eight."

  PULL BACK

  The social retards are orgasmic over his story.
			
  INT. SAFEWAY - BANK BRANCH - DAY

  MUZAK UP.  Diane, at the service window, smiles as she helps
  a CUSTOMER, then drops her pen behind the counter, mouthing
  "Ooops, one moment."  She bends down.

  BEHIND THE COUNTER

  Diane voraciously rips the top off a SNICKERS and shoves it
  into a jar of HAAGENDAAZ.  She takes a huge bite, then pops
  up, SMILING - MOUTH FULL.

  INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Diane (eating Snickers) sits in the bean-bag chair in front

  Jack starts to run them under the scanner.

  Lisa grabs her tapes and exits.

  INT. APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

  Diane's belly.  Jack's HAND comes into frame, tracing it. 
  ICE CREAM drips on it. 
  Jack licks it off as we PULL BACK to see a VERY TIRED Diane
  holding a pint of ice cream, using a SNICKERS as a spoon. 
  FOUR lines labelled "August," "September," "October" and
  "November" on the wall.  Jack gives Diane a tired peck on the
  cheek as she continues to eat.

  vendor's box.  They run over to her.

  ON JACK

  running for a touchdown - a la his homecoming run.  This time
  he's exhausted and the competition is gaining.

  Everything grinds to a SLO-MO CRAWL as Jack makes a heroic
  leap for the touchdown.  With his spare hand, he attempts to
  smother a huge yawn, as opposing players come flying at him
  from both sides.

  ANGLE ABOVE BED

  Continuation of pervious shot as Jack lands on the bed
  completing the touchdown.  Diane falls across the frame from

  bed - still in cheerleading and football uniforms.  Jack
  holds a large STATE TROPHY - Diane holds a half-eaten
  Snickers.

  case of "Heat" sits beside her monitor.  She's taking copious

  concealing her monitor.  Her mom sets down the cookies and
  kisses Lucy's good-night before she exits.  Relieved, Lucy

  when her stern, UBER-CHRISTIAN PARENTS ENTER and take a seat

            That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to

            from movies.  But robberies?  There's no
            way.

  Cleo sets the HAND-PIECE on Diane's belly.  The squad stares

  INT. SEARS - MATERNITY DEPARTMENT - DAY

  Diane watches as the squad MODELS BIG WHITE MATERNITY
  UNDERPANTS over their Addidas sweats, with pillows and
  stuffed animals in the belly portion.  It's like some bizarre
  fashion show.  A STERN OLD SALESWOMAN approaches.  Diane
  points to Cleo's style, then hands the surprised saleswoman
  FIVE SKI MASKS.

  STANDING ON A COCKROACH.

            Whoever gets out alive -- have the
            authorities to check in the crawl space.

  Diane walks to the counter and rings the bell.

                      DIANE
            Kansas, you should never judge a book by
            its cover.

  HANK WOOD ENTERS (greasy hair, dirty coveralls, big rubber
  gloves).  He's a chain-smoker and reeks of insecticide.  The
  squad reacts.

                      HANK
            Yeah?

                      DIANE
                (sotto)
            I guess there's an exception to every
            rule.

                      KANSAS
            You're the "Terminator?"

                      HANK
            You come in here to bust my balls?  I
            kill bugs for a livin'.  G-d already
            beat ya to it.

  He turns to exit.

                      DIANE
            NO!  Wait...um...
                (nervous, but smiling)
            We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? 
            So, uh...

                      KANSAS
            We were told you could "fix us up."

                      HANK
                (eyeing suspiciously)
            Really...

                      LUCY
            Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.

                      HANK
            She did, did she?  How is the old girl?

                      LUCY
            Definitely old.

                      HANK
                (warming)
            That's Itchy, alright.  How many y'need?

                      DIANE
            Well, we'll each probably want one - so
            let's make it five.  Five should do it.

                      HANK
            Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll
            need?

                      DIANE
            Ammo?

                      HANK
            Bullets.

                      DIANE
            Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these
            are just to scare people. 
            Kinda like round-off, back handspring,
            whip back, double full.  You never
            really use it - you just want the
            opposing squad to know you've got it.

                      HANK
            Right.
                (beat)
            That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.

  Squad REACTS!

            What?!

                      KANSAS
            You piece-a-shit bug zapper!

                      DIANE
            Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.
                (to Hank)
            Obviously that's a little more than our
            budget will allow.  Basically, we're
            looking for something around two-hundred
            dollars.

                      HANK
            Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred
            I got a nice rubber band and a real
            sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it
            for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. 
            Cash.  Take it or leave it.

                      HANNAH
            What kind of deal would you make if I
            said we were going to the police and
            tell them you're selling illegal guns...
            to minors!  To girl minors!

                      HANK
                (big toothless grin)
            I'd just hafta kiiiiiill you.

                      DIANE
            Well, okay then.  It was a pleasure
            meeting you.  Take care, let's go you
            guys.

  Squad quickly exits.

                      HANK
            Hold on!

  They stop, still facing the door.

                      LUCY
            Oh please, we've all got bright futures
            ahead of us - we're not going to tell
            anyone.  Promise!

                      HANK
            Maybe we can make a deal.

                      KANSAS
            Look, we're not gonna trade sex for
            guns.  Unless Cleo...

  Cleo hits her.

                      HANK
            My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a
            cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and
            I'll give you the guns.

                      DIANE
            You're kidding.

                      HANK
            Fern!  C'mere!
                (to squad)
            She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to
            cap off the cyanide hose.

  FERN, all of 85 pounds wet, ENTERS wearing BIG GOGGLES, BIG
  RUBBER GLOVES, BOOTS and a BREATHER which she removes and
  gasps for air.

                      DIANE
            We'll be right back.

  EXT. "THE TERMINATOR" EXTERMINATOR SHOP - DAY

  The squad runs out and gets into Hannah's STATION WAGON.

                      KANSAS (O.S.)
            Holy shit!  That's a poster child for
            "Planned Parenthood."

  INT. LAMAZE CLASSROOM - NIGHT

  CLOSE ON

  Slide of VAGINA.

                      INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
            The vagina, forming the lower portion of
            the birth canal, will normally expand
            its folded walls to allow for the birth
            process...

  Suddenly Diane and the squad walk across the screen.

                      DIANE
            Sorry, we had our first basketball game -
            went into overtime... Excuse us.  Sorry.

  PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

  Pregnant WOMEN on the floor, resting on pillows - husbands
  kneeling beside them.  CONTINUE TO PULL BACK with the squad
  as they make their way to the back row.

                      INSTRUCTOR
                (annoyed)
            May I continue, ladies?

                      KANSAS
            Sure.  Unless it's hard for you to talk
            with that stick up your ass.

  A few couples LAUGH.  Pissed, the instructor continues in the
  B.G.  Room starts LAMAZE BREATHING.  Diane joins in.

  Squad reaches an open space at the back of the room.  Diane
  gets down on her pillow - squad surrounds her.  ROOM STARTS
  LA MAZE BREATHING EXERCISES.  Lucy takes out a piece of paper
  which she sets on Diane's belly for all to see.

            What do we do before a big game?

                      CLEO
            Use the bathroom, because the Port-a

            That's right.  Practice makes perfect. 
            I'm practicing to have a baby right now. 
            If we do a practice job, we'll not only
            get the experience, but also the extra
            money we need for guns!

  Squad quietly AD-LIBS their agreement.

                      DIANE (CONT'D)

  INT. LINCOLN HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY

  A SMILING OLDER WOMAN with a "Volunteer" button sits at a
  table with a "LUNCH TICKETS: $1.50" SIGN on it.  LISA JANUSCH
  approaches and hands her some money.  The Older Woman starts
  to SLOWLY COUNT OFF TICKETS from a roll.

  Impatient, Lisa grabs the roll, rips off some tickets, tosses
  the roll on the table and STORMS OFF.  The Older Woman
  UNLOCKS THE METAL BOX (key around her neck), PUTS THE MONEY
  IN, then SHUTS IT.

  Diane ENTERS FRAME and gives her money.  The older woman
  counts off tickets, smiles and gives them to Diane who bends
  down to tie her shoe. 
  The Older Woman UNLOCKS the metal box to put the money in as
  KANSAS ENTERS, FALLS TO THE GROUND and fakes CHOKING.  Cleo
  runs up to Kansas - begging for help.

  The Older Woman hurries around the table to help as Hannah
  ENTERS FRAME, takes the open metal box and dumps the contents
  into Lucy's Winnie the Pooh BACKPACK as she walks quickly
  THROUGH FRAME.  Hannah hands the box to Diane who shuts it
  and puts it back on the table. 
  BOTH EXIT in opposite directions as Kansas STOPS CHOKING,
  gets up and exits, followed by Cleo, who first helps the
  Older Woman to her feet and then exits.

  INT. HANNAH'S STATION WAGON - DAY

  Squad looks miserable - Fern SMILES from ear to ear.  The
  squad slowly STARTS TO SNIFF, then turn toward Fern.

  EXT. KANSAS' HOUSE - OLD RAMBLER STYLE - DAY

  The station wagon pulls into the cracked driveway.  The squad
  jumps out and runs around to the back of the car, pulling out
  the large black trunk.

            You guys wanna hurry up?  My
            grandparents get back from dinner at
            four-thirty.

  INT. KANSAS' BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

  Squad hurries down the open, unfinished stairs, lugging the
  trunk behind.  It looks like a STUDIO APARTMENT - a unique
  combination of her grandparents' old '60's furniture and high
  school memorabilia.

                      CLEO
            I can't believe your grandparents never

            wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit -
            I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.

  Squad forms a circle around the trunk.

                      DIANE

  She flips OPEN the latches.

  All help LIFT THE LID.  Stunned SILENCE.

                      KANSAS
            What the hell?

  WE SEE the trunk is filled with OLD GUN PIECES.  Stocks,
  barrels, flint locks, rusty triggers, etc.  Nothing seems to
  go together.  ALL TALK AT ONCE.

                      DIANE
            Oh no...

            Kansas?

  FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the top of the stairwell.  Squad quickly
  shuts the trunk and sits on it.

            Is that you down there?

            Shit!

            Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.

                      GRANDMOTHER (O.S.)
            Are you girls talking about boys? 
            Practicing kissing your hands?

                      KANSAS
            Oh yeah, you caught us...

  TWO OLD LEGS with SUP-HOSE and ORTHOPEDIC SHOES STEP DOWN on
  the top step.  Squad panics.  Tries to quietly hide the
  trunk.

                      GRANDMOTHER (O.S.)
            Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at
            the top of the stairs for you gals.

                      KANSAS
            Thanks!  That'd be great.

  Old legs START BACK UPSTAIRS.  Girls relax.  Legs STOP, TURN
  and head BACK DOWN.  Squad springs into action again.

            Uh...Yeah, Grandma.
                (to Hannah)
            She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the
            old filter with her last stroke.

                      GRANDMOTHER (O.S.)
            Then I'll throw a few more treats on the

            I'll get them before "Touched by an
            Angel," don't worry.

                      GRANDMOTHER (O.S.)
            You damn well better...

  LEGS DISAPPEAR.  Squad relaxes.

                      CLEO
                (loud whisper)
            This is great.  What do we do?  Threaten
            people with a trunk full of parts?

                      FERN
            I'm sorry, you guys.  But when you're
            dealin' with South American Rebels, you
            kinda gotta take what you can get.

  Squad AD-LIBS their frustration.

                      DIANE
            Excuse me, but do you guys know what I
            don't see here?

  Squad AD-LIBS "No.  Uh-uh.  What?" etc...

                      DIANE (CONT'D)
            I don't see a problem.  I see a great
            big craft project sitting right in front
            of us.  So, Kansas, get me some glue,
            tape and a nail file...

  The squad looks at each other as Diane rolls up her sleeves
  and reaches into the trunk.

                      DIANE (CONT'D)
            Oh, and some Lysol if you have...

  INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

  Squad, set up for a girl party, is making a large HALLWAY
  POSTER ("Go Mighty Logs!") in the middle of sleeping bags. 
  They're laughing and having fun as Jack, in Video Barn
  uniform, ENTERS from the bedroom, kisses Diane on the head,
  waves good-bye to the squad and LEAVES.  All freeze for a
  beat, then quickly turn over the poster, revealing a detailed
  layout of the SAFEWAY/BANK BRANCH.

  Cleo opens her OVERNIGHT BAG and pulls out FIVE MODIFIED
  DOLLS - she CUT OUT their SCHOOL PICTURES and taped them over
  the dolls' faces.  ALL PLACE THEIR DOLL IN STARTING
  POSITIONS. 

  Cleo then pulls out a CONAN DOLL (Conan's face over a
  shirtless G.I. Joe) who sweeps "her" off her feet and takes
  her in frozen foods.

  Kansas grabs the Conan Doll, runs into the kitchen and shoves
  him head first down the garbage disposal.

  Diane and squad stand at the check-out.  Diane places SHOWER

  frowns.  Diane smiles, points again and holds up ten fingers.

  PULL BACK to REVEAL WE'RE:

  INT. LINCOLN HIGH - GYMNASIUM - DAY

  It's DECORATED for CHRISTMAS.  Fightin' Log Mascot now wears
  a Santa Hat and red scarf. 
  A JAZZ BAND on stage beside him starts up.  With a voice like
  JIM NEIGHBORS, Bruce TIPS the Mascot Head BACK and launches
  into the following to the tune of "Rudolph The Red-Nosed
  Reindeer."

                      BRUCE
                (singing slow intro)
            "I....see...girls swimming..."

  A HUMILIATED B-squad MEMBER - in swimsuit - ENTERS a SIDE
  DOOR and pretends to SWIM to CENTER COURT.

                      BRUCE (CONT'D)
            "Boys swimming..."

  Another B-squad MEMBER - dressed as a guy in a swimsuit -
  "swims" to CENTER COURT.

                      BRUCE (CONT'D)
            "Ooooh, they look chilllyyyyy..."

  Squad members pantomime this to the JEERS FROM THE CROWD.

                      BRUCE (CONT'D)
            "Volleyball for her..."

  B-squad MEMBER - in volleyball uniform - ENTERS and spikes a
  ball.  It gets away from her and she has to CHASE IT.  Crowd
  CHEERS AGAIN.

                      BRUCE (CONT'D)


			EXT. EXTERMINATION VAN - CONTINUOUS

  SIDE DOOR SLIDES OPEN.  One by one, the squad, dressed as
  PREGNANT BETTYS - MASKS ON, MATCHING JACKETS and each holding
  a BOX FOR LONG STEM ROSES - jump out.

  NEW ANGLE

  as the MOTION SLOWS and, like a shot out of "Tombstone," the
  LINE OF PREGNANT BETTYS disappear around the corner - coats
  blowing in the wind.

  ANGLE ON

  BACK DOOR ENTRANCE.  Cleo grabs the door handle - and it
  COMES OFF.

                      KANSAS
                (panting)
            Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!

                      CLEO
            I just pulled and it - it came off.

                      KANSAS
            This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to
            enter the front door!

                      CLEO
                (taking off her mask to breath)
            Look, it's really not my fault.

  Kansas jumps at her, pulling her mask back down.

                      KANSAS
            Hey!  Rule number one - never take off
            the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what
            happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!

                      CLEO
            Sorry, Kansas...

                      KANSAS
                (out of her mind)
            NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO
            NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!

                      CLEO
            Oh for Chrissakes...
                (with emphasis)
            "White trash Betty."
                (back to normal)
            I didn't realize the rules went into
            effect before we entered Safeway.

                      KANSAS
                (pushing her for emphasis)
            Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty."

                      DIANE
            Bettys, stop it!  "The best squad is one

            Cheerleading Association letterhead. 
            Now, let's give a hands in...

  All form a circle, putting their right hands in.

                      DIANE (CONT'D)
            We're ready.  We're prepared.  And this
            is going to be the best bank robbery
            ever, because...

                      DIANE & SQUAD
                (loud whisper)
            Cheer-leaders kick...

  All swing arms overhead and SMACK THE "ASS" of the girl to
  their right. 

  MUSIC UP

  They start back around the corner.  Suddenly someone dressed
  as a PREGNANT NIXON turns the CORNER - all SCREAM!  

  MUSIC UNDER

                      NIXON
                (it's LUCY)
            SHH!  It's me.

                      DIANE
            Lucy?

                      KANSAS
            What the hell do you want?

                      LUCY
            I want to help.  I'm part of this
            squad...

                      HANNAH
                (nerves build to rage)
            Oh no!  You committed the ultimate sin -
            you left our squad to be with a guy. 
            And - and that guy is the Devil himself -
            'cause only the Devil would turn you
            against your sisters!

  All stare at her... then start to LAUGH.

                      DIANE
                (arm around Hannah)
            Hannah, you really have to stop taking
            that church stuff so literally.

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

  EXT. SAFEWAY ENTRANCE - DAY

  ANGLE ON LINE

  Walking in SLOW MOTION, this time with the PREGNANT NIXON on
  the end.

  ANGLE BEHIND SQUAD

  as they STOP at the MAIN ENTRANCE.

  IN UNISON

  the squad TUCKS their BOXES tight under their right arms,
  then takes a step FORWARD - AUTOMATIC DOORS OPEN and they
  ENTER.

  INT. SAFEWAY - CONTINUOUS

  MUZAK PLAYS.  Squad steps off the black electronic met, then
  stops.  CUSTOMERS FALL SILENT.  It's a sight to behold.  Only
  MUZAK CONTINUES.

  Kansas holds up a hand and counts off ONE, TWO, THREE
  FINGERS.  All pull the RED RIBBON off their rose box with one
  hand - smoothly grabbing the guns they've glued and taped
  together with the other - as they move into their next
  position (Kansas and Hannah take point as Diane, Cleo, Lucy
  and Fern move into the bank branch).  Cleo fumbles with her
  box, dropping her gun.  The barrel falls off, CLANKING as it
  rolls away from her.  Nixon helps her stick it back together.

                      KANSAS
                (deep, strong guy voice)
            Okay, down on the ground!  Now!

  SOME PATRONS DROP to the ground.  Others STAND FROZEN. 
  They're confused.  Just the bank or everyone?

                      KANSAS (CONT'D)
            I said DOWN!

  A Safeway CASHIER ("witness" from opening) in front of them,
  stands trembling.

                      SAFEWAY CASHIER
            Uh, y-y-y-you robbin' the Safeway, or
            the bank?

                      KANSAS
            BANK!

                      SAFEWAY CASHIER
            S-s-so y'want everyone down?  O-or just
            the people at the b-b-bank branch?

  They never thought about that...

                      KANSAS
            All of you!

                      HANNAH
                (same time)
            Bank branch!

  People start to get down who were up, others get up who were
  down.  Kansas and Hannah look at each other a beat, then:

                      KANSAS
            Bank branch! 

                      HANNAH
                (same time)
            All of you!

  People start to MURMUR and, once again, reverse their
  positions.  Kansas and Hannah move together for a brief
  conference.

  SECURITY CAMERA POV

  Lucy and Cleo stand under it, shoulder to shoulder, inner
  hands joined, looking up.  Fern RUNS IN FRAME and JUMPS onto
  her HANDS.  They POP her up to their SHOULDERS making a
  STANDING PYRAMID.  Fern pulls out SPRAY PAINT and sprays over
  the SECURITY CAMERA LENS.

  ON KANSAS AND HANNAH

  conference ends.  They return to point positions.

                      KANSAS
            Bank branch only!  Everyone else - go on
            about your business!

  EVERYONE near the bank starts to get down.  Unable to "go
  about their business" with a robbery in progress, Safeway
  CUSTOMERS just stare.  After an uncomfortable beat.

                      KANSAS (CONT'D)
            Shit - EVERYBODY DOWN!

  MUSIC UP: LOUD ROCKIN' VERSION OF MUZAK

  Everyone goes ass-up.  Kansas and Hannah nod with their
  success, then shoulder their guns.

  ON LISA

  as she slowly gets on the floor - watching Lucy, Cleo and
  Fern spray painting the security camera.

  LISA'S POV

  as Lucy, Cleo and Fern do a HALF-SWAN DISMOUNT from the
  Pyramid.

  ON LISA

  as this stunt registers across her face - it's an illegal
  dismount!  She starts to count Bettys...

  ON DIANE

  in the bank branch, moving like a shark - never stopping -
  knowing exactly where everything is.

  ON LUCY, CLEO AND FERN

  as they RUN ACROSS to the other SECURITY CAMERA.  They pass
  Lisa, staring up at them.  Cleo steps on her ass as she
  crosses over.

  LISA'S POV

  as she hits the ground - noticing a POMPON STRING stuck in
  Fern's boot.  Lisa REACHES OUT - GOT IT!

  ON LISA

  as she pulls it in, under her body - EVIDENCE!

  ON DIANE

  Safe is OPEN.  Cleo and Fern join her, taking the MONEY BAGS. 
  They open them as Diane turns around with her first arm-load
  of cash.  (Lucy moved to her next position at the front
  door.)

                      FACTORY WORKER (O.S.)
            This here's bullshit!  That's what this
            is!

  ALL TURN and FREEZE.  MUSIC UNDER.

                      FERN
            Shit.

                      DIANE
                (whispered)
            I'm fine here - go help!

  ANGLE ON FACTORY WORKER ("Witness" from opening)

  wearing a "Lincoln, Local 186" cap.  He walks up the cereal
  aisle.

                      FACTORY WORKER
            Not gonna let some piece-a-shit Betty
            Doll tell me what to do...

  ON KANSAS AND HANNAH

  they turn to each other - shit!

  ON FACTORY WORKER

  as he continues toward them - REACHING INTO HIS BOOT AND
  PULLING OUT A KNIFE.

                      FACTORY WORKER (CONT'D)
            No-sireee-bob...

  ON KANSAS AND HANNAH

  Oh shit-oh-shit!  Cleo and Fern join them.

                      KANSAS
            Freeze or meet Jesus, Ass-hole!

  Kansas shoulders her gun.  The barrel starts to droop, the
  glue isn't holding.  She quickly reaches out to straighten
  it.

  ON FACTORY WORKER

  he stops, dead in his track.

                      FACTORY WORKER
            Don't we never take the Lord's son's
            name in vain around this part of the U-S
            A!

  He drops his 6-pack and starts to RUN AT THEM!

                      FACTORY WORKER (CONT'D)
            Ahhhhhhhh!

  ON THE GIRLS

  they're freaking out.

  ON CUSTOMERS

  bracing for the worst.

  ON FACTORY WORKER

  yelling and running.  SUDDENLY, the SOUND OF TEN ROUNDS in
  TWO SECONDS breaks the tension.  MOTION SLOWS as his hat
  EXPLODES OFF HIS HEAD.  His face registers absolute surprise
  as he falls back on his ass.

  ON THE GIRLS

  Hannah stands frozen, gun still at her shoulder, breathing
  hard.  All turn - SHE JUST SHOT A GUY!

  ON FACTORY WORKER

  spread eagle in the middle of the demolished aisle.  Cereal
  trickles down from punctured boxes on the shelves.

  Suddenly, he starts to move and slowly sits up.  Dazed and
  confused, only a piece of his union cap remains on his
  head...

  ON THE GIRLS

  they breathe a sigh of relief!

  Fern approaches Hannah.

                      FERN
                (sotto)
            Uh, I forgot to tell you sometimes when
            the rebels take the gun off a corpse,
            some live rounds get left in the drum.

                      HANNAH
                (complete shock)
            Good to know, Fern.  Good to know.

  MUSIC UP.

  ON DIANE 

  SHOVING CASH in the last money bag as Cleo and Fern return,
  GRAB THE OTHER FULL BAGS and GO!  Diane's about to close her
  bag when SNIFF...SNIFF... SNIFF - she turns toward the fish
  department, puts the BAG OVER HER MOUTH and goes down to
  puke.  BEAT.  She stands, pulling her mask back down, ties
  the bag and follows the others.

  ANGLE ON SQUAD

  as they run out together.  Fern watching the rear.  Diane
  sees Snickers near the door.  She's torn - THIS IS ONE TOUGH
  CRAVING! 
  Kansas motions for her to "C'mon, run!" but Diane can't.  She
  goes back for a Snickers.  She suddenly stops, digs in her
  pocket and tosses a bill to the Cashier.

  FADE OUT MUSIC.

  ON TV SCREEN - NEWS CAMERA POV

  EXT. SAFEWAY - DAY

  An animated Lisa talks to a MALE REPORTER.  In the B.G. the
  place buzzes with POLICE, PARAMEDICS and CRIME SCENE TECHS. 
  "LIVE" flashes across the bottom of the screen.

                      LISA
                (ranting)
            ...I'm walking evidence!  One of them
            stopped my ass!
                (turning ass to camera)
            Can you get a shot of it!?
                (calling to tech)
            Hey, can someone dust my ass for prints
            over here?!

  The male reporter waves TWO PARAMEDICS OVER - signaling
  "crazy" and pointing to Lisa.

                      LISA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            I immediately started helping local
            police with their investigation.

                      LISA (CONT'D)
            Oh, wait - I almost forgot!  I-I found
            this!!!

  She pulls out the pompon string (from Fern's boot) and hands
  it up proudly as two PARAMEDICS take her arms and try to lead
  her away.  Lisa struggles to show her pompon string to
  camera.

  IN EXTREME F.G. - a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL FLOATS PAST

  PULL BACK to reveal we're watching a TV.  More money floats
  past IN FRONT OF THE SCREEN.  

  CONTINUE TO PULL BACK to REVEAL WE'RE:

  INT. KANSAS' BASEMENT - HOUR AFTER ROBBERY

  Diane, Cleo, Hannah and Lucy are laughing, throwing and
  rolling around in the money as the TV continues to play
  "LIVE" from the scene.  They're all in their undies (find out
  why in a second) - money stuffed everywhere.  Diane goes back
  to hanging freshly washed bills (from the barf bag) to dry.

                      CLEO
            Can you guys believe this?  We're like
            celebrities!

            mean, even the kids on the short bus can
            see that all the evidence points to
            Diane and the A-squad.

                      FBI AGENT
            Sure does.  Your testimony will prove
            invaluable.

  MUSIC UP

  Lisa, now the A-squad Captain, is leading a cheer.

                      LISA (V.O.)
            We were on our way to practice.  Now, I
            really need to get going, 'cause nobody
            ever got ahead by sitting on their
            behind...

  She's competent, not great.  Squad, including Fern, is
  thrilled to be cheering.  Diane, very pregnant, SMILES and
  WAVES from the stands.
