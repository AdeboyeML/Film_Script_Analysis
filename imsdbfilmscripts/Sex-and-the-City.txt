     FADE IN:


A1   EXT. 5TH AVENUE -- NEW YORK CITY -- DAY -- SUMMER           A1

     Glistening city buildings reflect onto the WINDOW of an
     upscale clothing boutique. In the window -- a MANNEQUIN is
     wearing -- the best of everything. A PRETTY TWENTY-SOMETHING
     girl looks in at the display: dreaming of the day.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Year after year, twenty-something
                women come to New York City in
                search of the two "L's": labels and
                love.


1    EXT. 5TH AVENUE/TIFFANY -- DAY -- SUMMER                    1

     Four TWENTY-SOMETHING WOMEN walk away from us -- arms linked
     LAUGHING -- They make their way down the busy street --
     shopping bags and designer purses swinging.

     The young women reveal:

     CARRIE BRADSHAW (41) and fabulous -- walking towards us. She
     watches them as they pass, a SMILE grows on her face.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Twenty years ago... I was one of
                them.

     She walks along, her shopping bag -- swinging.


2    INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT/CLOSET -- NIGHT -- SUMMER           2

     Carrie on step ladder, barefoot. Her finger moves along a
     series of DESIGNER shoe boxes...

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Having gotten the knack for labels
                early... I concentrated on my
                search for love.


3    EXT. CLUB -- NIGHT -- FALL                                  3

     Summer night. Couples everywhere. Carrie walks along.

                                              1A.


                    CARRIE (V.O.)
          Turns out, a "knock-off" is not as
          easy to spot when comes to love...

She passes a twenty-something girl and guy huddled very close
together. Suddenly, the girl SLAPS HIM across the face.

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Until it is.

CARRIE reacts, and trots along.

                                                     2.


4    EXT. STREET -- DAY -- SPRING                                    4

     CARRIE and preppy perfect CHARLOTTE walk along, talking.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               That is why you need help to spot
               them...

     JUMP CUT TO: Carrie, Charlotte and MIRANDA walk along
     talking.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               ... Lots of help.

     JUMP CUT TO: Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and SAMANTHA walk
     along; LAUGHING -- their shopping bags and designer purses
     swinging.

     The front of Carrie's building.   She is typing in her window.


5A   INT. CARRIE'S BULIDING -- CONTINUOUS                        5A

     Carrie at her desk - typing. CLOSE ON the computer screen --
     Written on it: "Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha..."

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               Year after year, my single
               girlfriends were my salvation. And,
               as it turns out...


6    INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- SPRING                        6

     CLOSE ON: A colorful CHICK LIT book cover: "A Single Life" by
     Carrie Bradshaw.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               ... My meal ticket.

     CARRIE -- standing on her bed placing it next to her TWO
     other books: "Sex and The City" and "Menhattan"

     A framed photo of four girls (circa 1999) is also on the
     shelf.

     She picks it up -- Touches it sweetly.

                         CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               We still are those four single
               girls...

                                                      3.

     CARRIE in a sexy, summer dress, spots someone -- waves --

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               Even though, technically... we're
               not.

     She hurries across the street to meet that SOMEONE...


8    INT. MIRANDA'S BROOKLYN HOUSE/BACKYARD -- DAY -- SUMMER          8

     MIRANDA (41) and BRADY (5) are filling an inflatable pool
     with water from a hose. As STEVE approaches with Popsicles,
     they squirt him with the hose. He grabs them; laughing.

                         CARRIE (V.O)
               One of us is married...


9    EXT. CENTRAL PARK CAROUSEL -- DAY -- SUMMER                      9

     Charlotte (40) and HARRY and their beautiful Asian daughter
     LILY (3) go around. Lily giggles, they kvell.

                         CARRIE (V.O)
               One of us... married, divorced and
               re-married...


10   EXT. BEACHOUSE -- DAY -- SUMMER                              10

     The deck of fabulous Malibu beachouse. Samantha (49) sits
     near the pool wearing a white bikini and huge white
     sunglasses making deals on the phone as SMITH lays nearby in
     a bathing suit -- reading a script.

                         CARRIE (V.O)
               One of us... relocated.


11   EXT. UPPER FIFTH AVE -- SAME -- SUMMER                       11

     Carrie walks over and into the arms of that SOMEONE -- it's
     MR. BIG -- waiting for her in front of an apartment building.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               And... one of us stayed exactly
               where she was.

                                                     4.


     They kiss. A good kiss.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               In love.

     A kiss worth waiting four years to see.

     They turn and start into the classic apartment building. The
     doorman tips his hat and opens the door.


12   INT. FIFTH AVENUE BUILDING/LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS               12

     Carrie and Big walk through the beautiful lobby and over to
     the elevator... holding hands.

                         BIG
               I got a good feeling about this
               one, kid.

                         CARRIE
               I've always loved this block.

                         CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Finding the perfect apartment in
               New York City is like finding the
               perfect partner. It can take years.

     They push the elevator button. Doors open. They step on.

                         BIG
               How many does this make?

                         CARRIE
               This is thirty-three.

                         BIG
               Lucky thirty-three!

     They laugh a little as the doors close on the elevator.


13   INT. FIFTH AVE BUILDING - BAD APARTMENT/HALL -- MOMENTS LATER
                                                               13

     A door is opened up by CAROL (55) their real estate agent.

                         CAROL
               The worst. I just left you a
               message.

     Carrie and Big look in. The apartment is dark, claustrophobic
     -- awful. A male BUILDING AGENT (40) stands here. The smiles
     leave Carrie and Big's faces.

                                                      5.


                         CARRIE
                   (to Big)
               Thirty-four. Lucky thirty-four?

     Big looks over at her. She shrugs.


14   INT. FIFTH AVE BUILDING/HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER             14

     The Building Agent holds the elevator doors open for Carrie,
     Big and Carol as they get on.

                         CARRIE
               If anything else opens up let us
               know. We're very interested in
               this building.

                         AGENT
               I do have another apartment that's
               not even on the market yet. Care to
               take a look?

                         CARRIE/BIG
               Sure.

                         AGENT
               It's more than you were looking to
               pay.

                         CAROL
               How much more?

                         AGENT
               More.

     The Agent reaches over and presses the "PH" button on the
     control panel. Carrie and Big react.


15   INT. PENTHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- SUMMER                    15

     A gorgeous pre-war penthouse apartment. Empty except for the
     beautiful light. Old-world New York City style. Elevator
     doors open into the penthouse foyer. Carrie and Big step in.

                         BIG
               Oh, so this is where they keep the
               light.

                                                 6.


                    CARRIE
          Oh my God. I've died and gone to
          real estate heaven. Look at this
          place.

She swirls around to Big -- very grand dame; with accent.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Hellooo, I live here.

Carrie starts giggling. Big looks over to the agents.

                    BIG
          Must be the altitude.

Big smiles. Carrie laughs as the Agent walks on.

                    AGENT
          And across the rooftop terrace ---

                     CARRIE
          What --   Nirvana?

                    AGENT
          Your wife has quite a sense of
          humor.

                    CAROL
              (Cool/quick)
          They're not married.

                    CARRIE
          No, he's my boyfriend.

                      AGENT
          This way.

The agent and Carol start out across the terrace.   Big and
Carrie follow lagging a little behind.

                    BIG
          Aren't I a little old to be
          introduced as your boyfriend?

                    CARRIE
          Point taken. From now on... you'll
          be my man friend.

                    BIG
          Sounds like a dog.

                    CARRIE
          Well, if the shoe fits.

                                                    7.


     She gives him a look. He swats her ass, gently as they go.


16   INT. PENTHOUSE/BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER                      16

     Carrie and Big lead the way into the bedroom. Big windows,
     high ceilings. Beautiful light as well.

                         AGENT
               And this is the master bedroom.

                         CARRIE
               Hideous. Hate it. Hurts my eyes.

     Big laughs, Carrie walks around taking it in.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               How is this place even available?

                         AGENT
               Nasty divorce.

                         CARRIE
               If you live here what is there to
               fight about?

     Carrie opens the closet door. It is very small.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               This is the master closet? No.

                         AGENT
               Yes. Small for a room this size. I
               know.

                         CARRIE
               Hmmm. Hmmm. Now, I understand the
               divorce.

                         BIG
               I can build you a better closet.

     Carrie looks at him; aghast. He smiles.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               Welcome home, baby.

                         CARRIE
               Can we afford this?

                           BIG
               I got it.

                                                    8.


     Carrie screams with joy and shock. He laughs, thrilled.


17   EXT. NYC STREET/CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE -- DAY -- SUMMER 17

     Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte walk down the street.

                         CARRIE
               "I got it." Just like that. "I got
               it" -- like he was picking up the
               check for coffee or something.

                         CHARLOTTE
               It sounds perfect.

                         CARRIE
               Except for the closet which Big
               says he can redo -- also he says
               the kitchen needs work but I don't
               know about that `cause I keep
               sweaters in my stove.

     Carrie and Charlotte laugh.

                         MIRANDA
               So, he bought it -- and you're
               going to live there with him?

                         CARRIE
               Yes, together. That's right.

                         MIRANDA
               But he'll own it. So. You are
               keeping your own place, right?

                         CARRIE
               Oh, Miranda, please, I haven't
               figured out all the details yet,
               but I'm a smart girl and I'm sure
               I'll figure out something I'm
               comfortable with.

                         MIRANDA
               I just want to make sure you're
               being smart here --

                         CARRIE
               And I love you for it -- but for
               now can't you stop worrying for me
               and just go ahead and feel what I
               want you to feel. Jealous.

     Miranda smiles. Carrie puts her arm around her.

                                                    9.


                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               Jealous of me living in this
               gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.

                         MIRANDA
               Fine. I'm jealous. You're in real
               estate heaven and I'm in Brooklyn.

                         CHARLOTTE
               New York magazine said Brooklyn is
               the new Manhattan.

                         MIRANDA
               Whoever wrote that - lives in
               Brooklyn.

                         CARRIE
               There she is. Hey Hollywood!

     Samantha is standing out in front of Christies. She waves to
     them -- as she finishes a call.

                         SAMANTHA
                   (on phone)
               Samantha Jones... Smith Jerrod's
               manager -- I'm in New York `till
               Monday.

     She hangs up; as they reach her.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               How was your flight?

                         SAMANTHA
               Fabulous. Let's go in -- I am so
               excited!


18   INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE/LOBBY -- DAY -- MOMENTS LATER 8
                                                               1

     A lobby bustling with NEW YORK WOMEN. All types. Carrie,
     Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda make their way through them.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               It was a rare occasion that brought
               all types of women together. The
               socialites, the trendies the
               yuppies, the yentas.

     The girls gently move past by an elderly YENTA, who reacts.

                         YENTA
               Why the pushing?

                                                    9A.


18A   INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE -- LATER                    18A

      Carrie and the girls enter a room filled with dramatically
      lit jewelry cases that display amazing jewelry. On the walls
      around the gallery are large photos of a BEAUTIFUL RAVEN
      HAIRED WOMAN (45). She is captured in candid poses "out and
      about" New York city at various social events wearing the
      jewelry on display.

                                              10.


                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Blair Elkenn was a waitress turned
          model turned actress turned
          billionaire's girlfriend who came
          home one night to find herself
          unceremoniously turned out on the
          street.

Samantha, Carrie and Charlotte page through the catalogues as
they walk. Miranda types on her Blackberry.

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And now she was getting the
          ultimate break-up revenge. An
          embarrassing and very public
          auction of all the jewelry he had
          given her when they were happy.

The girls stop. Floating in a case at their eye level is a
unique, "two finger" FLOWER RING made out of diamonds.

                    SAMANTHA
          There it is. My baby.

                    CARRIE/BIG
          And she's a beauty.

                    SAMANTHA
          When I saw this in the catalogue I
          said to Smith: This flower ring is
          the essence of me. One of a kind,
          filled with fire...

                    CARRIE
          And a little too much.

                    SAMANTHA
          Exactly. Come on. Let's go spend
          some of my hard-earned Hollywood
          money.

They make their way to the auction room.

                    MIRANDA
          Hey -- what's coming up on Smith's
          series? Is he going to sleep with
          that new blonde neurosurgeon?

                    SAMANTHA
          He sleeps with every hot woman
          doctor in that hospital.

                                                   11.


                         MIRANDA
               Great. Can't wait.

                         CHARLOTTE
               Don't you ever get weirded out by
               seeing Smith in bed with all those
               other women?

                         SAMANTHA
               No, I think it's hot. Sometimes,
               when I'm alone, I masturbate right
               along with them.

                         CARRIE
               And people say the golden age of
               television is over.

                         SAMANTHA
               Besides, it's fake sex. When
               they're doing it -- no one's
               actually turned on.

                         MIRANDA
               Kinda like Steve and I.

     Miranda laughs. Everyone looks.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               I'm kidding.
                   (Beat; then)
               But come one-- it's been seven
               years. He does that, I do this...
               It's not like a new plot twist is
               going to turn up.


19   INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE/AUCTION ROOM -- LATER        19

     A DISTINGUISHED WOMAN AUCTIONEER is at a podium.

                         AUCTIONEER
               Next item. The flower ring.

     Samantha sits up, ready. An electric buzz moves through the
     crowd.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               If Schadenfreude is the word for
               feeling pleasure at someone else
               misfortune -- This was
               "jewelryfreude."

                                              12.


                    AUCTIONEER
          Let's start the bidding at ten
          thousand.

Samantha raises her number. The Auctioneer nods.

                    AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Thank you madame. Do I hear
          fifteen?

A WOMAN IN A BUSINESS SUIT (40) on a phone, raises her
number. Samantha looks over at her.

                    SAMANTHA
          Bitch.

                    CARRIE
          And the gloves are off.

                    AUCTIONEER
          Do I hear twenty?

Samantha raises her number.

                    AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Twenty. Do I hear twenty-five?

The Woman raises her number.

                    AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Twenty-five. Thirty?

Samantha raises her number. Carrie's eyes widen.

                    AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Thirty-five?

The Woman is talking with someone on the phone.

                    MIRANDA
          She's bidding for someone on the
          phone.

                    CHARLOTTE
          That's not fair.

The Woman raises her hand. Charlotte gives her a look.

                    AUCTIONEER
          Thirty-five. Forty?

                    SAMANTHA
          I deserve this. I work hard.

                                                     13.


                         AUCTIONEER
               Do I hear forty?

     Samantha raises her hand.

                         AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
               Do I hear forty fi--

     The Woman quickly raises her hand. Auctioneer nods.

                         AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
               Fifty?

                         SAMANTHA
               Sex with only one man for I don't
               know how long.

                         AUCTIONEER
               Do I hear fifty thousand?

                         SAMANTHA
                   (Beat; loud)
               Fifty fucking thousand!

     A LAUGH ripples through the room. Samantha glares at the
     rival woman, almost daring her. Carrie looks afraid.

                         AUCTIONEER
               Fifty-five?

     The Woman raises her hand. Samantha reacts disappointed. The
     Auctioneer looks at Samantha.

                         AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
               Sixty? Sixty to our colorful
               bidder?

                         SAMANTHA
                   (to Carrie)
               I draw the line at fifty.

     Samantha shakes her head no. Carrie rubs her arm.


20   INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE/LADIES ROOM -- LATER           20

     Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte are primping in front
     of the mirror.

                         CHARLOTTE
               I thought this auction would be
               more fun... but it's kinda sad.

                                                    14.


     A BABY VOICED WOMAN (45) next to Charlotte overhears.

                           BABY VOICED WOMAN
               Isn't it?

     They look over at her.

                         BABY VOICED WOMAN (CONT'D)
               I thought it was just sad for me
               `cause I know her. But it's really
               sad, huh? And it's funny cause they
               were so happy.

                         SAMANTHA
               ... Till they weren't

                         BABY VOICED WOMAN
               I know, right? We all told her to
               get married -- but she didn't want
               to push him. He'd been married
               three other times. So, she let it
               ride and then she came home one
               night and he had locked her out.
               She didn't even have anywhere to
               live. After ten years. Such a
               shame. She was a smart girl till
               she fell in love.

     Carrie catches Miranda's eye in the mirror, looks away.


21   INT. BIG'S SUBLET/KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- SUMMER                21

     Big takes a bright red lobster out of a pot of hot water with
     tongs. He places it next to another cooked lobster. He walks
     to the cooking island where Carrie sits; sipping wine.

                          BIG
               The creatures are ready. Just gonna
               sit there?

                         CARRIE
               I'm not sitting, I'm thinking.

                         BIG
               Here. Husk and think.

                                               15.


He winks -- puts two ears of corn in front of her, then
starts chopping tomatoes.

                    CARRIE
          I'm thinking I'm going to sell my
          apartment and put the money towards
          heaven on Fifth.

                    BIG
          Why? You love your place.

                    CARRIE
          I know but --

                      BIG
          But what?

                    CARRIE
          We're together ever night -- so I'm
          basically paying a mortgage on a
          glorified closet.

                    BIG
          You write there. It's your office.

                    CARRIE
          There's plenty of room at the new
          place and -- besides.. I want to
          make us -- a life there. I want it
          to be ours.

                    BIG
          It is ours. I bought it for us.

                    CARRIE
          And that's so amazing --but you
          bought it, so it's really your
          place. And -- if anything were to
          happen...

                    BIG
          What's going to happen?

                    CARRIE
          I have to be smart here. I mean,
          we're not married and I'd have no
          legal rights to... this home that I
          built... with you.

Silence. He thinks. Chops. She husks.

                    BIG
          Did you want to get married?

                                              16.


                    CARRIE
          I didn't think it was an option.

                     BIG
          Well, Mr. Bradshaw, what if it was
          an option?

She hits him with a husk. He smiles.

                    CARRIE
          Well, people are always assuming we
          are.

                    BIG
          And you know what happens when
          people assume. They make an ass out
          of who?

                    CARRIE
          You and me.

He smiles. She smiles. Chop. Chop.

                    BIG
          What do you think, kid?

                    CARRIE
          Why -- Do you want to get married?

                    BIG
          Well, I wouldn't mind be married to
          you. Would you mind being married
          to me?

                    CARRIE
          No, if that's what you want. Is
          that what you want?

                    BIG
          I want you. So. Okay.

                    CARRIE
          Okay. Really? We're getting
          married.

                     BIG
          We're getting married.
              (Beat)
          Should we get you a diamond?

                    CARRIE
          No, please, don't get me a diamond.
              (Beat; then)
          Get me a really big closet.

                                             16A.


                    BIG
          Deal.

He puts out his hand. She takes it and they shake.

                    BIG (CONT'D)
          But... You gotta do better on that
          corn. Look at all the stuff left on
          there.

She looks down at her corn, he's right. She nods.

                                                    17.


22   INT. MODERN RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SUMMER                      22

     Crowded; serious lunch crowd. Carrie sits across from
     Charlotte and Miranda. Miranda is in a work suit.

                         CARRIE
               So, the other night, Big and I were
               talking about, you know, moving in
               together and our future...

     Charlotte's eyes are getting wider and wider.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               ... And about what makes sense as
               we move forward. And, well... we
               decided to get married.

     Charlottes SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Carrie and
     Miranda and the ENTIRE RESTAURANT REACT.

                         MIRANDA
               ... and I'm deaf.

                         CARRIE
               Everyone's looking

     Charlotte looks around at the DISGRUNTLED FACES. She half-
     stands and address the DINERS looking at her.

                         CHARLOTTE
               Sorry! I'm sorry... but my friend
               here, just got engaged and she's
               been going out with the man for ten
               years.

     The DINERS bursts into APPLAUSE. Carrie slumps in her chair,
     pulls up her sweater collar, turns to Miranda.

                         CARRIE
               I am mortified.

                         MIRANDA
               There is literally a ringing in my
               ear.


23   INT. SAMANTHA JONES MANAGEMENT -- DAY                        23

     A large PHOTO of Smith. Samantha walks past it and up a
     sleek, modern office building stairway. Her cell rings.

                                                   18.


                         SAMANTHA
               Samantha Jones--


24   INT. FENDI -- LATER -- SUMMER                               24

     Intercut with Carrie walking through the upscale boutique
     talking on her pink Swarovski crystal-covered cell phone.

                         CARRIE
               Well... I made a little decision
               that I hope you'll be happy about.

                         SAMANTHA
               Oh, honey... you finally got Botox.

                         CARRIE
               No. I did not get Botox

                         SAMANTHA
               I'm telling you, Carrie -- you'll
               love it.

                         CARRIE
               I did not call to talk about Botox.

                         SAMANTHA
               I'm just saying.

     Samantha reaches the top of the stairs. Blow-ups of Smith on
     various magazine covers line the walls of the chic, small
     office space.

                         CARRIE
               So... Last week, after the auction,
               I started thinking about my
               options.

                         SAMANTHA
               Right.

                         CARRIE
               Right, and... well, Big and I
               decided to get married.

                         SAMANTHA
               Really?

                         CARRIE
               Yes.

                         SAMANTHA
               That's great.

                                                   19.


                         CARRIE
               You sounded more excited about the
               botox.

                         SAMANTHA
               Well, honey -- I am excited for you
               but -- you know me... I don't
               really believe in marriage....
               Botox on the other hand -- That
               works every time.

     A RECEPTIONIST (23) hands her some messages.

                         SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
               Honey, I've got to go. The People
               magazine person is on hold. Smith's
               on the short list to be their
               "Sexiest Man Alive." We can catch
               up when I'm in town next week.

     Samantha hangs up. Carrie looks at her phone: dismissed and
     disappointed. She closes it and walks on.


25   INT. FENDI -- A LITTLE LATER                               25

     Carrie rounds a corner. Her phone rings.

                            CARRIE
               Hello?


26   INT. SAMANTHA JONES MANAGEMENT -- CONTINUOUS               26

     Intercut with Samantha standing in her office.

                         SAMANTHA
               I think I was in shock. I mean,
               it's you getting married. This is
               not some random person -- it's you.

                            CARRIE
               I hear ya.

                         SAMANTHA
               And I guess, I thought that after
               that big mess with Aidan -- you'd
               never want to get married.

                            CARRIE
               I know.

                                           19A.


                  SAMANTHA
        So, I put you in my "we're never
        getting married" file. Now, I've
        got to take you out of that file.

                  CARRIE
        Sorry about the extra paper work.

                  SAMANTHA
        You'll get my bill.

                  CARRIE
        Samantha, it feels so different
        this time. No cliché romantic
        kneeling down on one knee. Just you
        know, two grown-ups -- making a
        decision about spending their lives
        together.

                                                   20.


                         SAMANTHA
               Well, I'm happy for you.

                         CARRIE
               And one more thing... I want you to
               be maid of honor. How do you feel
               about that?

                         SAMANTHA
               The same way you feel about Botox.
               Painful and unnecessary.

     Carrie laughs. Samantha shrugs.


27   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- SUMMER                   27

     Carrie and Charlotte sit on her bed looking through a list of
     names. ANTHONY sits at her makeup vanity. He has a large
     notebook open in front of him.

                         CHARLOTTE
               74, 75, 76.... Seventy-six guests.

                         ANTHONY
               Seventy five sounds better. "A
               small, wedding of seventy five
               guests."

     Carrie looks at the list.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               As a wedding gift, Charlotte had
               given me Anthony Marantino --
               friend and wedding planner.

     Carrie crosses someone off. Charlotte reacts, shocked.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               What? She was borderline anyway.

                                              21.


                    ANTHONY
          Cut throat -- I love it. I hope
          you're that decisive when it comes
          to the location and the dress.

                    CARRIE
          Oh. I found the dress.

                    CHARLOTTE
          What?! When?

                    CARRIE
          The other day. I have it here.

Carrie gets up and goes into the closet. Anthony hurries over
and sits next to Charlotte.

                    ANTHONY
          This is going to be good!

                    CHARLOTTE
          I'm so excited!

                    CARRIE (V.O.)
          Here it is.

Anthony and Charlotte grab hands in anticipation as Carrie
comes out of her closet. She holds up a simple OFF-WHITE
VINTAGE SUIT. Charlotte and Anthony deflate.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Well... that was the exact reaction
          I was aiming for.

                    CHARLOTTE
          No, it's pretty but it's so --
          simple.

                    CARRIE
          Simple and classic. When I saw it I
          just thought: That is what I should
          marry Big in.

                    ANTHONY
          Well, who's it by? The label?

                    CARRIE
          No one. I found it in a vintage
          shop.

                    ANTHONY
          "The bride wore a dress by no one."

                                                   22.


     She turns and heads back into the closet.

                         CARRIE
                   (As she goes)
               Don't worry, I'll style it up with
               shoes.

     Anthony turns to Charlotte and says in a low voice.

                         ANTHONY
               The invitation is fancier than the
               dress.

                         CARRIE (O.C.)
               I heard that.


28   INT. BROOKLYN RESTAURANT -- NIGHT -- SUMMER                  28

     A "family style" Italian restaurant. Miranda, in business
     clothes, sits with Steve, Brady and MAGDA. Brady's face is
     covered in spaghetti sauce.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               And from Anthony Marantino to
               spaghetti marinara.

                         MIRANDA
               Where is he with the check?

                         STEVE
               Geese, Miranda -- relax. Magda's
               not even finished yet.

                         MIRANDA
               I still have a legal brief to work
               on when I get home.

                         BRADY
               I have to go to the bathroom.

                         MAGDA
               I'll take him. Wash that beautiful
               face too, yes?

     Brady nods. Magda walks away with Brady. Miranda is packing
     up Brady's action figures. Steve gives her a look.

                         MIRANDA
               What? I'm sorry. I'm exhausted.
               Brady woke me up at five AM.

                                                     23.


                         STEVE
               He woke me up too.

     Silence. She sips her cappuccino. Foam covers her top lip. He
     looks over at her and smiles.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
               You got milk on your top lip.

     She licks it off, not pleased.

                           STEVE (CONT'D)
               What now?

                         MIRANDA
               It's like you're always criticizing
               me.

                          STEVE
               I am not.
                    (Beat; then, cute)
               You want to go through life with
               foam on your lip and no one telling
               you?

     Silence. He reaches down and picks up her coffee cup and
     sips... putting lots of foam on his lip. He looks over.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
               Anything you want to tell me?

     She shakes her head: No. He puts his face in front of hers.
     She laughs. He licks his lip.


29   INT. MIRANDA AND STEVE'S BEDROOM -- LATER                    29

     Steve is in bed with Miranda, they are making love. She is
     wearing a T-shirt.

                         MIRANDA
               Yeah. Yeah.

                          STEVE
               Wait --- wait -- Don't come
               already...

                         MIRANDA
               Yeah. Yeah.

                         STEVE
               Wait, wait -- get on top.    Get on --

                                                     24.


                         MIRANDA
               It's late... let's just get it over
               with.

     Steve looks at her. She can't believe what she's said.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               I mean -- We have to get up in four
               and half hours.

                         STEVE
               We never have sex and you want to
               get it over with?

                         MIRANDA
               Steve... We have sex.

                         STEVE
               When was the last time we had sex?

     Miranda can't remember. He moves to his side of the bed.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
                   (As he turns away)
               There was snow on the ground.

     He gets out of the bed and walks away. She watches him go.


30   INT. COFFEE SHOP -- DAY -- SUMMER                            30

     The girls are having breakfast. Lily sits at the table in a
     booster seat coloring in a Cinderella coloring book. Carrie
     is helping her. CLOSE ON: Cinderella's shoe. Carrie is
     filling it in with a BLUE CRAYON.

                         MIRANDA
               How often do you guys have sex?

                         CHARLOTTE
               Miranda -- please.

                         MIRANDA
               What?

     She indicates that Lily is sitting with Carrie. Carrie
     continues to color, not looking up.

                         CARRIE
               It's okay, I know all about sex.

                                           24A.


                  SAMANTHA
        If I knew the girl talk was going
        to be on "lock down," I wouldn't
        have flown two thousand miles.

                                              25.


                     CHARLOTTE
          No, we can talk, let's just not use
          that word.

                    MIRANDA
          She's three, she doesn't know what
          it means. I'm forty- two and I
          still don't know what it means.

                    CHARLOTTE
          I know, but she's repeating
          everything.

                    MIRANDA
          Fine. How often do you guys...

                    CARRIE
          ... "Color"?

                       CHARLOTTE
          Thank-you.

                    SAMANTHA
          Well, I can't color enough. I would
          color all day -- every day if I had
          my way. I'd use every crayon in my
          box.

                    CARRIE
          We get it. You love to color.
              (To Miranda)
          Why are you asking?

                    MIRANDA
          Steve and I were "coloring" last
          night and just as I was about to --

Miranda is searching for a word she can use.

                    SAMANTHA
          Come?
              (beat; to Charlotte)
          Sorry -- there is no crayon
          equivalent.

                    MIRANDA
          He wanted to change positions and I
          said... "Let's just get it over
          with."

The ladies react, three different shades of shocked.

                                           25A.


                  MIRANDA (CONT'D)
        Well, he kept trying to make it
        last longer.

                  SAMANTHA
        And this is bad?

                                              26.


                    MIRANDA
          It is when you have a full-time
          job.

                    SAMANTHA
          I have a full-time job.

                    MIRANDA
          Well, you don't also have a five
          year old and play groups and PTA
          and a mother-in-law in a rest home
          with advancing Alzheimer's. I'm
          telling you, at the end of the day
          all I want to do is sleep. The most
          exciting thing in bed now -- is the
          bed.

                    CARRIE
          So... Sleep is the new sex?

                    LILY
          Sex.

                    CHARLOTTE
          See.

                    CARRIE
          -- I meant coloring.

                    MIRANDA
          We're just going through a no
          coloring phase -- it comes and
          goes, right?

                    CHARLOTTE
          Every couple is different. Harry
          and I --

Carrie and Samantha look over; interested.

                    CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
          ... Make love two or three times a
          week.

                    MIRANDA
          Great. Now I feel worse.

                    SAMANTHA
          Well, when was the last time for
          you?

                    MIRANDA
          Six months ago.

                                                    27.


                          CARRIE
                Oh my.

      Miranda looks at her. She -- continues to color.

                          MIRANDA
                But that's a dry spell.

                          SAMANTHA
                I bet it is.

                          CHARLOTTE
                What about you and Big, Carrie?
                    (Off her look)
                Come on, I told.

                          CARRIE
                Never. But, I will tell you this.
                When Big colors --
                    (Beat; sexy)
                He rarely stays inside the lines.

      Samantha whoops. Carrie resumes coloring.

                          MIRANDA
                Well, this was very helpful.


30A   INT. BEACHOUSE/BATHROOM -- SUNSET -- SUMMER               30A

      A freshly-showered Samantha sits on a chaise lounge in a robe
      -- talking on the phone.

                          SAMANTHA
                Send it to Smith Jerrod at the
                office address.

      Smith walks up to Samantha wearing only underwear. There is a
      huge bulge in the front. Samantha takes the bulge in.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    (into phone)
                I've got to go. Something just came
                up.

      She hangs up. He smiles, looks down at her.

                          SMITH
                I've got a gift for you.

                          SAMANTHA
                So far, I like it.

                                             27A.


He smiles as she reaches INTO his underwear basket and
removes a long black velvet jewelry case. She opens it. It's
the petal ring from the auction.

                    SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
          How did -- Wait -- that was you on
          the phone at the auction?

                    SMITH
          I knew how much you wanted it.

                    SAMANTHA
          But I was going to buy it for
          myself.

                     SMITH
          I wanted to give it to you... for
          our anniversary. We met five years
          ago today.

                    SAMANTHA
              (beat; had no idea)
          Right.

He smiles, sits down on the bed.

                    SMITH
          Do you like it?

                    SAMANTHA
          To be clear -- This is a ring with
          diamonds -- not a diamond ring,
          right?
              (Off his nod)
          In that case... I love it.
              (Re; underwear)
          It's my second favorite thing I've
          ever found in there.

She kisses him, touched -- then reaches in his underwear.

                    SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
          Now, my gift's a little bit more...
          oral.

                    SMITH
          Babe -- I've got to go to bed.

                    SAMANTHA
          Bed? It's seven-thirty.

                                                     27B.


                          SMITH
                I have to be at the studio by six
                A.M. and I need to get a workout
                before that.

                          SAMANTHA
                This is how it starts. Next thing
                you know... we're only having sex
                three or four times a week.

                          SMITH
                Most people consider that normal.

                          SAMANTHA
                I am not most people.

                          SMITH
                No - you most certainly are not.

      He smiles, leans in and gives her a hot -- hot kiss. The kiss
      leads -- to reaching into underwear... as they start.


30B   INT. BEACHOUSE/ BEDROOM -- NIGHT                            30B

      Smith is laying in bed. Sound asleep. The clock on the bed
      table reads: 9:01.


30C   EXT. BEACHOUSE/JACUZZI -- CONTINUOUS                        30C

      Night. Samantha sits in the jacuzzi wearing her ring --
      sipping a glass of wine -- bored.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                One glass of Merlot and two orgasms
                later.

      Samantha hears MOANING. The sounds of someone having SEX in
      the house right next door. She looks -- from the hot tub she
      can see her neighbor DANTE -- hot, dark -- "sex on a stick"
      in his living room making wild love to a RED HAIRED WOMAN.
      They are naked. Samantha watches and sips -- not so bored.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                And that is how Samantha learned
                she had a new neighbor.


31    INT. BIG'S SUBLET -- NIGHT -- SUMMER                         31

      Carrie enters the apartment.   It is dark-ish. A candle or two
      is lit.

                                                    27C.


                             CARRIE
                    (soft)
                John?

      The terrace doors are open. The curtains blow, gently.   She
      walks out onto it.


31A   EXT. BIG'S SUBLET -- CONTINUOUS                            31A

      As she steps out onto the terrace. Big comes up behind her.
      He -- leans her against the door jamb and kisses her. It's
      hot. He kisses her -- sliding down the front of her body.


32    INT. BIG'S SUBLET/BEDROOM-- LATER -- SUMMER                  32

      Big is in bed wearing "half glasses," reading The Wall Street
      Journal. Carrie enters from the bathroom and hops into bed.
      She grabs a LIBRARY BOOK from the night stand and looks over.

                             CARRIE
                Lean?

      He nods and lifts up one of his arms. She slides over and
      nestles in, leaning up against him. She opens her book. He
      looks down at it.

                          BIG
                Are you the last person in New York
                still taking out library books?

                                                28.


                    CARRIE
          I love the smell.

She smells the book, then holds it up to him. He smells.

                    BIG
          That's an old one.

                    CARRIE
          "The Love Letters of Great Men."
          Volume one.

                    BIG
          Am I in there?

                    CARRIE
          No, but some of your classmates
          are. Voltaire, Napoleon...

Big smiles. She takes the glasses off his face and puts them
on, looks at book.

                    BIG
          You need to get glasses.

                    CARRIE
          No, I don't -- you have them.
              (then; off book)
          Here's Napoleon...
              (Reads)
          "My dearest Josephine, I wake
          consumed with thoughts of you --"

                    BIG
          Typical short guy. Gives it all
          away up front.

She punches him a little, continues to read.

                    BIG (CONT'D)
          Why are you reading this?

                    CARRIE
          Research for my new book.

                    BIG
          What's it about?

                    CARRIE
          Love. I use to write about finding
          love-- now I want to write about
          what happens after you've found it.

                                           28A.


                  BIG
        Interesting. What happens?

                  CARRIE
        Stay tuned.

                                              29.


He smiles. She looks at the book again.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Listen... Here's Beethoven.

                    BIG
          Bring it, Ludwig.

                    CARRIE
              (Reading)
          "My thoughts go out to you today my
          immortal beloved. I can live only
          wholly with you or not at all."

                    BIG
          Good stuff.

                    CARRIE
              (Reading)
          "Be calm my life, my all. Only by
          calm consideration of our existence
          can we achieve our purpose to live
          together. Oh continue to love me,
          never misjudge the most faithful
          heart of your beloved. Ever thine --
          ever mine -- ever ours.

Silence. The beautiful sentiment hangs in the air. She closes
the book and looks up at him.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Have you ever written me a love
          letter?

                    BIG
          Does a love fax count?

                    CARRIE
          When have I ever gotten a love fax?

                    BIG
          I'm pretty sure my secretary sent
          one at some point.

Carrie looks at him, mock disappointed.

                     BIG (CONT'D)
          What can I say, baby? Not my
          style.
              (Beat)
          Besides, these guys had to write--
          they were separated from their
          loves by wars and hundreds of
          miles. I'm right here.
                     (MORE)

                                                     30.

                              BIG (CONT'D)
                     (Beat)
               Hi.

     She smiles. He kisses her on the forehead. Sincere.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               You make me very happy.

                         CARRIE
               Yeah, yeah.... Put it in writing.

     He laughs, she looks at her book, turns a page and reads.
     After a beat, he puts down his paper.

                          BIG
               Alright. Here's a love letter from
               me to you.

     She looks up at him, excited. He speaks romantically.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               Loving you. Is easy... `cause your
               beautiful...

     Big continues --   now SINGING the Minnie Ripperton classic.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE
               IS FILLED WITH LOVING YOU. LA LA LA
               LA LA LA LA OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.

     Carrie LAUGHS as he continues to massacre the high notes.


33   EXT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY -      DAY -- SUMMER            33

     Carrie runs past the stone lions and up the grand stairs
     holding three LIBRARY BOOKS in her hand.


34   INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY/LOBBY -- LATER -- SUMMER        34

     Carrie stands at the entrance while a FEMALE GUARD (60)
     checks the contents of her purse. A FLORAL DELIVERY MAN comes
     in carrying a GORGEOUS ARRANGEMENT OF WHITE FLOWERS. He calls
     to the Guard.

                         DELIVERY MAN
               Which way's the wedding?

     The Guard points, bored. Carrie looks, interested.

                                                  30A.


35   INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY/WEDDING SPACE -- MOMENTS LATER 5
                                                               3

     A beautiful space. The tables are being set up as MORE
     FLOWERS arrive. Carrie tip-toes in and looks around. A SMILE
     grows on her face.

                                                   31.


36   INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT -- SUMMER                         36

     Carrie and Big sit at the bar -- having dinner.

                         CARRIE
               I've been thinking.

                         BIG
               Again?

                         CARRIE
               How about we get married at The New
               York Public Library?
                   (Gushy and silly)
               Think how perfect. You and I and
               our love story surrounded by all
               the other lesser love stories.

                         BIG
               Do we have to make that big of a
               deal?

                         CARRIE
               It's not that big a deal. It's
               seventy-five people in a room
               that's partitioned in half.

                         BIG
               It's just -- I've already had two
               big weddings.

     Carrie winces -- stung. After a beat, she goes on.

                         CARRIE
               Well, what did you have in mind?

                         BIG
               I don't know -- a judge, couple
               friends and then we go for ham and
               eggs after.

     A bucket of cold water.

                         CARRIE
               Interesting.

     Big looks over at her. She looks upset, hurt, sad. Silence.

                         BIG
               Would we have to whisper? In the
               library?

                                              32.


Carrie looks over at him, softens a little.

                    BIG (CONT'D)
          "Do you, Carrie" -- Shhhh. "Take
          this man" -- SHHHH!

He raises his eyebrow. She laughs. ELAINE (40) Zaftig, Jewish
-- spots Carrie.

                    ELAINE
          Carrie, hi!

                    CARRIE
          Elaine, hi. Do you know John?

                    ELAINE
          No, hi. Nice to meet you.

                    CARRIE
          Elaine writes a single gal column
          for The New York Post.

                    ELAINE
          Please -- I'd rather you reveal my
          weight.

Carrie and Big laugh.

                    ELAINE (CONT'D)V.O.)
          So, what's new?

                    CARRIE
          Well. We're getting married.

                    BIG
          Yep -- At the New York Public
          Library.

Carrie looks at Big, touched. Elaine is delighted, TEARFUL.

                    ELAINE
          Oh, my God! This gives me such
          hope.

She hugs Carrie, then hugs Big. Then hugs Big again.

                    ELAINE (CONT'D)
          Thank-you. Thank-you for marrying
          someone our age.

                                                    33.


37   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/DINING ROOM -- DAY -- SUMMER     37

     Charlotte, Harry and Lily are having breakfast. A KING
     CHARLES SPANIEL and TWO MUTTS sit on the floor looking up at
     them. Charlotte pages through the New York Post -- She
     notices something. CLOSE ON: NEWSPAPER; A small PHOTO: of
     Carrie on "PAGE SIX" above a mention of the wedding.
     Charlotte SCREAMS. Harry and Lily JUMP. She grabs the
     cordless phone from the table.


38   INT. BIG'S SUBLET -- MOMENTS LATER                          38

     Intercut with Carrie on the phone as Big sips coffee.

                         CHARLOTTE
                   (reading paper)
               "The ultimate single gal Carrie
               Bradshaw will be married in Manolos
               to New York financier John James
               Preston come fall."

                         CARRIE
                   (to Big)
               Our wedding's on Page Six.

                         BIG
                   (not pleased)
               Who would put that in there?

     Carrie shrugs, Charlotte continues reading.

                         CHARLOTTE
               "Proving to single gals everywhere
               that there can be a happy ending
               over forty."

                         CARRIE
               Oh, I know who.


39   EXT. NYC STREET -- DAY -- LATER -- SUMMER                   39

     Carrie is walking down the street with STANFORD.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               Later that day, I met my friend
               Stanford for our weekly quick lunch
               and gossip session... Also known
               as "dish then dash."

                                               33A.


                    STANFORD
          According to a certain trashy tome,
          you are marrying John James
          Preston.

                    CARRIE
          Rumor has it.

                    STANFORD
          Just one question: Does Big know?

                    CARRIE
              (laughs; then)
          Where are we eating?

                    STANFORD
          Anywhere you like... and you know
          the rule -- the person on Page Six
          pays for lunch.

Carrie laughs. TWO WOMEN spot her and scream.   She and
Stanford REACT as the women GUSH.

                                                      34.


40   INT. RESTAURANT -- LATER -- SUMMER                            40

     Carrie and Stanford are mid-meal. Three GAY MALE friends (3O-
     40) stand at their table and gush.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               It seemed everywhere I went...
               people I knew were excited and
               available to come to the wedding.

     A WAITRESS (23) places a check on the table.    Stanford looks
     at it, then leans in to waitress.

                         STANFORD
               You forgot to charge us for the
               gaggle of gays.


41   EXT. STREET -- LATER -- SUMMER                                41

     Carrie and Stanford are walking by a nail salon as BITSY VON
     MUFFLING, socialite, comes running out -- Mid-pedicure. She
     is barefoot with foam pads stuck between her painted toes.

                         BITSY
               Carrie Bradshaw Preston! Carrie
               Bradshaw Preston!

     Carrie and Stanford stop -- turn around.    Bitsy gushes.

                         BITSY (CONT'D)
               Mazel tov! Saw you on Page Six!
               September? October? When?
                   (beat; realizes feet)
               Look! Will you look! I got so
               excited -- no shoes. I'm standing
               barefoot on a New York sidewalk
               probably getting trichinoses.

     She hurries away, turning back to CALL as she goes.

                         BITSY (CONT'D)
               We're at the same address --
               different floor. Just send it --
               they'll get us the invite.

     She waves, goes back inside.   Carrie looks stunned.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               The shocking thing was not the
               plethora of empty autumn social
               calenders but knowledge that
               everyone does indeed read Page Six.

                                                   34A.


41A   INT. VOGUE OFFICES/RECEPTION AREA -- DAY -- SUMMER         41A

      Carrie opens the glass door and walks into the Vogue offices.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Even people you didn't expect, like
                my Vogue editor, Enid.


42    INT. VOGUE OFFICES/ENID'S OFFICE -- LATER                  42

      Carrie is with ENID (60) her stunning, icy Vogue editor.

                          ENID
                We're putting together our annual
                "Age" issue -- and we'd like you to
                do forty.

                          CARRIE
                Great. Who am I interviewing?

                          ENID
                No. You. You are forty. I want you
                to be featured in the magazine as
                the forty year old -- and here's
                the brilliant twist -- bride.

                          CARRIE
                Wait -- I would be in the magazine?

                                              35.


                    ENID
          In bridal couture. It's a once in a
          lifetime opportunity - so spare me
          a week of faux soul-searching and
          just say yes.

                    CARRIE
          Enid -- I'm so very flattered but--

                     ENID
          Carrie. Vogue designers, Vogue
          photographers, Vogue airbrushing.
              (Beat)
          Nod your head: yes.

Carrie smiles and nods.

                    ENID (CONT'D)
          Thank-you. It will be a sensation.
          We're calling it: "The Last Single
          Girl."

                    CARRIE
          Well, I'm hardly the last single
          girl.

                    ENID
          No, but forty is the last age you
          can see a woman photographed in a
          wedding gown without the unintended
          Diane Arbus subtext.

                    CARRIE
          I thought the issue was "great
          style at every age."

                    ENID
          Style yes... bride no.

                    CARRIE
              (smiles; then)
          Enid -- I have no idea -- were you
          ever married?

                    ENID
          Briefly. In 1975. I wore Halston.
          Creme. One shoulder Grecian with a
          low-cut bodice to the waistline for
          a dramatic flair. The fabric in the
          sleeves formed oval draping on the
          sides. Stunning. My future husband
          and I saw it on a trip to Paris and
          he fell in love with it.
                    (MORE)

                                           35A.

                  ENID (CONT'D)
        Insisted I be married in it. So I
        was. We had quite a beautiful
        party.

                  CARRIE
            (smiles; then delicately)
        Why didn't the marriage work out?

                  ENID
        Did you not hear me say my husband
        fell in love with my gown?
            (beat; off Carrie's nod)
        Has your fiancée expressed any
        interest in what you'll be wearing?

                  CARRIE
        None at all.

                  ENID
        Then you may have a shot.

                                                       36.


43    INT. VOGUE PHOTO SHOOT SET -- DAY -- SUMMER                   43

      Carrie stands on the set of a Vogue photo shoot wearing a
      GORGEOUS VERA WANG GOWN. Hair, make-up: stunning. She is
      surrounded by VOGUE STYLISTS and CREW. Carrie looks over to
      Samantha, Stanford and Charlotte standing on the side-lines,
      watching. They signal their approval. Carrie smiles...
      tentative -- but excited.

                           SAMANTHA
                 She's looking quite at home for
                 someone who didn't think she had
                 the bride gene.

                           CHARLOTTE
                 Well, I guess with the right man...

                           STANFORD
                 ... And the right dress.

      Charlotte and Samantha smile.

                           STANFORD (CONT'D)
                 When I get married, I'm wearing
                 something like that. But bigger.

      Samantha and Charlotte laugh. The PHOTOGRAPHER starts
      working. FLASH! Carrie poses. FLASH!

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 Just your typical Wednesday.

      FLASH!   Carrie in another FAMOUS DESIGNER wedding gown.

      Samantha holds up her iPhone and takes a photograph of
      Carrie. Charlotte looks at it, smiles, then presses --
      "send."


43A   INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS                          43A

      Miranda is at her desk, working -- her phone -- "beeps." She
      picks it up -- CLOSE ON: PHONE announcing a photo arrival.
      She opens the photo - it's Carrie in the wedding dress.
      Miranda smiles.

                                                    36A.

      beautiful in it.

                And for dessert -- Vivienne
                Westwood.

                                                        37.


        Charlotte and Stanford are looking at Carrie, moved.

                            CARRIE (CONT'D)
                  A confection so special...

        Samantha reaches up and wipes away a tear.

                            CARRIE (CONT'D)
                  ... It could wring a wedding tear
                  from even the most unbelieving of
                  women.


44      INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- SUMMER                     44

        Carrie opens the door to find a DELIVERY MAN standing there
        with a very large dress box tied by a lush RIBBON.

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  And then the impossible happened.

        JUMP CUT TO: Carrie pulling back the tissue paper to reveal:
        her favorite wedding gown. Carrie picks up a hand-written
        note on an engraved note card from VIVIENNE WESTWOOD. It
        reads: "I saw the photos from the shoot. This dress belongs
        to you. Cheers!"


45      INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT/CLOSET -- LATER -- SUMMER            45

        Carrie peeks around the closet and looks in. The gown is
        hanging next to the white suit, dwarfing it.

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  And just like that, Vivienne
                  Westwood kicked my sweet little
                  suit's ass.


49   INT. PENTHOUSE/BEDROOM -- DAY -- LATE SUMMER               49

     Big leads Carrie into their new bedroom by the hand. Her eyes
     are closed and she has a DESIGNER shopping bag slung over her
     one arm. He moves her around the construction debris,
     stopping in front of the new closet's double doors.

                         BIG
               Okay. Open them.

     Carrie opens her eyes.

                         CARRIE
               Double door. So far so good.

                                                    40.


     She opens the closet doors, revealing a beautiful oversized,
     walk-in closet with shelves and more shelves and places for
     shoes and more shoes.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               Well. You did me proud, Mister.

                          BIG
               Like it?

                         CARRIE
               Like it? It's love at first sight.

     He smiles, proud. She takes the DESIGNER shoe box out of her
     shopping bag and hands it to him. She opens the lid, takes
     out a pair of COLORFUL/FUN HEELS and places them on the
     shelf. She turns back to him.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
               Now, I believe this is all really
               happening.


50   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- LATE SUMMER               50

     Miranda, Charlotte and Carrie are standing in Carrie's
     apartment. Empty boxes are everywhere. Lily is coloring
     quietly nearby.

                         MIRANDA
               I can't believe it sold so fast.

                         CHARLOTTE
               It's a sign.

                         CARRIE
               Yeah, a sign I priced it too low.

     The door buzzes. Carrie pushes the intercom button.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
               That's the food -- money on the
               table.
                   (Beat)
               I'll get started in the closet... I
               should be done in seventeen years.

     Carrie starts into the bathroom. Charlotte calls:

                         CHARLOTTE
               Pink Post-it -- take. Purple --
               toss. Yellow: Storage.

                                                     41.


                         CARRIE (O.C)
                   (Calling out)
               You're good friends.

     There is a knock on the door. Miranda opens it. Samantha
     stands there with her carry-on luggage.

                         CHARLOTTE
               Samantha! Oh my God!

     Carrie re-enters from the bathroom... stunned.

                         CARRIE
               What are you doing here?!

                         SAMANTHA
               I lot of shit went down in this
               place. Attention must be payed!

     She reaches into her bag and pulls out a bottle of champagne.
     They all CHEER. She reaches in again and pulls out another
     bottle. More cheering.


51   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- LATER                     51

     Samantha is packing Carrie's collection of CD's, tapes and
     albums. She puts on a "Best of the 80's" CD.

     MUSIC START: Run DMC & Aerosmith: "WALK THIS WAY."

     Carrie comes   out of her closet wearing an outfit that screams
     "80's." Lily   looks up from her coloring. Miranda, Charlotte
     and Samantha   sit on the bed drinking champagne. Carrie poses.
     They hold up   hand-written signs: "Take" or "Toss."

     JUMP CUT TO: Carrie comes out of the closet wearing another
     "80's" outfit. The girls vote: "Take, Take, Toss." Carrie
     nods.

     JUMP CUT TO: Carrie comes out of the closet wearing a tight
     pink top and a tutu. The girls LAUGH; then all hold up:
     "Toss." Carrie reacts.

     JUMP CUT TO: Carrie comes out wearing a late "90's" outfit.
     The girls vote: "Take, Take, Take." Carrie is thrilled - she
     keeps it.

     JUMP CUT TO: Miranda wearing something from Carrie's closet.

     JUMP CUT TO: Charlotte wearing something from Carrie's
     closet.

     JUMP CUT TO: Samantha wearing something from Carrie's closet.

                                                  41A.


     JUMP CUT TO: Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha LAUGHING
     -- at something. REVEAL: Lily standing in the closet, naked
     except for her training underpants. Her arms are outstretched
     and draped with Carrie's small purses and bags.


52   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT -- LATE SUMMER             52

     The girls in the apartment are surrounded by many, boxes.

                                                   42.


                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               It took four friends, three days to
               put twenty years into twenty-eight
               boxes.


53   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- LATE SUMMER                53

     Carrie walks through her now, empty apartment. She takes one
     last long look and leaves. END MUSIC.


54   INT. REST HOME -- DAY -- LATE SUMMER                         54

     Steve sits in a chair as Miranda hands a cup of tea to his
     mother MARY. She looks up at Miranda, lost.

                         MARY
               Who are you again?

                         MIRANDA
               Oh, you know me -- I'm your
               daughter-in-law.
                   (beat; then)
               I'm Miranda.

                         MARY
               That's right.

     Miranda nods and smiles. Steve watches, touched.


55   INT. MIRANDA AND STEVE'S HOUSE/KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- LT. SUMMER
                                                               55

     Miranda is putting away groceries. Steve is sitting at the
     kitchen table.

                         MIRANDA
               While I run over to see your mother
               tomorrow maybe you can take him to
               the first birthday party alone.
               Then -- I'll meet you at the twins'
               party and you can leave and be at
               the bar by six.

     She looks over at him. He looks strange.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               What's the matter? Steve.

     He starts crying.

                         STEVE
               -- I had sex with someone else.

                                                   43.


     Miranda can't believe her ears.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
               -- And you are so amazing with Ma
               and everything... everything you do
               and I can't believe I would do that
               to you.

     Miranda just sits -- looking at him.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
               You and I hadn't had sex in a
               really long time and I --

     Miranda shakes her head, turns and walks out of the kitchen.
     He gets up and follows her.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
               It didn't mean anything -- It was
               just once... and it's been killing
               me.

     She stops and turns around. He stops.

                         MIRANDA
               It's killing you?!

     She starts down the hall again. He's on her heels.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
               It just happened... I wasn't
               thinking.

                         MIRANDA
               Do not follow me.

     She starts up the stairs. He stops at the bottom and watches
     her go. Lost as to what to do next.


56   INT. BIG SUBLET -- A LITTLE LATER -- LATE SUMMER           56

     Carrie opens the door. Miranda stands there with Brady. She
     looks like she is about to burst into tears. Big stands in
     the hall behind Carrie. Unsure.

                         CARRIE
               Hi.

                         MIRANDA
               Surprise -- Here we are!

                                                     44.


                         CARRIE
                   (To Brady)
               Well, I'm so excited you are here
               for a sleepover.

                         MIRANDA
               We are too. Aren't we B-boy?

     Brady nods. Miranda gives Brady's hand to Carrie.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               Here. Mommy has to go to the
               bathroom.

     Miranda hurries away. Carrie looks after her, concerned.

                         CARRIE
               Brady, do you want to go have some
               peanut butter?

     He nods. Carrie give his hand to Big and hurries away. Big
     looks at Brady. Brady looks up at him.

                         BIG
               Peanut butter it is.

     They walk into the kitchen.


57   INT. BIG SUBLET/POWDER ROOM -- A LITTLE LATER                57

     Miranda is sitting on the toilet, seat down. Carrie at the
     sink.

                         MIRANDA
               Apparently you don't have sex for
               six months he runs out and has it
               with some girl at his bar.

                         CARRIE
               Steve. I can't believe it. Steve.

                         MIRANDA
               Steve. When I think of everything
               I've done for him. And this is how
               he repays me. Man, if I didn't have
               Brady, I would never go back there.

     Miranda looks furious. Carrie nods, in shock.

                                                     45.


58   INT. MIRANDA AND STEVE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- LATE SUMMER     58

     Steve is in bed. Miranda comes in, dressed for bed.

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  The next night, for the sake of
                  Brady, Miranda went against her
                  instincts and went home.

     He throws back the covers. She looks at him.

                            STEVE
                  Miranda, it's still me.

                            MIRANDA
                  Is it?

     She stands there and looks at him. Shakes her head, exits.


59   INT. MERCER HOTEL/LOBBY -- NIGHT -- LATE SUMMER              59

     Miranda walks into the chic hotel lobby holding Brady's hand.
     She pulls a piece of luggage behind her.

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  So Miranda left Brooklyn and came
                  home... to Manhattan.


60   INT. MERCER HOTEL LOBBY/RESTAURANT -- DAY -- LATE SUMMER     60

     Brady sits   on a couch in the lobby playing with his action
     figures. A   HOODED MOVIE ACTOR TYPE (25) sits slumped next him
     texting on   a phone. Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha
     are having   brunch at a table nearby.

                            MIRANDA
                  Yes, it's sad, but I'm not going to
                  make it any sadder by staying at a
                  bad hotel while I look for a place.
                  Pass the salt.

     Charlotte passes the salt.

                            MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                  Plus, I have to be downtown and
                  close to Brooklyn. We're going to
                  keep things as normal for Brady as
                  we can. I'll pick him up on my
                  days... take him over on Steve's.

                                                   46.


                         CARRIE
               I don't know if this question is
               allowed -- but how is Steve
               handling this?

                          MIRANDA
               Says he's devastated -- begs me to
               forgive him.
                   (beat)
               Not going to happen. I can barely
               even look at him.

                         CHARLOTTE
               Steve -- I can't believe it.

                         CARRIE
               That's what I said.

                         SAMANTHA
               Miranda, honey -- are you sure you
               want to do this? It's just one
               time. Anyone can have a slip.

                         MIRANDA
               Well, even if I could get my head
               around that justification -- it's
               the cheating part -- the behind my
               back part... the violation of the
               trust -- that's the thing that's
               killing me.

     Samantha nods, taking it in.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               Besides... women who stay with men
               who cheat are women who are afraid
               to be on their own. And that's not
               me -- I can handle it. Always
               could.

     Brady walks over holding an action figure.

                         BRADY
               Mommy, I want to go home.

     Miranda nods; keeping a brave face. Charlotte looks upset.


61   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- LATE SUMMER 61

     Charlotte and Harry are making love, gently. She looks into
     his eyes -- speaks softly.

                                                    46A.


                           CHARLOTTE
                 Thank-you for being you.

       He smiles, touched. She smiles -- he kisses her.

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 Charlotte made love to Harry five
                 times that week.


61aA   INT. SAMANTHA'S BEACH HOUSE -- NIGHT -- FALL             61aA

       Smith and Samantha are sitting at the dining table. ANAKA,
       (45) a Zen, low-key chef lays down plates in front of them.

                           SAMANTHA
                 It's a little quick to move out,
                 don't you think?

                           SMITH
                 Her reaction is her reaction.
                 Thanks Anaka.

       Anaka nods and walks away.

                           SAMANTHA
                 He had sex once. Not even an
                 affair.

                           SMITH
                 Maybe it's not the sex. Maybe,
                 it's the cheating. For me... that
                 would be the thing. That it
                 happened behind my back.

                           SAMANTHA
                 That's what she said.

       He nods. Samantha eats. Thinks.

                           SMITH
                 Look. I know we're not married but -
                 - if you were going to have sex
                 with someone else...

       Long pause. He looks at her.

                           SAMANTHA
                 Are you waiting for me to get out
                 my datebook?

                                                   46B.


                          SMITH
                    (beat; then)
                But... seriously, I'd rather know
                first.

      She gets up from the table and moves over to him.

                          SAMANTHA
                You want me to tell you if I'm
                going to have sex? Fine. I'm about
                to have sex.

      She sits on the table directly in front of him and opens her
      legs. Anaka enters -- sees her position, spins on his heels
      and walks back out.

                          SMITH
                    (as he goes)
                Thanks Anaka.


61A   INT. REST HOME -- DAY -- SUMMER                           61A

      Mary sits in a chair eating dinner from a tray. Miranda sits
      on the edge of the bed near her.

                          MIRANDA
                I don't know if Steve's mentioned
                anything to you yet -- about us.
                Has he?

      Mary shakes her head: No -- concerned. Miranda nods.

                          MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                Well -- we've had some marriage
                problems -- it's not necessary to
                go into the details but -- I just
                wanted you to know that we won't be
                coming to see you together anymore.
                I'll be here Monday, Wednesday and
                Sunday -- the other days will be
                Steve.

                          MARY
                Who's Steve?

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Miranda was starting to see the
                upside of Alzheimer's.

                                                  46C.


62   INT. BIG'S SUBLET/DEN -- NIGHT -- LATE SUMMER              62

     The room is crowded with Carrie's boxes waiting to be moved.
     Big is sitting at a computer reading his emails.

                                              47.


Close on screen: We see his email address is John@JJPny.com.
He clicks open a file as Carrie enters.

                    CARRIE
          Wedding crunch time. We need to
          really get serious here.

                     BIG
          Not now -- I just got an email from
          the the contractor -- they pushed
          our move-in date again -- and I
          have to --

                    CARRIE
          Nope. Wedding before contractor.
          Unless you're planning to invite
          him -- which would make the guest
          list two hundred and one.

                    BIG
          Two hundred? Jesus, Carrie -- it's
          gone up again?

                    CARRIE
          Blame the New York Post and Vogue.
          Two publications that have never
          before been uttered in the same
          sentence.

                    BIG
          You said: seventy-five people in a
          partitioned-off room.

                    CARRIE
          It's the dress. How can I explain
          this? It's like poker -- The dress
          upped the ante.

                    BIG
          Change the dress.

                    CARRIE
          No, no, no -- you haven't seen this
          dress. This dress may be the whole
          reason to get married. Well, you
          and the dress.

She sits in his lap. He adjusts, uncomfortable.

                    CARRIE(CONT'D)
          How are you coming with your vows?
          Just a reminder -- you are going to
          be saying these in front of a lot
          of people, so the pressure is on.

                                                   48.


                         BIG
                   (He's had it)
               Up, up. I have to finish this. Up.

     He sort of "helps her" out of his lap.

                         CARRIE
               Hey...

                         BIG
               I don't have time for this.

                         CARRIE
               This is our wedding and you're not
               taking it seriously.

                         BIG
               No, I'm not -- It's a circus! Two
               hundred people -- Page Six -- This
               is my third marriage -- how do you
               think it makes me look?

     Carrie looks at him, stunned by this new information.

                          CARRIE
               I didn't know that was even an
               issue.
                   (beat)
               Why didn't you say anything sooner?

                         BIG
               You wanted all this.

                         CARRIE
               But -- don't you want --

                         BIG
               I want you, Carrie. That's what I
               want. I would have just gone down
               to city hall.

     Tension. He starts out of the room, moving a wardrobe box out
     of his way as he goes. She stands there. Upset.


63   INT. BIG'S SUBLET/BATHROOM -- LATER                        63

     Big is brushing his teeth. There's a knock. The door opens.
     Carrie comes in, vulnerable.

                         CARRIE
               I think it's too late for city hall
               now.

                                                     49.


                          BIG
                Well, no. I wasn't suggesting -- I
                was just saying.

      He looks at her. She looks -- devastated.

                          BIG (CONT'D)
                See. That is the face I've been
                trying to avoid. Come here.

      She stands there. He goes to her, hugs her.

                          CARRIE
                You're a great man friend.

      She buries her head in his chest; relieved. He exhales.


64    INT. BUDDAKAN RESTAURANT -- NIGHT -- FALL                   64

      Miranda, Charlotte, Harry, Samantha, Smith, Stanford,
      Anthony, Bitsy and other GUESTS are gathered around a long
      beautifully-set table. Carrie and Big ARRIVE at the top of
      the stairs. Everyone looks up and applauds.


64A   INT. BUDDAKAN RESTAUANT -- LATER                           64A

      The desserts are being served. Samantha stands and prepares
      to speak. Harry hits a glass with a spoon... people quiet
      down.

                          SAMANTHA
                Now, I know it's tradition at the
                rehearsal dinner for the maid of
                honor to reveal embarrassing things
                about the bride. But in our group --

      She looks at Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                ... We never kiss and tell.

      Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte WHOOP. Laughter.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                So, I'd like to make a toast to the
                groom.

      From somewhere down the table, KARL (50) a Preppy Businessman
      CALLS OUT; joking.

                          KARL
                There's a word he's heard before!

                                                   50.


     The room LAUGHS. Big smiles; tight. Carrie leans in.

                         CARRIE
               Who is that again?

                         BIG
               Karl... a partner at the firm.

                         CARRIE
               Karl's kind of a jerk.

                         KARL
                   (Calling)
               You know what they say -- three
               times a charm!

                         SAMANTHA
                   (Calling to Karl)
               Hey "dick wad"... I'm speaking.

                            CARRIE
               Whooo!

                         SAMANTHA
               Now. There were times when we had
               our doubt about this gorgeous man.
               But after careful observation over
               the last hundred years, my doubts
               are over.
                   (Lifts glass high)
               So... here's to the groom. A man
               who finally got "Carrie-d" away.

     Big is touched. Then Karl feels the need to add:

                         KARL
               Here's hopin', John!

     Big smiles, he has no choice. He raises his glass.

                            CARRIE
                   (Soft)
               Jackass.


65   EXT. BUDDAKAN RESTAURANT -- LATER                           65

     Samantha is out front with Big, Harry and Smith. They are
     smoking cigars.

                         BIG
               Quite a toast, Samantha.

                                                   51.


                         SAMANTHA
               Well, you're quite a guy.

     They chuckle, then -- Samantha's smile fades.

                         SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
               Steve.

     The men turn as Steve approaches. He has a look of real pain
     and guilt and embarrassment on his face.

                         STEVE
               I don't want to bother you all --

                         BIG
               You're not bothering us.

                         STEVE
               But --- I need to talk to Miranda.
               Samantha, could you -- ask her to
               come out. I don't want to go in.
               It's a party and all.

     Samantha is trapped... trapped and touched.


66   INT. BUDDAKAN RESTAUANT -- MOMENTS LATER                    66

     Miranda comes out of the ladies room. Samantha spots her.

                         MIRANDA
               Hi. I haven't talked to you all
               night.

                         SAMANTHA
               Steve's here.

     The blood drains from Miranda's face. Samantha nods.


67   EXT. BUDDAKAN RESTAURANT -- MOMENTS LATER                   67

     Steve is standing with Smith, Big and Harry as Miranda comes
     out of the restaurant -- Samantha looks out from inside.

                         MIRANDA
               Could you give us --

     The guys go inside. Samantha gives Miranda a look and leads
     them away. Miranda turns. She glares at Steve.

                                                   52.


                         STEVE
               You didn't leave me any choice. You
               won't return my calls -- You only
               talk to me in front of the baby
               when you know I can't say anything.

                         MIRANDA
               What could you possibly have to say
               that could make it better?

                         STEVE
               Miranda, please... It was just that
               one time. Please -- I love you --

                         MIRANDA
               You broke us! You broke us. What we
               had is broken!

     Three YOUNG SINGLE GIRLS (25) walk past them into the club.
     They look back at the scene. Miranda looks down at the
     ground. Steve is paralyzed. Miranda turns to leave -- looks
     back at him with daggers and hurt.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               I changed who I was for you.

     Miranda goes inside. Steve is a stone.


68   INT. BUDDAKAN RESTAURANT -- LATER                           68

     Miranda makes her way through the crowded bar. She looks very
     rattled. Big spots her and follows, gently.

                         BIG
               Hey. Are you alright?

                         MIRANDA
               No, I'm not alright. You two are
               crazy to get married. Marriage
               ruins everything.

     Miranda walks away, upset. He stands there; shaken.


69   INT. BUDDAKAN RESTAURANT -- LATER                           69

     Big is at the bar having a scotch. Carrie hurries over to
     him. She leans in and puts her arm on his back.

                         CARRIE
               There you are. I thought you
               skipped out on me.

                                                     53.


     She smiles, kisses him. He smiles, sips his scotch.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               Well, the all-gal sleepover is
               about to commence. You gonna miss
               me?

                         BIG
               Don't go. Spend the night with me.

                         CARRIE
               Oh... One night won't kill you. And
               tomorrow you get to have me for the
               rest of your life.

     He sips his scotch. She looks at him, sees a glimmer of
     something. Something that scares her.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               Is everything okay?

     He looks over -- sees her face. Scared.

                         BIG
               I'm just tired -- I guess.

     Carrie reaches up and fixes Big's hair.

                          CARRIE
               Go home and sleep.
                   (beat)
               Now, give me a kiss good night.
               Make it good -- it's the last
               single girl kiss.

     He looks at her as if to say something, then kisses her.


70   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- LATER -- FALL          70

     Carrie sits on the bed surrounded by Charlotte, Samantha, and
     Miranda all wearing matching robes. Laying on the floor near
     the bed -- three open gift boxes and ribbons. Lily sits in
     Carrie's lap playing with Carrie's cell phone -- in her PJ's.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               There we sat... like a scene out of
               Louisa May Alcott's: "Not-so Little
               Women."

                         CHARLOTTE
               I always knew she would marry Big.

                                              54.


                    SAMANTHA/MIRANDA
          You did not!

                    CHARLOTTE
          Yes I did! After every break-up I
          secretly thought: Nope. They belong
          together.

                    SAMANTHA
          You thought that after the second
          break-up?

                    CHARLOTTE
          Yep.

                    MIRANDA
          After the fifteenth?

                    CARRIE
          Ha ha -- hilarious -- we broke up a
          lot.

                    SAMANTHA
          Yes, but... after the break-ups --
          comes the hot make-up sex.

Charlotte pokes Samantha; indicates Lily. Samantha rolls her
eyes. Carrie's cell phone RINGS. Lily wants to answer it.

                    CARRIE
          You want to answer? Go ahead,
          sweetie... Open it up...

Lily opens it and holds it up to her face, silent.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Say something.

                    LILY
          Sex.

They are all shocked; then: LAUGHTER, even Charlotte.

                    CARRIE
          Sweetie, that was your first bootie
          call.

                    SAMANTHA
          Are you sure she's not my child?

Carrie, still laughing, wipes a tear away as she takes the
phone from Lily and answers it.

                                                    55.


                          CARRIE
               Hello?


71   INT. BIG'S SUBLET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                     71

     Big is sitting at the desk, a piece of paper on it.

                          BIG
               It's me.

                         CARRIE
               Oh my God -- did you just hear
               Lily?

                         BIG
               Hey -- I need to talk.

     Carrie puts her hand to her ear, blocking the laughter.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               I'm sitting here trying to write
               these vows and...
                   (beat; then)
               Is this something we really want to
               do?

     Carrie gets out of bed; playing it "casual" to the girls.

                         CARRIE
               It's Big. I'm gonna take it in the--

     She points to the study. Charlotte calls to the phone.

                         CHARLOTTE
                   (calling; silly)
               Get some sleep, groomie!

     Carrie goes into the study and closes the door.


72   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/STUDY -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL      72

     Carrie leans against the door, her face now concerned.

                         CARRIE
               What's the matter?

                          BIG
               It's just -- everything is great as
               it is.
                   (beat)
               I don't want to screw it up.

                                              56.


                       CARRIE
          You won't.

                    BIG
          I screwed it up twice before.

Big is silent. Carrie is thinking, thinking, thinking.

                    CARRIE
          Here's the thing. This is me that
          you're marrying tomorrow. Me.
          Nobody else.

                       BIG
          Yeah.

                    CARRIE
          And I'm marrying you. It's me and
          you. And you want to know the good
          news there?

                       BIG
          Yeah.

                    CARRIE
          We've already both done everything
          we can to screw it up.

He smiles. She is very alert -- thinking, thinking.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Is that a smile I'm hearing?

                       BIG
          Yeah.

                     CARRIE
          Now, it sounds to me like you've
          got a bit of writer's block on the
          vow front.

                       BIG
          Yeah.

                    CARRIE
          And I find - you know - as a
          professional writer- it's best to
          just, you know, stop thinking about
          it so much -- and go to bed. And in
          the morning...

                    BIG
          You know what to do?

                                                    57.


                         CARRIE
               Exactly. And if not -- Just write
               this: "I will love you." Simple and
               to-the-point. And I swear I won't
               even try to take credit for it.

     Silence. Deep silence.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               You're going to bed now, right?

                         BIG
               Okay. Good night.

                         CARRIE
               I'll see you tomorrow. Hey. Me and
               you.

     He hangs up. She looks terrified.


73   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- LATER                 73

     Dark. Charlotte and Carrie are sharing the bed. Carrie is
     wide awake. Here eyes focused across the room on her gorgeous
     wedding gown: ready and waiting.


74   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/HALLWAY -- NEXT DAY -- FALL      74

     Miranda is standing in the hall putting on her earrings. The
     bedroom door opens -- Carrie stands there in the wedding
     gown. Carrie and Miranda catch eyes for a brief moment. There
     are no words.

     Lily steps around from behind Carrie. She is wearing a long
     white dress and holding a LITTLE PURSE. She looks adorable.

                         CARRIE
               There you are! Almost lost you
               under all that. Got your purse?

     Charlotte takes Lily's hand as Anthony comes out of the
     dining room and spots Carrie for the first time.

                         ANTHONY
               Now there's a bride! Flowers!


75   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/DINING ROOM -- LATER             75

     A flurry of activity -- attaching the veil on Carrie.
     Stanford stands near Carrie ready to assist if needed.

                                               57A.


Harry stands in the pantry doorway watching -- eating a
toasted bagel. Charlotte takes a bite -- carefully.

                                                    58.


                         CARRIE
               Whose got a mirror?

                         CHARLOTTE
               Behind you.

     Carrie turns to move to the mirror. She is JERKED BACK.

                         CARRIE
               Stanford, you're on my dress.

                         ANTHONY
               Get off the dress!

                         MIRANDA
               Is that a rip?

                         CARRIE/ANTHONY
               Where?!

     Carrie's CELL PHONE RINGS. Anthony reaches over and picks it
     up, distracted by the dress situation.

                         ANTHONY
                   (sharp; into phone)
               What?


76   INT. BIG'S SUBLET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                     76

     Intercut with Big... pacing. He doesn't look rested.

                         BIG
               Can you put Carrie on, please?

                         ANTHONY
               Not now... dress emergency.

     Anthony hangs up, tosses her phone onto the dining table.

                         ANTHONY (CONT'D)
               Damage? What's the damage?

                         SAMANTHA
               There's so much fabric I can't see.

                         ANTHONY
               Can't see anything behind this
               friggin' table. Go, go -- everyone
               out into the hall.

     As the girls start out -- Anthony addresses Stanford.

                                             58A.


                    ANTHONY (CONT'D)
          You're a queen -- you should know
          how to step around a gown.

                    STANFORD
          Don't call me a queen.

                    ANTHONY
          Go -- Out in the hall, your
          highness.

Everyone except for Lily moves out into the hall.

                                                     59.


     Carrie's cell RINGS AGAIN. Lily picks it up, opens it and
     holds it up to her face -- She says nothing.


77   INT. BIG'S SUBLET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                      77

     Big is standing there. He hears only Lily breathing.

                         BIG
               Hello?

     Lily closes the cell phone. Big reacts, puzzled. She opens
     her little purse, drops the phone in and walks out.


78   EXT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- FALL                  78

     Carries and company leave the building, JADED NEW YORKERS
     passing by react with awe at the beautiful sight.

     CHARLOTTE leads Lily over to HARRY who is waiting by the
     Sedan. He makes a fuss over how cute she looks.


79   EXT. BIG'S SUBLET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                      79

     Big's driver RAOUL (55) is waiting out front next to his car,
     smoking. Big leaves his building talking on his phone.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               It's Carrie... leave me a message.

                         BIG
               Why aren't you calling me back? I
               really need to talk to you. Call me
               back as soon as you get this.

     He closes phone. Raoul opens the back door.


80   INT. LIBRARY -- LATER -- FALL                                80

     WEDDING GUESTS arrive. Bitsy comes up to Stanford. A DRIVER
     follows her carrying a LARGE box from TIFFANY.

                         STANFORD
               Looks like someone had breakfast at
               Tiffany.

                         BITSY
               Sweetheart, look at the size...
               it's breakfast, lunch and dinner at
               Tiffany.
                         (MORE)

                                             59A.

                       BITSY (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          Gifts?

Stanford chuckles as he points. She points to the DRIVER and
they walk away. Anthony comes over to Stanford.

                    ANTHONY
          We have a problem.

                    STANFORD
          I know, but for Carrie's sake I've
          decided to ignore your attitude.

                    ANTHONY
          No, a real problem. They're not
          here.

                    STANFORD
          They're probably stuck in traffic.

                    ANTHONY
          Both of them?

                                                    60.


     Stanford gives a look of concern. Anthony nods.


81   EXT. LIBRARY -- LATER -- FALL                               81

     Big's car is parked in front of the library. Raoul is leaning
     against it looking at his watch.


82   INT. BIG'S CAR - CONTINUOUS -- FALL                         82

     Big is on the phone, smoking one of Raoul's cigarettes.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               This is Carrie, leave a message.

                         BIG
               I'm out front -- waiting. I can't
               go in without you.

     He takes a drag on the cigarette. Exhales.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               Baby, this whole bride and groom
               thing has really thrown me. I need
               to know that it's still us. Just
               like you said. Me and you.

     Raoul KNOCKS on the window. Big looks out. The girls are in
     the process of climbing out of the limo. Big closes the phone
     and looks. Carrie gets out of the limo, her back to him.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               Turn around baby, let me see you.

     Just as he's about to see her face -- Charlotte pulls the
     veil over it. Carrie is gone -- all Big can see is a bride.
     He sinks back into his seat and away from the window as the
     girls hurry up the library stairs.


83   INT. LIBRARY/WEDDING AREA -- MOMENTS LATER -- FALL          83

     Anthony and Stanford are waiting, as are Harry with Lily and
     Magda with Brady, who is wearing a little tux with shorts and
     knee socks holding a ring pillow.

     A FLURRY OF HIGH HEELS CLICKING on a marble floor is heard as
     Carrie and the girls arrive around a corner. Magda GASPS,
     overjoyed when she sees Carrie in her dress.

                         MIRANDA
               Traffic was the worst --

                                                     61.


     Miranda kneels to hug Brady. Samantha fluffs Carrie.

                         SAMANTHA
               Ready. We're ready.

     Samantha looks over. Anthony has a weird look on his face.

                         STANFORD
               He's not here yet.

                            SAMANTHA
               Who's not?

                            ANTHONY
               The groom.

     Carrie lifts up her veil with ONE arm and looks out from
     under it. She is on super high-alert.

                         CARRIE
               What's happening?

                         SAMANTHA
               Big's not here.

                         CHARLOTTE
               But we're twenty-five minutes late.

                         CARRIE
               Did anyone call him?
                   (beat; nothing)
               Give me a phone. Someone give me a
               phone.

     Samantha hands her the iPhone. Carrie looks at it.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
                   (tight/controlled)
               I don't know how to work this.

     Stanford hands her a phone. As she dials she catches a
     WORRIED LOOK on Charlotte's face. Carrie turns away and holds
     the phone to her ear, waits. Waits. Then --

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
                   (into phone)
               Are you okay?


84   INT. BIG'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                         84

     Big is sitting in the car as it MOVES down a side street.

                                           61A.


                  BIG
        I've been calling you for an hour.
        Why haven't you been answering your
        phone?

                                                    62.


                          CARRIE
                   (anxiety escaping)
               I don't know where my phone is!
                   (beat)
               What is going on? Where are you?

                         BIG
                   (beat; then)
               I was out front --but I just left.
               I can't do this.

                         CARRIE
                   (in pain)
               Oh my God --

     Carrie drops the phone from her ear -- She's heard the words.
     The words on some level she was expecting.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               He's not coming. Oh my God.

     The phone slips out of her hand and lands on the floor.
     Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha don't know what to do.

                         SAMANTHA
               What do you mean he's not coming?

                         CARRIE
               Get me out of here.
                   (beat; a plea)
               -- Get me out of here!

                         SAMANTHA
               Go, go. You take her. I'll stay
               here and deal with this --

     She gestures to the wedding area. Miranda and Charlotte take
     Carrie's arms and quickly start moving her away. Horror on
     all of their faces. Brady CALLS after them, his voice ECHOES
     off the marble.

                         BRADY
               Where you going, Mommy?!

     Samantha looks at Stanford and Anthony -- speechless.


85   EXT. LIBRARY -- MOMENTS LATER -- FALL                       85

     The LIMO DRIVER slams the limo door. Carrie is seen through
     the window, sitting in back -- stunned. Miranda and Charlotte
     are in the back next to her -- stunned.

                                                   63.


86   INT. BIG'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                         86

     Big sits, pale, staring off as the car drives away.

                         BIG
                   (sudden realization)
               What the fuck am I doing? What the
               fuck am I doing?
                   (to Raoul)
               Turn around and go back.

                         RAOUL
               It's a one way street. I have to go
               around the block.

                         BIG
               By the time we go around the block
               she'll be gone. No one's behind us -
               - Turn around!


87   EXT. 41ST STREET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                       87

     Big's car makes a QUICK three-point turn and starts back up
     the one-way street as Carrie's limo turns onto it.


88   INT. BIG'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                         88

     Raoul sees the limo -- coming.

                         RAOUL
               I think this is them.

                         BIG
               Pull over. Pull over.

     Big's car pulls over, as the limo approaches. Big powers down
     his window -- as the limo passes, he sees Carrie in the
     window --resting her head against the glass, listless.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               Carrie!

     Carrie looks up, and see's Big. He smiles an apologetically
     smile. Her limo keeps on moving. Big watches it go. Until...


89   EXT. 41ST STREET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                       89

     The limo SCREECHES to a halt. The back door flies open and
     Carrie almost leaps out. Big sees her, he looks relieved.

                                              64.


She hurries up the street to Big's car holding her bouquet.
Big gets out of his car just as Carrie reaches him.

                    BIG
          I freaked out for a minute -- but --
          I'm ready now --

Carrie HITS him with her bouquet. It's a violent direct hit
on his face. He recoils. She hits him again, hard... a
wounded sound escaping her throat.

                    BIG (CONT'D)
          Carrie!

She hits him again. He ducks back into the car for
protection. She hits the bouquet on the roof of the car --
the flowers start breaking apart and flying everywhere.

                    CARRIE
          I knew you would do this -- I knew
          it!

Miranda reaches Carrie and holds her back by her waist. Big
gets back out of the car and starts over to her.

                    BIG
          I'm sorry -- I just --

With all she has left, she throws the broken bouquet at him.

                    CARRIE
          You left! I am humiliated!

Carrie starts crying. Charlotte has arrived. Carrie turns and
falls into her arms. Miranda and Charlotte lead her away. Big
starts over to follow.

                    BIG
          Carrie, wait --

Charlotte whips her head around and stares him down.

                    CHARLOTTE
          No!

He stops in his tracks. A WAITRESS (20's) at the Brant Park
Cafe nearby "over-pours" water into a CUSTOMER'S glass --
riveted by the scene. Miranda and Charlotte move Carrie back
into the limo. A CAB comes down the street and HONKS at Big
standing in the road; dazed.

                                                  64A.


90   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/STUDY -- LATER -- FALL           90

     Carrie sits in a chair. She is holding a glass and has an
     Hermes blanket wrapped around her.

                                               65.


Miranda sits nearby holding a bottle of vodka. Samantha
paces, working on her iPHONE.

                    CARRIE
          I thought I would still be in
          extreme pain but I'm feeling
          nothing.

Carrie reaches over and holds out her glass.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          I'd like a little more nothing.

Miranda nods and pours some more vodka into it...

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I had gone from Little Women to
          Little Drunk Women.

Charlotte enters and looks over at Carrie, soulfully.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Yes, I'm still jilted.

                    SAMANTHA
          What the hell got into him? He was
          perfectly fine at the dinner.

Miranda sips her vodka -- should she say anything?

                    CARRIE
          I knew it when he called last
          night. I could tell.

                    SAMANTHA
          Why didn't you say anything?

She shrugs and sips.

                     CARRIE
          Didn't want to believe it. Didn't
          even want to say it out loud.
              (beat)
          And now I have nowhere to love --
              (beat; then)
          I meant live. I have nowhere to
          live.

                    CHARLOTTE
          You'll stay here.

                       CARRIE
          Forever.

                                             65A.


She sips. Charlotte looks at her, concerned.

                                              66.


                    CHARLOTTE
          Maybe you should eat something.

She shakes her head. Charlotte looks at the others.

                    CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
          Anyone hungry?

They shake their heads; no.

                    CARRIE
          Well, if you change your minds, I
          know where we can get one hundred
          beef, seventy-five fish and twenty-
          five vegetarian meals.

She sips. Charlotte rubs her back. She sips.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          And my clothes. All my clothes. I
          can never go over there again. How
          am I going to get my clothes?

                    SAMANTHA
          Oh, honey -- I can hire people to
          do all that. Anything you need.

                     CARRIE
          A hit man?
              (beat)
          I have nothing to wear but a
          wedding gown.

                    CHARLOTTE
          You have your honeymoon stuff here.

                    CARRIE
          There's the silver lining. A
          honeymoon to a romantic Mexican
          resort that's pre-paid on my credit
          card because I wanted to surprise
          the man who jilted me.

                    SAMANTHA
          I can get you out of that. Worse
          comes to worse -- I'll say there
          was a death or something.

                    CARRIE
          Wasn't there?

She sips, looking sad.

                                                   66A.


90A   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/LILY'S ROOM -- LATER           90A

      Charlotte leans down and tucks in the sleeping Lily. She
      picks up a "Chinese baby doll" and nestles it under Lily's
      arm, then turns and starts out.

                                                     67.


91   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS             91

     Miranda is standing in the hall as Charlotte enters from
     Lily's room.

                         MIRANDA
               I did something really bad -- I
               think.

     Charlotte looks at her.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               I said something to Big. At the
               rehearsal dinner.

                         CHARLOTTE
               What do you mean?

                         MIRANDA
               It was right after Steve showed up.
               I was upset... Big came up to me --
               and I said something like: You're
               crazy to get married.
                   (off her look)
               It just came out.

     Charlotte nods trying to understand.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               Do you think it was totally the
               reason?

                         CHARLOTTE
                   (cutting her a break)
               No, no, no. Big has been weird
               about marriage for years.

                         MIRANDA
               I keep thinking I should tell
               Carrie.

                         CHARLOTTE
               No, no. This is a really bad time
               to even mention it - no, no, no.
               Find another time. Later.

     Samantha comes down the hall. She is energized.

                         SAMANTHA
               Well, turns out, I couldn't get her
               out of the honeymoon -- but I got
               us in.

                                                   68.


                         MIRANDA
               What?

                         SAMANTHA
               I just booked us three seats on the
               flight. Mexico here we come.

     Charlotte and Miranda react; completely thrown.

                         MIRANDA
               I can't go to Mexico. I have a job.

     Samantha indicates Carrie -- sitting in the den staring off
     to nowhere, deeply sad -- Devastated.


92   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/ROAD -- SUNSET                           92

     A lush tropical road with a view of the sun setting on the
     ocean. A large open air GOLF CART comes around the bend
     holding the girls. Carrie's hair blows in the breeze, her
     sunglasses firmly in place.


93   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/HOUSE -- A LITTLE LATER                  93

     A gorgeous romantic private house surrounded by tropical
     splendor. The cart arrives in front. The DOORS are open and
     PAULO (38) the BUTLER stands there holding a tray with two
     beautiful tropical drinks. He is surprised when he sees the
     four women, but he covers, effortlessly.

                         PAULO
               Welcome to Mexico.

                         SAMANTHA
               Buenos dias.

     Carrie gets out of the cart and goes into the house --
     followed by Charlotte and Miranda. Samantha arrives and picks
     up a drink off the tray.

                         PAULO
               I'm sorry. I am confused. I am
               waiting for a Mr. And Mrs. Preston.

                         SAMANTHA
               Honey, you'll be waiting for a long
               time.

     She sips the drink, then looks at him, "familiar."

                                                   69.


                         SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
               We'll talk.


94   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MAIN ROOM -- CONTINUOUS          94

     Charlotte and Miranda stand looking at the gorgeous, romantic
     private Mexican bungalow. Samantha enters; looks.

                          SAMANTHA
               This... will kill her.
                   (beat)
               Where is she?

                         CHARLOTTE
               In the powder room.


95   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/POWDER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS        95

     Carrie stands looking in the mirror. She takes off her
     sunglasses. Her eyes are red, red, red. She splashes water on
     her face and looks at herself in the beautiful Mexican
     mirror.


96   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 96

     Paulo leads Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha into the
     romantic bedroom suite. On the bed -- rose petals are
     scattered in the shape of a large heart.

                            MIRANDA
               Oh My God!

     Miranda and Charlotte quickly grab the bed cover and jerk it
     up -- throwing all the rose petals off. Paulo watches.
     Miranda addresses him in a very intense WHISPER.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               No more honeymoon stuff. This is
               very important. Have I made myself
               clear?


97   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                    97

     Carrie exits the powder room, her sunglasses in her hand. She
     stands in the entry way; alone. She looks out at the main
     room; the beautiful view, the romance. Her eyes start to
     water. A PORTER enters with the bags. Carrie hides her face,
     acknowledging him with a nod.

                                                     70.


98    INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS       98

      Carrie enters and moves directly to the bed, past Charlotte
      where Miranda is sitting talking on her cell.

                          MIRANDA
                Magda -- I'll talk to you tomorrow

      Miranda hangs up as Carrie crawls onto the bed and lays down.
      The pink sunset light floods across her face.

                          SAMANTHA
                Well, it's a gorgeous sunset.

                          CARRIE
                Close the shutters.

      Paulo moves over to the window and starts closing the
      shutters. The sun is slowly shuttered out.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                All of them.

      Carrie closes her eyes. DARKNESS falls across her face.


99    INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- MORNING          99

      The room is dark except for the bright sunlight straining to
      get in between the cracks of the closed shutters. Carrie is
      asleep. Miranda sits on the bed. Carrie stirs, half waking...
      Miranda smiles.

                           MIRANDA
                Morning.

                          CARRIE
                Did I dream it?

      Miranda shakes her head, no. Carrie closes her eyes, falls
      back asleep.


100   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- DUSK           100

      Dark. Carrie is still asleep. Charlotte sits on the bed. She
      gently shakes Carrie. Carrie opens her eyes.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Carrie, it's dinner time. You slept
                the whole day.

                                                    71.


                             CARRIE
                So?

      Carrie closes her eyes. Charlotte exhales, concerned.


101   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- MORNING         101

      A "tingling of glass" sound wakes Carrie. She opens her eyes
      and looks. Samantha is just sitting on the bed with a
      breakfast tray.

                           SAMANTHA
                Honey, you have to eat a little
                breakfast.

                             CARRIE
                I'm tired.

                          SAMANTHA
                Eat something and you can go back
                to sleep.

      Samantha holds up a bowl of yogurt. Carrie adjusts on her
      pillows a little. Samantha feeds Carrie a spoonful of yogurt.
      Carrie looks at her. Samantha nods.


102   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/PATIO -- LATER                    102

      Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte are sitting having lunch.
      Charlotte opens a pre-packaged "snack pack" chocolate
      pudding. She peels the lid off, takes a spoon and starts
      eating.

                          SAMANTHA
                With all this gorgeous fresh food
                you're just going to eat that
                pudding crap the entire trip?

                          CHARLOTTE
                It's the only thing in the pantry
                that's totally safe.
                    (holding up lid)
                See. Made in Poughkeepsie. I don't
                want to chance it.

                          MIRANDA
                It's a five-star resort.

                          CHARLOTTE
                It's Mexico.

                                                    72.


      The bedroom door opens. Carrie walks out. The sun hits her
      eyes. She squints.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                Carrie!

                          CARRIE
                Is there coffee?


103   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/PATIO -- LATER                  103

      All four girls are laying in the sun in bathing suits reading
      magazines. Miranda re-adjusts her body, stretching out on her
      beach chair.

                          MIRANDA
                The sun feels nice.

      Samantha looks over at her and notices something.

                          SAMANTHA
                Jesus, honey. Wax much?

      Miranda looks up at Samantha. Samantha indicates her swimsuit
      crotch area...which is badly in need of a wax. Miranda grabs
      her towel and covers her crotch area.

                          MIRANDA
                -- What? I didn't know I was going
                to be in a swimsuit.

      Carrie and Charlotte look up from their magazines.

                          CHARLOTTE
                What are you talking about?

                          MIRANDA
                I forgot to get a wax.

                          SAMANTHA
                Since when -- 1998?

      Carrie looks away, resumes reading.

                          MIRANDA
                I've had other things on my mind.

                          SAMANTHA
                I could be on death row and not
                have that situation.

                                              73.


                    MIRANDA
          Well, when you're married, Samantha
          -- you have a different set of
          priorities.

                     SAMANTHA
          Honey don't blame marriage --
              (re: Charlotte)
          This one's married -- and she's not
          growing a national forest. How do
          you even cross your legs?
              (beat)
          Let me make you a spa appointment --
          Any thicker and you won't be able
          to find it.

Miranda gets up from the chair and looks at her, mad.

                    MIRANDA
          So what -- It's my fault?! I let
          the sex go out of our marriage! I
          deserve what I got. Thanks for
          understanding.

She walks away. Samantha calls after her.

                    SAMANTHA
          Honey, I'm sorry. That's not what --

                      MIRANDA
          I'm fine!

Miranda goes inside. Carries throws her magazine down.

                    CARRIE
          Let's go down to the hotel for
          dinner on the beach tonight.

                      CHARLOTTE
          Really?

                    CARRIE
          Yeah. I've got to do something to
          pull me out of my Mexicoma.

                    SAMANTHA
          Oh, honey... you made a little
          joke. Good for you.

Samantha nods. Charlotte smiles; encouraged.

                                                    74.


104   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/HOTEL RESTAURANT -- LATER             104

      A romantic open-air restaurant on the beach. A MARIACHI BAND
      is serenading HONEYMOON COUPLES. A MALE HOST leads the girls
      across the small dance floor to their table. As they walk
      Miranda notices a slow dancing TWENTY-SOMETHING HONEYMOON
      COUPLE kissing -- very much in love.

                          MIRANDA
                    (to Carrie)
                Don't look to your --

                            CARRIE
                Too late.

      They arrive at their table and the host places down MENUS.
      FELIX, (40) the waiter comes up to them.

                          MAITRE' D
                Buenos notches. My name is Felix,
                I`ll be your server.

                          SAMANTHA
                    (to Felix)
                Felix -- We'll start with quatro
                margaritas.

                          CHARLOTTE
                No, I'm not drinking. Just bottled
                water.

                          CARRIE
                    (to waiter)
                I'll drink hers.

                          FELIX
                May I have your room numbers?

                          CARRIE
                We're staying in one of the private
                houses. Number three.

      He looks down onto a list he is holding, then up to Carrie.

                          MAITRE' D
                Very good, Mrs. Preston.

      The waiter smiles and walks away.

                          CARRIE
                That was like taking a bullet.

                                                    74A.


       Miranda, Samantha, and Carrie look at the menu. Charlotte
       reaches into her purse and pulls out a little pudding and
       places it on the table. They all look at her.

                           MIRANDA
                 Charlotte had pudding in her Prada.

       Samantha laughs. Miranda smiles. Carrie looks.

                           CARRIE
                 Will I ever laugh again?
                     (beat; then)
                 I'm serious.

                           MIRANDA
                 Yes.

                           CARRIE
                 When?

                           MIRANDA
                 When something is really, really
                 funny.

       The Mariachi band strolls by playing.

                           CARRIE
                 Thank god for that Mariachi band or
                 I'd be able to hear my own
                 thoughts.

       Felix re-enters with the drinks.

                           SAMANTHA
                 Fabulous -- and keep them coming.


104A   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/HOTEL RESTAURANT -- LATER            104A

       Food is on the table -- but Carrie, Miranda and Samantha are
       mostly drinking. Charlotte is eating her pudding.

                            CARRIE
                 After everything I know... After
                 twenty years of everything we've
                 learned -- I threw it all away for
                 the thrill of putting his name on
                 the honeymoon suite.
                     (beat)
                 If I met me now -- I wouldn't know
                 me.

                                             74B.


                     SAMANTHA
          Well, as long as we're going down
          this road.

They look at her -- she sips her cocktail.

                    SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
          I can't believe my life revolves
          around a man. On what planet did I
          allow that to happen?

                    CHARLOTTE
          You love him.

                    SAMANTHA
          Does that mean saying his name
          fifty times more a day than I say
          my own? Does it mean worrying about
          him and his needs before me and
          mine? Is it all about the other
          person? Is that love?

                    MIRANDA
          No, that's marriage.

                    CARRIE
          So, you're saying marriage is a bad
          thing? Good to know right about
          now.

Samantha looks down at her gardenia ring.

                    SAMANTHA
          Even this ring. I wanted to buy
          this for myself. That meant
          something to me. To be able to do
          that. Then, he buys it for me.

                    CHARLOTTE
          Because he knew how much you loved
          it.

                    SAMANTHA
          Yes. But now, every time I look
          down at it... I see him. Not me.

                    CHARLOTTE
          You could look at it and see a man
          who loves you and wants you to be
          happy.

                    SAMANTHA
          No, you could look at it and see
          that. I'm Samantha.

                                                    74C.


       The Waiter walks over --

                           SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                 We'll take another round.

                            CHARLOTTE
                 Another?

                           SAMANTHA
                 Relax -- we're on vacation.

                            CARRIE
                 Technically -- we're on my
                 honeymoon.

                            MIRANDA
                 No-- I think we're on their
                 honeymoon.

       She points to the TWENTY-SOMETHING COUPLE at a nearby table--
       who have progressed to graphic French kissing.

                           MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                     (call to them)
                 It's all so hot -- three days in.


104B   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/HOTEL RESTAURANT -- LATER            104B

       The GIRLS are pretty much the only ones left in the
       restaurant. Empty drink glasses.

                           CARRIE
                 He couldn't get out of the car.
                 After everything he'd already put
                 me through -- he couldn't make the
                 effort and get out of the car? I
                 made the effort -- I put a bird on
                 my head.

                           MIRANDA
                 Was that what that was?

                            CARRIE
                 Yes.

                           MIRANDA
                 I thought it was just feathers.

                           CARRIE
                 No. It was a bird.

                           CHARLOTTE
                 It was beautiful.

                                             74D.


                    CARRIE
          He's a bad guy. Always was. Bad
          guys do bad things.

                    MIRANDA
          And good guys do bad things. The
          good guys screw you and the bad
          guys screw you.

                    SAMANTHA
          And the rest of them don't know how
          to screw you. Trust me-- I've done
          the leg work.

                    MIRANDA
          And that was all Steve had --
          didn't have money -- didn't have a
          career. He was the good guy
          bartender with a big dick.

The all look over at her and react.

                       SAMANTHA
          How big?

                    CHARLOTTE
          I don't want to know this.

                    SAMANTHA
          Eat your pudding.

                    MIRANDA
          Nine. Like -- nine and change.

                    CARRIE
          That's nice. Kinda balances off the
          one ball.

                    SAMANTHA
          You can't forgive a man with a dick
          over nine inches?
              (off Miranda's "no")
          Well, honey, if you can't -- some
          other woman will.

Felix comes up to the table.

                    FELIX
          Ladies -- the bar is closing.

                       CHARLOTTE
          Thank God.

                                                    74E.


                           CARRIE
                     (to Felix)
                 Mrs. Preston will take the check.

                           SAMANTHA
                 And a bottle of tequila.

       Charlotte's eyes widen. Felix nods.


104C   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/HOTEL RESTAURANT -- LATER            104C

       The STAFF are stacking chairs -- The Mariachi band plays.
       Carrie, Miranda and Samantha are on the beach wading into the
       water. Charlotte is just off the dance floor -- holding their
       shoes.

                           CHARLOTTE
                     (calling)
                 Don't go all the way in -- there
                 may be sharks!

                                                 75-76.


106   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/PATIO -- DAY                    106

      Carrie, Miranda and Samantha are laying in the shade. Miranda
      is working on her laptop. Carrie is cautiously studying her
      cell phone. She reads the message "window".

                          CARRIE
                "Mail box full."

                          SAMANTHA
                No time like the present.

                          CARRIE
                Not ready to face it all yet.

      Carrie puts down the phone. Charlotte walks out of the house
      wearing a workout outfit.

                                                      77.


                          CHARLOTTE
                I'm going for a run and then to the
                gym for pilates. Anyone want to --

      They all shake their heads: no. Charlotte trots away.

                          MIRANDA
                Good news. Just got an e mail from
                your buyer's attorney -- they have
                agreed to sell you back your old
                apartment at that escalated price.
                    (reading)
                And "are willing to vacate by the
                time you return -- pending an
                additional financial offer."

                          CARRIE
                Well, apparently you can go home
                again -- but it'll cost you.

                          SAMANTHA
                Now -- lets work on getting your
                things there.

      Samantha picks up her iPhone and starts working as Miranda
      types an e mail response. Carrie watches them; touched.

                          CARRIE
                You two could rule the world.


107   INT. RESORT/GYM CHANGING ROOM-- CONTINUOUS                  107

      Charlotte is showering after her workout.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                After her workout Charlotte
                couldn't help but think about how
                truly blessed she was. This week
                had made her feel more grateful
                than ever for her happy marriage.

      Charlotte closes her eyes, lets the water flow over her.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                And while picturing her loved ones
                at home in New York, she forgot
                where she was...

      Charlotte opens her mouth, shower water goes in.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                And opened her mouth.

                                                     78.


      Charlotte suddenly realizes what she's done. She spits the
      water out. A panicked look on her face.


108   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/PATH -- LATER                            108

      Charlotte walks along, looking refreshed. There's a GURGLING
      sound in her stomach. Her eyes WIDEN. She walks quickly.


109   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/PATH -- MOMENTS LATER                    109

      Charlotte is moving oddly. Walking on the balls of her feet.
      She passes a WORKER who is pruning the bushes.

                          WORKER
                Hello Miss.

      Charlotte shakes her head; not now. He looks at her.


110   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/PATIO -- MOMENTS LATER             110

      Carrie and Samantha sit reading. Charlotte hurries across the
      patio -- a CRAZED LOOK on her face.

                          CARRIE
                Sweetie -- what's --

      She shakes her head: NO and moves quickly to a door.   She
      tries the handle -- it's LOCKED. NO!

                          SAMANTHA
                That's locked -- Use the other--

      Charlotte starts - but stops, cold. She has the look of a
      trapped animal on her face. Then - BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM.
      Charlotte's eyes WIDEN. They watch -- stunned.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And just like that, Charlotte
                Pookeepsed in her pants.

      Miranda opens the door and stands there.    Takes in the scene.

                           MIRANDA
                Did you   --

                          CHARLOTTE
                Shut up, shut up, shut up.

                                                    79.


      Charlotte duck waddles across the patio to the open door.
      Carrie, Samantha and Miranda look at each other. Carrie
      BURSTS out laughing. She laughs till her eyes water.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Miranda was right -- when something
                was really, really funny -- I
                laughed.


111   EXT. MEXICAN CLIFFS -- LATER                                111

      Carrie sits overlooking a magnificent view of the ocean. She
      has her cell phone in her hand. She pushes a button and
      listens to the first message.

                          VOICEMAIL (V.O.)
                First message. Received: Saturday,
                September twentieth; twelve-thirty
                P.M.

                          BIG (V.O.)
                Hey babe -- I need to talk to you
                before you leave for the -- .

      Carrie impulsively THROWS her phone off the cliff. It sails
      through the air. The sun glistens off the pink crystals as it
      falls to the ocean below.


112   EXT. CARRIE'S BUILDING -- DAY -- FALL                       112

      Raining. A MANHATTAN STORAGE TRUCK drives away from the front
      of Carrie's building revealing... Carrie - standing in her
      front doorway. She exhales, turns and walks back inside.


113   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER                    113

      CARRIE swings open the front door -- her living room is
      filled with boxes of her clothes, a few of her furniture
      pieces -- many, beautifully wrapped wedding gifts -- and her
      wedding gown.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                There was no better time I could
                think of to hire and assistant.


114   INT. STARBUCKS -- DAY -- FALL                               114

      Carrie sits across from A SPOILED LABEL QUEEN (22) wearing
      expensive clothes.

                                                    80.


                          SPOILED LABEL QUEEN
                Ummm, no. I don't lift boxes. Yeah,
                definitely - No.


115   INT. STARBUCKS -- LATER -- FALL                             115

      A LARGE PARTY GIRL (34) Low cut blouse; very relaxed.

                           PARTY GIRL
                I love your books. You're shit's
                brilliant.

                          CARRIE
                Um, Cathy... You seem drunk.

                           PARTY GIRL
                Little bit. Never got to bed last
                night.
                    (beat)
                But I type like a motherfucker.


116   INT. STARBUCKS -- LATER -- FALL                             116

      A mousey BUSINESS GUY (23) in a tweed suit and tie.

                          BUSINESS GUY
                I have a degree in finance from
                Princeton and for the last two
                years I have been assistant to a
                V.P. at Merrill Lynch.

                          CARRIE
                    (polite/lost)
                And why do you think you're right
                for this job?

      He glances at his feet. Carrie looks down. He is wearing high
      heels.


117   INT. STARBUCKS -- LATER -- FALL                             117

      Louise (22) African-American -- she holds a LOUIS VUITTON
      DENIM PURSE.

                          CARRIE
                So, you're from St. Louis?

                          LOUISE
                That's right. Louise from St.
                Louis.

                                              81.


Carrie smiles, looks down at her resume.

                     CARRIE
          Have you ever been a personal
          assistant?

                    LOUISE
          No, but I'm the oldest of six kids,
          so I can pretty much handle
          anything you got.

                    CARRIE
          Six kids? What was that like?

                    LOUISE
          Crowded. I had to move to New York
          just to get some room. And where'd
          I wind up? A one bedroom apartment
          with three roommates.

                    CARRIE
              (laughs; then)
          Aside from the space issue... why'd
          you move to New York?

                    LOUISE
          To fall in love.

Carrie is taken aback.

                    LOUISE (CONT'D)
          What? That's corny, right?

                    CARRIE
          No, it's just -- so -- honest. I
          don't think I've ever heard anyone
          say that in a long time.

Louise looks at her, owns it. Carrie smiles, sold.

                     CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Well... Louise from St. Louis... I
          have just one more question.
              (beat)
          How does an unemployed girl with
          three roommates afford the
          Patchwork Denim Bowley Louis
          Vuitton bag?

                    LOUISE
          It's rented. "Bag, Borrow or
          Steal." It's like Netflix for
          purses.

                                                     82.


                          CARRIE
                No! How can I not know about this?

                          LOUISE
                Girl, stick with me, I'll hook you
                up.


118   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT-- DAY -- FALL                       118

      The room is now half-empty of the presents. Louise sits in
      the middle of the clutter -- busy writing out note cards.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And she did hook me up.


119   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- FALL                      119

      The space is much more orderly. Louise is kneeling on the
      floor taking books out of boxes and placing them on in piles
      on the floor. Carrie enters -- amazed at the progress. Her
      phone rings. Louise answers it instantly.

                          LOUISE
                Carrie Bradshaw... This is Louise.
                    (listens; then repeats)
                Anne From the New York Observer...

      She looks over at Carrie, who shakes her head: No.

                          LOUISE (CONT'D)
                I'll let her know you called.

      She hangs up and continues working. Carrie watches her.


120   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- FALL                      120

      Louise directs two DELIVERY MEN who are carrying a NEW
      MATTRESS into the bedroom. Carrie watches from her closet
      surrounded by boxes.

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                After only three days -- I began to
                think of her as Saint Louise from
                St. Louis.


121   INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- DAY                                121

      Miranda is sitting at her desk, eating a take-out salad while
      talking on the phone.

                                             82A.


                    MIRANDA
              (into phone)
          No, I can't be more patient. Your
          agency has had three weeks to find
          me an apartment.

The office door opens -- A TWENTY-SOMETHING ASSISTANT enters
and places some documents on the desk in front of her.
Miranda signs as she chews and talks.

                    MIRANDA (CONT'D)
          No -- I told you... It has to be in
          Manhattan. Because it does.
                    (MORE)

                                                     83.

                          MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                How hard could it be to find
                something just on the other side of
                the Brooklyn Bridge?

      The assistant takes the documents and starts away.

                          MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                    (into phone pissed)
                On second thought -- Forget it. I
                could do a better job myself.

      Miranda hangs up, exhales. Bites her salad. Determined.


122   EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE -- LATER                              122

      An ethically diverse neighborhood with ethnically diverse
      PEOPLE. Miranda walks with Brady. A WIDE EYED Magda walks
      next to her.

                          MIRANDA
                According to New York Magazine,
                this is the new up-and-coming
                neighborhood.

      A CAUCASIAN YUPPIE DAD (32) with a BABY in a snugly comes out
      of bodega. Miranda turns to Magda.

                          MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                See! Wherever he's going is where
                we need to be.

      Miranda, excited about the hunt --picks up the pace following
      after the dad. Magda hurries as best as she can.


123   EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE STREET -- LATER                       123

      Miranda, Brady and Magda walk around a corner.

                          MAGDA
                I've been here before -- This was
                all Ukrainian area.

      Miranda spots a U-HAUL truck parked in front of a building.

                          MIRANDA
                Coming or going?

                                                      84.


      TWO NYU-TYPE KIDS come out of a building carrying boxes.

                          MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                Going. Oh boy. Lets go.

      She starts down the street with a clip.


124   EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE -- LATER                               124

      Magda is standing out in front of the apartment building with
      Brady. She looks -- A HOT LOOKING LATIN GUY (29) with tattoos
      is sitting on the stoop with a pitbull.


125   INT. LOWER EAST SIDE APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER             125

      Miranda peeks into the empty apartment. Nice size, brick
      wall, big windows with a view of a colorful jungle gym on a
      play ground across the street. Her heart starts racing.


126   EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER             126

      Miranda comes out of the building out of breath as the NYU
      kids are going back in.

                           MIRANDA
                Hi. I'm interested in the
                apartment.

                          NYU KID
                Get in line.

                          MIRANDA
                I understand but -- who would I
                talk to about it?

                             NYU KID
                The super.

      He points to a SIGN in LOBBY. The name: Lovro Klujcik and a
      telephone number. Miranda writes it down.

                          MIRANDA
                Lovro... -- and I have no idea.
                    (attempting to pronounce)
                Ku...

                          MAGDA
                    (amazed)
                Kljuic. Lovro Klujcik. I know him.

                                                     85.


                            MIRANDA
                No way.

                          MAGDA
                We were couple -- long time ago.

                          MIRANDA
                    (can't believe her luck)
                No way -- You dated?

                          MAGDA
                Haven't seen him since his wife
                died.

                          MIRANDA
                He's single?

      Magda shrugs as if to say: So what? Miranda smiles.


127   INT. SPANISH HAIR SALON -- LATER -- FALL                   127

      Spanish music plays. Two female HAIRDRESSERS work on two
      Dominican WOMEN CUSTOMERS. Magda sits under a hair dryer --
      her top lip white with cream bleach. Miranda is next to her,
      dialing on her cell. Brady plays nearby with two Dominican
      KIDS (5,6).


128   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER -- FALL                   128

      Miranda stands at a gate and pushes the buzzer marked
      "Klujcik." A door under the stoop opens revealing LOVRO
      KLUJCIK, a Croatian man about Magda's age.

                          LOVRO
                No, no... I told you on phone...
                the apartment is --

      He looks past Miranda and sees Magda -- standing there with
      brown hair and wearing make-up. His face lights up when he
      sees her.

                            LOVRO (CONT'D)
                Magda?    Is this you?

      She smiles. Shy. He beams at her. He opens the gate, saying
      something to her in his native tongue. Magda smiles.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                As much as Miranda wanted to pat
                herself on the back for finding her
                new apartment in just one
                afternoon... in the end, she knew --

                                                   85A.


      Miranda watches, thrilled as they converse.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                It was a Lovro connection.


129   INT. BEACHOUSE/BEDROOM -- NIGHT                           129

      SAMANTHA and SMITH have just finished making love. They are
      face to face.

                          SAMANTHA
                That was really hot.

                          SMITH
                Hmmm. You were kind of distant.

                                              86.


                    SAMANTHA
          Distant? You're still in me.

He gently moves off her and reclines next to her.

                    SMITH
          You want to talk about it?

                    SAMANTHA
          When have I ever wanted to talk
          about it?

                    SMITH
          Okay. I'll talk about it. Your best
          friends get screwed over by their
          guys -- how can you not get
          distant?

                    SAMANTHA
          It's more than that -- lately, I
          haven't been feeling a connection
          to --

                      SMITH
          What? Me?

                    SAMANTHA
          No -- to -- it -- here. I have no
          real connection to our life here.

                    SMITH
          What life here? Seriously -- all I
          do is work -- and you run off to
          New York every chance you get.

                    SAMANTHA
          Not every chance I get. Only for
          the A-list things.
              (beat; then)
          And my managing you -- it's all too
          much. I'm starting to resent it.
          For the last two years it's been
          all about you.

                    SMITH
          Well, for the first three years it
          was all about you.

                    SAMANTHA
          I know. That was so much more fun.

                                                   86A.


                          SMITH
                Maybe we need to make an effort to
                reconnect -- spend more time
                together -- away from the business.
                Less me, less you -- More us.


130   INT. BEACHOUSE -- DAY -- FALL                             130

      Samantha is on the phone, looking out at the ocean.

                                                    87.


                          SAMANTHA
                So, I won't be coming to New York
                for a while. We're going to spend
                some time reconnecting on the
                weekends... do the "LA couple
                thing."


131   EXT. NYC STREETS -- CONTINUOUS   -- FALL                  131

                          CARRIE
                Yeah, hi, can you put on Samantha?

                          SAMANTHA
                Really. At first I was all: "You
                can't tell me what I can do" -- but
                then, I had to admit he had a
                point.

                          CARRIE
                You people and your relationships.

                          OPERATOR (V.O.)
                Please deposit another eighty-five
                cents.

                          SAMANTHA
                Honey, a pay phone? Where's your
                cell?

                          CARRIE
                At the bottom of the ocean in
                Mexico.

                          SAMANTHA
                Want me to hook you up with a new
                one?

                          CARRIE
                No, not yet. No phone -- no calls,
                no calls-- no questions, no
                questions-- no explaining no
                wedding.

      Carrie puts coins into phone. She is wearing gloves.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                Plus, It's an excuse to break out
                the gloves.

                                                    88.

      Samantha and Smith run into the surf in their wetsuits with
      surfboards.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                When Samantha Jones decides to do
                something...

                ... She does it all the way.

      A BEACHCOMBER with a metal detector, watches nearby.

      Carrie sips a latté while sorting through a stack of papers.
      Louise is working on Carrie's computer.

                          LOUISE
                Carrie Bradshaw's web page is a
                mess.

                          CARRIE
                -- Interesting -- so is Carrie
                Bradshaw.

      Louise laughs. Carrie sips her latte.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                Come on -- When are we going to get
                to the really important things like
                unpacking my closet?

                          LOUISE
                One thing at a time. Are you ever
                going to answer these emails?

                            CARRIE
                Yes.

                            LOUISE
                When?

                            CARRIE
                Now?

                          LOUISE
                Okay -- I'll read -- you tell me
                what to do.(beat) Vitaminsforless.
                Delete. Right?

                            CARRIE
                So right.

      Louise deletes it -- Looks at next e mail.

                          LOUISE
                Who's John@jjpny.com.?

      Carries freezes -- Louise looks up.

                          LOUISE (CONT'D)
                Oh, shit -- that's him, right?

      Carrie turns the lap-top around to face her and looks.

                                                    90.


      JOHN@JJPNY.COM: "I'M SORRY."

      She clicks the email open; breathless. One sentence:

      "I don't know what to say."

      She swings the laptop back around to Louise.

                          CARRIE
                Delete.

      Louise looks at her, unsure... then deletes.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                And -- isn't there some cyberspace
                place that you can send those so
                that I never have to see an email
                from him ever again?
                    (off her nod)
                Do that please.

                          LOUISE
                You sure you want to end all
                communication with him?

      Carrie nods. Louise nods.


138   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/LILY'S ROOM -- DAY -- FALL       138

      Carrie is reading Cinderella to Lily who sits in her lap.
      They are on Lily's bed - surrounded by her dolls.

                          CARRIE
                    (reading)
                "And Cinderella and Prince Charming
                lived happily ever after."
                    (beat; looks at her)
                This is a fairy tall sweetheart.
                Things don't always happen like
                this in real life -- you should
                know that now.

                          LILY
                Again!

      Carrie flips back to the front. Lily is all smiles.

                          CARRIE
                And another one bites the dust.

      Charlotte walks into the den with her coat on. She smiles.

                                                    91.


                          LILY
                Mommie home!


139   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/HALL -- A LITTLE LATER         139

      Charlotte walks Carrie to the front door.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Thanks for watching her while I
                went to the doctor.

                          CARRIE
                    (pulling on coat)
                Sure. Everything okay?

                          CHARLOTTE
                I'm pregnant.

      Carrie looks at her. Charlotte smiles.

                           CARRIE
                How?

                          CHARLOTTE
                My doctor said sometimes when women
                stop trying -- it can happen. She
                knows other couples that adopt and
                then get pregnant.

                           CARRIE
                Sweetie.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Carrie -- I'm pregnant!

      Happy, happy tears. Carrie hugs her.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                I guess, in certain houses, fairy
                tales do come true.


140   INT. DUANE READE DRUG STORE -- DAY -- FALL                140

      Halloween costume aisle. Carrie and Miranda browse.

                          CARRIE
                I can't believe you're even
                dressing up.

                                               92.


                    MIRANDA
          All the parents at Brady's school
          dress up -- it's fun! Fun thought
          up by a group of non-working
          mothers with nothing else to do all
          day.

Miranda stops, looks at the costumes hanging there.

                    MIRANDA (CONT'D)
          Witch and -- "sexy kitten". That's
          it? The only two choices for women.
          Witch and Sexy kitten.

                    CARRIE
          You said a mouthful there, sister.

Miranda holds up a mask of a ghoul screaming in horror.

                    MIRANDA
          Maybe I should just wear this and a
          business suit and go as myself.

                    CARRIE
              (re; mask)
          Speaking of monsters -- I got an
          email from Big.

Miranda looks over at her.

                     CARRIE (CONT'D)
          "I don't know what to say."
              (beat)
          Ah... then don't send an email.

                    MIRANDA
          What were you expecting?

No idea. Miranda grabs a witch hat. They start walking away.
They round a corner, CHILD wearing a mask pops up.

                    CHILD
          Boo!

Carrie smiles. The child walks away.

                    CARRIE
          Gonna take a little more than that
          to scare me after what I have been
          through.

They start walking toward the check-out counter.

                                                      93.


                           CARRIE (CONT'D)
                And in the subject box: two words:
                I'm sorry.

                          MIRANDA
                Steve is all about "I'm sorry." I'm
                sorry emails -- I'm sorry voice
                mails -- I'm sorry flowers -- I'm
                sorry cards. How about: don't do
                anything to be: " I'm sorry" for.

                          CARRIE
                Maybe he's sorry.

                          MIRANDA
                Maybe Big is too.

                           CARRIE
                Point taken.
                    (beat)
                I still can't believe this happened
                to me. I know it happened, but I
                can't believe it happened. I lay
                awake at night going over every
                detail of the last week in my head.

                          MIRANDA
                Carrie -- There's a detail I've
                been meaning to tell you about --

      Carrie spots something; GRABS Miranda's arm with horror.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And then I saw it...the only thing
                scary enough to scare me after the
                experience I'd been through.

      On the rack in the front register -- Vogue!


141   INT. DUANE READE DRUG STORE -- MOMENTS LATER -- FALL        141

      Carrie and Miranda stand looking at an open Vogue:

      "The Last Single Girl: Carrie Bradshaw Gets Married."

                          MIRANDA
                You look great, you look amazing.
                So. That's the worst of it.

      Carrie flips a page. She noticed something.

                                                    94.


                          CARRIE
                Wait -- what's that say? In the box
                at the end?

                          MIRANDA
                    (reading)
                "Editor's note: The wedding of
                Carrie Bradshaw and John James
                Preston was cancelled as this issue
                went to press. Carrie Bradshaw
                is...

      Miranda stops reading.   Carrie looks at her.

                           CARRIE
                Is what?

      Miranda doesn't want to respond. Carrie pushes the magazine
      further away so she can read it.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                    (reads)
                "Carrie Bradshaw is still single
                and living in Manhattan."


142   EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS -- LATER -- FALL                   142

      A wind kicks up, autumn leaves blow. Carrie walks down the
      street, the Vogue under her arm, angry.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                I didn't want to buy it - but I
                figured it was one less Vogue in
                New York.


143   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- FALL                  143

      Carrie's door opens. Charlotte stands in the hall with Lily.

                          CHARLOTTE
                I saw it. The pictures are
                gorgeous.

                          CARRIE
                Yes -- I'm a beautiful bride. Come
                in.

      They walk in, Carrie closes the door.

                                             94A.


                    CHARLOTTE
          Look, the people who don't know --
          will only see the beautiful
          pictures. The people who do know
          will only see what an asshole he
          is.
              (beat; to Lily)
          Mommy said a bad word.

                     CARRIE
              (looks down to Lily)
          Hi, honey.

Lily holds up a little baby pumpkin to Carrie.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          For me?

Lily nods. Carrie has to lighten up. She kneels to Lily.

                                                     95.


                           CARRIE (CONT'D)
                And what are you going to be for
                Halloween?

                          LILY
                Cinderella.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Or -- we also brought Mulan.

      Lily shakes her head: NO. Carrie smiles.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                Would you like to go trick or
                treating with us?

                             LILY
                Yea!

                          CHARLOTTE
                Just in our building -- if you feel
                up to it.

                             LILY
                Yea!

                             CARRIE
                       (How can I not?)
                Yea!


144   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/HALL -- NIGHT -- FALL           144

      Carrie knocks on Charlotte's front door. It opens. Charlotte
      stands there -- dressed as a cute cow. With udders on her
      belly. Harry is Uncle Fester. Lily is Cinderella in a MASK.

                          HARRY
                No costume?

                          CARRIE
                Look closer. I'm the scariest thing
                in New York. Jilted at Forty-one.
                Boo.

      Harry Laughs. So does Charlotte...even Carrie smiles.


145   INT. CHARLOTTE'S BUILDING/HALL -- LATER -- FALL            145

      They walk down the hall. Carrie is holding Lily's hand.

                                                    96.


                          CARRIE
                You know you have to give me some
                of your loot, right?

      Lily nods Carrie smiles. Harry knocks on a door. It opens. A
      PARK AVE WOMAN (40), stylish - stands there with treats.

                          CHARLOTTE/HARRY/LILY
                Trick or treat!

      The woman smiles -- then suddenly, her smile fades.

                          WOMAN
                Oh, Carrie, I saw Vogue -- I'm so
                sorry.

      Carrie reacts, mortified.


146   INT. CHARLOTTE'S BUILDING/HALL -- LATER -- FALL             146

      Another door opens. A PREPPY WOMAN (36) is there.

                          CHARLOTTE/HARRY/LILY
                Trick or treat!

      REVEAL: Carrie's face -- hidden behind the Cinderella mask.


147   INT. HAIR SALON -- DAY -- FALL                              147

      A STYLIST is blowing out a woman with dark chestnut brown
      hair. Reveal the woman's face: It's Carrie --


148   INT. STARBUCKS -- LATER THAT DAY -- FALL                    148

      Raining outside. Louise walks in, looks around.

                          CARRIE
                Louise!

      Double-take. Carrie is waving to her from a table.

                          LOUISE
                Oh my Lord. I did not even
                recognize you.

                          CARRIE
                That's the point. My head is the
                witness protection program.

                                                    97.


                          LOUISE
                I'm really feeling that look on
                you.

      Louise reaches into her purse to get something --

                          CARRIE
                And I am feeling that Balenciaga on
                you.

                          LOUISE
                Mine till Tuesday.

      Louise pulls out a cell phone and holds it out to her.

                          LOUISE (CONT'D)
                Here -- time to re-join the world.

                           CARRIE
                Already?

      Louise nods. Carrie takes the phone.

                          LOUISE
                Your new number... area code: 347 --

                          CARRIE
                Hold, Hold, Hold. 347? No, no. I'm
                a 917 gal. Always have been.

                          LOUISE
                No longer available. Now, you're
                347.

                          CARRIE
                Great. Now even I don't recognize
                me.


149   EXT. BEACHOUSE/DECK -- DAY -- FALL                        149

      Samantha sits on her deck. Her phone rings.

                          SAMANTHA
                Samantha Jones.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Carrie Bradshaw --


150   EXT. NYC STREET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                     150

      Intercut with Carrie walking along.

                                                    98.


                          CARRIE
                -- Or I used to be.

                          SAMANTHA
                Talk to me.

                          CARRIE
                I'm a 347 area code. How tacky is
                that?

                          SAMANTHA
                347 is the new New York.

                          CARRIE
                I want the old New York with the
                old 917 and my old will to live.

                          SAMANTHA
                Old New York, new New York -- honey
                -- at least it's New York.

      She looks -- Dante is coming out of the surf in his wetsuit.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                Another hard thing about being in
                L.A? My "sex on a stick" next door
                neighbor. I can't stop looking at
                him.

                           CARRIE
                Looking?

                          SAMANTHA
                Just looking. After I saw Steve's
                face at the rehearsal dinner, I
                could never ---

      Dante notices her on the deck. He gives her a sexy smile.
      She doesn't acknowledge it -- turns away and walks inside.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                But you should see this guy. Every
                night sex with a different partner.
                He's like --
                    (searching then realizing)
                --Me. Five years ago.

                           CARRIE
                Yes.   When I was a 212.


151   EXT. RODEO DRIVE -- DAY -- FALL                           151

      Samantha strolls along Rodeo Drive.

                                             98A.


                    CARRIE (V.O.)
          And in an effort to stay out of her
          house and out of trouble --
          Samantha went shopping.

She notices a sidewalk "dog rescue station." Cute puppies
frolic and play in a wire pen.

                                                       99.


      In the back of the pen sits a tattered tiny DOG.   Alone.
      Samantha can't help but look at it.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                It certainly wasn't the cutest dog
                in the pen - but their was
                something about it --

      The dog looks up at her -- Dark marks under its eyes. The
      Rescue Woman (40) notices Samantha looking.

                          RESCUE WOMAN
                She needs a good a home.
                Interested?

      Samantha shakes her head; "no."

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And just as Samantha convinced
                herself that the dog wasn't for
                her.

      The dog starts humping a stuffed animal.

                          RESCUE WOMAN
                She's been fixed, but she hasn't
                lost the urge.


152   INT. DOG GROOMER'S -- LATER -- FALL                          152

      Samantha holds the dog while talking to two GROOMERS.

                          SAMANTHA
                And she needs a little eye work.
                Anything you can do about these
                stains?

      The dog looks up at her. She looks down at it.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    (to dog)
                Honey, I don't mince words.


153   EXT. RODEO DRIVE -- LATER -- FALL                            153

      Samantha and the dog walk out of Gucci in matching outfits...
      looking fabulous. Three GUCCI SALESMEN follow them holding
      large Gucci bags. They walk to her sleek Mercedes SUV --
      parked at the curb.

                                             99A.


JUMP CUT TO: The back of the Mercedes SUV filled with
shopping bags: Gucci, Prada, Dior -- the SUV hatch is closed,
revealing Samantha's licence plate: I HEART NY. Samantha
pulls away, the dog in her lap -- fur blowing.

                                                    100.


154   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT                           154

      Carrie and Louise are in the closet unloading clothes from
      the boxes. Carrie opens a wardrobe box -- It's the WEDDING
      GOWN. They both look at it - not knowing what to do.

                          LOUISE
                Do you want me to get rid of it?

                          CARRIE
                No, it's too beautiful. I'll just
                bury it deep in the back -- like I
                did my feelings.

      Carries closes the box back up. Louise watches; then.

                          LOUISE
                Do you miss him?

                          CARRIE
                    (beat; then)
                Every day. You know, it's weird --
                I haven't cried very much at all.
                Maybe you're only allotted a
                certain amount of tears per man --
                and I used mine up.

      Carrie gently pushes the box away. Opens another.

                          LOUISE
                Yeah. I know how you feel `cause,
                my college boyfriend broke up with
                me last year. And I miss him all
                the time.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Suddenly, it dawned on me -- there
                were two broken hearts in my-walk
                in.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                Louise -- we need a cocktail. Grab
                your rental.

      Carrie starts out. Louise grabs her purse and follows.


155   INT. THE CARLYLE HOTEL/BAR -- A LITTLE LATER -- FALL       155

      Carrie and Louise are having cocktails.

                                              101.


                    LOUISE
          And it threw me so hard `cause, you
          know, I thought Will -- that's his
          name... was the love of my life.

                    CARRIE
          What happened?

                    LOUISE
          He said he loved me and all -- but
          didn't think I was "the one".

Carrie looks at her, nods.

                    LOUISE (CONT'D)
          And that hurt. But -- you know --
          whatever. I'm not going to give up
          on love.

                      CARRIE
          Good.

                    LOUISE
          Love is the thing, you know.

She holds up her key chain. The word "Love" in gold.

                    LOUISE (CONT'D)
          See that. I'm bringing it to me all
          day long.

Louise gets a "text".  She reaches over and looks.     She
smiles as she reads it. Carrie raises her eyebrow.

                    CARRIE
          Oh, I remember that smile.   Who's
          the guy?

                    LOUISE
          Someone I just met. He wants me to
          meet him for a drink.

                      CARRIE
          At 11:30?     That's a bootie call.

                    LOUISE
          No, it's not like that... he just
          got off work -- he's a waiter.

                    CARRIE
          Louise, I may not get texts and I
          may not send texts -- but trust me:
          The sub-text of that text: Bootie.

                                                   101A.


       Louise nods, then starts texting him.

                           LOUISE
                 But it's not a bootie call if he
                 meets me.... right?

                           CARRIE
                 All right, then. You kids enjoy.
                 That's what your twenties are for.
                 Your thirties are to learn the
                 lessons.

       Carrie stands up, throws some money on the bar.

                           CARRIE (CONT'D)
                 And your forties are to pay for
                 drinks.


156    INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- FALL                 156

       Charlotte sits on the couch, reading a magazine. The three
       dogs near her. Harry enters.

                           HARRY
                 You going for your run?

                             CHARLOTTE
                 Um... no.

                           HARRY
                 You didn't go yesterday either.

                             CHARLOTTE
                 I know.

                                                   102.


                          HARRY
                Why is that?

                          CHARLOTTE
                    (snapping)
                I don't feel like running!

                          HARRY
                    (as he goes)
                Okay. Welcome to the house of
                hormones.


157   INT. UPSCALE FURNITURE STORE -- DAY -- FALL               157

      Carrie and Charlotte walk looking at furniture.

                           CARRIE
                It's all about the desk. If I find
                the desk, the writing will come.
                And it better `cause I'm using my
                new book advance to pay the fancy
                decorator.

                          CHARLOTTE
                I think it's so great that you are
                re-doing your entire apartment.

                          CARRIE
                Out with the old --
                    (looks at price tag)
                -- In with the overpriced.

      Charlotte smiles. Carrie links arms with her.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                Hey, Harry called me and mentioned
                you're not running.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Why'd he do that?

                           CARRIE
                `Cause he loves you... and he's
                concerned.

                          CHARLOTTE
                There is nothing to be concerned
                about.

                          CARRIE
                Did the doctor say it wasn't safe
                or something?

                                             103.


                    CHARLOTTE
          No, she said because I'm already a
          runner -- it's fine.

                    CARRIE
          So, why are you not --

                    CHARLOTTE
          I'm afraid something bad will
          happen. It's a miracle that I'm
          even pregnant.

                    CARRIE
          But if the doctor said --

                    CHARLOTTE
          It's not rational, Carrie... it's
          irrational. I know that.

                      CARRIE
          Okay.

                     CHARLOTTE
          I've got everything I ever wanted.
          I'm so happy -- I'm terrified.
              (beat)
          No one gets everything they want.
          Look at you. Look at Miranda.
          You're such good people and look
          what happened to you. Of course,
          something bad is going to happen to
          me.

                    CARRIE
          Sweetie, you shit your pants this
          year. Maybe you're done.

Charlotte laughs a little. Carrie moves her along.

                      CARRIE (CONT'D)
          You run   every day -- that's what
          you do.   You can't stop being who
          you are   -- just because you're
          afraid.   Right?

Charlotte nods, they walk on, linked together.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Now let's get down to business.
          I've got to have my apartment done
          in time for that baby shower.

                                                    104.


158    EXT. CENTRAL PARK/RESERVOIR -- DAY -- FALL                158

       AUTUMN LEAVES fall as Charlotte walks onto the running track
       with the three dogs on leashes. She starts to run --
       tentative -- slowly. They trot along with her.


158A   EXT. CENTRAL PARK/RESERVOIR -- DAY -- LATE FALL          158A

       Charlotte runs faster - more confident. The dogs run along
       with her -- they are wearing Burberry pet sweaters.

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 And as the last of the autumn
                 leaves fell away -- so did
                 Charlotte's fear.


158B   EXT. CENTRAL PARK/RESERVOIR -- DAY -- WINTER             158B

       SNOWFLAKES float down. Charlotte, dressed for winter runs in
       form -- alone. A smile on her face.


159    INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- WINTER                  159

       Carrie sits at her card table "temp" desk. Louise is sorting
       through a stack of mail.

                           LOUISE
                 You sure you don't want me to RSVP
                 to some of these holiday parties?

                            CARRIE
                 Yep. I'm perfectly happy spending
                 time home alone.
                     (beat)
                 And speaking of home -- you're
                 going to miss your plane.

       Louise takes a gift wrapped present out of her purse

                           LOUISE
                 Merry Christmas. It's just
                 something silly.

       Carrie opens it. A DVD of "MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS."

                           CARRIE
                 Oh... Louise from St. Louis.

                           LOUISE
                 You said you never saw it -- so.

                                           104A.


                   CARRIE
         Now, I feel bad. If I had known we
         were going to exchange gifts --

                                                      105.


        Carrie gets up and RUNS to her closet.

                            CARRIE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                  I would have bought you one two
                  weeks ago and hidden it in here.

        She comes back out with a large circular BOX tied with satin
        ribbons. It says: Louis Vuitton.

                            LOUISE
                  No! That is not what I think it is.

                             CARRIE
                  Open it.

                            LOUISE
                  Oh my Lord. Oh my --

        She opens it and SCREAMS as she pulls out a gorgeous purse.

                            CARRIE
                  No more rent girl for you.

        Louise throws it over her shoulder and walks "runway."

                            LOUISE
                  Look who's home from the big city!

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  It was the best money I'd ever
                  spent.


159A    INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT -- WINTER                159A

        Carrie comes out of her kitchen, holding a Cup O'Soup. She is
        wearing pajamas and socks.

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  New Year's Eve... and a Cup O'Soup.

        She plops in a chair in front of the TV. She picks up the
        "Meet Me in St. Louis" DVD and looks at it.


159AA   INT. MIRANDA'S APARTMENTS -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER        159AA

        Steve is standing in the open doorway -- with his coat and
        hat on. Miranda is kneeling -- putting a winter coat on
        Brady. A Christmas tree glows behind them.

                            MIRANDA
                  And what are you gonna say at
                  midnight?

                                            105A.


                    BRADY
          Happy New Year.

                    MIRANDA
          That's right -- but you gotta say
          it more excited than that --
              (then; excited)
          "Happy New Year!"

                    BRADY
          Happy New Year!

                    MIRANDA
          You say that and then... you kiss.

She gives him a big kiss. He laughs. She stands.

                    STEVE
          You all ready to go, B-boy?

                    MIRANDA
          Did you pack the new Batman Santa
          brought you?

Brady shakes his head: NO.

                    STEVE
          Aw man -- Gotta have the new
          Batman.

                    MIRANDA
          It's there near the tree.

Brady leaves to get it. Steve looks over at Miranda.

                    STEVE
          You got plans with the girls?

                    MIRANDA
          We're all kinda staying in tonight.

                    STEVE
          Would you like to come and eat with
          us? We can go somewhere over here
          on your side.

                    MIRANDA
          No, thank you.


                    STEVE
          Miranda -- I never meant to hurt
          you.

                                                      105B.


        She looks away. Brady comes up back to them with Batman.

                            MIRANDA
                  There he is. Batman.

                            STEVE
                  Put your hat on. It's snowing out.

        Brady nods and takes Steve's hand.   Steve looks over at
        Miranda.

                            STEVE (CONT'D)
                  Happy New Year.

                            MIRANDA
                  Happy New Year.

                            BRADY
                  Kiss.

        Silence... then, Miranda bends down and gives Brady a big
        sloppy kiss.

                            MIRANDA
                  See you tomorrow.

        She stands up and closes the door. As it closes, Steve looks
        at her. Finally; it is closed -- she leans against it.


159AB   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER            159AB

        Carrie sips soup watching a "deliriously in love" Judy
        Garland sing "The Trolley Song."

                            JUDY GARLAND
                  ZING ZING ZING WENT MY HEARTSTRINGS
                  THE MOMENT I MET HIM -- I FELL

        Carrie, not in the mood, picks up the remote -- clicks. The
        TV goes off. She looks around: Now what?


159AC   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- WINTER                 159AC

        Carrie sits at her makeshift desk as snow falls outside her
        window. She looks down at the computer; motionless. CLOSE ON
        SCREEN: The only thing written on it is the word: "Love."
        After a beat Carrie types three dots. She thinks, then
        deletes two of the dots. Her phone rings. She answers it.

                            CARRIE
                  Hello?

                                                     105C.


159B   INT. BUDDAKAN/RED ROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER             159B

       Stanford sits in a festive booth with festive FRIENDS.

                           STANFORD
                 Happy New Year -- We're having a
                 fabulous time. The only thing
                 missing is you. Come.

                           CARRIE
                 That's sweet but I can't, I'm
                 writing.

                           STANFORD
                 Oh... Okay.
                     (beat;then)
                 You're not really writing are you?

                           CARRIE
                 No. You're not really having a
                 fabulous time are you?

                           STANFORD
                 No. Rescue me. It's very forced
                 festive.

                           CARRIE
                 Oh yes, that's just what every New
                 Year's Eve party needs: a visit
                 from the lost Bronte sister.

                           STANFORD
                 Well... Better a Bronte sister than
                 a Hilton sister.

                           CARRIE
                     (laughs; then)
                 Thanks but -- by ten PM I'll be in
                 bed asleep and blissfully unaware
                 of how fabulous this night is
                 supposed to be.


159C   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- WINTER                 159C

       Carrie is sound asleep. Her phone rings. She grabs it.

                           CARRIE
                 Hello.

                                                   105D.


159D   INT. MIRANDA'S APARTMENTS -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER        159D

       Intercut with Miranda -- sitting on her couch watching the
       New Year's Eve coverage on television. Chinese take-out is on
       the table in front of her.

                            MIRANDA
                 I thought one of the perks of
                 having a family is you don't have
                 to spend New Year's Eve alone with
                 Chinese food.
                     (beat)
                 I'm alone with Chinese food.

                           CARRIE
                 I was sleeping.

                           MIRANDA
                 Oh, shit -- I'm sorry.

                           CARRIE
                 That's okay. Where's Brady?

                           MIRANDA
                 It's Steve's night.

                           CARRIE
                 Right.

                           MIRANDA
                 Go back to sleep -- don't wake up.

                           CARRIE
                 It's okay. Are you alright?

                           MIRANDA
                 I'm fine -- I was just getting a
                 little choked-up watching the
                 stupid New Year's Eve stuff on TV
                 alone.

                           CARRIE
                 Want me to come over?

                           MIRANDA
                 I'm all the way downtown --

                           CARRIE
                 I can grab a cab --

                           MIRANDA
                 On New Year's Eve? No way. I'm
                 fine... really.
                           (MORE)

                                                   105E.

                           MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                 I just wanted to talk a little. Go
                 back to sleep. Good night.

       Miranda hangs up. Carrie lays there -- holding the phone.
       She looks over at her bedside table clock: 11:12. She thinks
       then -- throws back the covers and gets out of bed. START
       MUSIC.


159E   EXT. CARRIE'S BULIDING -- NIGHT -- WINTER                159E

       Snowing. Carrie hurries out of her front door -- a coat
       thrown over her pajamas. She comes down the stairs to the
       street looking for a cab. Nothing. No traffic. She starts
       RUNNING up the block -- passing TWO FESTIVE COUPLES; walking.


159F   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT -- WINTER            159F

       Lily, in her PJ's, is marching around the den wearing a
       "Happy New Year" party crown and blowing into a party favor
       horn. Harry and Charlotte -- wearing New Year's Eve party
       hats -- sit on the couch -- laughing. Charlotte and Harry
       kiss. His hand moves sensuously down Charlotte's body and
       rests on her pregnant belly.

                                                     106.

       Samantha and Smith recline on the couch. They are wearing
       sexy black robes and having caviar and champagne. The Dog
       sits nearby... a fire roars in the fireplace behind them.
       Samantha and Smith kiss on the couch. The Dog humps a pillow
       nearby.

       Anthony stands talking to FRIENDS. Someone taps him on the
       shoulder. He looks over -- it's Stanford -- holding two
       glasses of champagne. Stanford and Anthony look at each
       other as everyone around them kisses. Stanford presents his
       cheek. Anthony kisses it.


166B   EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE STREET -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER        166B

       Snowing. Carrie runs up the stairs of the Lower East Side
       subway stop. She looks around to get her bearings -- then
       starts running again. She passes a GROUP OF TWENTY-SOMETHING
       PEOPLE blowing party horns and LAUGHING.


168    INT. ST. LOUIS APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER            168

       Louise is talking to a group of St. Louis FRIENDS. She looks
       up as WILL (22) her handsome African-American ex-boyfriend
       enters. Their eyes meet. Her heart stops. He smiles. She
       smiles. He starts over to her. They stand talking -- she
       smiles. He smiles.

168C   EXT. LOWER EAST APARTMENT DAY -- NIGHT -- WINTER          168C

       Miranda opens a fortune cookie -- and reads it. Tosses it
       down. Picks up another -- cracks it open. Reads it. Tosses it
       down. She looks like she might cry.


168D   EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER -- WINTER 8D
                                                               16

       Miranda opens the door -- Carrie is standing there -- out of
       breath.

                              CARRIE
                    You're not alone.

       Times Square is seen on the television in the background.

                                 TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

       Snow on the ground -- COLD. CROWDS gathered in front of the
       large fashion tent. Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha
       trudge through the snow to the stairs. Samantha is wearing
       lots of fur. She SLIPS on some ice -- Carrie catches her.

                               CARRIE
                  Easy girl.

                            SAMANTHA
                  Thanks -- Three months driving in
                  L.A. and I forgot how to use my
                  fucking legs.

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  Every year the women of New York
                  leave the past behind and look
                  forward to the future... this is
                  known as Fashion Week.

       They make their way up the stairs to the tent entrance.

       The lobby is buzzing with PRESS and CROWDS OF FASHIONISTAS.
       The GIRLS enter and make their way through the crowd.

                            CARRIE
                  This way. I hear the couture
                  calling my name.

                            SAMANTHA
                  See this -- this is what I miss.
                  Last night Smith and I cuddled in
                  front of the TV with "take out"
                  Mexican.                                               

                            MIRANDA                                      
                  -- In your four billion dollar                         
                  beach house.                                           

       The girls LAUGH.

                            SAMANTHA                                     
                  Still -- I don't think I'm cut out                     
                  for the one-on-one relationship
                  thing.

                                            108A.


                    CHARLOTTE
          You've been doing it for five
          years.

                    SAMANTHA
          No, see -- I've always had
          girlfriends on the side.

They smile. Miranda spots MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG across the
room.

                    MIRANDA
          There's Mayor Bloomberg.                             

                    SAMANTHA                                   
          New Yorkers are so damn attractive -                 
          - Even the Mayor is hot.                             

                    MIRANDA                                    
          I believe that was his last                          
          campaign slogan.                                     

The girls walk on.                                             

                                                   109.

      The room is filling up and buzzing with FASHIONISTAS as the
      girls make their way. Samantha spots her name on four chairs
      in the front row and leads the way.

                          SAMANTHA
                There we are.

                          CHARLOTTE
                We're in the front row?!

                          SAMANTHA
                I pulled some strings.

                             CARRIE
                Very nice.

                          SAMANTHA
                I should go thank them --

      Samantha throws her coat on her chair back.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Decide where we want to go for
                lunch -- I'll make the call.
                    (beat; excited)
                It's like old times.

      Samantha hurries off, excited. Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte
      settle into their seats.

                          MIRANDA
                So, this is how you all spent your
                Saturdays while I was with Brady
                and Steve at the Brooklyn Aquarium.

                          CARRIE
                Well... Not every Saturday.

                          MIRANDA
                Just so you know -- We always had
                front row at the mammal show.
                    (beat; then)
                Steve does the funniest dolphin
                impression. Actually, it's more --
                Steve as a dolphin --

      A smile escapes her -- they look at her. Her smile fades.


                    CHARLOTTE
          You really can't forgive him?

                    MIRANDA
          Are you suggesting something?

                    CHARLOTTE
          I like Steve. I've always liked
          Steve -- He's apologized a hundred
          times -- he's not seeing anyone
          else. What's it going to take?

                    MIRANDA
          And are you also suggesting that
          she forgive Big?

                    CHARLOTTE
          No. I could kill Big. Sometimes
          when I'm running -- I imagine what
          I'd say if I ever saw him again. I
          have the perfect opening sentence.
          Want to hear it?

                     CARRIE
              (duh?)
          Ah.... yes.

                    CHARLOTTE
          I curse the day you were born.

                    CARRIE
          Impressive. Better work up a hand
          gesture to go with it.

Elaine comes up to Carrie, squats down in front of her.

                    ELAINE
          Thank god you're here. They have me
          covering this Mercedes-Benz fashion
          week and I'm desperate for a Carrie
          Bradshaw-esque quote.

                    CARRIE
          Well, I'll do my best. We'll talk
          after?

                    ELAINE
          Great. And -- ooh -- my back --

She gets up -- sits in Samantha's empty chair next to Carrie.


                           ELAINE (CONT'D)
                     (very sincere)
                 -- Can I just say that I'm so sorry
                 about what happened with your
                 wedding.

       Carrie smiles -- what else can she do?

                           ELAINE (CONT'D)
                 I don't know how you survived it.
                 I, personally, was so devastated I
                 took myself off JDate -- but you
                 survived and you're here and you
                 look amazing and I just think
                 that's so great. Everyone in my row
                 does -- we can't stop talking about
                 it. Okay -- Meet you in the lobby
                 after.

       Elaine smiles and leaves. Carrie sits -- stunned; numb. She
       looks to the chairs across the runway -- FASHIONABLE WOMEN
       are looking back at her -- one or two smile sympathetically.
       She grabs her things and then turns to Charlotte.

                           CARRIE
                 I've gotta go.

       Carrie slips silently away. Charlotte gets up and starts away
       after her. Miranda looks --

                           MIRANDA
                 Should I --

       Charlotte shakes her head: "not sure"... and continues
       away...


178A   INT. FASHION SHOW TENT/ENTRANCE AREA -- MOMENTS LATER      178A

       Charlotte catches up with Carrie as she is about to exit.
       Fashionistas stream by them on their way in.

                           CHARLOTTE
                 Carrie, wait.

       Carrie stops -- turns around -- putting on her wrap.

                           CARRIE
                 This was a mistake -- it's too soon
                 -- I'm not ready. I'll go get a
                 coffee and you guys call me after --
                 and I'll meet you for lunch.

                           CHARLOTTE
                 Are you sure? I know how much you
                 were looking forward to this.

                           CARRIE
                 Yeah, I really was... until I
                 became the poster child for wounded
                 women everywhere.

                           CHARLOTTE
                 You're not.

                           CARRIE
                 Is this thing going to effect
                 everything I do for the rest of my
                 life?

                           CHARLOTTE
                 No -- but if you leave right now --
                 it will effect the rest of your
                 day.

       Carrie looks at her -- takes this in.

                            CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                     (softly)
                 It's Fashion Week. We're in the
                 front row.

                           CARRIE
                 Where everyone can see me.

                           CHARLOTTE
                 Who cares about them -- You only
                 came for the clothes.

       Carrie smiles... a little.

                           CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                 I know it's hard but -- It's like
                 you said: You can't stop being who
                 you are.


178B   INT. FASHION SHOW TENT -- MOMENTS LATER                  178B

       Samantha and Miranda have just gathered their things and are
       leaving their chairs as Charlotte and Carrie return.

                           SAMANTHA
                 We thought we were leaving.

       Charlotte shakes her head: NO. Samantha and Miranda turn
       around and start back to their seats as -- MUSIC STARTS...

       LIGHTS CHANGE. The girls settle in just as a MODEL starts
       down the RUNWAY in gorgeous clothes. Carrie, Miranda,
       Charlotte and Samantha watch --

       DISSOLVE TO: the girls watching another model; another
       outfit. They point and discuss what they see -- loving it.

       DISSOLVE TO: the girls watching another model; another
       outfit. With each outfit Carrie seems to lighten and
       brighten.

       DISSOLVE TO: the girls watching another model; another
       outfit. Carrie smiles as she watches -- now, truly enjoying
       herself.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:


178C   INT. LOBBY TENT -- MOMENTS LATER -- WINTER                 178C

       Carrie is being interviewed by Elaine holding a TAPE
       RECORDER. Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte watch nearby.

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 I didn't know if it was the fashion
                 or the fact that the four of us
                 were together again -- but for the
                 first time in a long time -- I felt
                 like myself.


183   EXT. BRYANT PARK -- MOMENTS LATER -- WINTER               183

      The girls leave the tent and start down the stairs.

                          SAMANTHA
                Let's get a cab -- I am starv --

      SPLAT. Her fur coat is hit with SPLASH of red paint. They
      REACT: SHOCKED. AN ACTIVIST WOMAN stands there holding a
      paint cup. Next to her -- another ACTIVIST is holding a PUG
      dog.

                          ACTIVIST #1
                Fur is murder!

                           ACTIVIST #2
                MUR-DER.   MUR-DER.

                           SAMANTHA
                    (beat)
                God, I miss New York.


184   EXT. NYC STREET -- DAY -- WINTER                          184

      Carrie hurries across the street --

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And a couple of weeks later -- I
                met St. Louise's St. Louis
                boyfriend, Will.

      She arrives at the front of a restaurant. Through the window,
      she can see Louise sitting next to Will. Louise spots Carrie
      and waves. Carrie waves back and starts in.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Over Christmas they realized how
                much they loved each other. Just in
                time for Valentine's day.


185   INT. CARRIE'S BUILDING/FOYER -- LATER -- WINTER           185

      Carrie turns the key in her mail box. A little pink envelope
      sits there. She takes it out and opens it. It's a "kid's
      style" Valentine card of Cinderella. She turns it over.
      Lily's crayon mark mixes with Charlotte's handwriting: To
      Aunt Carrie... Love, Lily.


186   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- A LITTLE LATER -- WINTER       186

      Carrie opens the door, holding the valentine. Her phone is
      ringing. She answers it.

                           CARRIE
                Hello?


187   INT. BEACHOUSE/KITCHEN -- LATER -- WINTER                 187

      Intercut with Samantha in her kitchen attempting to make
      sushi. Her hands covered in rice. The DOG, wearing a sweater
      with a "heart" on it sits on the floor watching.

                          SAMANTHA
                I'm just calling to make sure you
                aren't hanging from your shower
                rod.

                          CARRIE
                You called an hour too early.

                          SAMANTHA
                So, what's the V-day plan?

                          CARRIE
                Miranda and I are going to dinner
                and then a really violent slasher
                movie.

                           SAMANTHA
                Perfect.

                           CARRIE
                And you?

                          SAMANTHA
                I am making Smith sushi. Pause for
                reaction.

                          CARRIE
                Wow. Do you make sushi?


                          SAMANTHA
                We took a class a while back -- and
                when he walks in the door at seven-
                thirty, I am going to surprise him
                by laying on the dining room table -
                -- covered with homemade sushi.

                          CARRIE
                Boy, you do have time on your
                hands.


188   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER -- WINTER        188

      Carrie walks over to the book shelf and places the Cinderella
      valentine on it. She looks down at the bottom shelf. The
      Vogue magazine is looking up at her -- She picks it up.


189   INT. VILLAGE RESTAURANT -- LATER -- WINTER                189

      A small, village restaurant festively decorated for
      Valentine's Day. Pink balloons float on the ceiling, their
      red ribbon strings hang at eye level. Carrie and Miranda sit
      at a table. At all the other tables -- Couples!

                          MIRANDA
                Is it me or is Valentine's Day this
                year on steroids?

                          CARRIE
                I think it was like this last year
                but we played for the other team.

      A WAITRESS (23) approaches them with pink menus.

                          WAITRESS
                Good evening. Here's our special
                Valentine night menu. All the
                selections are romantic in theme
                and designed to be split for two.
                Are you having wine?

                          CARRIE/MIRANDA
                Yes.

                          WAITRESS
                A glass or a bot --

                          CARRIE/MIRANDA
                Bottle.


                          WAITRESS
                I'll be right back to take you and
                your girlfriends order.

      The waitress leaves. Miranda looks at Carrie.

                          MIRANDA
                I could do a lot worse.


190   INT. VILLAGE RESTAURANT -- LATER -- WINTER                190

      The wine bottle is now empty. Carrie and Miranda eat.

                          MIRANDA
                Why would you look at the Vogue
                today of all days?

                          CARRIE
                `Cause -- I'm an emotional cutter.
                    (Beat;then)
                I deserve what I got. Running all
                over New York believing that I'm
                finally getting my happy ending.
                "See everyone, love does conquer
                all. Look at me in my one of a kind
                wedding gown marrying the love of
                my life."

      Waitress stops at the table. She picks up the bottle.

                          WAITRESS
                Would you like another bot --

                          CARRIE/MIRANDA
                Yes.

      She leaves.

                          CARRIE
                And Miranda... in that article -- I
                did not say "we" once. It was all:
                "I" want and "I" think.

                          MIRANDA
                It was from your point of view.

                          CARRIE
                My point of view... Exactly. The
                whole wedding was my point of view.
                I let the wedding get bigger than
                Big. I am the reason he didn't get
                out of that car.

                                           116A.


                   MIRANDA
         You can't put this all on yourself.
             (beat; then)
         Okay. I said something I shouldn't
         have said to Big at the rehearsal
         dinner.

                                             117.


                    CARRIE
          What do you mean?

                    MIRANDA
          I was really upset after Steve
          showed up and I bumped into Big and
          -- I said that you two were crazy
          to get married.

Carrie is stunned. The waitress arrives with the new bottle
of wine.

                    WAITRESS
          Here we go. Your Shiraz.

She is opening the bottle. Tension. She pops the cork --
starts to pour.

                    MIRANDA
          Stop -- It's fine -- Thanks.

The Waitress puts the bottle down and walks away.

                    MIRANDA (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, I was upset-- Steve had--

                    CARRIE
          I have been going over this and
          over this in my mind for five
          months -- and -- for five months
          you kept a secret like that?

                    MIRANDA
          I tried to tell you once but the
          Vogue article came out --

                    CARRIE
          Once? You tried to tell me once?
          You should have tried to tell me
          every single day!

                    MIRANDA
          I know, I was looking for the right
          time.

                    CARRIE
          There is no right time to tell me
          you ruined my marriage!

The Room is now at "attention."

                                                   118.


                          MIRANDA
                It just happened -- I wasn't
                thinking.

      Carrie grabs her purse -- to leave.

                          MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                Carrie, please -- Don't go -- I --

      Carrie stands up -- the festive balloon strings bob in front
      of her face. She pushes them away.

                           CARRIE
                And I think what hurts the most is
                that you kept a secret from me. I
                have never ever kept a secret from
                you. Ever!

      She starts out. Stops, comes back -- through the ribbons.

                           CARRIE (CONT'D)
                No, I'm lying. For the last five
                months I've been thinking that it's
                a huge mistake that you left Steve.
                    (beat)
                There. How does it feel?

      She turns and pushes balloons out of her way as she starts
      out. A KISSING COUPLE (20's) is BLOCKING her way.

                             CARRIE (CONT'D)
                Excuse me!

      They stop -- She squeezes by them. Miranda is devastated.


191   INT. BEACHOUSE/DINING ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER 1
                                                               19

      Candles are lit. Samantha enters wearing a sexy sheer robe
      and carrying a giant tray of homemade sushi. The phone rings.
      The machine picks up. Smith leaves a message.

                          SMITH (V.O.)
                Babe -- we're way behind on set. I
                still haven't been released. I'll
                get there as soon as I can.

      She SIGHS -- places the tray on the table. Looks at the wall
      clock: Seven-thirty.

                                                  118A.


192   INT. BEACHOUSE/DINING ROOM -- LATER -- WINTER             192

      Eight o'clock. Samantha is sitting in the robe near the
      table. Not pleased.


193   INT. BEACHOUSE/DINING ROOM -- LATER -- WINTER             193

      Eight-thirty -- Samantha is pacing. She takes a piece of
      sushi -- pops it in her mouth and chews -- pissed. A WOMAN
      MOANING is heard. She walks over and glances out the window
      into Dante's living room. Candles are everywhere -- he is
      naked and GIVING HEAD to naked BLONDE WOMAN. She is writhing
      in pleasure. Samantha watches -- even more pissed.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                It was the same Valentine night
                Samantha had planned -- minus the
                sushi.

                                                    119.


194   INT. BEACHOUSE/KITCHEN -- LATER                            194

      Samantha now wearing sweat clothes, sits with her arms
      crossed -- waiting. The door opens and Smith enters.

                            SMITH
                I'm home!

      He see's Samantha sitting there. He smiles.

                          SMITH (CONT'D) (CONT'D)
                Man, that was a long day -- the
                crew went into double overtime.

                          SAMANTHA
                You are three hours late.

                          SMITH
                Bummer. I know. Did you eat?

                          SAMANTHA
                Yes, I ate. I ate the sushi that I
                hand made for you. The sushi that I
                planned to lay all over my naked
                body as a Valentines surprise for
                you.

                          SMITH
                Why are you so upset? I called.

                          SAMANTHA
                I slaved away in a kitchen all day
                to make this meal for you.

                                                     120.


                           SMITH
                 You made some sushi -- it's not a
                 big deal!

                           SAMANTHA
                 Not a big deal?

       She stands up. She picks up some pieces of sushi.

                           SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                 You see this -- This took me five
                 fucking hours!

       She throws sushi at him. He dodges them.

                            SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                 I am not the type of woman who sits
                 home all day waiting for a man!
                     (beat)
                 You love California so much --
                 enjoy your hand-made California
                 roll!

       She throws more sushi and storms out. Smith looks at the
       subzero fridge. A sushi piece slides down the front.

196B   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- WINTER                   196B

       A FLORAL ARRANGEMENT sits on the hall table next to the
       answering machine. A card reading: "I'm sorry -- Miranda" is
       nearby. The answering machine is recording an incoming call
       from Miranda.

                           MIRANDA (V.O)
                 It's me. Pick up. Are you there?

       Carrie is standing in the bathroom; looking out at the
       answering machine, brushing her teeth.

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 Three days of "I'm sorry" calls and
                 e-mails and flowers -- and I still
                 wasn't ready. It was the longest
                 we'd even gone without speaking.

                                                   120A.


196C   EXT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- WINTER                  196C

       Rain. Carrie walks up to her stoop. A CAB idling in front.
       The cab window goes down. Miranda is sitting there.

                              MIRANDA
                 Carrie.

       Carrie looks. Stops.

                           MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                 Hi. I need to talk to you.

                           CARRIE
                 How long have you been waiting
                 here?

       Miranda looks to the meter, then back to her.

                            MIRANDA
                 Seventeen dollars long.
                     (beat)
                 Please get in. It just turned to
                 eighteen.

       Carrie looks at her, hesitates, starts over to the cab.


196D   INT. CAB -- A LITTLE LATER                                196D

       Rain pours down the windows. Carrie and Miranda sit in
       silence. A MIDDLE EASTERN DRIVER sits behind the wheel.
       CLOSE ON: THE METER. It reads 22.00.

                                             121.



          This is weird not talking.

                       CARRIE
          I'm upset.

                      MIRANDA
          Carrie, I understand -- but it just
          happened -- I never meant to hurt
          you.
               (beat)
          You have to forgive me.

Carrie looks over at her.

                    CARRIE
          You know --

                                                     122.


                           MIRANDA
                 What?

                           CARRIE
                 No.

                           MIRANDA
                 Please. What were you going to say?

                           CARRIE
                 You badger me to forgive you in
                 three days -- and you won't even
                 consider forgiving Steve for
                 something he did six months ago.

                           MIRANDA
                 It's not the same thing.

                           CARRIE
                 It's forgiveness.

       Miranda thinks -- Carrie looks at her.

                           CARRIE (CONT'D)
                 And -- I know you're not the reason
                 my marriage fell apart. I was just
                 - desperate to have someone else to
                 blame.

       Miranda thinks. The METER clicks.

201    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE -- DAY -- WINTER                   201

       Steve and Miranda are sitting in front of a THERAPIST.

                           MIRANDA
                 I don't know if I can trust that it
                 won't happen again.

                                           122A.


                   THERAPIST
         Steve - you're very quiet today.

                   STEVE
         Miranda, I know I made it hard for
         you to trust me. But -- You made it
         hard for me to trust you.

                   MIRANDA
         Me?!

                                                   123.


                           STEVE
                 The way you treated me and cut me
                 out of your life like that? I mean,
                 yeah -- I broke a vow. But what
                 about the other vows? Like
                 promising to love someone for
                 better or for worse? What about
                 that?

      Miranda looks down at her hands. Steve looks at the
      therapist.

                           STEVE (CONT'D)
                 How do I know she won't punish me
                 for the rest of my life?

                            THERAPIST
                 You don't. And she doesn't know for
                 sure that you won't have another
                 indiscretion.
                     (beat)
                 All you can know... is that you
                 want to move forward and risk that
                 you love for each other won't allow
                 that to happen.

      Silence.

                           THERAPIST (CONT'D)
                 And that's what we'll discover
                 here.

      Steve looks over at Miranda. Miranda looks at Steve.


202   EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- DAY -- SPRING                        202

      Forsythia bushes are in bloom. Carrie and Miranda walk. They
      carry sandwiches.

                           MIRANDA
                 So, we're done with our last
                 session and we're not allowed to
                 talk for two weeks while we figure
                 out if being together again is
                 something we really want. And then -
                 - we had to pick a place to meet --
                 and if we both show up on that day -
                 - the past no longer exists.
                 Showing up is the promise we make
                 to each other that we're willing to
                 let it all go and move forward.

                                           124.


                  CARRIE
        Can you do that?

                  MIRANDA
        I don't know. I have a lot of
        thinking to do.

                  CARRIE
        Thinking -- or feeling?

                  MIRANDA
        What do you mean?

                  CARRIE
        Miranda -- you're a lawyer. You can
        argue both sides of any case --
        but, why we feel what we feel --
        isn't logical. It's emotional.
        Sorry, Harvard -- I'm afraid you're
        going to have to make this decision
        based on your emotions.

                  MIRANDA
        Well, then -- I'm screwed. I don't
        know what I feel.

                  CARRIE
        You will. There will come a moment
        when you'll know. And if it's: yes -
        - all that brilliant logic will go
        out the window... with the past.

                  MIRANDA
        And I thought picking the place to
        meet was a challenge.

                  CARRIE
        Where is it?

                  MIRANDA
        The Brooklyn Bridge. Halfway
        between both our places.

                  CARRIE
        Very logical. And yet poetic.

                  MIRANDA
        Poetic -- if we both show up.
        Otherwise -- you're on a bridge --
        rejected. Not a good plan.

                                                      125.


203    INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- SPRING                  203

       Carrie walks in carrying a Starbucks cardboard caddy with two
       coffee. Louise is sitting at her desk, working.

                           LOUISE
                 I have two pieces of good news.

                           CARRIE
                 And I have two coffees.

                           LOUISE
                 I just got a heads-up from your
                 realtor. The apartment on Fifth
                 finally sold.

       Carrie sips coffee. Nods.

                           LOUISE (CONT'D)
                 You have sixty days before the new
                 owner takes possession and you are
                 out of there.

                           CARRIE
                 What's the other news?

       Louise holds up her hand. There is a diamond ring on it.

                           CARRIE (CONT'D)
                 Oh my God --

                           LOUISE
                 I'm moving back to St. Louis -- we
                 are getting married in the fall.

       Louise beams. Carrie hugs her.


204    EXT. BEACH -- DAY -- SPRING                                 204

       Grey day. Samantha is sitting on the beach reading "The
       Secret."

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 Meanwhile, back in Lost Angeles...

       She rolls her eyes, and tosses it down in the sand.


204A   EXT. BEACH -- A LITTLE LATER                               204A

       Samantha walks on the beach. The dog is walking with her.

                                            125A.


                    CARRIE (V.O.)
          ... Samantha had money, a career
          and a man who loved her... Still,
          she couldn't shake the feeling that
          something was missing from her
          life.

The dog runs up onto the neighbor's deck.

                                                     126.


                          SAMANTHA
                No! Come back here.


205   EXT. NEIGHBORS'S DECK -- MOMENTS LATER -- SPRING            205

      Samantha is on the neighbor's deck looking for the dog.

                          SAMANTHA
                Where are you, baby?

      She rounds a corner -- and comes face to face with Dante --
      showering in the outdoor shower. Water runs over his NAKED
      and PERFECT BODY. He sees her and smiles a hot smile. She is
      thrown -- overwhelmed.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                Sorry -- I'm your neighbor and my
                dog ran up on your dick--
                    (catching herself)
                --Deck!

      There is a GROWL sound. She looks -- the dog is humping a
      towel on the deck floor. She looks back at Dante.

                          DANTE
                Want to join me?

      Speechless -- She shakes her head: No -- she scoops up the
      dog and hurries away. He calls after her.

                             DANTE (CONT'D)
                I'm Dante.     Stop by -- anytime.

      Samantha takes a peek back and continues on her way.


206   EXT. BEACHOUSE/BEDROOM -- DAY -- SPRING                     206

      Samantha is having lunch outside while on the phone.

                          SAMANTHA
                Smith is interested - but the dates
                will have to work with the series.

      Dante appears on the deck next store in a wet suit. He unzips
      it while looking at Samantha. SAMANTHA dips a chip in
      guacamole and eats it. He pulls his wet-suit down and smiles
      at her. She dips another chip. He steps out of it and looks
      at her -- almost torturing her. She looks the other way, dips
      another chip in guacamole and eats it. Then another.

                                                   127.


207   INT. BEACHOUSE/KITCHEN -- DAY -- SPRING                     207

      Samantha is in the kitchen on the phone. She picks up a slice
      of messy pizza from a delivery box on the table.

                           SAMANTHA
                We agreed that no one else from the
                show but Smith was going to be on
                the cover.

      She walks to the window and looks out. Dante is on his deck
      putting on sun screen. He glistens. She chews.


208   INT. BEACHOUSE/DECK -- NIGHT -- SPRING                      208

      Samantha is in the jacuzzi -- she is looking up at Dante who
      is on his deck smoking a joint. He indicates for her to come
      over. She shakes her head: No. He walks away. She presses a
      button on the control panel. The jacuzzi jets start. She re-
      positions herself "on" them, then... She reaches over and
      grabs a giant hot fudge sundae and... starts eating it.


209   INT. LOWER EAST SIDE RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SPRING            209

      Miranda sits in the window -- having a cappuccino, alone. On
      the table a legal pad with a list of PROS and CONS.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                With her two weeks just about up,
                Miranda's list of pros and cons
                were equal.

      She throws some money down on the table and takes a final sip
      on her cappuccino. As she stands up, she catches sight of
      herself in the mirrored wall. Cappuccino foam covers her top
      lip. She remembers. She knows.


210   EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- LATER THAT DAY                      210

      Miranda stands on the bridge. Alone. She looks at her watch.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                It suddenly dawned on Miranda that
                Steve's list might have had more
                cons then pros.

      Just as this reality hits -- the CROWD parts and Steve is
      seen RUNNING up the bridge... towards her.

                                                  127A.


211   EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- MOMENTS LATER                       211

      Miranda and Steve walk along the bridge towards Brooklyn.

                                                     128.


                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And Miranda never looked back...


212   INT. STEVE AND MIRANDA'S HOUSE -- NIGHT -- SPRING           212

      Steve and Miranda are making love -- it is passionate.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Well, almost never.

      Miranda turns her head back to look at Steve.

                           MIRANDA
                Kiss me.


213   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- SPRING                    213

      Carrie's apartment is transformed. It is sleeker, polished,
      more grown-up, with a warm, modern feel.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And at home -- everything felt and
                looked different -- and yet still
                very much me.

      Carrie -- BLONDE again -- walks out of the kitchen with
      Lilacs in a large vase. The door bell buzzes.


214   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER -- SPRING          214

      Carrie opens the door. Miranda stands there with a very
      pregnant Charlotte.

                          CARRIE
                Sorry. This is a very exclusive
                party.

                          MIRANDA
                We're on the list. Miranda Hobbes
                plus one...and a half.


215   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- SPRING                  215

      WOMEN FRIENDS chatting and having fun. The front door is open
      and a coat rack is visible in the hall. A couple of WAITERS
      (20's) move around. ANTHONY comes up to Carrie.

                                             129.


                    ANTHONY
          A woman just put a glass down on
          your new desk without a coaster. I
          told her if she did it again I'd
          break her arm.

                      CARRIE
          Thanks.

He walks on. Miranda wanders up to Carrie.

                    MIRANDA
          Where's Samantha? Her plane landed
          two hours ago.

                    CARRIE
          You know her, probably ran to the
          hotel gym for a quick work-out.

Samantha appears in the doorway wearing a summer coat -- the
dog is in her purse.

                    SAMANTHA
          There's no place like home.

                      CARRIE
          Sweetie!

They kiss -- She goes to Miranda; they kiss.

                    MIRANDA
          There's a rat in your purse.

                    CARRIE
          And that rat better be house
          trained.

A CATER WAITER walks over to her.

                    CATER WAITER
          Can I take your coat?

Samantha nods and takes off her coat. Revealing: She has a
belly. A very non-Samantha big fat gut.

Carrie looks at it. Miranda looks at it. Carrie and Miranda
exchange looks. Charlotte comes running down the hall.

                      CHARLOTTE
          Samantha!

Samantha raises her arms to greet her. Her blouse rides up,
the gut peeks out. Charlotte reacts; shocked.

                                                   130.


                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                You have a -- dog!

                          SAMANTHA
                Did you ever think you'd see the
                day -- me with a pooch.

      All three shake their heads: No.


216   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM -- LATER -- SPRING       216

      Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte are in the bathroom.

                          MIRANDA
                So, she has a belly. So what?

                          CARRIE
                No, a belly on anyone else is a "so
                what?" A belly on Samantha is a:
                "So what the hell is going on?"

                          CHARLOTTE
                She never mentioned it on the
                phone?

                          CARRIE
                Never. And when has she ever not
                talked about every detail regarding
                her body?

                          CHARLOTTE
                Should we even bring it up?

                          MIRANDA
                What -- like a fat intervention?
                "We love you -- have a salad?" No.
                We should let her bring it up.

      There is a knock... Samantha opens the door. She's eating a
      piece of cake.

                          SAMANTHA
                Ladies, we can talk about my gut
                later-- right now, I'm bored to
                tears here.

      She gives them a look. They smile, relieved.

                                                   131.


217   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- SPRING                  217

      Everyone has left. Samantha is sitting with Charlotte and
      Miranda and Carrie. They are having coffee.

                          SAMANTHA
                I eat -- so I won't cheat.

                          MIRANDA
                What exactly are you eating?

                          SAMANTHA
                Everything except Dante's dick.

                          CARRIE
                Language, please -- this is a grown-
                up apartment now.

                          SAMANTHA
                I guess I didn't realize how big I
                was until I saw it on your faces.

                          CARRIE
                How -- and I say this with love --
                How could you not realize it?

                          SAMANTHA
                I've been avoiding mirrors.

                          CHARLOTTE
                I'm proud of you for not cheating.

                          SAMANTHA
                I don't know if there's anything to
                be proud of. I stuff my face to
                stop myself from doing something
                that feels natural to me.

      Carrie reaches over and rubs Samantha's back.

                          CARRIE
                Why didn't you say something?

                          SAMANTHA
                I guess I didn't want to admit it.
                And when you're in denial -- you
                don't dial.

                          CARRIE
                Now, listen -- this isn't about the
                weight. You'd be gorgeous at any
                size. But are you happy?

                                             132.


                     SAMANTHA
              (Silence; then)
          Relationships aren't always about
          being happy, right?
              (beat)
          How often do you feel happy in your
          relationship?

                    CARRIE
              (to Charlotte)
          I'm pretty sure that's to you.

                       CHARLOTTE
          Every day.

                    SAMANTHA
          You feel happy ever day?

                    CHARLOTTE
          Not all day -- everyday -- but
          everyday.

                    MIRANDA
          When was the last time you felt
          happy?

                    SAMANTHA
          Six months ago.

They react.

                    SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
          What am I going to do?

                    CARRIE
          What does your gut tell you?

                    SAMANTHA
          I know but --
              (beat; hard)
          Smith stayed with me through chemo.
          If he could stay with me through
          that, I should be able to stay in
          this relationship for him.

                    CARRIE
          Sweetie... You just compared your
          relationship to chemo.

Samantha looks at her, then Charlotte, then Miranda.

                                                    133.


                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                There we were...the three mirrors
                Samantha couldn't avoid.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                And Samantha?

      Samantha looks. Carrie points. The dog is humping a pillow on
      Carrie's furniture.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                That pillow cost three hundred
                dollars.


218   INT. BEACHHOUSE -- DINING ROOM/SUNSET -- SPRING            218

      Samantha is sitting -- waiting. Smith enters.

                          SMITH
                Hey -- You're home! I thought you
                were staying the week.

      He kisses her. She looks at him. Touches his face.

                          SAMANTHA
                We need to talk.

                          SMITH
                Awwww... man. I knew this was
                coming.

                           SAMANTHA
                Yeah. This isn't working.
                    (beat)
                I've done my best. I've given it
                five years and fifteen pounds.

                          SMITH
                What -- You don't love me any more?

                          SAMANTHA
                Yes, I love you - ah, fuck it --
                I'm just gonna say the thing you're
                not supposed to say -- I love you
                but I love me more. And I've been
                in a relationship with myself for
                forty-nine years and that's the one
                I need to work on.

      She stands up and wraps her arms around him, whispers.

                                                   134.


                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                You'll find a wonderful woman who
                loves being in a relationship.

                          SMITH
                What will you find?

                          SAMANTHA
                I don't know. But that's a risk I'm
                willing to take.

      She notices the gardenia ring on her finger. She starts to
      take it off. Stops. Looks back up at him.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                No. I'm keeping this. Every time I
                look down at it I want to think of
                you.

      She kisses him on the lips. GENTLY. SOFTLY.


219   INT. AIRPLANE/FIRST CLASS -- NIGHT -- SPRING              219

      Samantha sits in first class. She is crying... while eating a
      hot fudge sundae. A STEWARDESS leans down.

                          STEWARDESS
                We're landing in new York. I'm
                gonna need to take that now.

      Samantha nods, and finishes eating the hot fudge sundae as
      fast as she can. Scraping, almost licking the bowl.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                As someone returned to my life...


220   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- SPRING                  220

      Carrie stands at the door with Louise.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                ... Someone left.

                          LOUISE
                And I put all the unopened mail
                from your P.O. Box in the manila
                envelopes on the bottom shelf
                there.

      She points to the shelf in the new bookcase. Carrie looks.

                                               135.


                    LOUISE (CONT'D)
          And please -- please do not make a
          mess of CarrieBradshaw.com -- it's
          my masterpiece.

                    CARRIE
          What am I gonna do without you?

                    LOUISE
          You'll find some other girl... but
          she won't have my style.

                    CARRIE
          St. Louise, you brought me back to
          life.

Emotion floods Carrie; she chokes up. So does Louise --

                    LOUISE
          And you gave me Louise Vuitton.

Carrie laughs -- they hug.

                    LOUISE (CONT'D)
          Serious. We need to stop cryin'.

Louise breaks the hug and takes her "love" key chain out of
her purse -- hands it to Carrie.

                       LOUISE (CONT'D)
          Your keys.

                    CARRIE
          Wait -- don't forget your "love."

                    LOUISE
          No, I found my love. I'm leaving
          that with you.

Carrie smiles. Louise starts out the door, turns back.

                    LOUISE (CONT'D)
          See you at my wedding.

                    CARRIE
          I'll meet you in St. Louis.

Louise gives one last look, and leaves. Carrie closes the
door. Looks down at "love" in her hand.

                                                   136.


221   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT -- SPRING                  221

      Carrie is sitting at her desk... typing.

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                Now, there were no more
                distractions.
                    (beat)
                And as I moved on...


222   EXT. MIRANDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY -- SPRING          222

      Samantha walks past Lovro and Magda sitting on chairs out
      front, sipping ice tea, and up to Miranda's lower east side
      apartment stoop with the dog on the leash.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                ... Samantha moved in.

      The HOT TATTOOED LATIN GUY is still sitting on the stoop out
      front with the ferocious looking pitbull. She starts up the
      stairs. He checks her out. She turns.

                          SAMANTHA
                Hi, I'm your new neighbor.

                             HOT NEIGHBOR
                Diego.

                             SAMANTHA
                Samantha.

      They smile. There is a connection. Samantha looks down. The
      dog is humping the pitbull. Diego nods approval.


223   EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SPRING            223

      A very, very pregnant Charlotte carrying shopping bags is
      being seated at a banquette by the HOSTESS (26).

                          HOSTESS
                When are you due?

                             CHARLOTTE
                Next week.

                          HOSTESS
                You look gorgeous.

                                                     137.


                          CHARLOTTE
                    (touched; embarrassed)
                Oh, thank-you.

      The Hostess walks away as Charlotte settles in and looks
      around. Her eyes WIDEN. Big is sitting across the room at a
      table -- alone. He hasn't seen her. Charlotte starts to panic
      as the WAITRESS (20's) comes over.

                          WAITRESS
                Hi, can I --

                          CHARLOTTE
                No, I'm sorry -- I can't stay --
                Help me -- pull out the table. I
                can't --

      Charlotte pulls herself up off the banquette. As she tries to
      slide out, her belly and shopping bags knock things off the
      table. Crash. DINERS looks. Big spots her -- their eyes meet.
      She moves away as quickly as she can through the room. He
      gets up and follows after her.


224   EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SPRING            224

      Charlotte exits the restaurant -- visibly upset. Big is
      quickly on her heels.

                          BIG
                Charlotte. Charlotte wait --

      He catches up to her - and gently steps to her.

                          BIG (CONT'D)
                You're pregnant -- don't run.

                          CHARLOTTE
                I don't want to see you.

      She starts crying and talking though the tears.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                I'm so mad at you. I was always on
                your side and then you did that to
                Carrie -- No, no -- I'm not going
                to cry -- I'm not going to waste
                tears on you --
                    (strong; stomping foot)
                I curse the day you were born!

      Charlotte's eyes widen. She stops moving, entirely.

                                                   138.


                           CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                I think my water just broke.
                    (beat)
                Oh my God -- Taxi!

                          BIG
                My car's right there. Get in my
                car.

                          CHARLOTTE
                I don't want to get in your car --
                I hate your car. Taxi!

                          BIG
                Charlotte -- we need to get you to
                the hospital -- Please get in my
                car. It's right here and ready.

      Charlotte finally nods. Big hurries her to the car.


225   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- LATER                             225

      Carrie hurries down a corridor -- looking for a room. She
      spots it, knocks and enters.


226   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                            226

      Carrie enters. Harry stands there. Beaming.

                          CARRIE
                Hi. Congratulations... A girl!

                          HARRY
                It's my lot in life to be
                surrounded by beautiful women.

      She kisses him and walks over to the bed where Charlotte is
      holding ROSE, a beautiful baby with thick dark hair.

                          CARRIE
                Oh my God. She's gorgeous.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Say hello to Rose.

      Carrie kisses Charlotte on the head.

                          CARRIE
                What a beautiful name.

                                             139.


                    CHARLOTTE
          After Harry's "Bubbie."

                    HARRY
          Now, we got a Lily and a Rose.

Carrie sits on the edge of the bed.

                    CARRIE
          Well, I have to say you two are
          very cool customers -- just making
          the "baby's here" call without all
          the "I'm in labor" drama.

                    HARRY
          Oh -- there was plenty of drama.

                    CHARLOTTE
          My water broke in front of a
          restaurant.

                    CARRIE
          Very dramatic.

                    HARRY
          Wait -- she's not done.

                    CHARLOTTE
          It broke while I was talking to
          Big.

                    CARRIE
          What?

                    HARRY
          See. Drama.

                    CHARLOTTE
          I bumped into him and I got so
          upset I started crying and then -
          my water broke.

                    HARRY
          He brought her to the hospital.
          Stayed until the baby was born.

                    CHARLOTTE
          I think he was hoping to see you.

Silence. Carrie is having a hard time with this.

                                                   140.


                          CARRIE
                Well -- today is not about him.
                It's about beautiful baby Rose.
                    (beat; forced up)
                So -- we know she has Charlotte's
                hair -- what else do we know?

      Harry and Charlotte give each other a sad glance.


227   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- LATER                           227

      Carrie walks out of Charlotte's room with Harry.

                          CARRIE
                She's a doll. Mazel tov!

      She kisses Harry on the cheek and starts away.

                          HARRY
                He asked me to ask you to call him.

      Carrie stops. Turns around. Looks at him.

                          HARRY (CONT'D)
                I know! It's none of my business.
                But I felt bad for the poor schmuck
                hanging around the hospital waiting
                room hoping to see you. I swear
                every time he heard someone in
                heels coming down the hall -- his
                heart stopped.

                          CARRIE
                Harry -- it's so much more
                complicated than you can imagine.

                          HARRY
                I know it is -- and you have every
                right to never call him -- but I'm
                just a big pile of love today --and
                I feel bad for the guy. He said
                he's been writing you -- but you
                never responded.

                          CARRIE
                    (beat; then)
                He's never written me.

                          HARRY
                He said he wrote because he didn't
                have your phone number.

                                                   141.


                          CARRIE
                No. He's never written me. Ever.

                          HARRY
                Then, why would he say that he had?

      Carrie looks at Harry. Lost. Confused.


228   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- SPRING                  228

      Carrie enters her apartment. She glances over at her bookcase
      -- Remembers.

      JUMP CUT TO: Carrie opens the bookcase drawer and takes out a
      Manila envelope marked: P.O. Box.

      JUMP CUT TO: Carrie dumps the contents of the envelopes on
      the desk.

      JUMP CUT TO: Carrie quickly sorts through the mail -- looking
      -- looking for something. A letter -- something. Nothing from
      him. She leans back in her chair -- more confused. Her eyes
      drift up to her computer. She wonders if --

      JUMP CUT TO: Carrie is logging onto CarrieBradshaw.com. She
      types in PASSWORD.

      JUMP CUT TO: CarrieBradshaw.com's "welcome page." She clicks
      on EMAIL.

      JUMP CUT TO: Carrie scans through emails -- none are from
      Big. Frustrated she logs off.


229   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER                            229

      Carrie is still at her desk, lost in thought.

                          CARRIE (VO)
                Two hours, two manila envelopes and
                countless emails later, I was just
                about to give up on the Big riddle
                when --

      She looks back at her computer screen and notices:

      "CB-assistant." Carrie sits up. Clicks on it.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                I had told Louise to put Big in a
                place where I would never have to
                hear from him again.

                                               142.


She types in her password. Nothing. Picks up her phone. Dials
a number.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Hey, Louise -- it's me. What's the
          password to get into your assistant
          file? Call me.

She hangs up and places the phone on a pile of mail -- which
causes the mail to fall over onto the floor.

                       CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Shit.

Carrie reaches down to pick-up the mail -- she notices the
"LOVE" key chain has fallen as well. She picks it up and
looks at it, has a hunch.

                       CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Oh my God.

JUMP CUT TO: Carrie types the password: "L-O-V-E." Yes! The
file opens -- her eyes widen. There on the screen are many,
many, many emails -- all from JJP@JJP.com.

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          As soon as I typed in "love" --
          there he was.

She clicks on the first e-mail. It opens:

It's the love letter from Beethoven, retyped.

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And because Big still didn't have
          the words... he retyped a love
          letter from Beethoven.

JUMP CUT TO: New Email: A love letter from Lord Byron.

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And Lord Byron.

JUMP CUT TO: New Email: A love letter from James Joyce.

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And James Joyce.

JUMP CUT TO: New Email: A Love letter from Voltaire.

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And Voltaire.

                                                   143.


      JUMP CUT TO: Carrie sits in the chair. Breathless.
      Overwhelmed.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                There they were. "The Love Letters
                of Great Men - Volume One." Plus
                one more... Written by John James
                Preston.

      New email -- It reads: "I know I screwed it up -- but I will
      love you forever."

      Carrie impulsively picks up the phone -- starts to dial.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                I wanted to call him - but our
                love... Carrie and Big: volumes
                one, two, and three... stopped me.

      She puts the phone down and is about to "delete" the e mail --
      suddenly; the phone rings.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                Hello.

                          LOUISE (O.C.)
                I didn't hear my phone.


230   INT. BRIDAL SHOP -- CONTINUOUS -- SPRING                   230

      Intercut with Louise, standing in a wedding gown. Her MOTHER
      (45), GRANDMOTHER (65), and SISTERS (20 15, 8) sit watching.

                          LOUISE
                We are shopping for my wedding
                gown.

      ANGELA, her youngest sister calls out.

                          ANGELA
                That one makes you look weird.

                          LOUISE
                    (calls over)
                Momma -- can you please -- This is
                a work call.

      The Mother motions for Angela to sit down. She does.

                          CARRIE
                No, it's okay I figured it out.

                                                     144.


                           LOUISE
                Well, I was going to call you
                anyway -- today is the final day on
                the Fifth Avenue apartment. You
                have till six before they change
                the locks.

                          CARRIE
                I don't need to go over there.

                          LOUISE
                And do you NOT want those never-
                worn shoes?

                          CARRIE
                Oh -- I completely forgot about --

                          LOUISE
                `Cause if you don't -- send them on
                to me. I'll squeeze my feet into
                them.

                          CARRIE
                It's already five o'clock.

                          LOUISE
                Hello? There are never been worn
                four hundred dollar shoes!

                           CARRIE
                Five twenty-five.
                     (beat; hears herself)
                Bye.

      Carrie drops the phone and jumps up.


231   EXT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER -- SPRING          231

      Carrie runs down the stairs... she spots a passing CAB.

                          CARRIE
                Taxi!

      It SCREECHES to a halt. She runs to the cab.


232   INT. ELEVATOR -- MOMENTS LATER -- SPRING                    232

      Carrie steps into the elevator. She presses "PH," steps back.
      The doors close.

                                                   145.


233   INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER -- SPRING         233

      Key in the lock -- Carrie enters. She looks around.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                The light in our pre-war apartment
                looked completely different post-
                war.


234   INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER   -- SPRING
                                                                234

      Carrie walks into the bedroom and over to the closet. She
      pushes open the other double door... Revealing --

      Mr. Big - standing there holding the Manolos in his hands. He
      looks up -- surprised by her.

                          BIG
                I was going to get these to you. I
                didn't want it to be a total loss.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                It wasn't logic -- it was love.

      She walks into the closet and over to him. She throws her
      arms around him. He drops the shoes. They kiss. It's
      passionate. Very -- very passionate.


235   INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT/WALK-IN CLOSET -- LATER -- SPRING 35
                                                               2

      Carrie and Big are nestled up next to each other on the
      carpeted floor of the empty walk-in closet. His suit jacket
      is off. Her shoes are off.

                          CARRIE
                Why did we ever decide to get
                married?

                          BIG
                    (beat; then)
                I guess we were afraid it meant
                something if we didn't.

      She looks at him and nods. It's true.

                          BIG (CONT'D)
                I'm sorry to have done that to you.

      Silence. She touches his lips.

                                               146.


                     CARRIE
          I'm sorry to have done that to
          you...
              (beat)
          And you know the funny part?

                    BIG
          Is there a funny part?

                    CARRIE
          We were perfectly happy before we
          decided to live happily ever after.

                    BIG
          Yep. The jokes on us.

She nods... she looks around.

                    CARRIE
          Good closet.

                     BIG
          Thanks.

                    CARRIE
          Comfortable. Is this what you had
          in mind when you installed the
          carpet?

                    BIG
          I'd like to think I was that
          smooth.

                    CARRIE
          We better get up before the new
          owner bust in on us.

They start to get up. Carrie rises first. He starts to get
up, first -- sitting on his side...

                    BIG
          And the way we decided to get
          married -- All business... No
          romance. That's not the way you
          propose to someone.

He moves further up -- onto one knee -- where he stops.

                     BIG (CONT'D)
          This is.

She looks down at him -- Is this happening? He holds out his
hand. She places her hand in his.

                                                   147.


                          BIG (CONT'D)
                Carrie Bradshaw -- love of my life -
                - will you marry me?

      It is everything Carrie Bradshaw had convinced herself would
      never happen. Could never happen. And here it is.

      She nods. Speechless. Overcome. He smiles.

                          BIG (CONT'D)
                See, this is why there's a diamond.
                You need to do something to close
                the deal.

      She laughs. He notices her never-worn Manolo on the floor. He
      picks it up. Holds it out to her. She lifts her foot and
      places it in the shoe. Cinderella style.


236   INT. COURTHOUSE/ROOM -- DAY -- SPRING                     236

      Carrie stands with Big in front of a JUDGE. She is wearing
      the simple white suit and her never-worn Manolos from the
      closet.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And in the end... Carrie Bradshaw
                married John James Preston in a
                label-less dress.

      Big Smiles. She smiles. Both calm. Sure.

                           JUDGE
                By the power vested in me, by the
                state of New York, I now pronounce
                you husband and wife. You may kiss
                the bride.

      Big and Carrie kiss. Then, he whispers into her ear.

                          BIG
                Ever thine. Ever mine. Ever ours.


237   INT. COURTHOUSE/LOBBY -- LATER                            237

      Carrie and Big walk through the courthouse lobby toward the
      front door holding hands.

                          BIG
                You okay that it was just us?

                          CARRIE
                Perfect. You and me -- like I said.

                                                     148.


                          BIG
                Still. Would have been nice if you
                had the girls here.

      He holds the door open for her as they walk outside.


238   EXT. COURTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS -- SPRING                     238

      Carrie and Big walk out of the courthouse into the sun.

                          BIG
                Which is why I called them.

      Carrie looks. Miranda, Charlotte, and a MORE SLENDER Samantha
      are standing there. They SCREAM and throw rice.

                          MIRANDA/SAMANTHA
                Congratulations!

                             CHARLOTTE
                Mazel tov!

      As the rice hits... Carrie screams and Big laughs. A GUARD
      hurries over to them. Carrie is spitting out rice.

                          GUARD
                Excuse me -- excuse me! You're not
                allowed to throw rice anymore.

                          SAMANTHA
                Honey, get over it -- It's New
                York!

      She winks at the guard. He shrugs and walks away.


239   INT. COFFEE SHOP -- LATER -- SPRING                         239

      Big, Carrie, Miranda, Steve, Brady, Charlotte, Harry, Lily,
      rose, Stanford, Samantha are casually gathered around a
      couple of tables that have been pushed together. A WAITRESS
      comes over balancing hot plates.

                          WAITRESS
                Who had the ham and eggs?

      Big raises his arm. The waitress hands the plate down...
      Carrie intercepts it and places it in front of Big.

                                                      149.


                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 It wasn't a fancy designer
                 reception either. Just food and
                 friends.

       The Waitress hands out the other breakfasts. People LAUGH.
       Samantha feeds bacon to the dog -- who is wearing a tiny
       bridal veil on his head.


239A   INT. BARNES AND NOBLE -- DAY -- SUMMER                     239A

       Carrie's books are displayed on a BOOK KIOSK. Carrie stands
       in front of it READING to a crowd from the galleys of her new
       book. She is wearing READING GLASSES.

                           CARRIE
                 Maybe some labels are best left in
                 the closet...


240    EXT. VITRA -- NIGHT -- SUMMER                               240

       Bustling. Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha -- back to
       her fighting weight -- walk down the busy street dressed for
       a night on the town. They laugh as they go -- their designer
       purses swinging.

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 ... Maybe when we put a label on
                 people... bride, groom, husband,
                 wife, fat, thin, married, single...
                 we forget to look past the label
                 and see the person.

       They arrive at the club entrance. A line of PEOPLE wait to be
       let inside. The DOORMAN (30's) spots Carrie, lifts the red
       rope and lets the girls in -- closing it after them.


241    INT. RESTAURANT -- LATER -- SUMMER                          241

       The four girls sit at a table drinking "Cosmopolitans."

                           CHARLOTTE
                 Hmmm. This is delicious.

                           MIRANDA
                 Why did we ever stop drinking
                 these?

                           CARRIE
                 Because everyone else started.

                                            149A.


                    SAMANTHA
              (sips; then)
          Well, that is an oldie but goodie.

                    CARRIE
          And speaking of an oldie but
          goodie...

A WAITER brings birthday cake to the table. The number: "50"
stands proud and tall among the glowing candles. He places it
down in front of a proud Samantha.

                                                     150.


                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                Wait -- wait -- a toast.

      The girls lift their glasses to Samantha.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                To Samantha... fifty and fabulous!

      Samantha smiles, touched -- then blows out her candles.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                To us... and the next fifty!

      Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha raise their glasses.

                          ALL
                To the next fifty.

      They sip and look at one another.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And there, in the same city where
                they met as girls, four New York
                women entered the next phase of
                their lives... dressed head to toe
                in love.

      Samantha licks some icing. Charlotte cuts the cake. Miranda
      helps. Carrie smiles and sips.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                And that's the one label -- that
                never goes out of style.


242   EXT. VITRA -- CONTINUOUS                                    242

      From outside we catch just a glimpse of Carrie and the girls
      at their table inside the busy club. The CAMERA starts to
      move away -- passing the line of PEOPLE waiting to get in.
      At the front of the line four TWENTY-SOMETHING WOMEN stand
      waiting for the red rope to be lifted. As the CAMERA moves
      past them and UP -- the Doorman lifts the red rope and the
      twenty-something women SQUEAL with excitement and
      anticipation as they hurry inside. The CAMERA continues UP
      and UP and over the busy and exciting city.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK.
