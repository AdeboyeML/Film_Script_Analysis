           So, while I would never have

           Eighth grade sucked. I did get my

           was gross and kind of turned me off

           mention, the even-worse other-
           people's-tongues-in-MY-mouth thing.
           Seriously, folks. Who invented
           kissing? Why is everyone so dead-
           set on sticking their body parts in
           other people's orifices? If

           sentiment, Lewis, a pretend hand
           job should have warranted a little
           more than a hundred dollars worth
           of AMC Movie Passes. They had an
           expiration date AND were only able
           to be used for movies that had been
           running for two weeks. But even
           that's better than Tyler Jennings,
           who gave me a ten percent off
           coupon to Bath and Body Works.
           Seriously. A fucking coupon. Is
           that how good my imaginary blow job
           was to you? Huh? Is chivalry
           dead? I want John Cusack holding a
           boombox outside my window. I want
           Richard Gere climbing up my fire
           escape with the limo waiting
           downstairs. I want to ride off on
           a lawnmower with Patrick Dempsey.

           prefer him to look like he looks
           now. What woman wouldn't? But no.
           I get to save two fifty on a bottle
           of Juniper Breeze Hand Lotion.
