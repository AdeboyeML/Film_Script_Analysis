    BILL BABOWSKY ("BB"), a wiry, dapper-looking man in his
    mid-thirties, is circling a baby blue Cadillac. A
    SALESMAN follows on his heels.
                             SALESMAN
               She's a beauty.
                              BB
                       (looking at Salesman)
               Who?

                                SALESMAN
               What?
                             BB
               Who's the beauty?
                                SALESMAN
               The car.
                             BB
               I thought maybe you saw some chick
               walking by. I lost my concentration.
               Why do they call cars 'she'? They
               never say 'he'... always 'she.'
    The Salesman shrugs his shoulders.      BB walks around the
    Cadillac.
                             BB
               Very nice... very nice.

    NORA, a rather plain, but attractive woman in her early
    30's, is yelling up the stairs.
                             NORA
               You're a sick man! Sick! Do ya
               hear me?! Do ya hear me?!

    Peeking around the bannister from the second floor is
    ERNEST TILLEY, also in his 30's, handsome in a boyish
    way.
                            TILLEY
              Who's sick?
                            NORA
              Who do ya think I'm screaming at?
              How many of you are there up there?
              There's only you, and you're a sick
              human being.
                            TILLEY
                     (quietly, coming
                      down a few steps)
              Where's my white on white shirt?
              The nice one, you know.
                            NORA
              It's like yelling through a wall
              to you. I'm carrying on about
              what a disgusting human being you
              are, and all you want to know is
              where your white on white shirt is.
                            TILLEY
              Yes, the one with the permanent
              stays.

    BB is now sitting in a cubicle in the office with the
    Salesman, going over the contract on the car.
                            BB
              Now don't try to hustle me here
              ... you know what I mean. I hate
              being hustled. Give me an honest
              price, not one of your 'special'
              deals... give me an honest price.
              Do I make myself clear?
                            SALESMAN
              Now, how much are you willing to
              pay?
                            BB
              There ya go... there ya go...
              you're doing it... you're doing
              one of those hustle numbers.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                            SALESMAN
              I'm just trying to get an idea
              how much you're willing to pay.
                            BB
              Four dollars... I want to pay four
              dollars a month.
                            SALESMAN
              That's not an honest answer.
                            BB
              What do ya want to hear? That I'd
              love to pay three hundred and fifty
              a month... is that what you want to
              hear? Tell me how much you want me
              to pay and I'll tell you how much
              I'll pay, but don't do a hustle on
              me... I don't like that. How much
              do I want to pay? I'd like to pay
              nothing!

5   EXT. TILLEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                     5
    Tilley's leaving the house with his tie undone around
    his white on white shirt. He carries his sports jacket,
    and Nora is standing at the door yelling at him.
                            NORA
              You're being unreasonable.     You
              don't even want to listen.
                            TILLEY
              I don't know what I did... I got
              no idea. If it's my fault, I'm
              sorry... I'm sorry. I can do no
              better than that. A full
              unconditional apology.
    Tilley walks down the steps of the house and goes to his
    car -- a Cadillac. He gets inside, STARTS the ENGINE and
    pulls away. Nora remains on the porch watching the car
    ... one lonely figure in a neighborhood of hundreds of
    duplicate houses.

              If you even have the smallest
              problem, call me personally and
              I'll just shoot you straight into
              the service department.
                            BB
              And I get a loaner if the car's
              got to stay?
                            SALESMAN
              As we discussed, you get a car if
              the car has to be kept overnight.
                            BB
              I get a loaner?
    The Salesman nods.

    He drives along, mumbling to himself.
                            TILLEY
              She's gonna drive me to my grave...
              I'm headed to my grave... the
              woman's driving me insane... it's
              not supposed to happen this way.
    He starts moving his head -- stretching his neck from
    right to left.
                            TILLEY
              It's not even eleven o'clock
              and my neck is stiffening up.
    He juts his jaw out.
                            TILLEY
              My neck's tight... it's tight.

    BB gets into the shiny, baby-blue Cadillac, puts it in
    reverse and starts to back out of the car lot.

                                                             5.

     Tilley is doing neck exercises, rolling his head from
     left to right as he drives. He sees a red light ahead
     and starts to slow down, continuing to roll his head.

10   EXT. BB'S CADILLAC - DAY                                10
     BB sees the light is red and starts to back into the

     Tilley rolls his head back as he slows to 15 miles an
     hour.

     going to stop.

14   EXT. STREET - DAY                                       14
     Tilley's Cadillac and BB's Cadillac CRASH into one
     another. The entire right rear of BB's shiny, baby-blue
     Cadillac is smashed. Both men are shocked and momen-
     tarily confused. After a beat, both Tilley and BB bolt
     from their cars. Tilley looks at his buckled hood. BB
     races up to Tilley's face.
                             BB
               Are you a lunatic? Can't you see
               I'm trying to back out of this
               lot? There's a red light, you
               shoulda stopped.
                             TILLEY
               Me? What are you, crazy? You
               just want to back into the middle
               of the street like that. A man's
               just driving along and you back
               into the middle of the street.
               What kind of driving is that?
               What kind of driving?

                 a space for myself... that's
                 what I'm doing, in order to get
                 into the street... that's
                 something ya do!

                 bolted out of no place... bolted
                 out of nowhere.
                               BB
                 Bolted! At six miles an hour I'm
                 bolting into the street! You
                 schmuck! You schmuck!
     He moves toward Tilley.
                               TILLEY
                 Back away from me, do ya hear me?
                 Back away from me.
                              BB
                 Back away? You want me to back
                 away? I'll back away.
     He turns to walk away from Tilley, walks and then turns
     back and kicks in the headlight of Tilley's car.
                               TILLEY
                 You're a fucking lunatic!
     He goes for BB, jumps him and they both fall on to the
     trunk of BB's car. People have started to gather and
     immediately jump in and pull BB and Tilley apart.

                               BB
                 You're a madman! Smashes into
                 me, attacks me... the man is
                 crazy!
     People continue to pull them apart.
                               MAN #1
                 Come on now, calm down, calm down.
     He holds BB's arms. Another MAN grabs for Tilley and
     tries to pull him off BB.
                               MAN #2

               guy?   Backs in front of me, and
               then  kicks my headlight in...
               and  I'm crazy. You lunatic!
     Tilley makes another jump for BB.    Again, people try
     pulling them apart.
                             BB
               You're going to prison. Death!
               Death! They're going to give
               you death!

     BB looks at his brand new Cadillac with the smashed-in
     side.
                             BB
               Car only has one sixteenth of a
               mile, and I've been hit.
     He turns back and looks at Tilley.
                             BB
               I'm gonna get even with you,
               you son of a bitch... I'm gonna
               get even with you. This is no
               ordinary traffic accident.
                             TILLEY
               You want to drive a Cadillac,
               learn how to drive. You want
               to get even with somebody? You
               picked the wrong person to get
               even with. Nobody backs into
               traffic, smashes my car and
               says they want to get even.
               I'm gonna get even!

               Ben Cartwright had a colored guy
               stay overnight at the Ponderosa?
     MOUSE, who is picking his teeth with a matchbook, squints
     at Sam with an investigative look.
                             MOUSE
               Did he know this guy personally?
                             SAM
               No... he was just passing through,
               asked if he could stay over, and
               Ben Cartwright said 'sure thing.'
               It doesn't make any sense... he
               invites a strange colored guy in...
               invited him in to stay. Is that
               crazy or what? If a colored guy
               came to my door and said 'can I
               stay the night,' I'd tell him
               'get the fuck out of here'! It's
               nothing personal, mind you.
                             MOUSE
               You're not a bigot, is that what
               you're telling us?

               If you're not, how come you're
               making such a big thing out of it?

                             SAM
               It's the fact the Ben Cartwright's
               on the Ponderosa... he's in the
               middle of nowhere. It's not like
               he's living on Reisterstown Road
               with houses all around... we're
               talking about the West here. It's
               the idea that a strange guy comes
               to the door in the middle of the
               West. It doesn't make sense,
               that's all I'm saying.
                             MOUSE
               Come on... you're a bigot, that's

     He starts walking to the booth where the other tin men
     are. On his way he yells over to the waitress.

               Florence, eggs and the toast,

     FLORENCE, who doesn't have too much energy, calls back
     to Tilley.

               Not too gooey.     Coffee right
               away.
     She trails the last word. Sam is still talking about
     his problem with "Bonanza."

                             SAM
               I just don't believe that 'Bonanza'
               is an accurate description of the
               West. I say no more.
     Tilley slips into the booth next to Sam.    He indicates
     for Sam to give him more room.

               home, 'cos he'd have to go over
               the figures with the salesman...

     BB and Moe are sitting on a sofa sipping coffee, looking
     as if they were members of the family. The Housewife and
     her HUSBAND are sitting across the dining room table from

               and make sure we  can hold up the
               issue until this  job is completed?
               This house really  could be a

               working on a Saturday? 'Cos if
               my crew can work on Saturday
               next, that'll free my guys up
               on Monday. Yeah, that'll really
               help me out on another job.
               Anyway, if we can do that, I
               think I'll be able to knock off
               three hundred and fifty dollars
               from the job. You see, I've
               got an overlapping situation on

     BB backs his car halfway up the street. He stops in the
     driveway of the Pimlico Hotel parking lot.

     We hear the    sound of BREAKING GLASS. Tilley responds to
     the sound.     He looks out of the glass doors and sees BB
     kicking in    the headlight of his car. BB runs back

               It's that fucking lunatic again.
     He races out of the door of the hotel towards BB's car
     which pulls away and speeds down the street. Several

     watching the car disappear.

     ANOTHER ANGLE
     Moe, Looney and Carly are talking to STANLEY FRANKS, a
     young guy in his early 20's. He is dressed in the "Ivy
     League" look of the times.
                             MOE
                      (to Stanley)
               Sure you wanna get into the tin
               game?
                             STANLEY
               Money's good, I understand.
                             LOONEY
               Lot of crazy people you're gonna
               run into when you're knocking on
               those doors. Hermits that don't
               see the outside world, Jehovah's
               Witnesses that try and sell you
               the Bible at the same time you're
               trying to sell them tin. People
               that are just lonely and want to
               have conversations.
                             CARLY
               Every time you step in that door,
               you've got to be fast on your feet.
                              STANLEY
               Interesting.
                              MOE
                       (quizzing Stanley)
               What's the best way to qualify
               a mark?

                              STANLEY
               What?
                             MOE
               How do you know if you can get the
               upper hand? How do you know if
               you're dealing with a guy who's in
               an inferior position to you, or
               superior position? How do you
               know?
     Moe puts Stanley on the defensive.
                             STANLEY
               You just have to talk and feel
               your way.

               Quick way... get a book of
               matches out of your pocket to
               light your cigarette... you drop
               the matches on the floor.
                               STANLEY
                        (looks puzzled)
               Yeah.
                             MOE
               Guy bends down to pick up the
               matches for you, you got a mark...
               you got this guy in your pocket.
               If he looks to you to pick it up,
               you've got a long, hard, tough
               sell on your hands.
     BB walks over to the guys, having just poured himself
     some coffee.
                             BB
               You want to get in good with these
               people... you want to win their
               confidence? Good thing to try...
               get a five dollar bill, take it
               out when the guy's not looking,
               drop it on the ground. Guy looks
               back, pick it up, hand it to him
               and say, 'Mr. Blah blah, you
               musta dropped this five dollar
               bill on the ground.' Two things
               happen... he says, 'It's not
               mine,' you say, 'Musta been, 'cos
               it's certainly not mine,' or the
               guy takes it. Right away this
               guy is thinking you must be one
               hell of a nice guy... you're in.
               You start chipping away... you
               start getting inside those people.
     Stanley is quite taken by their information.   BB puts
     his cup down and grabs his coat.
                             BB
               Come on, Moe, let's split.

               Yeah, we'd better go, too. Come
               on, Stanley.

                       hanging behind)

     BB and Moe approach BB's Cadillac. He sees that all the
     windows have been smashed in. Moe looks to BB. Looney
     walks up from behind.
                             LOONEY
               What? You got a special bargain
               when you bought this car? They
               come cheaper without windows?
     BB reaches into the car and picks up a handful of broken
     glass. He tosses it up and down in his hands.
                             BB
               This guy's looking to play tit
               for tat. That's not my game.
               I'm gonna play hardball.

     Looney just nods for them to go, and they start to walk

     ball drops into the pocket. Tilley throws down his pool
     stick. We  see his partner is Mouse. Gil sits in a chair

     nickel in the juke box. A RECORD     slips into position,
     and Harry Belafonte's "Banana Boat    Song" begins. Mouse,
     in unison with the record, sings,    and is totally caught
     up in the song.

               From the IRS. I never even
               remember seeing it. I must have
               left it with my other bills. I
               wonder what it is?
                             SAM
               Maybe it's a refund check.
     Tilley opens the envelope and looks at the document.

               Hum... says here that they haven't
               received my 1962 taxes. They seem
               to be saying that they didn't
               get my check for four thousand
               dollars.
                            SAM
               What? It must be a clerical
               error.
                             TILLEY
               I can't believe they spend all
               that time and energy to write to
               me... to single me out.
                             SAM
               What are you talking about?   You

               You know what would be a lot more
               healthy and satisfying is to get
               yourself a chicken... just pop it
               in the oven for a couple of hours
               with a little bit of seasoning on
               it. Makes a good meal, and you
               can make sandwiches with the

               watching a chicken cook.

               I'm riding high... twenty-seven

               free'... the man went insane...
               lost control of himself... his
               wife and children are out on the
               street!

               Sometimes I'm brilliant... I'm

55   INT. CORRAL CLUB - ANGLE ON MOE AND BB - NIGHT               55
     They're looking at the girls, sizing them up.
                             BB
                      (pointing to a
                       girl)
               See that one, if you were married
               to that one two weeks you'd have
               to put your head out of the window
               for air... this one smothers.
                      (looking over to
                       another girl)
               That one is the kind that can't
               live without you...
                      (whiney voice)
               ... 'Where were you? When will
               you be home?'
                             MOE
               I should get out of here. I told
               my wife I'd be home early tonight.
                               BB
               Christ!    It's not even one o'clock
               yet.
                      (beat)
               How long you been married now?
               What is it? Twelve... twelve
               years?
                               MOE
               Sixteen.
                             BB
               Holy God! Sixteen years? What
               do you think? Is it worth it?

                               MOE
               Yeah.
                             BB
               Why do you think?
                             MOE
               It's hard to answer.
                      (beat)
               Seems better than if she wasn't
               there.
                              BB
               Quite a recommendation... can't
               wait to do it.
     He laughs.

     Tilley and Sam come through the door and walk over to
     the bar.

                      (to Sam)
               Scotch straight up?
                             SAM
               Yeah.

               Scotch straight up and a rum
               and Coke for me.
     He looks around the room at the women.
                             TILLEY
               Looks like there's good action
               here tonight.
                             SAM
               What do you expect, it's half
               price night for divorced women.
               The place is hopping.

     ANGLE ON BB AND MOE
                             BB
               Look how much more complicated
               things are now. There used to
               be a time you met a girl, you
               courted and then you got married
               and lived happily ever after.
               Now, see that one over there...
                      (he points to
                       girl at a table)
               ... that's Helen Armstrong...
               maiden name used to be Tudor.
               Get this, she dated Charlie
               Rider when I was in high school,
               seemed like they were together
               forever. They broke up, she
               started to go with Lenny
               Mardigian, they got married,
               she's Helen Mardigian. That
               goes on two years... three years,
               something like that.

               They divorce, dates Billy Small
               for a couple of years, lives with
               John Isaacs for a year, marries
               Tommy Selnini... that marriage
               goes in the toilet, but fast.
               Now she's dating Charlie Rider
               who was divorced by Evelyn Chartoff
               who used to be Evelyn Gage before
               that.

               So much for relationships.


     ANGLE ON SAM AND TILLEY AT BAR
                             SAM
               I'm beginning to believe in God.
                             TILLEY
               You were never one of those
               atheists, were you?
                             SAM
               No, I'm not saying that, but I'm
               beginning to give God more thought.
                             TILLEY
               So, what did you do? Have some
               kind of religious experience?
                             SAM
               I tell ya... I took my wife for
               lunch yesterday... we went and
               had some smorgasbord, and it
               kind of happened.
                             TILLEY
               You found God at the smorgasbord?
                              SAM
               Yeah.
                             TILLEY
               Sam, people have religious
               experiences like on a lake or
               when they go up into the mountains,
               that kind of thing.
                             SAM
               Maybe... but I had mine in a
               smorgasbord.

               Sam, you're too much.
                             SAM
               I went to get myself a salad
               and I started to see all these
               vegetables, you know how they
               have all those salads laid out
               so that when it's time to get to
               the main course you won't eat too
               much... that scam to get you
               filled up so you don't eat too
               much chicken and beef and all
               that other stuff.

                             TILLEY
               Yeah, yeah... I get the point.
               So?
                             SAM
               So I see celery, I see the lettuce,
               tomatoes, cauliflower... and I
               think, all these things come out
               of the ground... they just grow
               out of the ground. They had corn
               -- out of the ground... radish --
               out of the ground. You say to
               yourself, how can all these things
               come out of the ground? You know
               what I'm talking about? All these
               things are out of the ground.
                               TILLEY
                        (not understanding)
               Yeah.

                              SAM
               I mean, how can that be? It just
               happened that way? And I'm not
               even getting into the fruits...
               I'm just dealing with vegetables
               right now. With all those things
               coming out of the earth, there
               must be a God.
                             TILLEY
                      (looking at Sam)
               I'm not getting the same religious
               effect that came over you. I
               don't know why, but I don't feel
               like running to a church to pray
               right this second.

     Both BB and Tilley weave their way through the crowd to
     get to one another. In the confusion of all the people,
     they both go right past one another and then look around
     for one another. They see that they're in the opposite

56   EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                               56
     Tilley and BB   come out of the club and start to look for
     a place in the   lot where there's some room to fight. The
     crowd eagerly   follows right on the heels of BB and Tilley.
     BB and Tilley   both take off their sports jackets.
                             BB

               What is this? What is this crowd
               here? We're charging admission?
                             TILLEY
               Back away... give me some elbow
               room.

     BB and Tilley both take up  fighting stances and circle
     one another looking to take  a shot. A police car pulls
     into the lot. The sound of   the tires on the gravel
     catches Moe's attention and  he sees it's the police.

               Police!
     Tilley and BB immediately drop their guards and lean

     heads into the club, the other cop stays behind in the

     is so nearby.

     stop and all we can see are the lit candles. We hear
     a huge chorus from all of the Secretaries in the

               Surprise!!!
     Lights go on again, and we see a group of GIRLS gathered
     around the cake placed on one of the desks. At the
     center of the group is ADA, in her late twenties, and
     very pregnant.

     in the b.g. -- it is "IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE

     The remains of Chinese food in containers are alongside.

     They dance quietly for a moment.

               Every time I listen to Sinatra, I
               always remember when I used to
               work in Atlantic City back in the
               late 40's... you know, a busboy
               job... Sinatra used to play at the
               500 Club, and we used to take our
               dates and say, 'Hey, you wanna
               go and hear Sinatra?' Then we'd
               just lean on the door of the club
               in the alley and listen to the
               music. I think the girls were
               looking for something a bit more
               uptown.
     Nora laughs.

               I'd go with you and lean against
               the door.
     They dance for a bit and look at one another. He leans
     toward her, holds her tight and kisses her. Then the
     RECORD STICKS on the words "that's the time"... "that's
     the time"... "that's the time"... BB slips off one of his
     loafers, while still embracing Nora, kicks it so that it
     hits the side of the record table. The RECORD SLIPS
     a little and continues to play correctly.

     His office    is equally messy and thrown together as
     everything    else in the Gibraltar offices. As Tilley
     closes the    door, his coffee, which is filled to the top
     of his cup,    spills over the top and starts to burn his
     hand.

     An area has been set up for hearings to take place. This
     seems to be a temporary headquarters until something sub-
     stantial can be worked out. There are boxes and crates
     all over. There's a long table with a number of commis-
     sioners behind it, and a defense table a little way
     across the room. MICROPHONES are being used, and the
     sound BOOMS -- ECHOING off the walls. A small gallery of
     people are watching the proceedings.

               that  you would be giving free
               storm  windows with the job?

               Yes. That you would provide a
               free set of storm windows with
               the sale of aluminum siding.
                             MURRAY
               No, sir. I wouldn't be able to
               make any money if I was giving
               away storm windows. My cost of a

               windows.

               The storm windows, as I can recall,
               was not an issue. I mentioned
               that I thought the storm windows
               would cut down on their heating
               bill, and that they would obviously
               enhance the look of the house with
               the aluminum siding work we were
               going to do.
                             MASTERS (O.S.)
               So, you weren't dangling a free
               set of storm windows as a come-on
               to selling them the aluminum siding
               job? Because it says here, and

               Tilley, this is insane. You're
               picking horses because you think
               you're clairvoyant or something.

               Sam, I'm  not doing too well by
               checking  the stats, so why not.
               I put my  hand to my forehead, I
               see a one  -- Mr. Motor in the
               second...  twenty bucks.
     They both look toward the track, the horses race to the

               she was sleeping on my side of
               the bed. In my life I  never got
               out of bed on the left side...

               I got close once up in the

               Dorian. For a week we  were
               together, but it wasn't the
               same because she always went to
               her room to change and do all
               that stuff. She didn't  have
               things in my room.

     BB gives a big sigh.

               were setting me up with your

               You know what I think you should
               do now. Why don't you pull some
               files... some files that were
               completed, others that went
               unsold, and I'll have somebody

                work with you. I'm off to Florida
                at the end of the week for some
                sun and fun. Let Stanley work
                with you, and when I get back,

                get on your nerves. He's a lousy
                pool player and he can't play
                cards for shit, but...

                             TILLEY
                IRS? They're not gonna leave me
                alone!
                              SAM
                Home Improvement Commission.
      With those words there's a genuine moment of concern from
      all of the tin men -- even Mouse stops singing. Tilley
      picks up the envelope and pulls out the letter.
                              TILLEY
                We've got to appear?
                              SAM
                I think that's the gist of what
                they're saying.
      Gil looks over Tilley's shoulder at the letter.    Mouse
      comes over.
                               MOUSE
                Holy Christ!
                              TILLEY
                Can't we just ignore it? How do
                they know we got the letter.

                What do you think, Sam?
                              SAM
                I dunno... I don't know what
                they've got.
                              TILLEY
                Why is this happening? Am I
                paranoid or something? I mean,
                why is this happening? The
                government is after me... the
                state is after me... Mr. Marengay
                ... somebody is always after me.
                What the hell's going on here?
                I'm just this guy. What's the
                big deal? They can't get along
                without me? The government can't
                operate unless they've got Tilley's
                money... the Commission's after
                my job! This shit's driving me
                insane! All the lying, thieving,
                stealing corporations in this
                world, and the IRS takes the
                time to come for me? There's
                billions of dollars out there
                but they've got to come and get
                Tilley's four thousand dollars!
                       (turning to Mouse)
                Turn off the fucking Belafonte
                song now, or I'm gonna break the
                goddamn machine!!

      Ruthie moves off. BB takes a shot of whiskey and downs
      it, and then drinks some beer.

      He holds up his shot glass towards the bartender, and
      the bartender fills it up.

                              BB
                Harry Apel... Dandy Flynn... those
                guys had good lines, but they
                burned themselves out too fast.
                Best? Moe's the best... the best
                there ever was. If he's in the
                door, he's got a sale. The best
                closer ever.

                What's some of the hustles he
                used to pull?
      BB downs another shot glass of whisky.
                              BB
                God damn Nora... God damn Nora!

                putting up with things I never
                put up with in my life. I mean,
                give me a break... give me a
                break, woman.
      Stanely wants to get back to the topic of best tin man.

      Tilley throws another egg at BB and hits him in the head
      again. Egg yolk drips down BB's face. He tries to get
      off the floor, but can't.

      A POLICE OFFICER is interrogating Tilley behind the main
      desk of the police station. There's a lot of activity
      during this interaction... people coming and going.
                              TILLEY
                A guy breaks into my house and I'm
                being charged with assault? It
                makes no sense...
                              POLICE OFFICER
                       (with pencil and paper)
                Let's get it down right. The guy
                broke into your house, you hit him
                in the head with a gun, went to
                the refrigerator, took out eggs
                and tomatoes and threw them at
                him.
                              TILLEY
                I was defending myself... he was
                stealing from me.
                              POLICE OFFICER
                It doesn't sound like defense to
                me.
                              TILLEY
                I wanted to humiliate the guy.
                Here I am, out busting my ass all
                day making a decent living, I come
                home, and some schmuck is trying
                to steal from me.
                              POLICE OFFICER
                So you hit him with a gun, and
                pelted him with eggs and tomatoes?

                              TILLEY
                If I had some soup I would have
                thrown soup at him... is there
                any law you can't throw eggs?
                              POLICE OFFICER
                Mr. Babowski claims he didn't
                break into your house.
                              TILLEY
                What did I do? Invite him in so
                that I could throw eggs at him?

                Maybe Mr. Babowski intended to
                break into your house, but these
                circumstances of the guy being
                pelted with eggs and tomatoes is
                something we need to look into.
      Tilley shrugs his shoulders.
                              TILLEY
                He's lucky that he didn't rob me
                last week, 'cos then my wife was
                living at home and we had all
                kinds of things in the fridge...
                I could have thrown barley soup,
                pumpkin pie, candied yams... yeah,
                he got off light.

                breaks into my house and I'm the
                one charged.

                I told you, I wasn't breaking into

                Couple of eggs over,   some hash
                browns, some toast --   toasted
                dark... butter on the   side, large
                grapefruit juice and   some coffee.
      The Waitress writes his order.
                              TILLEY
                On second thought, instead of the
                eggs over, if I ordered soft
                boiled eggs do you take them out
                of the shell or leave them in the
                shells?
      We can see that BB is getting a little irritable.

                We leave them in the shell.
                              TILLEY
                I don't like them that way because
                they get hot in the hand and it's
                hard to scoop the stuff out...
                it's not good... and you get
                little bits of shell in there and
                it doesn't taste good.
                              BB
                Why don't you just order some
                scrambled eggs and be done with
                it... all right?

                I'm getting a little hungry...
                I've got a headache as it is.
                Just order some eggs so some other
                people can have something to eat

      Moe is in bed, still hooked up to tubes. His breathing
      is deliberate and he seems weak. The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS

                Moe, when you decided to marry

                You know, when I saw 'Bonanza' the
                other day, something occurred to
                me. There's those three guys
                living on the Ponderosa and you
                never hear them say anything about
                wanting to get laid. You never
                hear Hoss turn to Little Joe and
                say 'I had such a hard-on when I
                woke up this morning.' You know
                ... they never talk about broads
                ... nothing. Ya never hear Little
                Joe say 'Hey, Hoss, I went into
                Virginia City and saw a girl with
                the greatest ass I ever saw in my
                life.' Ya just see 'em walking
                around the Ponderosa saying, 'Yes,
                Pa,' and 'Where's Little Joe?'
                Nothing about broads. I don't
                think I'm being too picky... at
                least once if they talked about
                getting horny. I don't care if
                you're living on the Ponderosa or
                right here in Baltimore, guys talk

                That's an awful lot for nothing.
                Doesn't sound like good business

                Mr. Boloshevski was ultimately
                charged twenty-four hundred
                dollars for labor, which according
                to our figures is about the average
                cost of an aluminum siding job.

                Twenty-four hundred dollars that
                you charged for labor, is the same
                as if Mr. Boloshevski had purchased
                the aluminum siding and had the
                labor done.
                              TILLEY
                Maybe I'm missing the point here,
                but if he paid twenty-four hundred,
                which is the cost of the job, I
                can't see anything wrong with that.
                I don't know the guy, but I don't
                quite get the problem.

                What we're getting at here... what
                we're trying to stress, is that
                the job was sold under false
                terms. The man didn't win any
                award... he was not getting
                aluminum siding at a special price.
                A clear case of deception was
                involved here.

                What's he talking about? The man
                got the job for twenty-four hundred
                dollars, and that's what it costs
                in aluminum siding.

                deception. Look, if you work in a

                a suit, it looks like shit, but
                you tell him it looks wonderful.

                says what a great suit and the man
                buys it. That's deception as far
                as I can see, but I don't
                understand the deceptiveness that
                you say we're responsible for...

                I don't know what you're talking
                about. I never put my feet up to
                watch TV.

                That's the way you are, Tilley, it

      car, gets in, slams the door and drives off. Tilley

                Thanks for the lift back, BB.
                See ya around.

      Stanley is standing at the filing cabinet going through
      files. He takes some files and puts them to one side.
      Then, satisfied that he's got everything he needs, he
      picks up the files and turns to leave. BB is standing
      at the door watching him.
                              BB
                You know something, Stanley, I
                can always smell a guy who's not
                made of tin.
      He walks over to Stanley.
                              BB
                It's against the law to steal
                files. I could call and have

                You work for the Commission, is
                that it?
      Stan nods "yes."
                              BB
                Doesn't the Commission have
                enough information? They got to
                send out guys like you to spy?

                              STANLEY
                Well, we just started out, and if
                we had some really good hard facts
                of some infractions, it would give
                us a lot of credibility in the
                community.
      BB walks closer to Stanley, looks at him for a second,
      grabs him by his tie and pushes him backwards. Stanley
      crashes into the filing cabinet.
                              BB
                You know what your big problem
                is, Stanley? You're lazy. If
                you want to find out stuff, then
                you dig... you get on the phone...
                you canvas... 'We're from the
                Home Improvement Commission...'
                Go find your leads... that's what
                we do all the time. You're just
                lazy, Stanley. If we're doing
                something wrong, you should
                collect all your evidence.
                Instead, you snoop around...
                steal files. What is this?
                Undercover time? You think
                you're breaking up some big drug
                ring? Is this the Mafia you've
                infiltrated? All you've got here
                is a bunch of guys selling tin

                       (beat)
                You want some files?
      He walks over to the filing cabinet, flips through some
      files and pulls out three files. Stanley has gotten up
      from the floor. BB throws the files down on the desk.

                the business.
      Stanley gathers up the files from the desk.
                              BB
                Go on, get out of here.
      Stanley starts for the door, and turns back.
                              STANLEY
                Why are you doing this?

                it's not    tonight, it's gonna be
                another    time.
      Stanley exits the office. BB picks up the files that
      Stanley had taken out of the filing cabinet, and starts
      to put them back. Then he slams the filing drawers
      closed very hard.

      shot. He carefully strokes the pool cue between his
      fingers, hits the ball, and sinks the shot. He moves
      around the table -- he has a particularly complicated
      shot.
                              BB
                Combination... side pocket.
      The tin men react.   BB hits the ball and sinks it.
                               BB
                That's four.

      He quickly surveys the     table and sees his next shot. He
      hits the ball, it goes     toward the pocket, but bounces
      back slightly, missing     the pocket. Tilley quickly goes
      to work. He sinks his      first shot... his second. He
      makes a difficult shot.
                                  TILLEY
                  Yes, sir!    Yes, sir!
      Tilley    keeps moving around the table, sinking one ball
      after    the other. He's enthusiastic, excited and confi-
      dent.     He sinks another ball, and another. He sinks
      every    ball, then he eyes the eight ball for the coup de
      grace.

                                BB
                         (trying to shake
                          Tilley)
                  You make this one here, and you
                  win.
                                TILLEY
                  Don't I know it... don't I know
                  it!
      He shoots. The eight ball heads for the pocket and
      doesn't make it. It hangs up on the felt about two feet
      from the pocket.
                                  BB
                  Bad break.
      BB quickly goes to work... sinks every one of his balls.
      He eyes the eight ball carefully. Tilley's nervous. A
      couple of the tin men make private side bets whether the
      ball goes or doesn't. BB lines up the shot; he shoots,
      and it misses, hanging up on the lip of the pocket.
                                  TILLEY
                  Tough break.
      Tilley quickly moves and sinks the eight ball.
                                  TILLEY
                  You lose.
                                BB
                  Yeah... that puts an end to one
                  of our differences. Now,
                  concerning you...
                                  TILLEY
                  Yeah?

                              BB
                I'm gonna beat the crap out of
                you. You want it here or do you
                want it outside?
                                TILLEY
                Outside.
      BB turns his back on Tilley to move toward the door.
      Tilley swings with all his might and hits BB in the     back
      of the head. BB almost falls to the ground. Tilley       goes
      to hit him again. BB hits him in the face, knocking      him
      back. Tilley falls back... BB starts to move toward      him.
      The tin men move in.

                              TILLEY
                Stay out of this... this is
                between the two of us.
      BB gets to his feet... the two guys eye one another,
      moving. BB quickly moves with incredible cat-like speed
      with four hits into the stomach, really fast, and one hit
      to Tilley's head. Tilley falls into the rack of pool
      cues, they all fall to the ground. BB goes to jump on
      Tilley. He slips on one of the pool cues and falls to
      the ground.

      ANGLE ON DOOR TO OFFICE
      Wing is standing watching the fight.    He looks disgusted
      ... shakes his head.

      BACK TO TILLEY AND BB

      Tilley moves toward BB. BB hits him hard in the stomach
      again. Tilley keeps coming at BB. He rams him and
      knocks him to the ground. Tilley pushes BB's head onto
      the ground, trying to hit it against the floor. BB gets
      a hand free and hits Tilley hard in the side of the
      head. The tin men have seen enough and jump in and pull
      Tilley and BB apart. AD LIBS: "That's enough, you guys"
      ... "Come on, break it up." BB and Tilley stand up.
      BB brushes his suit down with his hand.
                              BB
                I think our business is finished.
      Tilley just stands watching BB.    BB walks up the steps
      of the pool hall and exits.

      BB drives up to the front of the Superior Aluminum
      Siding building. He stops the car and gets out. He is
      fairly disheveled and has a bruise on his cheek. He
      walks up to the entrance of the building.

137   INT. SUPERIOR ALUMINUM SIDING OFFICE - DAY              137
      Three or four GIRLS are on the phones canvassing for
      sales.
                              GIRL #1
                ... Improves the insulation...

                              GIRL #2
                ... We'll have a representative
                in your area...
      Carly, Cheese and Looney are sitting around a desk drink-
      ing coffee.
                              LOONEY
                ... Danny's an example of that.
                Danny goes into a bar, chicks
                lined up and down the bar. Walks
                up to one and says, 'Honey, would
                you like to fuck?' She'd slap
                him in the face. He'd move down
                to the next girl, say the same
                thing... she'd slap him. Then
                he'd just keep moving down, going
                from one girl to the other.
                Fifteen, maybe sixteen girls
                would tell him to get lost... to
                get the hell out of there...
      BB enters, says "hi" to the Girls, moves to get a
      coffee.
                              LOONEY
                ... Call him names... but he
                doesn't take it personal, you see
                ... he keeps going, and then the
                next girl smiles. He says, 'Why
                don't you buy me a drink'... he
                scores. Every time. He goes
                through a lot of girls, takes a
                lot of slaps in the face, but he
                never takes it personally...
      BB moves over to the guys.

      Bagel walks out of his office and across to NICK, a tin
      man sitting at a desk across from Looney. He hands Nick
      a file.

      Tilley drives into the parking lot of the Pimlico -- he
      heads for a dark corner of the lot where about eight cars
      are parked. As he's about to park his car, he sees Wing
      talking to Masters in the car next to his. Tilley's a
      bit confused, stays in his car watching them. After a
      couple of beats, Wing gets out of the car and heads for
      the Pimlico. Masters drives off. Tilley gets out of
      his car and catches up to Wing.

                  I'm not aware of the section
                  numbers. Sometimes you get a
                  little overzealous in the heat of
                  the sales pitch, that's all.

                  Was it the heat of the sales pitch
                  on February 23rd of this year that

                                TILLEY
                  As I remember, no sale was made
                  concerning those customers.
                                MASTERS
                  It fell out because a loan couldn't
                  be arranged, but the people did
                  agree in principle.
                         (beat)
                  The point that we'd like to stress,
                  is that you misled these people.
                  Told them the job was free. Then
                  you sent in your closer with some
                  cover story about how you had
                  suffered a nervous breakdown, and
                  a sale was ultimately made for
                  twenty-three hundred and seventy-
                  seven dollars. That is misleading
                  and deceptive sales practice.

                        microphone)
                Thank you.
      BB gets up and walks to the back of the  room. He stops
      at the same desk as Tilley, but instead  of going into
      his wallet like Tilley, he just reaches  into his suit
      pocket, pulls out a license document and  tosses it onto
      the table. Then he heads out the door.

      BB walks down the street, making for his car. He sees
      Tilley still standing in the vacant parking space.
      Tilley sees BB. BB stops.
                              BB
                Sorry about your license.
                               TILLEY
                Yeah.   You in there?
                               BB
                Yeah.   They got my license as well.
                              TILLEY
                Sorry to hear it.
                              BB
                What are you doing standing there?

                              TILLEY
                This is where my car used to be.
                               BB
                Stolen?
                              TILLEY
                I.R.S. Fucking bandits! Bandits!
                Thieving sons of bitches!
      BB looks at Tilley for a beat.
                              BB
                You need a ride uptown?
                              TILLEY
                I could use one.

                Come on.
      They cross the street and go toward BB's Cadillac. BB
      gets in the driver's side, Tilley gets in the passenger
      side, and the car pulls out.

                Some bullshit commission, huh?
                       (beat)
                Tell me, where's it written it the
                Constitution that says you can't
                hustle for money? Where's it
                written? It ain't like I went
                into an alley and hit a guy over
                the head with a brick and stole
                his money... not like I broke
                into somebody's house and stole
                his stuff. All I'm doing is
                selling... where's the crime in
                that?
                              BB
                I don't know what the world's
                coming to.
                              TILLEY
                You're telling me. I don't know
                what the world's coming to.

                              BB
                You know what our big crime is?
                We're nickel and dime guys. We're
                small time hustlers.  They got us
                because we're hustling nickels and
                dimes.

                Nickels and dimes. You got a good
                point there, BB. You're right on
                the money with that kind of
                thinking.
      BB stops the car at a stop sign. Something catches BB's
      eye. THROUGH the windshield we see a Volkswagen "beetle"
      going from right to left.

      ANGLE ON BB
      as he watches the car.

                              BB
                Gotta find a new business to get
                into.
                              TILLEY
                New? Very hard to find something
                new to get into.
      BB puts his foot on the gas and starts to drive.
                              BB
                Maybe... maybe not.
                              TILLEY
                Better put on my thinking cap...
                not easy to think of something
                new.

      showing stacks of houses as the Cadillac drives away.
      A MacDonald golden arch is being put in place by a crane
      on the horizon line. It's almost as if it's a rainbow
      across the far side of town, and the Cadillac will drive
      through it.
                              BB (V.O.)
                Believe me, we'll find something.
                It's just a matter of time.
                              TILLEY (V.O.)

                You know, I hear the new Cadillac's
