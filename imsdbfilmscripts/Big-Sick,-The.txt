                           KUMAIL (V.O.)
              Hello. I grew up in Pakistan. And people
              are always asking me, what was that like?
              Really not that different from here. I
              mean we played cricket, which is just a
              spicier version of baseball. And we
              prayed a lot. Well not a lot, just five
              times a day. And we marry someone our
              parents find for us. Arranged marriage,
              you know. For me, it was probably that we
              got episodes of the A-Team a little bit
              later. And by a little bit later, I mean
              we just got episode two. But other than
              that, it was exactly the same.

    INT. TRIPLE DOOR - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT

    Kumail walks into the comedy club as MARY is doing a set
    on stage. CHRIS intercepts Kumail as he walks backstage.

                           CHRIS
              There's no bad crowds dude. Only bad
              comedians.

                           KUMAIL
              You complain about the crowd like all
              the time.

                           CHRIS
              Yeah, but that's when they're really bad.

                           KUMAIL
              So like ninety percent of the time,
              they're really bad?

                           CHRIS
              Will you just watch and give me notes
              tonight? If we both give each other
              notes, I think it would be helpful.

                           KUMAIL
              Your notes are just to add more "fucks"
              into the bit.

                           CHRIS
              Fuck's a funny word. Soft on the top and
              it's hard on the end.

    Mary walks off the stage and sits on the couch next to
    CJ.

                           MARY
              That was truly horrible.

                           KUMAIL
              Hey, that was great.

                           MARY
              No, he didn't even crack a smile. I
              thought I was gonna puke.

                             CHRIS
              Who?

                             MARY
              Bob Dalavan.

                           CHRIS
              Who's Bob Dalaban?

                           CJ
              Bob Dalavan - works for the Montreal
              Comedy Festival, you fuckin' doof.
              Don't you want to get noticed? Move to
              LA? Hang out with Elijah Wood and shit.

    ANDY DODD, the coked-up emcee, appears out of the
    bathroom.

                           DODD
              No one's on stage?

                             MARY
              No!

    Dodd rushes on stage.

                           KUMAIL
              He might have been doing cocaine.

                           CJ
              Was he doing cocaine recreationally?

                           MARY
              A true cokehead.

    Dodd jumps up on stage.

                           DODD (O.S.)
              Now before I bring up the next guy, you
              guys know tonight is Jell-o Shot
              Tuesday! Whooo!! And we all know what
              happens after eight Jell-o shots. We
              urinate all over ourselves and puke.
              Okay, so I'm going to bring up the next
              comic. You know this man.

    Chris slaps his own face.

                           CHRIS
              Confidence. Poise. Smile.

                           Dodd (O.S.)
              Give it up for Mister Chris Jones!


    Chris walks on stage.

                           KUMAIL
              He's like if a serial killer fucked an
              inspirational speaker.

                           CJ
              He's like Daniel Day Lewis except he
              sucks.

                           CHRIS
              Just bought a laser printer. Printed
              out like six lasers so far.

    CJ, Kumail, and Mary watching Chris' set. Andy Dodd
    saunters backstage.

                           KUMAIL
              Hey Dodd. Dalavan's in the crowd
              tonight. Could I do ten?

                           DODD
              No. Five minutes. You put out chairs,
              you get five minutes. You know the
              deal.

                           KUMAIL
              C'mon man. I'll double it up next time.

                            DODD
              No.

    Dodd walks back into the bathroom.

                           KUMAIL
              What are you gonna do in there?

                           DODD
              I'm making up next week's schedule.

                            KUMAIL
              Okay. Cool.



    INT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATER

    CJ is on stage crushing it. Kumail and Mary watch from
    the wings.

                           CJ
              I was in bed with my girlfriend and I was
              trying to mansplain to her that, you
              know, we are on one little rock orbiting
              a star in a galaxy of a billion stars in
              a universe full of a billion galaxies, so
              I forgot your birthday. Who gives a shit?
              You are cosmically over reacting to this.
              Honestly you are being super selfish.
              You're right, but you're selfish.

    Kumail looks out at the crowd. Dalavan enjoys CJ's set.



    INT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATER

    Kumail puts a RECORDER on his stool, presses RECORD and
    starts his set.

                           KUMAIL
              Hey! Have you guys heard of this new drug
              cocktail called cheese? I saw these news
              reports so I looked up what cheese is and
              cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM
              and heroin. So really, it's heroin.
              Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do
              the heroin, it's very powerful. You
              already have heroin.

    Kumail looks to see if Bob Dalavan is laughing. He's not
    there. He's in the back talking to CJ. Fuck.

                          KUMAIL (CONT'D)
                   (pushing through)
             Is Pakistan in the house?!

    O.S. A WOMAN "Woo-hoos!" Kumail looks out at the crowd
    and sees EMILY, late 20's, white with a streak of blue
    in her hair. She sits at a table with a few friends.

                          KUMAIL (CONT'D)
             You're not from Pakistan. I would have
             noticed you.

    She smiles.

    Crowded bar scene after the show. Kumail, Chris, Mary
    and CJ hang out at the bar.

                          CHRIS
             He just gave you Montreal? Like you
             don't have to showcase or audition or
             anything?

                          CJ
             It was too easy. Like I wanted to
             struggle. I wanted a story to be able
             to tell on talk shows and instead,
             like, you guys don't know how hard it
             is not to struggle. It's a struggle
             succeeding effortlessly.

                          MARY
             Did he say anything about me?

                          CJ
             Sure.

                          CHRIS
             What about me?

                          CJ
             Both of you. He said, those guys
             performed...

                          MARY
             I truly hate you, actually.

                          CHRIS
             We all hate you.

    Kumail walks over to Emily and her friend JESSIE, talks
    loud over the music.

                          KUMAIL
             Hi.
6


                          EMILY
              Hi.

                           KUMAIL
              Um, my name is Kumail.

                           EMILY
              Yeah. We know.

                           JESSIE
              We saw you perform.

                           KUMAIL
              Yeah. Now that the niceties are out of
              the way, I have to tell you that when
              you yelled at me, it threw me off. You
              really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's
              so rude.

                           EMILY
              I didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed
              you. It was supportive.

                           KUMAIL
              Okay, that's a common misconception.
              Yelling anything at a comedian is
              considered heckling. Heckling doesn't
              have to be negative.

                           EMILY
              So if I yelled out "You're amazing in
              bed," that would be a heckle?

                           KUMAIL
              Yeah. It'd be an accurate heckle.

                           JESSIE
              Wow. Goodbye!

    Jessie walks away.

                           EMILY
              Don't go! You scared my friend off now.

                           KUMAIL
              What's your name?

                          EMILY
              Emily.

    Kumail writes Emily's name in Urdu on a napkin.

                           KUMAIL
              I want to show you something, Emily.
              This is your name in Urdu.

    Emily picks up the napkin, looks at it.

                           EMILY
              Whoa. Does this move work?

                           KUMAIL
              I've had some minor success with it.

                           EMILY
              Bullshit.



    INT. TRIPLE DOOR BAR - LATER

    Emily and Kumail are still at the bar.

                           KUMAIL
              So you came to a comedy show with your
              friends?

                           EMILY
              Yeah, we're all grad students at U of
              C.

                           KUMAIL
              What are you studying at grad school?

                           EMILY
              I study psychology. I'm going to be a
              therapist.

                           KUMAIL
              Oh so you're gonna sit on a couch and
              ask people, "how did that make you
              feel?"

                           EMILY
              Eventually. Right now I'm doing field
              work with a group of guys convicted of
              domestic violence.

                           KUMAIL
              Jesus.

                           EMILY
              Cheers to that.

                           KUMAIL
              Oh wow. No, don't cheers to that. To
              you becoming a therapist.

                           EMILY
              Great. To me getting my masters. We'll
              start there and then we'll go to the
              rest of it.



    INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - LATER

    Kumail and Emily walk in. It's a typical bachelor pad
    boy house. Milk crates for furniture, mess everywhere,
    no art on the walls. Chris is sitting on the couch
    watching TV.

                           KUMAIL
              So my roommate Chris is probably on the
              couch. He's going to try and start a
              conversation. So no matter what- do not
              engage. Okay? Let's go.

                           CHRIS
              Hi!

    Emily and Kumail walk by Chris avoiding eye contact.
    Kumail closes the bedroom door behind him.

                           CHRIS (CONT'D)
              Good for him.



    INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM- CONTINUOUS

    Kumail's bed is an inflatable air mattress. There are
    clothes everywhere.

                           KUMAIL
              Do you want to watch a movie?

                           EMILY
              Sure. Should I just, put my stuff down?
              Or...

                           KUMAIL
              Yeah, I would say it's safe. You know
              what, go for that area. I cleaned that
              earlier this year.

    Kumail points to a corner of his room covered in dirty
    clothes.

                           EMILY
              Should I take my shoes off or is this a
              shoes on bed?

                           KUMAIL
              No, it's a shoes off bed. I have strict
              rules.

    Emily crawls onto the air mattress.

                           EMILY
              Oh wow. That's totally an inflated
              mattress.

                           KUMAIL
              Yeah. Did you think it would be a flat
              inflatable mattress?

                           EMILY
              I did think it might be an actual
              mattress.

                           KUMAIL
              Well air mattresses are actual
              mattresses. You're being bigoted towards
              air based comfort items.

    Kumail picks up the remote and turns on the TV. Night of
    the Living Dead is playing.

                           KUMAIL (CONT'D)
              Night of The Living Dead?

                           EMILY
              Sure, I haven't ever seen that movie.

                           KUMAIL
              Okay, so basically the dead start rising.
              And the good guys, um...

    They eye each other flirtatiously. Laugh. Lean in and
    kiss.

     INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Kumail and Emily post-coital.

                            EMILY
               What are these scars?

                            KUMAIL
               Oh, they're a smallpox vaccination.

                            EMILY
               I thought only old people had those.

                            KUMAIL
               Well I'm from Pakistan. We're still
               fighting some battles you guys have
               already won.

                            EMILY
               What were you like in high school? Were
               you like, super funny? Were you really
               smart?

                            KUMAIL
               I was very shy. They called me
               chashmullee.

                            EMILY
               What is that?

                            KUMAIL
               It roughly translates to "dweeb." I'll
               show you a picture.

     Kumail flips through his phone and produces his old high
     school photo, shows it to her.

                           EMILY
              Of you in high school? Oh my god!

                             KUMAIL
              Boom.

                             EMILY
              No.

                           KUMAIL
              And I'm thinking I'm killing it right
              now.

                           EMILY
              What inspired this hair cut?

                             KUMAIL
              Hugh Grant.

                           EMILY
              Oh no. And you're so serious.

                           KUMAIL
              I read in an interview with Hugh Grant,
              he said he doesn't smile because it
              makes his face look fat. So I didn't
              smile in pictures for many years. What
              were you like in high school? Were you
              voted... Most Sexy?

                           EMILY
              No. I was voted "Most Noticeable."

                             KUMAIL
              That's good.

                           EMILY
              No. It's really not good. I had acne,
              and I was a Goth and I had this
              terrible perm. The kids called me
              Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually
              I do know why, it's because they
              thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I
              think I'm done with this subject. In
              fact, I think I'm gonna go home.

     Emily gets up, pulling the blanket with her to hide her
     body. Kumail holds onto it, stopping her progress.

                           KUMAIL
              Wait we haven't even had sex again yet.
12


     She tugs the blanket, he lets go. She dresses behind it.

                            EMILY
               No. No. I'm really not that kind of
               girl. I only have sex once on a first
               date. Plus a hand job.

                            KUMAIL
               Well I haven't had that yet!

     Emily laughs.

                            EMILY
               You don't get that because you made fun
               of me.

                            KUMAIL
               What is happening right now? What are you
               doing?

                            EMILY
               I'm changing under this blanket.

                            KUMAIL
               I've seen everything. Do you remember, we
               were just having sex?

                            EMILY
               Yeah, but you were in the throes of
               passion then. Listen, I had a really nice
               time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna
               call an Uber and go home.

     Emily pulls out her PHONE, calls an Uber. Kumail's phone
     makes a noise. They exchange a look.

                            KUMAIL
               Your driver will be ready as soon as he
               puts on his pants.

                            EMILY
               Were you available for rides while we
               were fucking?

                            KUMAIL
               Yeah, but I only looked a couple of
               times.



     INT. KUMAIL'S CAR - LATER

     Kumail Ubers Emily home. Emily sits in the back.
13


                  KUMAIL
     So. Maybe I'll run into you at the club
     sometime and we can grab a drink?

                  EMILY
     I'm not really - I know this sounds
     like a line - but I'm not really dating
     right now. I have a lot of school and
     work and just a lot on my plate.

                  KUMAIL
     That's perfect because I'm not really
     dating right now either. I actually
     have a pretty strict two-day rule where
     I can't see someone more than two days
     in a row. So since we hung out for two
     days, if I were to see you again, which
     I won't because you're not dating, I'm
     not dating, I wouldn't be able to see
     you until Monday.

                  EMILY
     We haven't hung out for two days. We've
     hung out for about five hours. Just to
     like, be totally clear.

                  KUMAIL
     Yesterday and today. Cause it's after
     midnight, today is actually tomorrow.
     Earlier tonight was yesterday. So two
     days.

                  EMILY
     You see, I don't date time nerds, so that
     really takes you off the table.

                  KUMAIL
     That works out, because I am a hard
     core time nerd.

                  EMILY
     Yeah, I can tell.

                  KUMAIL
     I'm like, very strict about AM/PM
     stuff.

                  EMILY
     So wait, just to establish, what did we
     just decide?

                  KUMAIL
     We decided we aren't ever going to see
     each other again.
14


                            EMILY
               Great. I'm glad we're on the same page.



     INT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS DINING ROOM - BRUNCH

     Kumail is eating brunch with his father, AZMAT, his
     mother SHARMEEN, his brother, NAVEED, and his sister-in-
     law, FATIMA.

                            Azmat
               Look at these jeans, Kumi. They're from
               Citizens of Humanity, that's the
               brand's name. Touch them. They're so
               soft.

                            KUMAIL
               I don't want to touch your jeans.

                            AZMAT
               They're like sweatpants. You should be
               stylish like your father. It's not very
               difficult. Just observe me.

                            NAVEED
               Get some Daddy Style.

                            SHARMEEN
               Kumi, why don't you grow a beard? Not
               like Naveed's, just a small one.

                            AZMAT
               Maybe like mine, small and stylish.

                            SHARMEEN
               Kumi, I've been thinking, you know, why
               you don't enroll for LSAT now?

                            KUMAIL
               Yeah sorry, Ma. I haven't done it yet.
               I like that you bring it up as though
               you've never brought it up before.

                            NAVEED
               How's the stand-up coming Bhai?

                            KUMAIL
               It's going fine.

                            SHARMEEN
               Since when are you someone to stand-up?
               You know who I think should stand up is
               Malala. She has something to say.
15


                 NAVEED
     Ma-la-la.


                  KUMAIL
     She does open mics and she crushes. Lot
     of ethnic material, which I think is a
     crutch, and that one story gets a lot of
     play, but -

                  FATIMA
     You should be on that show Saturday Night
     Live!

                 NAVEED
     SNL!

                  KUMAIL
     That's a great idea. I should e-mail
     them, I don't know why I hadn't thought
     of that.

                  AZMAT
     You know, I hacked into your Cousin
     Rehan's Facebook account-

                  KUMAIL
     You hacked into it?

                  AZMAT
     Yeah, they were not accepting my friend
     request so I had to hack into it and I
     discovered he and that white woman he is
     living with are having a baby -

                  KUMAIL
     They're married.

                  AZMAT
     Yeah, whatever. And then I hacked into
     Tumblr and I discovered that they named
     him Davé. Can you imagine?

                  KUMAIL
     Dave. It's probably Dave.

                  ALL
     Ah, Dave. Yes, Dave.

                  SHARMEEN
     Very, very, very sad. No one is going to
     visit that baby. That baby, mark my
     words, will grow up without a family.

                            FATIMA
               It's like he's dead. Or worse.

                            SHARMEEN
               It's very sad. Kumi, go pray now so we
               can eat ice cream. Go! The ja-namaz is
               downstairs.

                            NAVEED
               Hurry up yaar. Ice cream.

     Kumail leaves the room.



     INT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS BASEMENT- DAY

     Kumail sets his stop watch for five minutes. He unfolds
     a FOLDED UP PRAYER MAT, stands beside it, looks on his
     phone. Kumail's stopwatch goes off. He folds up his mat.



     INT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS DINING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER

     Kumail is back. Everyone is eating ice cream.

                            AZMAT
               My mother used to make best kulfi. Your
               grandmother.

                            KUMAIL
               I think ice cream is better than kulfi.

                            KUMAIL
               I'm guessing it's a young, single
               Pakistani woman who just happened to be
               driving by our house, which is in a cul-
               de-sac and I'm also guessing that the
               phrase "dropped in" will be said in the
               next ten seconds.

               Here, Kumail. For your files. Your X-

               you're still not that good at it!

               Ha. Ha. Ha.

                            KUMAIL
               You brought your A-game with Naveed, but
               then with me, you're kind of just phoning
               it in a little bit.

                            SHARMEN
               Again with the comedy, the comedy. All
               the time with the comedy. Be serious!

                            KUMAIL
               I am serious! That's why I want to help

               So, are you ever going to let me sit in
               the front seat?

                            KUMAIL
               No, I'm a professional. And you're paying
               for this ride.

                            EMILY
               I don't want to pay for this ride! It's
               surging right now.

                            KUMAIL
               Yeah, sorry. You shouldn't have typed in

               Okay. The year is 1969. MGM has had a
               string of failures. So, it turns to its
               most bankable star, Vincent Price.

                            EMILY
               Is this your compatibility test? Like,
               the way people are with Vonnegut or The
               Big Lebowski?

                            KUMAIL
               No! Just watch the movie. And take it
               seriously.

                            EMILY
               I'm going to love it. I love it when men
               test me on my taste.

                            KUMAIL
               I just want to share this movie with you,
               so I don't know why you're reading into-

                            EMILY
               How many women have you shown this movie
               to?

                           KUMAIL
               Zero.

                            EMILY
               How many women have you shown a B Horror
               movie to on like, a third date.

                            KUMAIL
               This is not a B horror movie.

     Emily laughs.

                            KUMAIL (CONT'D)
               Okay, you ready? Just close your eyes
               cause when the menu comes up, there's
               some spoilers in the menu.

                            EMILY
               I'm ready, I'm ready!

                            KUMAIL
               Ok, I'll hit play.

     LATER, Kumail checks out Emily's reaction, she doesn't
     seem into it.

                           KUMAIL (CONT'D)
               Watch!
20

               Shhhhhh! Watch this part.

                            EMILY
               Stop watching me!

     Emily yawns.

                            KUMAIL
               No! Are you tired? We can watch it later.

                            EMILY
               I just have that weird yawning thing that
               happens, when you're watching a really
               boring film.

                            KUMAIL
               It's not boring! Wait for it to kick in.
               The plot kicks in really soon.

     LATER, Kumail and Emily make out. In the background,
     Vincent Price exacts his revenge.



     EXT. EMILY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

     Kumail walks Emily to her front door.

                            EMILY
               That was fun. Thanks for the ride home,
               but we gotta stop doing this.

                           KUMAIL
               Yeah.

                            EMILY
               I know I've said that before, but I
               really do mean it. I can't be doing this
               right now.

                            KUMAIL
               I know. Totally. One hundred percent. I
               agree with you.

                            EMILY
               So don't call me again.

                            KUMAIL
               I won't. I promise.

                            EMILY
               Good luck on all your future endeavors.

                            KUMAIL
               Oh yeah, thank you. Hey, can we have an
               awkward hug before we part forever?

                            EMILY
               Ok.

                            KUMAIL
               Ok.

     Kumail goes in for an awkward hug.

                            EMILY
               Goodbye.

                            KUMAIL
               Goodbye.

     Emily goes inside. Kumail calls her immediately. She
     answers and they talk to each other through the door.

                            EMILY
               You just promised never to call me
               again.

                            KUMAIL
               It's really cold out here. It's so
               cold.

                            EMILY
               You make a pretty good point.

     She opens the door, Kumail goes in.

                            EMILY (CONT'D)
               It's a lot warmer in here.

                            KUMAIL
               It is warmer in here.

                            EMILY
               You know, it's really nice upstairs.

     Emily with Kumail and his friends: CJ and Mary.

                             CJ
                Emily, has Kumail told you that in
                addition to being an Uber driver he
                also has a one-man show?

                             EMILY
                No, he did not tell me that.   Do you
                really?

                             KUMAIL
                It's really nothing. It's just
                something I'm fiddling around with.
23


                  EMILY
     How is a one man show different from
     stand-up?

                  KUMAIL
     It's really not.

                  MARY
     There's lots of wigs and costume
     changes.

                  CJ
     There's a lot of acting in it.

                  MARY
     And then like at the end of it, you've
     got this very awkward conversation where
     you go, "I really liked it."

                  KUMAIL
     But I thought you really liked it!

                  MARY
     I really liked it.

                  EMILY
     I can't wait to see the show.

                  KUMAIL
     You will never see the show...

                  CJ
     You have to see the show.

                  MARY
     You have to see it.

                  KUMAIL
     It's not ready.

                  CJ
     You will love the acting.

                  KUMAIL
     They're fucking with you.   It's not
     really like that.

                  EMILY
     Are they fucking with me or you? It

               I'm twelve years old. This...this is
               home. Feels like I never left. Do you
               smell that? That's my mom cooking the
               Murgh Roghen Joash.

               watching cricket on the telly. Do you
               feel that? That's the weight of
               Pakistan's history.

               Except instead of the traditional

               my khansama Chris will serve to you
               right now. Khansama is Urdu for
               servant.

               If you'd like to make it at home, the
               main ingredients are condensed milk,

                  Um, I thought it was great.

                  I never knew that Pakistan had the

                  Yeah. Something like 14 million
                  hectares are being irrigated. As soon
                  as I read that I was like "oh, that's

                               MARY
                  Yeah, that was so honest and good.

                  through? You're from Pakistan! Good to
                  see you Emily!

                            KUMAIL
               So, really what did you think?   You know,
               it's a work in progress...

                            EMILY
               I really liked it. I learned a lot.
               About Pakistan, and cricket. All those
               positions. But I just wish that I
               learned more about you. Does that make
               any sense?

                            KUMAIL
               Yeah.



     INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Kumail is asleep. EMILY is awake. She looks over at
     Kumail, and very silently, guiltily, crawls out of bed.



     INT. KUMAIL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Emily sneaks past Chris who is passed out on the couch
     and goes into the bathroom.



     INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Emily looks around Kumail's bedroom for something.

     She starts putting her clothes on. Kumail wakes up.

                            KUMAIL
               Hey.

                            EMILY
               Oh, hi!

                            KUMAIL
               It's 3 AM.

                            EMILY
               Is that diner around the corner open?

                            KUMAIL
               It's 24 hours. Why?   You want an old
               lemon meringue pie?
28


                  EMILY
     You're so funny! Actually, no, I
     just...I really need to get a cup of
     coffee.

                  KUMAIL
     I can make you coffee.

                  EMILY
     I love diner coffee.     That burnt taste.

                  KUMAIL
     All right, I'll come with you.

                  EMILY
     No, no! Why would you do that?

                  KUMAIL
     It's a bad neighborhood. I'm not gonna
     let you go on your own.

                  EMILY
     Why cause I'm a woman? Seriously, that's
     the most misogynist thing I've ever
     heard.

                  KUMAIL
     Why are you being so weird?

                  EMILY
     Fuck you, I'm not being weird.

                  KUMAIL
     You're being so weird.

                  EMILY
     Fuck you. You're being weird!    You're
     being so weird!

                  KUMAIL
     How am I weird? I want to sleep while
     it's sleep time.

                  EMILY
     This is normal. Girls go to get coffee
     in the middle of the night. Have you
     never had a girlfriend before? This is
     what it's like.

                  KUMAIL
     Are you okay?
29


                           EMILY
              Everything is not okay. Everything is
              not okay.

                           KUMAIL
              You can tell me anything, you know that
              right? You can tell me anything.

                           EMILY
              I have to take a shit, okay? I have to
              take a huge fucking dookie. I can't
              take a poo in your bathroom because you
              don't have any matches and you don't
              have any air freshener. What kind of
              person doesn't have any matches or air
              freshener in the bathroom? The walls
              are so thin! And Chris is right out
              there.

     Kumail starts laughing.

                           EMILY (CONT'D)
              Please stop laughing! Please, please.

                           KUMAIL
              Okay, I have an idea.



     EXT. KUMAIL'S HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER

     Kumail sits on the stoop outside. After a beat, Emily
     sheepishly walks out and sits next to him.

                             KUMAIL
              How are you?

                           EMILY
              I do not want to talk about it.



     INT. BATTING CAGES - DAY

     Naveed fully geared up: batting helmet, gloves, elbow
     pad, eye-black. Kumail behind the backstop, watching.

                           NAVEED
              Watch and learn, Bhai. It's all about
              shifting weight and torque.

     A BALL ZINGS at Naveed, he misses completely.

     Another ball zings. Misses again.

                            KUMAIL (CONT'D)
               You're like a Pakistani Sammy Sosa.

     An 8-year old KID in a cage nearby cracks a clean hit.

                            KUMAIL (CONT'D)
               Hey he's pretty good. Just do what
               he's doing.

     Naveed throws down his bat and exits the cage.



     INT. BATTING CAGE SNACK SHACK - LATER

     Kumail and Naveed eat from tiffins & ramekins. They fork-
     fight over their meal.

               These cookies are really good.

                            NAVEED
               They're biscuits! Listen to yourself.
               You hardly sound Pakistani. "Cookies"?
               You sound like Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
               You're such a burger.

                            KUMAIL
               I'm not a burger.


                            NAVEED
               Yes, you are. You're a big fat burger.

                            KUMAIL
               I'm not a burger and biscuit is actually
               a British term.

               Well thank you for that information
               that no one gives a shit about and you
               should listen to mom and grow a beard.

                            KUMAIL
               It gets really itchy, I've tried. It's
               all patchy.

               Try being a man and conditioning like I
               do.

                            KUMAIL
               What's the whole thing with Muslims
               growing beards anyway? It's such an
               arbitrary thing. Like who decided that?
               Oh, we have to have beards.

                            NAVEED
               Yeah. There are a billion of us and you
               are the only one with the truth. Is
               that right? The sun is just shining
               down on you right now. It's just
               parting like "ahh".

                            KUMAIL
               You know, I have to tell you something,
               Bhai.

                            NAVEED

                            KUMAIL
               I've been dating this girl.

                            NAVEED
               I thought you were going to say you were
               involved in a hit and run or you got
               caught forging some checks. But a WHITE
               GIRL? Such a cliche.

     A white family stares in their direction.

               Listen. I understand. You're in
               America. You wanna mow a few lawns and
               see what it's like. But eventually you
               have to marry a Pakistani girl. Like I
               hung out with other girls. But then I
               married Fatima. We hardly spoke two
               words to each other the first few
               months! But now, Kumi, she's like my
               best friend. You have to break up with
               her immediately.

                            KUMAIL
               If I find someone who's as good for me
               as Fatima is for you, Mom would
               understand, right? I mean, she wouldn't
               love me less?

                            NAVEED
               She would definitely love you less.
               Slowly, you'd sort of -- what's the
               word when guys stop returning girls'
               calls?

               Uh huh. It tastes like grape juice
               that's gone bad. How do you know so
               much about wine?
33


                  EMILY
     Um, because, I was pretty unhappy in my
     first marriage and I drank a lot and
     one way to cover drinking is to know a
     lot about wine.

                  KUMAIL
     I'm sorry wait, what did you say?

                  EMILY
     That knowing a lot about wine sort of
     covers for drinking a lot.

                  KUMAIL
     No, the huge piece of information
     you're trying to blow right past.

     questions other than...when did you get
     married? When did you get divorced?
     What's his name? How tall is he? Did
     you love him? I guess I have a couple
     of questions.

                  EMILY
     Uh huh. His name was, is Ryan. We met in
     college. Everyone I knew was getting
     married super young, so we did. And one
     day I was at a restaurant and I saw
     this couple making out and I thought "I
     don't think about my husband like that,
     but I guess that's okay" and then
     another part of my brain was like "NO
     IT'S NOT OKAY THIS IS YOUR LIFE". I
     feel like this is freaking you out.
     Does this freak you out?

                  KUMAIL
     It's not freaking me out.

              I think I just tweaked my ankle. I took
              this stupid hip hop dance class last
              weekend.

               Marriage! Okay? We just call it
               marriage. There's another type of
               marriage that's called "love marriage"
               and that's bad. My cousin Rehan married
               an Irish woman and he was kicked out of

               Yeah, let's go somewhere.



     INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Kumail asleep in his bed, DENISE is asleep next to him.
     C.U. CELLPHONE ringing. "UNKNOWN CALLER" blinks on the
     screen. KUMAIL stirs awake.

                               KUMAIL
               Hello?

                            JESSIE
               Kumail. It's Jessie.

                               KUMAIL
               Hey.     Who?

                            JESSIE
               Jessie. I'm in school with Emily.
               Listen, Emily is in the hospital.

                               KUMAIL
               What?

     Kumail jolts out of bed.

                            JESSIE (V.O.)
               Could you just go, please? She needs
               someone there. We have exams tomorrow
               so nobody else can go.

     Kumail fumbles to get dressed, as we CUT TO...



     INT/EXT. KUMAIL'S CAR - LATER

     Kumail drives in the middle of the night, empty streets.

                            JESSIE (V.O.)
               She's still in the ER. Could you just go
               and sit with her? I was there for as long
               as I could, but it's a crazy time for all
               of us...



     EXT. CITY VIEW     HOSPITAL - LATER

     A MASSIVE HOSPITAL looms over a quiet residential area.
45


     INT. CITY VIEW HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

     Kumail walks up to the reception desk.

                           KUMAIL
              Hi. I am looking for Emily Gardner. Um,
              Emily Gardner? She was checked in...

     A MAN is rolled in a stretcher by EMTs.   The nurses run
     off.



     INT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

     Kumail walks by curtained beds hearing screams, wailing,
     moaning. He finally sees Emily in a bed, hooked up to
     wires and monitors. She looks scared, a bit sedated.

                           KUMAIL
              Hey.

                           EMILY
              What are you doing here?

                           KUMAIL
              Jessie called me and wanted me to make
              sure you were okay. So how are you
              doing?

                           EMILY
              Fine. Totally fine. Never been better.
              A thousand percent fine. Just like
              fainted a little at work. I didn't have
              breakfast this morning.

                           KUMAIL
              Breakfast is the most important meal of
              the day. You know that.

                           NURSE BETTE
              Ms. Gardner. Your room will be ready
              soon. Okay?

                           EMILY
              Oh, no, actually I'd love to go home
              and sleep in my own bed.

                           NURSE BETTE
              Sir, can you step outside a moment,
              please? If you want to stay you have to
              go to the security desk to get a pass.
46


                           KUMAIL
              Where is the security desk?

                           NURSE BETTE
              It's downstairs. Exactly where you walked
              in. At the security desk.

                           KUMAIL
              The security desk is at the security
              desk. Got it.



     INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM   - LATER

     Emily is propped up. Kumail next to her. He has a badge.

                           KUMAIL
              Can I get you something? Water. Juice.
              Coffee?

     Emily is essentially passed out. Kumail isn't sure what
     to do. NURSE JUDY brings in a doctor. DR. WRIGHT, 30s,
     looks over at Kumail.

                           DR. WRIGHT
              May I speak with you for a second?

                           KUMAIL
                     (to Emily)
              I'll be right back.



     INT. ICU ROOM HALLWAY- CONTINUOUS

     Kumail follows Dr. Wright out to a busy hallway.

                           DR. WRIGHT
              There is a massive infection in her
              lungs. All her vitals are elevated.
              Does she have HIV?

                           KUMAIL
              What? No. I mean she--

                           DR. WRIGHT
              Are you her husband?

                             KUMAIL
              No--
47


                            DR. WRIGHT
               We need to intubate her immediately. I
               need a family member to sign this. So
               I'm going to ask you again. Are you her
               husband?

                            KUMAIL
               What does "intubate" mean?

                            DR. WRIGHT
               We have to put her on a respirator and
               to do that we need to put her in a
               medically induced coma.

                               KUMAIL
               Coma.

                            DR. WRIGHT
               Yes, to stabilize her so we can work on
               the infection. And it needs to happen
               right now. So, I'm going to ask you one
               last time, are you her husband?

     Kumail signs the forms.



     INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

     Dr. Wright and Orderlies rush Emily down the hallway on
     a GURNEY. Kumail runs with them. Trying to keep up.

                            EMILY
               What's going on?! Where are you taking
               me?

     Emily disappears into an OR. Kumail watches DOCTORS and
     NURSES descend on her. Nurse Judy puts her hand on his
     arm.

                            NURSE JUDY
               You should call her family.



     INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM

     Kumail, freaked out, stares at Emily, hooked up to
     various wires on her arms and chest. He sees her purse
     and digs out her iPhone. It's locked. He looks over at
     Emily.

                               KUMAIL
               I'm sorry.
48


     He puts her finger on the phone. It unlocks.



     INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Kumail scrolls down to PARENTS on Emily's phone and
     dials. A WOMAN'S VOICE picks up, "Hello?"...

                            KUMAIL
               Hey, Mrs. Gardner? This is Kumail,
               Emily's friend. I'm so sorry to be
               calling you so late. Emily's fine.
               Just want to get that taken care of.
               She's fine. She is at City View
               Hospital in Chicago in a medically
               induced coma. But the doctors say that-
               - Yes I did say coma.



     INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM - LATER

     Kumail sits in a chair looking at Emily who is hooked up
     to a breathing machine.

     He dozes off.



     INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM- NEXT MORNING

     Kumail sleeps. He wakes up to a COUPLE sitting by
     Emily's bed. TERRY, 50's, rumpled, BETH, 50's, put-
     together.

                            KUMAIL
               Hey. I'm Kumail.

                            BETH
               We know who you are Kumail.

     They're clearly tired, terrified. Nurse Judy enters.

                            NURSE JUDY
               Mr. and Mrs. Gardner. The doctors would
               like to see you now.

                            BETH
                      (whispers, to Emily)
               Be right back.

     They leave. Kumail awkwardly follows them.
49


     INT. BEREAVEMENT ROOM- MOMENTS LATER (SUNDAY MORNING)

     Kumail, Terry, Beth sit. A waterfall coos. Meditations
     on the wall: "Darkest Nights Produce The Brightest
     Stars"; "Grief is love's unwillingness to let go", etc.

                               NURSE JUDY
                  Listen, the doctor will be here any
                  minute. She's just running a little
                  late. Don't read anything into this
                  being in the bereavement room. It was
                  the only room we had available.

                               TERRY
                  Okay. Thank you.

     She exits.    Terry nervously taps on his knees, annoying
     Beth.

                               BETH
                  Terry, Terry-- it's driving me insane.

                               TERRY
                  I know, I know. But it makes me feel
                  better.

     The doctor walks in.

                              DR. CUNNINGHAM
                  Hello.

     Beth and Terry stand to greet her.

                               DR. CUNNINGHAM (CONT'D)
                  Please sit. I'm Dr. Cunningham, Emily's
                  attending. I'll be coordinating all the
                  doctors and orchestrating her treatment
                  strategy.

                               BETH
                  "All the doctors"? How many are there?

                              DR. CUNNINGHAM
                  Five.

                               BETH
                  Five? Why so many? Is that normal?

                               Dr. CUNNINGHAM
                  Yes, it's standard with patients in the
                  ICU. We come at it from different
                  angles--

     When we cut back it is a different person now. DR.
     LEWIN. Terry, Kumail and Beth stay but the doctors
     change.

                            DR. LEWIN
               We immediately initiated orotracheal
               intubation. Thankfully it hasn't affected
               her heart at this point.

                            KUMAIL
               That was very reassuring, wasn't it?
               Apparently, there are good and bad
               comas. And the kind that they put her
               in, the medically induced ones, are
               definitely the good kind of coma.

     INT. TRIPLE DOOR - BACKSTAGE - THAT NIGHT

               What about this? I saw a sniffer dog at
               the airport get a boner. Does that mean
               drugs or bombs?

                            CJ
               That's good. What if instead of it being
               at the airport, you quit comedy and never
               did comedy ever again?

                            CHRIS
               Fuck you. It's a good bit.

                            CJ
               Just for the sake of the public. So they
               wouldn't have to look at your face or
               hear your words.

     Kumail interjects.

                            KUMAIL
               It's okay that I'm not there, right?
               Like, I don't need to be there, right?

                            SAM
               What happened?
52


                            CHRIS
               He put his girlfriend in a coma. You
               know, the way you do.

                            MARY
               He signed a paper that allowed doctors to
               put her--

                            CJ
               He suggested it.

                            KUMAIL
               She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine.
               They said she's gonna be fine. Doctors
               know medical stuff. That's what doctors
               do. They're good at medical stuff. This
               is a medically induced coma. This is
               their specialty.

                            MARY
               Maybe.

                            CHRIS
               It might be a good thing. She might wake
               up with a new skill. Like my cousin
               blacked out once and when he came to, he
               thought he knew a different language.

                            CJ
               Did he?

                            CHRIS
               No, it was just gibberish that he made
               up. It was brain damage.

     CJ and Mary shake their heads. Kumail looks freaked out.

                            SAM
               I got another Taco Bell one...



     INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM- MONDAY MORNING

     Terry and Beth wait. Beth is sewing a shirt of Emily's.
     Terry is pacing. Kumail walks up to them.

                            BETH
               Did you forget something?

                            KUMAIL
               Is she up yet?
53


                            TERRY
               No, she's not. They won't tell us
               anything. We've been here all morning.

                            KUMAIL
               I know you guys said you don't need me
               to stay, but I think I'm just going to
               wait anyway.

                            BETH
               You guys broke up. I'm not sure why
               you're here. You don't have to worry
               about being committed to anything,
               Kumail. You didn't want to when she was
               awake. There's no need to do it when
               she's unconscious.

                            KUMAIL
               It's more complicated than that--

                            BETH
               Is it? Because I know about the two-day
               rule, I know about the headshots and the
               secrets. She tells us everything.
                      (beat, then)
               You really don't have to stay Kumail. You
               have already done a lot.

     Kumail is speechless. After a beat of awkward quiet--

                            KUMAIL
               I'm just gonna stay for a second. Is this
               seat- ?

     Kumail gestures to the empty seat next to Beth, but she
     throws her sewing on it and turns away.

     Kumail walks to another row of seats and sits down,
     facing Emily's parents. Beth watches him intensely for a
     few beats before Kumail turns to the woman sitting next
     to him.

                            KUMAIL (CONT'D)
               Is that lady still looking at me?



     INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA- LATER

     Kumail carries his tray, spots Terry and Beth together
     having a hushed conversation. He sits at a different
     table. Terry waves at him. Kumail heads over to them.

                            TERRY
               No reason you should eat there by
               yourself. Right, hon?

                            BETH
                     (barely looks up)
               It's a free country.

     Kumail nods. Sits down. They eat. It's awkward.

                            KUMAIL
               How's your sandwich?

                            BETH
               Best fuckin' sandwich I've ever had.

                            TERRY
               Mine's good. Tuna's always a gamble.
               You know, we're not by the water. Well,
               we are by the water, but it's a lake.
               There's no tuna in the lake. Whatever.
               I threw the dice. I got the 7's, I
               guess. Whatever the good dice number
               is.

     More silence.

               So, uh, 9/11?

     Blank looks from Kumail and Beth.

                            TERRY (CONT'D)
               No, I mean, I've always wanted to have a
               conversation about it with...people.

                            KUMAIL
               You've never talked to people about 9/11?

                            TERRY
               No, uh, what's your stance?

                            KUMAIL
               What's my stance on 9/11? Oh, ummmm...
               Anti. It was a tragedy.
                     (a beat)
               I mean we lost 19 of our best guys.

                            BETH
               Huh?
55


                           KUMAIL
              That was a joke, obviously. 9/11 was a
              terrible tragedy, and it's not funny to
              joke about it.

     Beth and Terry are PAGED on the intercom. They quickly
     gather up their things and get up to leave.

                           KUMAIL (CONT'D)
              Hey, can I come?

     Yeah.                         No.



     Terry gestures for Kumail to get up and follow them.

                           BETH
              Whatever.



     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE- MOMENTS LATER

     Kumail, Beth, Terry, and Dr. Cunningham.

                           DR. CUNNINGHAM
              I know this isn't the news you were
              hoping for but we aren't ready to bring
              Emily out of the coma yet.

                           BETH
              Oh. I-

                           TERRY
              What happened?

                           DR. CUNNINGHAM
              The antibiotics aren't doing exactly
              what we'd hoped they would, and we
              don't want to mess around. So we're
              going to perform surgery tomorrow
              morning to remove the infection.

                           BETH
              Wait a second- Dr. Spellman told us
              that the antibiotics would work. He
              didn't say anything at all about
              surgery.
56


                            TERRY
               What does that mean? What kind of
               surgery?

                            DR. CUNNINGHAM
               It's called thoracentesis, it's a very
               common procedure. We're going to go in
               between the ribs and remove the
               infection.

                            TERRY
                     (scribbling in his notebook)

               What's the last part?

                              DR. CUNNINGHAM
               -Centesis.

                            BETH
               And where is the infection?

                              DR. CUNNINGHAM
               On the lung.

                            BETH
               What's the risk?

                            DR. CUNNINGHAM
               Low. My advice to you is that you go
               home, you get something to eat, and try
               to relax.

     Terry looks at Emily's bookshelf and pulls out a BOOK.
     Beth puts the sweater on and takes her laptop out, sits
     on the couch.

                            BETH (CONT'D)
               I'm gonna do some research.

                            BETH
               No, I gave her that one. Hey, do you
               have that little notebook from the
               doctors?

     Terry hands her the notebook.

               No, this is the book I gave her.

               I'm just gonna clean up Emily's rooms
               real quick.

                            BETH
               I remember. I met her at the falafel
               place and then we went to that book store
               that's hardly ever open and I bought it
               for her.

                            TERRY
               You're not the only one who gives her
               things.

                            BETH
               What's up with you?

                            TERRY
               I'm just tired of you thinking that
               you're the only one who gives her things.
               I gave her that book.

                            BETH
               Look at the inscription.

                            TERRY
               No. That's stupid.

     Beth shrugs and goes back to the computer. Terry looks at
     the inscription, frowns, puts it back.

     INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM- SAME

     Kumail leaves the door open a crack. He sees in the
     LIVING ROOM Terry and Beth are whisper-quarrelling.

     He begins to clean. Pulls a MARIJUANA PIPE and BAG OF
     WEED off the dresser and shoves it into the back of her
     closet.

     He notices the BRAINS SHIRT in the closet. He touches
     it. We see a flashback of Emily wearing the sweatshirt.

     He opens a cigar box on her dresser and pulls out
     POLAROID pictures. They're of him and Emily. More
     flashbacks of Emily.

               Kumail.

               Hey.

                            TERRY
               Sorry... Didn't mean to surprise you. I
               was just wondering if we wanna do
               anything. Got any parlor games...

                            KUMAIL
               I don't-what are parlor games?

                            TERRY
               Card games, word games. You play any word
               games?

                            KUMAIL
               No, I've never played-

               You ever played You Can't Rhyme It?

                            KUMAIL
               How does that go?

                            TERRY
               It's basically where you try to find a
               word, a real word, that nobody can rhyme.

                            KUMAIL

                            TERRY
               Yeah, see you would win. That'd be a
               winner.

                            KUMAIL
               I don't play board games. I play video
               games.

                            TERRY
               That's the thing. Everybody now needs
               Nintendo, the game thing, electronics, a
               thousand dollars. When I was a kid, a
               piece of chalk and a pavement, that's
               your entertainment. Hopscotch, tic tac
               toe, throw the chalk at Jimmy. There you
               go, three games right there.

                            KUMAIL
               Jimmy was a real guy?

               Yeah, well there was no particular Jimmy,
               whoever got hit with the chalk, he was
               the Jimmy.

     Kumail gets a call from Naveed on his phone. He ignores
     it.

                            TERRY (CONT'D)

               Yeah, tonight's no good for me. I'd
               love to, but I'm actually gigging
               tonight, which is like an industry word
               we use for when we do shows.

                  TERRY
           (nervous)
     Maybe we should go to Kumail's show.
     What do you think? Wouldn't that be
     fun?

                  BETH
     Oh my god. These pictures are horrible.

                  TERRY
     Okay listen, why don't we go to the
     comedy club with him? It'll take our
     mind off of things right now.

                  BETH
     I don't want to get my mind off it,
     Terry. Our daughter's having surgery
     tomorrow.

                  TERRY
     Please. I need the distraction.

                  BETH
     Well then why don't you go?

                  TERRY
     No, I want you to come with me. I don't
     wanna be alone.

                  BETH
     All right. But I'm bringing my iPad.

                  KUMAIL
     Ah it's sold out. I should've said it
     before you guys had the whole
     discussion. It sold out super quickly.
     They were shocked at how quickly it
     sold out.

                  TERRY
     But you can get us in? You're the
     headliner, right? That's what you said.
     I mean, if you're the headliner, you
     can get two more in, right?

               That's a good point.

                            TERRY
               We'll sit in the back. They got food
               there?

                            KUMAIL
               They've got waffle fries and um-

     Kumail turns and begins to head out the door.

                            TERRY
               The hospital had waffle fries too.



     INT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS HOUSE- SAME

     Kumail's family sits with a young Pakistani woman
     SUMERA. There's an empty chair where KUMAIL usually
     sits.

                            SUMERA
               I've actually never been to   Pakistan. My
               parents moved here for grad   school and
               they just stayed here. I've   never even
               been to Canada. So uh, when   is Kumail
               coming?

                            SHARMEEN
               He's coming. Right, Naveed? Traffic?

                            NAVEED
               I heard everything's bumper-to-bumper
               on the Dan Ryan Expressway.

                            SUMERA
               That's weird because I took the Dan
               Ryan Expressway here.

              Our daughter's in a coma.

               No, it's good. I like my jokes thoroughly

               Okay. I lied about the show to get out

               know what? He ate sprouts his whole

                            BETH
               I was going to East Carolina University
               and I was waiting tables. We met at
               this coffee shop, I was waiting on him.
               I liked his hair. He was a teacher
               already. Thick New York accent like
               nobody I'd ever met. Totally wrong for
               me. So naturally we fell-in-love. My
               family could not stand him. We're all
               military people, army pilots. All my
               brothers played football. Terry
               couldn't even change a tire. My father
               got so mad he broke every dinner plate
               we had. Now back then, you go to the
               gas station, you fill up your tank, you
               get a dinner plate. But just one at a
               time. Cup, saucer. It took us a year of
               fill-ups to get the whole set back. And
               Terry just stuck around. Eventually
               they just all got over it.

                            KUMAIL
               They just got over it. How?

                            BETH
               Lots of fucked up dinners. How'd your
               parents meet, Kumail?

                            KUMAIL
               So we have arranged marriage as you
               know. A big group got together to see a
               movie, but really it was just a set up
               so my mom and dad could meet.

                            BETH
               What movie did they see?

               without our parents? Have you been to the
               cat cafe? The cats just come up to you

               to just be in a relationship so you can
               finally relax?

                            KUMAIL
               I'm sorry. You deserve better than me.

                            KHADIJA
               People are always telling me what I
               deserve. It's bullshit. And stop being so
               sorry about everything. I'm gonna go.

     Khadija starts walking to her front door, then stops and
     turns back to Kumail.


                            KHADIJA (CONT'D)
               And you know what? I watched the X-Files,
               like three whole episodes, and it's a bad
               show.



     INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

     Beth, Terry, and Kumail sit. Beth and Terry with their
     laptops, Kumail with his iPhone. Each diligently typing.
     We see they're each looking things up on WebMD.

                            TERRY
               Wow, they should call this website,
               "Everything is Cancer Dot Com".
               Everything you put in, it could be
               cancer. Hiccups could be cancer. Come on.
               You take the fun out of hiccups now.

                            BETH
               Do you know this is the 17th best
               hospital in Chicago?
77


                            TERRY
               Really? Out of how many?

                            BETH
               I don't know, but Northwestern's number
               one.

                            TERRY
               Well how do they rate it? What's their
               methodology?

                            BETH
               I don't know, Terry. But 17th is bad.

                            TERRY
               It's not great, unless the sample size
               is, you know, that all depends.

                            KUMAIL
               Here, look at the comments.

                            TERRY
               This is why I don't want to go online
               cause it's never good. You go online,
               they hated Forrest Gump. Frickin' best
               movie ever.



     INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER

     Terry talks on his cellphone and paces. Dr. Cunningham
     tracks him down.

                            DR. CUNNINGHAM
               Terry - Hi. Can we talk?

                            TERRY
               Yeah.

                            DR. CUNNINGHAM
               We got the biopsy results. They are
               unfortunately inconclusive. We are
               concerned-

     Music drowns out the rest of their conversation as Terry
     looks increasingly distraught.



     INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATER

     Terry speaks with Beth and Kumail.

                            TERRY
               They couldn't find out what the disease
               was, or where the virus came from or
               the bacteria or whatever.

                            KUMAIL
               But they took out the infection so it
               shouldn't matter?

                            TERRY
               I know, that's what I said but her
               vitals didn't normalize. And now they
               say that the infection is continuing to
               spread, it's in her kidneys.

                            KUMAIL
               But the kidneys are so far from the
               lungs.

                            TERRY
               I know, it's an aggressive infection
               and they said what they gotta do now is
               figure out what this mystery disease
               actually is.

                            BETH
               I'm calling Northwestern.

                            TERRY
               Just hold on, hold on.

                            BETH
               Terry! Goddammit!

                            KUMAIL
               I think we should talk about this--

                            BETH
               --You shut up! I'm sick of this shit,
               Terry. We're getting her out of here!

                            TERRY
               They're in the middle of the whole
               process of elimination.

                            BETH
               So you're saying Northwestern can't
               take that information and continue the
               search? This place is a shithole.

     She looks towards the other people in the waiting room.

                            BETH (CONT'D)
               I'm sorry. Anna, could I have that?
79


     She takes her bag from Anna.

                            TERRY
               Will you just stop for a second? They're
               the doctors. You act like you know what
               you're talking about. You don't.

     Beth searches in her bag.

                            BETH
               I can't find my cellphone. You got a
               phone?

                            TERRY
               Don't give her a phone. You don't need a
               phone. You don't need to call anybody
               right now.

     Kumail takes out his phone, hands it to Beth. She starts
     fiddling with it.

                            TERRY (CONT'D)
               They're doing it. They're the experts
               here, and I trust them.

                            BETH
               Well that's very nice. But I don't. Can
               you unlock that thing?


     Beth hands the phone back to Kumail, he unlocks it, hands
     it back.

                            BETH (CONT'D)
               There's a reason why they're #17 and
               Northwestern's #1. And it's not because
               people trust them!

                            TERRY
               Oh - you think that you're smarter than
               me because you say big sentences. Well
               you're not!

     Kumail is trying to give them space, unsure what to do.

                            BETH
               I don't think I'm smarter than you! You
               just don't think you're as smart as I
               am! That's not my fault!

                            TERRY
               Right. It's never your fault.
               Everything's my fault.

                            BETH
               Oh there are some things that are
               definitely just your fault.

                            TERRY
               Okay, that's bullshit. You need to stop
               freaking out and calm down.

                            BETH
               And you need to stop being a coward.

                            TERRY
               Greatest hits, coming back. You can
               stop, I'll replay the rest of this from
               memory.

     Kumail slips away.



     INT. GIFT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

     Kumail looking at gift items.



     INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER

     Kumail walks with a giant STUFFED GIRAFFE.



     INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Kumail puts the STUFFED GIRAFFE by her bed. Nurse Judy
     smiles.

               Oh, you're giraffe-ing it.

                            KUMAIL
               It was the biggest thing they had. I
               don't even know if she likes giraffes. We
               never talked about giraffes. Hey, do
               they know what they're doing? Cause
               they don't tell us anything. Like, Lyme
               Disease? You know the girl on The Real
               World had it? Did you guys look for
               that?

                              NURSE JUDY
               Yes, we did.

                           KUMAIL
              Did you know she gets hurt all the
              time? She messed up her ankle recently -
              could that be Lupus?

                           NURSE JUDY
              Kumail. We're looking into everything.
              We're not holding anything back from
              you. We're still just eliminating
              possibilities.

                           KUMAIL
              Cause Beth wants to move her to
              Northwestern.

                           NURSE JUDY
              Oh no. Emily should not be moved. The
              hospital will approve it because it'll
              get the liability off their hands, but
              we put her in a coma for a reason. To
              stabilize her. Moving her could be very
              dangerous. The infection could spread.
              Trust me she is fighting. And so are
              we.

     Kumail looks frightened.



     INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Terry balls up his coat to use as a pillow, trying to
     get comfortable. Kumail enters. TERRY sees him and sits
     up.

                           KUMAIL
              Hey Terry. I was just talking to the
              nurse - You okay?

                           TERRY
              Yeah, of course. Totally fine.

     Terry's eyes are very puffy and red.

                           TERRY (CONT'D)
              Beth went to Emily's, so I'm gonna wait
              here until they kick me out. Keep an
              eye on her.

     Long pause. Terry and Kumail staring at one another.

              That wasn't funny, right?

                           KUMAIL
              I thought that was a serious question.

              Let's get the fuck out of here.

              So this is the place.

                           TERRY
              Wow...this place is terrible.



     INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - LATER

     Kumail and Terry lay on separate air mattresses.

                           KUMAIL
              Hey I talked to Nurse Judy, and she was
              saying that moving Emily could be a bad
              idea.

                           TERRY
              Really?

                           KUMAIL
              Yeah, she said it could be dangerous.

     Terry listens but doesn't respond.

                           KUMAIL (CONT'D)
              Like...

                           TERRY
              No. Yeah. I hear you. I'd give anything
              to trade places with Emily. Being a
              parent, it's a nightmare. Loving
              somebody this much sucks.
83


                           KUMAIL
               Yeah.

     Kumail's not sure what to say.

                            TERRY
               And I guess you've noticed some tension
               between Beth and me.

                            KUMAIL
               Not really. That's none of my business.

                            TERRY
               Yeah well, it's there. Big time.

                            KUMAIL
               It's getting really late. We should go
               to sleep.

     Kumail turns off the light. A beat of quiet in the dark.

                            TERRY
               I cheated on her.

                            TERRY
               I did. It was just a one night stand.

               Okay.

                            TERRY
               We met at some bar in Cincinnati. They
               have these teacher conferences. Who

                            KUMAIL
               Math teachers?

                            TERRY
               Yeah. I think I was depressed, that's
               what it was.

                            KUMAIL
               Yeah. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Get a
               full night's sleep. Catch up fresh in the-

                            TERRY
               She just smelled so good. It was horrible
               too. As soon as I was finished. As soon
               as I'd finished, I was like, what did you
               fucking do?! What did you just do?!

              Yup.

                           TERRY
              I told Beth right away. I had to. She
              was devastated. Now she hates me.

                           KUMAIL
              She might be mad at you, but she doesn't
              hate you. You should've heard the way she
              was talking about you. Hey, can I ask you
              something? Why did you tell her?

                           TERRY
              Oh, I had to. I'm no good with guilt.

                           KUMAIL
              Do you guys talk about it?

                           TERRY
              Not anymore. She said she forgave me,
              but no. She hasn't. Let me give you
              some advice Kumail. You're going to
              know the woman you want to spend the
              rest of your life with when you cheat
              on her. When you cheat on her and you
              just feel like shit.

                           KUMAIL
              So, to fully know I love someone, I
              have to cheat on them?

                           TERRY
              Out loud it sounds stupid. Yeah, that's
              terrible advice.

     Terry is clearly fraught.

              Love isn't easy. That's why they call
              it love.

                           KUMAIL
              I don't really get that either.

                           TERRY
              I know. I thought I could just start

              would come out.

     She is in very high demand.

     Okay. So?

     So?

     Can we please talk about this another
     time?

                  SHARMEEN
     No, no, Kumi. We will talk about this
     now. We have sacrificed everything for
     you.

                  KUMAIL
     I know, okay?

                  SHARMEEN
     We have left our family. We have left
     our home. I have missed the birth of my
     sister's daughter. I have not seen my
     mother for fifteen years. Your father,
     he had to do his graduate school.
     Again. He had to give exams. Again.

                  AZMAT
     I was in my mid 50's. They were in 20s.
     They used to call me Father Time!

                  KUMAIL
     I know that. I really appreciate
     everything you did for me, but can we
     talk about this another time?

                  SHARMEEN
     Kumi, if you don't want to be a lawyer,
     fine. If you want to do the stand-up
     comedy and embarrass us as a family,
     fine. There is only one thing that we
     have ever asked from you: that you be a
     good Muslim and that you marry a
     Pakistani girl. That is it, one thing!

                  KUMAIL
     Can I ask you something that has never
     made sense to me? Why did you bring me
     here if you wanted me to not have an
     American life?

               want me to follow the rules. But the
               rules don't make sense to me. I don't
               pray. I don't. I haven't prayed in

               really good for you, it has made you
               good people, but I don't know what I
               believe. I just need to figure it out

              Have you guys heard of this new drug
              cocktail called cheese? Like that's the
              name of it, it's called cheese. I saw
              all these news reports, and they were
              like, there's a new drug, it's called
              cheese. Everyone's doing it in the
              Midwest, kids are doing it.

              It's just really hard to do stand-up

               Not quite sure what part you're
               laughing at. They say she's fighting,
               but she doesn't look like she's
               fighting. She looks like she's just
               laying there. I said horrible things to
               her. I hurt her. She loves birds. Like
               she gets excited every time she sees a
               bird. She's like, look at this, it's a
               bird. And I'm always like, yeah,
               they're all over the place, they're
               birds. But she likes that bird. Every
               bird she sees, she sees it.

               Her dad just called and said that they
               can't transfer her because the infection
               has reached her heart. Which means...
                      (realizing for the 1st time)
               She could die.



     INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM - NIGHT

     It's darker, less clinical-feeling at night in Emily's
     room. She's still the same, the beeping is the same, but
     there's something almost holy feeling in the room at
     night. Kumail sits quietly talking to her.

                            KUMAIL
               I don't know if you can hear me or not,
               but it would be really good if you pulled
               through. If you have to go, you can go,
               but it would be really great if you
               stayed. And I'm really sorry about what I
               did -

     Kumail continues to quietly talk to her.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE EMILY'S ROOM - SAME

     He looks inside the room. Emily is awake, surrounded by
     her parents and some doctors. Kumail watches through the
     window. Emily is groggy. The respirator is gone. Beth
     and Terry talk to her. She seems upset, can't talk.
     Kumail wants to go in but doesn't.



     INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM- DAY

     Beth sits on Emily's bed. Terry, Dr. Cunningham, and
     Nurse Judy stand to the side.

               Mom. You're getting your tears all over

               I've called you that your whole life!

     Nurse Judy holds up a CUP for Emily to sip from. Emily
     spits out the liquid.

                            NURSE JUDY
               Sorry hon.

               We have to thicken your liquids for a
               bit. Your esophagus isn't strong enough

              She won't have any social inhibitions
              until the anesthetic wears off.

     Nurse Judy holds the cup for Emily again, and she sips.

                           EMILY
              It does! Seriously, Mom. You should try
              this.

     Emily tries to grab the cup herself.

                           BETH
              Oh wait a minute, honey!

     Emily drops the cup. She's very upset. Beth comforts
     her.

              Oh, come on, come on. They'll charge us
              forty eight dollars for it, don't worry

                     (to Emily)
              Honey, we'll be right outside.

     Terry and Beth and leave with Dr. Cunningham. Kumail
     approaches Emily.

     Cunningham speaks with Terry and Beth.

                            DR. CUNNINGHAM
               Emily has a rare condition called Adult
               Onset Still's disease. Kumail mentioned
               Emily's hurt ankle and the swelling
               still hadn't gone down even after
               several days in bed, which is strange.
               Still's disease is when the body thinks
               healthy tissue is an infection so it
               tries to fight it. It's like a big
               biological misunderstanding.

                             TERRY
               Yeah, yeah.

                            DR CUNNINGHAM
               We gave her anti-inflammatories and she
               stabilized within hours. She's gonna
               take time to recover but she'll be
               fine.

               I was like, I'll just pop in and say hi
               to Emily.

               not thinking as clearly.

                            EMILY
               Naw dog. I'm not joking. You're not funny
               to me. You just make me sad. You make me
               sad inside of my heart, and it makes me
               sad to look at you. So I think you should
               probably go. Just go and tell my mom I
               want her.

               Alright, Kumail. Here's the thing. Your
               living condition is a potential health
               risk and you're not that funny. But....
               you're probably not suited to do
               anything else either so that's

               Hey, can we talk for a second?

               Sure.

      They walk in. Lots of jackets on the bed.

                            KUMAIL
               So, I've been collecting some things
               that are important to me and I wanted
               to show them to you. I call this my bag
               of devotion.

      Kumail presents the BIG BAG and starts to take items
      out. He holds up a bunch of HOSPITAL PASSES.

                            KUMAIL (CONT'D)
               This is all the visitor passes from

      He holds up some TICKET STUBS.

                            KUMAIL (CONT'D)
               These are the ticket stubs from when
               your parents came to see me perform and
               I realized how great they are, and how
               great you are, and how great honesty
               is.

      He holds up a JAR FULL OF ASHES.

                            EMILY
               What did you do? Did you cremate
               someone?

                These are the ashes of all the
                Pakistani women - not the women - the
                pictures of the Pakistani women. I
                thought this was a good idea, but it
                feels a little stupid.

      Kumail puts the items down and kneels before Emily.

                             KUMAIL (CONT'D)
                I know I was a terrible boyfriend. But
                I've changed. And I am the person you
                need me to be. I really am. So, will
                you take me back?

                             EMILY
                Kumail, I'm really glad that you went
                through this experience, but you have
                to understand that all that happened
                while I was asleep. Like you felt one
                way a few weeks ago and now you're
                saying you feel the total opposite way
                and the only thing that's changed is
                that I was in a coma. Honestly, I look
                at all of this, and I just think, I
                can't do it again. I can't be the
                reason that you don't have a family. It
                just feels totally different now. And I
                can't do that again. Do you understand?

                Okay.

      INT. KUMAIL'S PARENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Kumail enters the dining room without knocking on the
      door. Azmat, Sharmeen, Naveed, and Fatima are eating
      dinner. Kumail joins them. We see he has another LARGE
      BAG.

                             KUMAIL
                Ma. Dad. Fatima. Bhai. There's no
                plate. Oh I forgot. I've decided I
                won't let you kick me out of the
                family. Since I am a member of the
                family, it would stand to reason that I
                would get a vote in whether or not I
                get kicked out, and that vote would
                have to be unanimous. Standard
                parliamentary procedure. So all those
                in favor of not kicking Kumail out of
                the family, raise your hand.

      Kumail raises his hand. Everyone else stares silently.

                             KUMAIL (CONT'D)
                Great. Motion to kick Kumail out of the
                family, denied. So you guys can just
                talk to me.

      Everyone is silent.

                             KUMAIL (CONT'D)
                Okay, you're giving me the silent
                treatment. I figured that was what was
                going to happen. I have a solution.

      Kumail pulls out cue cards from his bag and shows them.

                             KUMAIL (CONT'D)
                "Hi. How are you?" It's just a real
                basic one. "Pass the salt." Practical.
                "Always with the comedy." Mom, made
                that one specially for you. "Kumail,
                how did you become so much more
                handsome than your brother Naveed?"

      Naveed and Azmat exchange a look.

                             KUMAIL
                I admit this one is designed to stir up
                some controversy. "It's interesting how
                you can't really kick someone out of your
                family because they'll always be your
                family." I agree with that one. It's a
                good one. So, I'm gonna leave these here
                for you.

      Kumail leaves the cards on the dining table.

                             KUMAIL (CONT'D)
                I'm sorry I lied about the girls and
                the LSAT and all of that. That was
                wrong. And one more thing: I'm moving
                to New York to pursue stand-up, but I
                am not leaving this family.

      Kumail leaves. Eye contact around the table.

                everything. I told them about my life. I
                told them about Emily. They kicked me out
                of the family. I may never talk to them

               Yeah, I bombed my Montreal Comedy
               Festival audition, like horrifically.

                            EMILY
               I saw the video. It wasn't great. I'll be
               honest with you, it wasn't great.

                            KUMAIL
               I know.

                            EMILY
               But there was a lot I liked. Like a lot I
               liked.

                            KUMAIL
               I'm moving to New York.

                            EMILY
               Really?

                            KUMAIL
               Yeah. Mary and CJ and I are just gonna
               drive out. We have a place already.

                            EMILY
               When do you leave?

                            KUMAIL
               Next weekend.

      This kinda hits them both like a ton of bricks.

                            EMILY
               I'm so excited for you. That is great.
               I think you are going to do so great in
               New York.

                What were you going to say?

                              EMILY
                What?

                             KUMAIL
                You said you were going to say something
                to me. What was it?

                             EMILY
                Oh, just that I wanted to thank you. My
                parents told me everything you did for me
                and I feel like the last time we spoke I
                didn't properly thank you so-

                             KUMAIL
                Oh yeah. Totally fine.

                             EMILY
                I should probably go.

                             KUMAIL
                Do you wanna call an Uber?

                             EMILY
                No, I'm gonna walk actually. This has
                been really great. Okay, bye.


      They smile at each other.



      EXT. STREET - DAY

      CJ, Mary, Kumail, and Chris are packing BOXES into a
      car.

                             CHRIS
                The scene is gonna be so different with
                you guys gone.

                             KUMAIL
                You should... come out...

                             CHRIS
                Nah. I'm good here. I'm gonna miss you.

                             KUMAIL

      Kumail and Chris hug.

               Get out of here, you assholes.

                            MARY
               Come here, you big dummy.

      Chris hugs Mary. Kumail is distracted as a CAR pulls up
      nearby. Kumail stares at it. After a beat, Kumail's dad
      Azmat pops out and walks up to Kumail.

                            AZMAT
               You are still kicked out of the family,
               but because we did not get a proper
               chance to say bye to you... Your mother
               is so angry with you. She is not going
               to get out of the car. She's not even
               going to look at you. And I don't
               believe you kept so much secret from
               me, your father.

                              KUMAIL
               I'm sorry.

                            AZMAT
               Here. She asked me to give this to you.

      Azmat hands Kumail a TUPPERWARE CONTAINER.

                            AZMAT (CONT'D)
               Biryani. For your trip. Your favorite.
               She made it herself specially for you
               with extra potatoes.

                            KUMAIL
               Thank you Ma.

      Kumail looks to the car. Sharmeen is in the backseat.
      She averts her gaze when she sees him looking at her.

                              KUMAIL (CONT'D)
               Is she okay?

                            AZMAT
               Right now? No.

                            KUMAIL
               I'll miss you.

                            AZMAT
               I am forbidden from hugging you. So. It
               was nice to have you as my son. Goodbye
               forever. And do me a favor, when you
               reach New York, just text us and tell
               us that you've reached safely, okay?

      Kumail nods.

                             KUMAIL
                Dad, can I ask you something? When you
                and Mom went on your first date, what
                movie did you see?

                             AZMAT
                      (thinks, then)
                Satte pe Satta.

      Azmat hums a snippet of a song from the movie.

                             AZMAT (CONT'D)
                Her favorite song. Why are you asking?

                             KUMAIL
                Just curious.

      Azmat nods and heads back to the car. He gets in and
      drives off. Kumail gets in the car with CJ and Mary and
      they drive off.

      Kumail performs comedy in front of a room full of NEW
      YORK HIPSTERS. He's killing. CJ and Mary are there too.
      Kumail takes a sip of water.

                             KUMAIL
                So the first time I came to America, I
                was fourteen and I was just visiting my
                uncle in New York and it just happened
                to be Thanksgiving. On my first day in
                America, my uncle took me to the Macy's
                Thanksgiving Day Parade and I was like,
                this is every day in America! As
                advertised. Every day they have a party
                celebrating Garfield. No day has lived
                up to that day. So I was lying to my
                parents, I was telling them I was gonna
                be a lawyer. And they're very
                disappointed cause they wanted me to be
                a doctor. And you guys are like, why
                didn't you just tell them that you
                wanted to be a doctor?
                             (MORE)

                            KUMAIL (CONT'D)
               It's a lie anyway. And I'm like, well it
               has to be believable. If I told them I
               want to be a doctor, they'd be like,
               "bullshit." If I say lawyer, they're
               like, "oh, ok, that's something." Cause
               there's a strict hierarchy: doctor,
               engineer, lawyer, hundreds of jobs,
               ISIS, then comedian.

      A very loud WHOOOOO emanates from the crowd. Kumail
      looks out to the crowd to see Emily, beaming at him. He
      is taken aback.

                            KUMAIL (CONT'D)
                     (stumbling)
               Uhh. I'm sorry. It's very rude to
               heckle comedians.

                            EMILY
               Oh that wasn't a heckle. I just kind of
               woo-hooed you.

                            KUMAIL
               Well see that's a common misconception.
               Heckling doesn't have to be negative.

                            EMILY
               So if I was like, oh my god, you're
               amazing in bed! That would be a heckle?

                            KUMAIL
               Yeah, and now you're getting more laughs
               than me, and I don't like that. Do you
               want to come up, do my job? Are you from
               out of town, m'am?

               Ooh Windy City. And what brings you to
               New York?

                            EMILY
               I'm here to see someone.

                            KUMAIL
               And have you seen him? Or her, I mean I
               don't know what your deal is.

                            EMILY
