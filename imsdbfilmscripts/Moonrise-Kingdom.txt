          INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY
                         
          A landing at the top of a crooked, wooden staircase. There is
          a threadbare, braided rug on the floor. There is a long, wide
          corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and
          battleships. The wallpapers are sun-bleached and peeling at
          the corners except for a few newly-hung strips which are
          clean and bright. A small easel sits stored in the corner.
                         
          Outside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling
          the gutters.
                         
          A ten-year-old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully
          eating a bowl of cereal as he walks. He is Lionel. Lionel
          slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window. He
          takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the
          turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove.
                         
          A child's voice says over the speaker:
                         
           RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)
           In order to show you how a big symphony
           orchestra is put together, Benjamin
           Britten has written a big piece of music,
           which is made up of smaller pieces that
           show you all the separate parts of the
           orchestra.
                         
          As Lionel listens, three other children wander out of their
          bedrooms and down to the landing.
                         
          The first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe. He is
          Murray. The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer
          shorts and a white undershirt. He is Rudy. The third is a
          twelve-year-old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee-high
          socks and brightly polished, patent-leather shoes. She is
          Suzy. She carries a one-month-old striped kitten.
                         
          The boys drop down to the floor next to their brother. They
          lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their
          fists, listening.
                         
          Suzy sits in the windowsill. She opens a book called Shelly
          and the Secret Universe. There is an illustration on the
          cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her
          neck.
                         
          Suzy starts to read -- then pauses. She lowers her book. She
          raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes. She looks out
          into the rain.
           2.
                         
                         
          EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY
                         
          A rickety, three-story, stone-and-shingle house on a hillside
          with turrets and a widow's walk. A weather vane swings
          creaking on the roof. Tree tops sway in a cluster below. The
          sea is almost invisible in the misting rain, and the mainland
          is a shadow across the sound. Suzy sits in the high window,
          watching.
                         
                         TITLES OVER:
                         
          The family stuck indoors all day out of the rain.
                         
          In bedrooms, bathrooms, and corridors, we see the boys. They
          shoot marbles. They throw jacks. They play cards. They eat
          grilled cheese sandwiches together in the kitchen.
                         
          In half-open doorways, we see the parents. Mr. Bishop is a
          tall, fifty-year-old man in Madras trousers and horn-rimmed
          glasses. He reads the newspaper and drinks coffee. Mrs.
          Bishop is a tan, forty-five-year-old woman in a Lilly
          Pulitzer-type wrap-around skirt. She washes her hair,
          topless, in the kitchen sink.
                         
          In windows, we see Suzy with her binoculars. She watches wet
          branches shaking in the woods. She watches a man in a slicker
          fishing from a row-boat. She watches a white colt in a field.
          She eats a bowl of tomato soup alone in the pantry.
                         
          In the distance, a seaplane flies by below the clouds.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          The edge of a cliff above a white beach. A rocky peninsula
          curls into the background. Brisk wind rustles the tall grass.
          A fifty-year-old man, bald on top with long hair on the
          sides, stands next to a surveyor's levelling instrument on a
          tripod. He wears rubber boots and a parka. He is the
          narrator. He speaks to the camera:
                         
                          NARRATOR
           This is the island of New Penzance.
           Sixteen miles long. Forested with old-
           growth pine and maple. Criss-crossed by
           shallow tidal creeks. An important
           seabird habitat. There are no paved roads
           but instead many miles of intersecting
           foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry
           that runs twice daily from Stone Cove.
           The year is 1965. We are on the far edge
           of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the
           ferocious and well-documented storm which
           will strike from the east on the fifth of
           September -- in three day's time.
           3.
                         
                         
          EXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY
                         
          A clearing in the woods with ten small, khaki tents pitched
          in a row. A banner on a flag-pole ripples in the wind. It
          reads Camp Ivanhoe. A bugler in a khaki uniform with a yellow
          neckerchief plays a staccato tattoo. He has a gauze patch
          over one eye. He is Lazy-Eye.
                         
          A thirty-five-year-old man in the same uniform emerges
          through the flaps of a larger tent. He is Scout Master Ward.
          He puts on a wide-brimmed felt hat. A badge on the crown
          reads Khaki Scouts, Troop 55. He lights a cigarette. A thin
          scout with curly hair and sunglasses joins him at his side.
          He is Gadge.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Morning, Gadge.
                         
                          GADGE
           Morning, sir.
                         
          Gadge flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book. Scout
          Master Ward goes over to a latrine made from thick sticks and
          rope. A tall, stooped scout digs a trench next to it with an
          army-shovel. He is Deluca.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Deluca. Latrine inspection.
                         
          Deluca stops digging. He pulls on a rope and water runs down
          a chute. It bursts through a valve, spins a little door, and
          a small, red flag flips up. Scout Master Ward nods.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Good.
                         
          Gadge makes a note. Scout Master Ward strides away. He stops
          in front of a scout with long hair over his eyes sitting on a
          stump twisting something in his fingers. He is Roosevelt.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Roosevelt. How's that lanyard coming?

          A small, woven, multi-colored cord with a rabbit's foot
          attached to the end of it. It has been braided exceedingly
          badly and is brutally twisted and misshapen.
           4.
                         
                         
          Scout Master Ward studies the lanyard briefly. He looks
          perplexed. He pats Roosevelt on the back gently and does a
          secret handshake with him. Gadge makes a note. Scout Master
          Ward strides away.
                         
          An off-road motorcycle races by in the background behind the
          tents. It jumps a mound of dirt, kicks sideways in the air,
          and revs away riding a wheelie. Scout Master Ward frowns.
                         
          Scout Master Ward stops in front of a pile of boards and logs
          stacked six feet high. A thick-set scout with black hair and
          a crooked tooth approaches with more logs in his arms. He is
          Skotak.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Skotak. What's all this lumber for?

           We're building a tree house.
                         
          Skotak points up. Scout Master Ward squints. There is a small
          platform under construction about sixty feet above them. Two
          scouts are sawing something in half on it. Scout Master Ward
          looks astonished.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           That's not a safe altitude.
                         
          Scout Master Ward circles around the trunk while looking up
          at the tree house. He stammers:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Why's it up so high? If somebody falls --
           it's a guaranteed death.
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Well, where would you've built it?

           Lower!
                         
          Gadge makes a note. Skotak looks sheepish. Scout Master Ward
          strides away. He stops in front of a very small scout with
          tiny eyes poking at an anthill with a stick. He appears to be
          contemplating pouring lighter fluid on it. He is Nickleby.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Nickleby. Spot check.
                         
          Nickleby stands up. He looks extremely disheveled.
           5.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Your socks are down. Your shirt-tails are
           untucked. Your trousers are not properly
           pressed. You are reported for uniform
           violation!
                         
          Gadge makes a note. Nickleby slouches. Scout Master Ward
          strides away. He stops in front of a work-bench covered with
          newspaper where one scout sifts green powder through a funnel
          into cardboard tubes and another makes wax stoppers with a
          metal press. They are Panagle and Izod. A sign on the side of
          the table reads No Smoking. Scout Master Ward hands his
          cigarette to Gadge, who holds it away at arm's length.

           That enough for the Jubilee?
                         
          Gadge shakes his head. Scout Master Ward turns to Izod.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Izod, go fetch another pint of gun-powder
           from the armory shed.
                         
          Izod dashes around the corner. Scout Master Ward strides
          away. He shouts:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Redford! Halt!
                         
          The motorcycle skids to a stop in front of Scout Master Ward,
          engulfing him in a thick cloud of dust. He coughs and waves
          his arms in the air. As the smoke clears, we see that the
          rider is a bronze, all-American-looking boy with blond hair.
          He is Redford. His motorcycle has flames painted on the gas
          tank. He tries to cover for himself:

          Gadge makes a note. Redford scowls. Scout Master Ward strides
          away. He walks past a scout in a white apron cooking bacon
          over a charcoal grill. He is Chef.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Morning, Chef.
                         
          Chef rings a bell hanging on a post. Scout Master Ward
          arrives at a long picnic table. He sits down and opens a
          magazine called Indian Corn. There is a picture on the cover
          of a scout troop crossing a bridge in Indonesia.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          The first page. A caption across the top reads Scout Master-
          in-Chief. There is a drawing of a seventy-year-old man on
          horseback. He has silver hair and a moustache. A signature
          below reads Commander Pierce. There is a quotation in large
          text: "An eagle was never hatched from a goose's egg."
                         
          As Scout Master Ward reads, all the scouts begin to join him
          one-by-one. They range in age from twelve to fifteen. They
          unscrew the tops of tin mess-kits and assemble folding
          utensils. The chef brings a tray of scrambled eggs to the
          table. The scouts serve themselves noisily.
                         
          Scout Master Ward starts to take a sip of coffee from a metal
          cup -- then stops. He looks up from his magazine.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Who's missing?
                         
          Scout Master Ward silently reels off a list of names,
          scanning the troop. He turns and shouts across the camp:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD

          Lazy-Eye plays another tattoo. Silence.
                         
          Scout Master Ward closes his magazine. He flicks his
          cigarette into a red bucket labelled Fire. He picks up a

           Shakusky? You in there?
                         
          Scout Master Ward tugs on the tent's flaps. He frowns. He
          says to Gadge:

           It's zipped from the inside.
                         
          The other scouts begin to gather with their tin breakfast
          plates in their hands, watching curiously while they eat.
          Scout Master Ward's voice softens:

          Scout Master Ward looks concerned. He produces a wooden-
          handled scout pocket-knife. He unfolds a few blades and
          gadgets and decides quickly on a thin tool with a hook on the
          end. He crouches down and slips the hook through a small gap
          at the base of the flap, twists left and right, then pulls up
          briskly, unzipping the tent.

          The lining of the tent is printed with images of trees and
          pine cones, and a plaid rug covers the floor. There is a foot
          locker, a gas lamp, a chair with a folded blanket over it,
          and an empty cot. Scout Master Ward steps inside slowly, bent
          over, examining the space. He lifts the lid of the foot
          locker. He looks under the corner of the mattress. He picks
          up a piece of folded yellow notebook paper sticking out from
          under a pillow. He opens it and stares at it. He turns
          suddenly to the chair against the wall of the tent and slides
          it aside.
                         
          There is neat but slightly jagged hole the size of a
          basketball cut through the fabric in the back corner. Scout
          Master Ward looks to his staring troop.

          A one-room bungalow with a sign on the door that reads Island
          Police. There is a wood-panelled station wagon parked
          alongside it with roller-lights on the roof and a sheriff's
          office insignia on the door. (This is the only car on the
          island.) A dock stretches from the cottage into a small

          A silver Airstream trailer is parked under a tree nearby.
                         
          A six-foot tall, forty-five-year-old man sits on a stool
          fishing from the side of the dock. He wears a short-sleeved
          police uniform with a black necktie and a baseball cap. His
          glasses have clear, plastic frames and a strap. He is Captain
          Sharp.
                         
          Two grouchy, leathery, very old men in plaid flannel and
          hunting caps fish alongside Captain Sharp. A speaker on a
          post emits an electric buzz. Captain Sharp turns. He stands
          up briskly and says to one of the old men:

           only the most recent incident involving

           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           You know, we're, actually, kind of, in
           the middle of something, if you didn't
           notice. This is a crisis. Anybody else?

           No, you're not. This is a non-violent
           rescue effort. Your instructions are to
           find him, not to hurt him. Under any
           circumstances. Do I make myself

           I'm going to change my answer, in fact.

          The troop moves in a wide line searching through a thicket of
          skinny trees. Redford carries a net and a giant tomahawk in a
          sling. Deluca has a large hunting knife tucked under his
          belt. Panagle holds a walking stick with a cluster of nails
          sticking out on the end of it. Nickleby, Izod, and Lazy-Eye
          all wear bows and quivers of arrows strapped to their backs.

          away down the front steps. He passes Lionel, Murray, and Rudy
          on their way up the path. They wear wet bathing suits and
          towels around their shoulders. Captain Sharp pats Rudy on the
          top of his head. He dries his hand on the leg of his

          driveway, circles through the woods, and drives around to a
          small dirt road a hundred yards behind the house. He stops
          the car. He gets out, sits on the hood, and lights a
          cigarette.

          the house carrying a basket of damp laundry. She pauses at a
          clothesline, looks left and right, then walks quickly into
          the trees. She crosses a foot-bridge and arrives at the dirt
          road. Captain Sharp stands up. They talk briefly but
          intensely. Mrs. Bishop leans against the car and stares into
          space. Captain Sharp touches her hair. Mrs. Bishop makes a
          gesture with her fingers. Captain Sharp hands her his
          cigarette. Mrs. Bishop takes a puff, hands it back, and
          strides away again through the woods. Captain Sharp gets into
          his station wagon and drives off.

           First day of search party for Sam
           Shakusky. Morale is extremely low, in
           part, I suppose, because Sam is,
           unfortunately, the least popular scout in
           the troop, by a significant margin. I'm
           worried, and I'm confused. Please, let us
           find him tomorrow. Please, don't let him
           fall off a cliff or drown in the goddamn
           lake or something. A terrible day at Camp

          deep in the forest. The boy from the snap-shot rows a mini-
          canoe painted with Native American tribal symbols and
          severely over-loaded with boxes, bags, and blankets. He wears
          a pellet gun slung on a strap over his shoulder and his coon-
          skin cap. He smokes a pipe. A sash across his chest is
          decorated with numerous small, embroidered patches. There is
          a woman's enamelled brooch pinned to his shirt. It is a
          jeweled, black scorpion. He whistles to himself quietly as he
          steers under a fallen tree-trunk and winds through gentle

          foot of the stage. (This is meant to be water.) The rest of
          the room is dim, with tall candles flickering along the
          center aisle. The beams are draped with garlands. A large
          congregation fills every pew plus folding chairs against the
          walls. More people sit and stand on the steps to the choir
          loft at the back and in nooks and corners. The members of a
          brass ensemble seated beside the organist wait for their next
          cue, following their sheet music with instruments poised.
                         
          Khaki Scouts and scout masters occupy the rear section of the

          his pockets. A slight, forty-year-old man in the same uniform

          doors behind them, and the next group takes their place to
          wait.
                         
          Sam walks slowly among otters, monkeys, squirrels, and
          skunks, examining their costumes, periodically touching
          horns, tusks, and teeth. No one pays attention to him. He
          drinks a sip from a water fountain. He picks up a mint from a
          bowl and sucks on it. He slips out through a swinging door.

          Sam moves down a dark corridor. Voices murmur. He pokes his
          head around a corner. A rack of choir robes and cassocks
          blocks his path. He slides two of them apart and looks
                         THROUGH AT:
                         
          Five eleven-year-old girls in black leotards sitting on a
          bench in front of a mirror framed with light bulbs. They talk
          quietly and fix their make-up. They all wear wings on their
          arms and beaks on their heads. Suzy sits among them in black
          feathers. Sam stares at her. He steps into the light
          silently. Suzy sees him in the reflection. The other girls
          turn around quickly, covering themselves.
                         
          Sam removes his cap and takes another step forward. His eyes
          dart briefly among the other girls. He says to Suzy:

          Suzy hesitates. She looks to the girl next to her, who says
          in a bossy voice:

          Sam is deeply intrigued by this. The other girls look
          puzzled. Suzy presses her hair back off her face. She watches
          Sam nervously.

          Sam nods with his eyes still glued to Suzy's. Suzy bites her
          fingernails. The bossy girl rolls her eyes.

          Mrs. Lynn does a double-take. She snaps at Sam:

          Sam hesitates. He spits the mint into a trash can, ducks out
          through the clothing rack, and is gone. A skinny girl dressed
          as an owl watches Suzy while the other girls hurry to their
          feet. She says quietly:

          in animal costumes flood out from the other. They criss-cross
          among grave-markers and head-stones. Sam stops abruptly, face
          to face with the skinny owl. She whispers something, points
          behind her, and thrusts a folded scrap of paper into Sam's

          Sam and Suzy in the middle of the lake. Suzy sits at one end
          of the canoe fishing with a bamboo pole. Sam drapes his
          fingers off the side and stirs the water.

          Sam dips a net into the lake and brings it up with a small
          turtle in it. He lifts it out of the net. It has red and
          yellow markings and a slightly damaged shell. Sam flips it
          over. The word Albert is written on the underside of the
          turtle in magic marker. Sam says blankly:

          Sam jumps to his feet and heaves the turtle with two hands.
          It sails through the air across the pond and splashes down
          with a whack. Sam yells an announcement:

           time-travel, if they make it realistic.
           Usually, I prefer a girl hero, but not

          Suzy stares at the books. She absently brushes some dust off

          fish into the campfire and throws her metal plate like a
          frisbee into a tree trunk. It bounces off with a ding. She
          stands up and says coolly:

          Suzy walks away. She goes behind a bush and sits down on a
          rock. She starts to cry. Sam looks stricken and confused. He
          is very still. He gets up slowly. He tentatively approaches
          the bush. He looks behind it. He takes two steps closer. He
          stands above Suzy. He unties his neckerchief, crouches down,
          and holds it out.

          Suzy dries her eyes. She unfolds the neckerchief and studies

          Dusk. Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his
          pipe while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him. She reads
          aloud from a book called The Francine Odyssies. There is an
          illustration on the cover of an enormous panther with a
          bloody sword walking behind a small girl in a nightgown.

          Murray, and Rudy sit at a folding card table. They have
          plates on place-mats and forks and knives. There is one extra

          to it from stake to stake marking a perimeter. Lazy-Eye walks
          with the wire-haired terrier pulling at its leash. Other

                         CUT TO:
                         
          Redford's charred, partially demolished motorcycle smoldering
          in the branches of a tree.
                         
          Suzy stands on the edge of the ravine staring at the pair of
          bloody scissors in her hand. She looks shaken. Sam takes the
          scissors, cleans them with his fingers, and hands them back
          to Suzy. He says gently:
                         
                          SAM
           It was him or us.
                         
          Suzy nods. She turns slowly away. Her eyes widen.
                         
                          SUZY
           Oh, no.
                         
          Suzy points. The wire-haired terrier lies on his back on the
          ground with an arrow sticking out between his shoulder
          blades. The kitten licks at the wound. Sam and Suzy run over
          to the wounded dog. Sam crouches down, gently presses the
          kitten away, and says bleakly:
                         
                          SAM
           They got Snoopy through the neck.
                         
          Suzy has tears in her eyes. She slides her hands under the
          wire-haired terrier's body. She begins to hyperventilate as
                         SHE SAYS:

          Sam puts his finger to the wire-haired terrier's neck. He
                         SAYS SADLY:
                         
                          SAM

          Suzy lifts the bleeding dog into her arms. Sam grabs her by
          the shoulders. He locks eyes with her and says with grit and
                         MELODRAMA:

          Sam slaps Suzy in the face. She falls silent. He says slowly:
                         
                          SAM

           emergency is you never --
                         
          Suzy drops the wire-haired terrier which hits the ground with
          a thud. She slaps Sam back with a huge, roundhouse smack. Sam
          falls over sideways. Suzy stands over him.
                         
                          SUZY
           Don't ever do that again. No one's
           allowed to slap me.
                         
          Sam stands up and dusts himself off. He and Suzy stare down
          at the lifeless animal. Suzy says quietly:
                         
                          SUZY
           You're right. He's dead.
                         
          Sam reaches into a side-picket of his back-pack and takes out
          an army-shovel. He assembles it. Suzy says hopefully:
           45.

          Pause. Sam shrugs. He says distantly, even cosmically:
                         
                          SAM
           Who's to say -- but he didn't deserve to
           die.
                         
          Suzy slowly wraps her arm around Sam's shoulder. They squeeze
          each other tightly. Sam sighs. He begins to dig.

          Captain Sharp speeds bouncing down a winding dirt road. Lazy-
          Eye, Deluca, and Gadge sit next to him crowded into the
          passenger seat. Lazy-Eye yells into the hand-set of the

           Repeat that, please? Over.
                         
          Captain Sharp grabs the hand-set out of Lazy-Eye's hand. He
          shouts into it:

          Redford is lying on his stomach on a towel in the rear of the
          vehicle. Scout Master Ward kneels next to him pressing his
          hand firmly into the middle of his back. There is significant
          blood. Redford moans loudly. Scout Master Ward reassures him:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD

          Scout Master Ward puts a pencil in Redford's teeth. Redford
          grimaces, crunching it. In the back seat, the rest of the

          Captain Sharp's station wagon skids to a stop next to his
          office while the seaplane pulls up to the dock as Mr. and
          Mrs. Bishop approach pedalling furiously on bicycles. Mr.
          Bishop wears boating shoes. Captain Sharp and Scout Master
          Ward jump out of the car. Skotak and Gadge help them remove
          Redford on a stretcher from the back of the station wagon.
          Mr. Bishop struggles with his kick-stand. He shouts:
                         
           MR. BISHOP

          Captain Sharp motions for the two old fishermen to get out of
          the way. He and Scout Master Ward run with the stretcher onto
          the dock. Mrs. Bishop is frantic:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP

          Gadge points toward the hills. A man wearing a jumpsuit and
          aviator sunglasses stands next to the seaplane. He is Jed. He
          shouts as the stretcher approaches:

          Captain Sharp motions for Skotak, Gadge, and Lazy-eye to help
          Jed load the stretcher into the small cockpit. He tosses a
          set of keys to Scout Master Ward and says:

           Warm up the motor. I'll be right back.
                         
          Scout Master Ward takes the keys and starts untying the
          police launch. Captain Sharp heads toward his office. Mr.
          Bishop says firmly:

           Why can't you control your scouts?
                         
          Scout Master Ward recoils. He says quietly, troubled:

          Mr. Bishop takes off his shoe and throws it at Scout Master
          Ward. Scout Master Ward ducks, and the shoe bounces off his
          back. Captain Sharp blocks Mr. Bishop.

          Master Ward waits behind him with Gadge, Skotak, and Lazy-
          Eye. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop stride up out of the water. Mr.
          Bishop looks incensed. They are wet to the waist. The police
          launch is moored in the lagoon. Two larger boats with St.
          Jack Wood Fire Brigade printed on their hulls float further
          away. Men in red caps stand on their decks.
                         
          Suzy pulls Sam back inside. She zips up the tent again. She
          kisses Sam. Mr. Bishop hollers:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Suzy! Get out here!
                         
          Mr. Bishop grabs hold of the entire tent by the top and rips
          it up out of the ground, uprooting the stakes which go
          flying. This reveals:
                         
          Sam and Suzy, half-naked, entwined, kissing.
                         
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop both freeze. Sam and Suzy look up to
          them. Mr. Bishop growls and roars at them ferociously like a
          monster. Sam and Suzy look horrified. Mr. Bishop's face
          suddenly drains of all emotion. Pause. Mrs. Bishop commands
          Sam and Suzy:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Put your clothes on. Both of you.
                         
          Sam and Suzy remain perfectly still. Mrs. Bishop grabs Suzy
          by the arm and jerks her to her feet. Sam and Suzy hang onto
          each other. Mrs. Bishop slaps Suzy with a whack. Sam lets go,
          and Suzy is gone.
                         
          Scout Master Ward comes over to Sam sadly and hands him his
          uniform. Sam takes it. Scout Master Ward turns to the other
          scouts, claps his hands twice, and says:

          Scout Master Ward turns to Sam. He holds out the envelope.
          Sam takes it. He opens it. He reads. Suzy watches him from

          Sam holds out the note. Mr. Bishop pulls Suzy back down to
          her seat. He stands up, himself, and walks over to Sam. He
          takes him by the wrist and leads him to a small cabin. He
          opens the door and presses him forward. Sam stumbles down the
          steps and looks back. Mr. Bishop shuts the door. Captain
          Sharp glares at him. Suzy says icily:

          and reads on:

           He leapt out the window and landed in the
           fresh-fallen snow.
                         
          EXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY
                         
          The next morning. Camp Ivanhoe. Scout Master Ward emerges
          from his tent. He puts on his hat. The wind whips it off his
          head. He chases it, catches it, and puts it back on with the
          chin-strap tight. He frowns. He shouts:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           No bugle? No reveille? Lazy-eye, Gadge,
           Deluca, Izod? Where's my troop? Let's go!
           You're late!
                         
          Scout Master Ward tries to light a cigarette, but the match
          blows out. He walks past the latrine, the workbench, the row
          of smaller tents, and the charcoal grill. He throws his hands
          into the air.
           74.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Chef? Breakfast?
                         
          Scout Master Ward shakes his head. He arrives at the picnic
          table and rings his bell. He sits down. He opens a new issue
          of Indian Corn. There is a picture on the cover of a scout
          troop rappelling in Tasmania. He struggles to keep the
          rippling pages from turning by themselves.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          The first page. There is another drawing of the Scout Master-
          in-Chief. This time he is behind the wheel of a ship. His
          signature below, once again, reads Commander Pierce. There is
          a quotation in large text: "Anyone can hold the helm when the
          sea is calm."
                         
          Pause. Scout Master Ward lowers his magazine. He looks
          around, confused. Something dawns on him.
                         
          INT. COMMAND TENT. DAY
                         
          A small entourage of teenage scouts studies maps, charts, and
          documents at folding tables. One of them sits at a telegraph
          machine. He wears headphones and taps Morse code on a paddle
          as he listens to a transmission. He looks puzzled. He swivels
          his chair to a steno-machine and begins typing rapidly.
                         
          EXT. COMMAND TENT. DAY
                         
          A triple-sized tent with a canopy in front and a large totem
          pole looming over it. It stands on five-foot stilts. There is
          a school bus parked next to it with letters painted across
          its side which read Regional Jubilee.
                         
          A forty-five-year-old scout master with several medals on his
          chest is sharpening a straight razor. He is Secretary
          McIntire. He adjusts a hot towel on the face of a man in a
          barber's chair.
                         
          The young telegraph operator hurries out of the tent carrying
          a strip of paper. He hands it to Secretary McIntire.
          Secretary McIntire stares at it. He says to the man under the
                         TOWEL:
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
           You're not going to believe this one,
           sir. That Scout Master on New Penzance?
           Has now lost his entire troop.
                         
          The seated man whips the towel off his face and rises to his
          feet. He is Commander Pierce himself. He has silver hair, a
          moustache, and a much greater number of medals. He says in
          disbelief as he snatches the slip of paper:
           75.

           I couldn't say.
                         
          Commander Pierce shakes his head. He continues to study the
          document as he sits back down. Secretary McIntire begins to
          lather his cheeks with a brush.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A vast archway of wood, straw, and rope construction. Fort
          Lebanon is spelled out across the top with bound sticks. A
          large flag waving madly on a pole reads Khaki Scouts of North
          America. A bugler on a platform plays the familiar staccato
          tattoo. It echoes for miles.
                         
          Sam and Suzy wait inside the gates crouched behind a row of
          trash cans with the rest of the troop except Skotak. They
          shiver. Sam has on his back-pack. Suzy carries her suitcase.
          Gadge holds a tennis ball can.
                         
          A scout master in an Indian chief's headdress stops as he
          walks by. He looks curiously at Sam and especially Suzy. He
          says to Nickleby:
                         
                          GUARD SCOUT
           Who's your unit leader?
                         
          Pause. Nickleby points to a fat man in an apron cooking
          hamburgers on a grill.
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           That guy.
                         
          The scout master shrugs. Skotak comes over and says
                         FURTIVELY:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           There's a broken gum-ball machine behind
           the snack tent.
                         
          Skotak distributes a handful of gum-balls among Sam, Suzy,
          and the rest of the troop. They all put them in their mouths.
          Skotak motions for everyone to follow him.
                         
          A footbridge across a stream leads to a Quonset hut with an
          awning in front labelled Supply Tent. A crowd of very young
          scouts waits at a wide counter bartering over boxes of food,
          drink, and equipment. A team of helpers collects money and
          packages goods. At the center, there is a twenty-year-old
           76.
                         
                         
          scout with a pencil behind his ear. He is Cousin Ben. He says
          to a nine-year-old Junior Khaki:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           I don't care how they do it where you
           come from. You want pop? You want candy?
           You want a snake-bite kit? Get some
           money.
                         
          Skotak appears and whispers something to Cousin Ben. Cousin
          Ben nods. He says to his customers:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Come back in five minutes.
                         
          Cousin Ben pulls a curtain shut behind the counter.
                         
          EXT. WOODEN PROMENADE. DAY
                         
          Sam, Suzy, Skotak and the rest of the troop follow Cousin Ben
          briskly out a door and onto a cat-walk that runs along the
          top of a wall made from tall, pointed logs. As they talk,
          they walk past dozens of rows and clusters of tents grouped
          by color in the fields below. They walk past towers, huts,
          ladders, latrines, and a catapult under construction. They
          walk past a white infirmary with a red cross on it and a
          doctor taking a boy's blood pressure. They walk past a fleet
          of small, antique sailboats flying assorted troop banners.
          Five hundred scouts and fifty scout masters work, eat, talk,
          cook, and play sports and games all around the compound in
          spite of the fierce winds. One group rides motorcycles,
          another fires model rockets, another flies by overhead on a
          cable-trolley.
                         
          Cousin Ben points to Sam and asks Skotak over the sound of
                         THE WIND:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN

                          SKOTAK
           Seventy-six dollars -- but it's mostly in
           nickels.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN

          Skotak motions for Gadge to hand Cousin Ben the tennis ball
          can. It appears to be very heavy and jingles as it moves.
          Cousin Ben takes it. He says to Sam:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN

           Yes, sir.
                         
          Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has an
          anchor embroidered on it.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Good. There's cold-water crabber moored
           off Broken Rock. The skipper owes me an
           I.O.U. We'll see if he can take you on as
           a claw cracker. It won't be an easy life,
           but it's better than shock therapy.
                         
                          SAM
           Thank you, sir. By the way, where's the
           chapel tent?
                         
          Cousin Ben hesitates. He points behind them with his thumb:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Back there, but the padre's home with the

                          SAM
           I want to bring my wife.
                         
          Cousin Ben stops walking. He looks Sam up and down. Suzy says
                         BEHIND HIM:
                         
                          SUZY
           But we're not married yet.
                         
          Cousin Ben turns to Suzy. He looks back to Sam and back to
          Suzy again.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           You his girl?
                         
          Suzy nods. Cousin Ben looks intrigued. He says tentatively:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Technically, I'm a civil-law scrivener.
           I'm authorized to declare births, deaths,
           and marriages. You're kind of young. You

          Sam and Suzy shake their heads. Cousin Ben nods. He speaks
          more gently now:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           I can't offer you a legally binding
           union. It won't hold up in the state, the
           county, or, frankly, any courtroom in the
           world due to your age, lack of a license,
           and failure to get parental consent --
           but the ritual does carry a very
           important moral weight within yourselves.
           You can't enter into this lightly. Do you
           love each other?
                         
          Sam and Suzy immediately nod. Cousin Ben continues:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Are you sure you're ready for this?
                         
          Sam and Suzy immediately nod. Cousin Ben looks perturbed.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Let me rephrase it.

           everybody.
                         
          Cousin Ben puts out his hand. Suzy spits her gum into his
          palm. He throws it away over his shoulder. Sam and the rest
          of the troop spit their gum out on the ground. Cousin Ben
                         SAYS STERNLY:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           I don't like the snappy attitude. This is
           the most important decision you've made
           in your lives. Now go over by that
           trampoline and talk it through before you
           give me another quick answer.
                         
          Cousin Ben watches as Sam and Suzy walk away and stand next
          to a large trampoline. A small scout jumps from a high
          ladder, bounces, and does a back-flip.

          Sam and Suzy uncertain how to begin the conversation. Sam

                          SUZY
           Maybe he's right. It could be a mistake.
                         
          Sam looks stunned. He is speechless. He stammers:
                         
                          SAM
           What? Why? How?
                         
                          SUZY
           Being married. Sometimes it seems sad to
           me. It might be better to just go steady
           permanently.
                         
          Sam shakes his head. He looks off into the distance. He says
                         QUIETLY:

          Cousin Ben counting nickels in the tennis ball can. He jerks
          his thumb toward Sam and Suzy and says dismissively:

          Cousin Ben looks. Suzy has her hands around Sam's throat and
          is throttling him. Sam squirms loose and calms her down. The
          troop watches transfixed. Sam takes a snapshot out of his
          pocket and shows it to Suzy, explaining. Suzy nods. They come
          back over to the group. There are tears on Suzy's cheeks. She
          says to Cousin Ben:

          Ben glares at them. He sighs. He points to Skotak.

          Cousin Ben points to the tennis ball can on the floor next to

          Sam and Suzy turn and walk out of the chapel tent holding
          hands. They do not smile. Cousin Ben, Skotak, and the rest of
          the troop follow them with grave expressions on their faces.
          Sam touches Suzy's hair. Suzy kisses Sam's hand. They walk as
          a group through the camp.

          Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop wait at the end
          of a narrow dock. Cousin Ben stands below them in a small
          sailboat. He reaches up to Suzy and lifts her onboard. He
          reaches up to Sam and lifts him onboard, too. He rigs the
          sail.
                         
          Sam smiles sadly. He and Skotak do the secret handshake. The
          others quickly join in. Suzy blows them a kiss. Everyone
          looks choked up.
                         
          Cousin Ben unloops a line. The sails quickly catch the strong
          wind, and the boat sails away into the harbor. Skotak and the
          rest of troop wave and salute. They watch, bittersweet.

          Sam whips the binoculars out of Redford's hands, turns away,

          An emergency alarm sounds. The entire camp swings into
          action. Two teams of scouts playing capture-the-flag descend
          from both sides and cut Sam off from the dock. They wear red
          and yellow jerseys over their uniforms.
                         
          Suzy jumps out of the boat onto the dock. Sam sees her beyond
          the blockade of scouts. She waves her arms. Sam throws up his
          hands. He sprints in a new direction, onto a wide field.
          There is a small, pink flag on a thin stick stuck in the
          ground at the center of a plastic ring. Sam grabs it as he
          runs past. He looks back and sees:

          and stops at the top.
                         
          Sam looks down at the approaching scouts and hundreds of
          others watching. A dark cloud rolls in casting a giant shadow
          over the entire camp. Sam throws the little flag down at his
          pursuers like a javelin. It sails in an arc and pokes down
          into the grass. There is a thunderclap. Sam looks up into the
          sky.

          Sam is thrown ten feet through the air and lands on his back.
          The tennis ball can explodes nickels. The mob of scouts stops
          with a jolt. They look terrified. Sam sits up. He is covered
          in black soot. His shoes are on fire. He shakes them off his
          feet.

          Gushing water pours down the hillside, cuts a swath through
          the center of the camp, and tears down everything in its

          onto the command tent, splitting it down the middle. Inside,
          something sparks, pops, then blows up. The tent bursts into
          flames.
                         
          Secretary McIntire does not react. He stands perfectly still,
          watching the fire. Scout Master Ward taps him, grabs him, and
          shakes him. Secretary McIntire looks at him blankly. Scout
          Master Ward makes a snap decision. He turns to the company
                         AND SHOUTS:

          Scout Master Ward runs ahead, splashes into the raging flood,
          wades through it against the current, dodging branches and
          debris, then pulls himself up onto the fallen totem pole and
          walks balancing on it to the burning tent. He disappears
          inside.

          onto the other end of the fallen totem pole carrying
          Commander Pierce over his shoulders. He descends back into
          the water, trudges through it, and steps up onto the
          embankment. The company looks deeply, permanently impressed.

          Captain Sharp looks up to the choir loft. Eleven children
          dressed in animal masks sit quietly in a row. Captain Sharp
          does a double-take. One of the animals is an otter wearing
          Sunday-school shoes and binoculars around its neck. Next to
          her is the male of the species in a sash with numerous small,

          Skotak hesitates. He and the rest of the troop all look up to
          a small, rickety, attic door. It is slightly ajar above a
          long, narrow ladder behind the pipes of the organ.
                         
          Captain Sharp bolts up the steps. Everyone follows him,
          running.
                         
          EXT. CHURCH ROOF. NIGHT
                         
          The storm rages. Captain Sharp opens a trap door onto the
          high eaves. Faces appear in numerous windows below, looking
          up. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop poke their heads out behind Captain
          Sharp. On the far end of the rooftop, Sam and Suzy huddle
          together at the base of the high steeple.
                         
          Captain Sharp stares up at Sam and Suzy, dumbstruck.
                         
          Sam and Suzy quickly start climbing a rusty gutter up the
          side of the steeple. Captain Sharp looks astonished. He
                         HOLLERS:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Halt! Stop!
                         
          Sam and Suzy continue to climb. Captain Sharp shouts back to
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop over the roaring wind:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP

          Scout Master Ward appears and thrusts out the coil of rope.
          He yells to Captain Sharp:

          Captain Sharp throws the rope over his shoulder and advances.
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop both crawl out after him, but Scout
          Master Ward pulls them back. Mr. Bishop looks to Mrs. Bishop.
          They are both terrified and helpless. They hold on to each
          other tightly.

          Captain Sharp tight-rope-walking along the edge of the
          slippery roof with his arms stretched out sideways,
          balancing. He army-crawls up steep slate shingles and reaches
          the bottom of the steeple. He looks up. Sam and Suzy have
          arrived at the top. They inch away sideways around a ledge
          and disappear to the other side. Captain Sharp's voice
                         STRAINS:

           down!
                         
          Captain Sharp rubs his eyes. He knots one end of the rope
          around his waist and ties the other to a pipe at the foot of
          the gutter. He pulls the rope tight, presses his foot on the
          wall, and gets ready to start climbing -- then stops
          suddenly. He hesitates. He pulls the walkie-talkie off his
          belt and yells into it:

          The entire church has become an island. The cemetery is under
          water, and the circling streets are fast rivers. Suzy turns
          to Sam. They both appear relatively calm.

          Skotak and the young boy out of the tent. The narrator
                         CONTINUES:

           The coastal areas of New Penzance were
           battered and changed forever.

          The narrator's nautical chart. The cove is no longer
          identified.

           Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet was erased from the

          EXT. WIDE MEADOW. DAY
                         
          One year later. The sky is blue. Wildflowers grow in the tall
          grass. The narrator, now in shirtsleeves, concludes:

           But harvest yields the following autumn
           far exceeded any previously recorded, and
           the quality of the crops was said to be
           extraordinary.
                         
          The narrator lingers for a moment, looking into the camera --
          then turns away and walks down the hillside.
                         
          INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY
                         
          The landing at the top of the staircase. The portable record
          player sits on the braided rug with the turntable spinning. A
          child's voice says over the speaker:
           104.
                         
                         
           RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)
           So you see, the composer Benjamin Britten
           has taken the whole orchestra apart. Now
           he puts it back together again in a
           fugue.
                         
          Lionel, Murray, and Rudy lie on the floor on their stomachs,
          propped up with their chins on their fists. They listen.
                         
          Suzy sits in a small armchair reading a book called The
          Return of Auntie Lorraine. There is an illustration on the
          cover of a leathery, old woman and a girl with a pony-tail
          looking together into a crystal ball. The kitten scratches at
          Suzy's feet.
                         
          Sam sits on a stool painting a picture at the small easel. He
          wears a miniature version of Captain Sharp's short-sleeved
          uniform with a black necktie and a baseball cap.
                         
          Mrs. Bishop's amplified voice booms from the bottom of the
                         STAIRS:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)
           Suzy? Lionel, Murray, Rudy! Dinner!
                         
          Sam starts. Lionel, Murray, and Rudy look up from the record
          player. Suzy is impassive. Mr. Bishop's voice takes over the
                         MEGAPHONE:
                         
           MR. BISHOP (O.S.)
           Don't make us ask twice!
                         
          Lionel, Murray, and Rudy jump to their feet and race down the
          stairs. Sam dashes to the window. He opens it, climbs out,
          and disappears. Suzy closes her book and rises to her feet.
          Sam's head pokes back up from below. He and Suzy lock eyes.
                         
          Sam smiles. He whispers to Suzy urgently:
                         
                          SAM
           See you tomorrow.
                         
          Suzy smiles back. Sam ducks away. Suzy goes over to the
          window and looks out with her binoculars.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A binocular shot of Sam dropping to the ground and running
          across the back lawn, into the trees. He comes out on the
          dirt road where Captain Sharp waits, sitting on the hood of
          his station wagon, smoking a cigarette. They both get into
          the car and drive off.
           105.
                         
                         
          Suzy lowers the binoculars. She pauses in front of the easel
          and looks at the picture. She walks quietly away down the
          stairs. The kitten follows her. The record continues to play
          on the empty landing.
                         
          The camera moves in toward Sam's painting on the easel. It is
          a watercolor landscape of Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. The tent is
          pitched on the beach, and Sam's and Suzy's clothes hang on
          the clothesline. Written in the sand with seashells just at
          the water's edge are the words:
