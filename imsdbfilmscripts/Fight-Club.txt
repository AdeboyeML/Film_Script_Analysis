     SCREEN BLACK

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 People were always asking me, did I
                 know Tyler Durden.

     FADE IN:

     INT.  SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT

     TYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand
     holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH.
     Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap.

     They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler
     is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a
     dry sort of way.  Tyler looks at his watch.

                             TYLER
                 One minute.
                       (looking out window)
                 This is the beginning.  We're at
                 ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
                 few words, to mark the occasion.

                             JACK
                 ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With a gun barrel between your teeth,
                 you only speak in vowels.

     Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

                             JACK
                       (still distorted)
                 I can't think of anything.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With my tongue, I can feel the
                 rifling in the barrel.  For a second,
                 I totally forgot about Tyler's whole
                 controlled demolition thing and I
                 wondered how clean this gun is.

     Tyler checks his watch.

                             TYLER
                 It's getting exciting now.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 That old saying, how you always hurt
                 the one you love, well, it works both
                 way.

     Jack turns so that he can see down -- 31 STORIES.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 We have front row seats for this
                 Theater of Mass Destruction.  The
                 Demolitions Committee of Project
                 Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns
                 of ten buildings with blasting
                 gelatin.  In two minutes, primary
                 charges will blow base charges, and
                 those buildings will be reduced to
                 smoldering rubble.  I know this
                 because Tyler knows this.

                             TYLER
                 Look what we've accomplised.
                       (checks watch)
                 Thirty seconds.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Somehow, I realize all of this -- the
                 gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is
                 really about Marla Singer.

     PULL BACK from Jack's face.  It's pressed against TWO LARGE
     BREASTS that belong to...BOB, 45, a moose of a man.  Jack is
     engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace.  Bob weeps openly.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Bob had bitch tits.

     PULL BACK to wide on...

     INT. CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     Men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones.
     Near the door, a SIGN on a stand: "REMAINING MEN TOGETHER."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This was a support group for men with
                 testicular cancer.  The big moosie
                 slobbering all over me was Bob.

                             BOB
                 We're still men.

                             JACK
                 Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Six months ago, Bob's testicles were
                 removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He
                 developed bitch tits because his
                 testosterone was too high and his
                 body upped the estrogen.  That was
                 where my head fit -- into his huge,
                 sweating tits that hung enormous, the
                 way we think of God's as big.

                             BOB
                 They're gonna have to open my pec's
                 again to drain the fluid.

     Bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes.

                             BOB
                 Okay.  You cry now.

     Jack looks at Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Wait.  Back up.  Let me start earlier.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 For six months.  I could not sleep.

     INT. COPY ROOM - DAY

     Jack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine.  His Starbucks cup
     sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With insomnia, nothing is real.
                 Everything is far away.  Everything
                 is a copy of a copy of a copy.

     Other people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping.
     Jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME

     Jack, sipping, stares blankly at a Starbucks bag on the
     floor, full of newspapers and FAST FOOD GARBAGE.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When deep space exploration ramps up,
                 it will be corporations that name
                 everything.  The IBM Stellar Sphere.
                 The Philip Morris Galaxy.  Planet
                 Starbucks.

     Jack looks up as a pudgy man, Jack's BOSS, enters, Starbucks
     cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on Jack's desk.

                             BOSS
                 I'm going to need you out-of-town a
                 little more this week.  We've got
                 some "red-flags" to cover.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It must've been Tuesday.  he was
                 wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.

                             JACK
                       (listless management speak)
                 You want me to de-prioritize my
                 current reports until you advise of
                 a status upgrade?

                             BOSS
                 You need to make these your primary
                 "action items."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was full of pep.  Must've had his
                 grande latte enema.

                             BOSS
                 Here are your flight coupons.  Call
                 me from the road if there are any
                 snags.  Your itinerary...

     Jack hides a yawn, pretends to listen.

     INT. BATHROOM - JACK'S CONDO - NIGHT

     Jack sits on the toilet, CORDLESS PHONE to his ear, flips
     through an IKEA catalog.  There's a stack of old Playboy
     magazines and other catalogs nearby.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Like everyone else, I had become a
                 slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 Yes.  I'd like to order the Erika
                 Pekkari slip covers.

     Jack drops the open catalog on the floor.

     MOVE IN ON CATALOG -- ON PHOTO of COFFEETABLE SET...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If I saw something like clever coffee
                 table sin the shape of a yin and
                 yang, I had to have it.

     PAN TO PHOTO of ARMCHAIR...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Like the Johanneshov armchair in the
                 Strinne green stripe pattern...

     INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING AREA/KITCHEN

     The armchair APPEARS.  PAN OVER next to armchair...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Or the Rislampa wire lamps of
                 environmentally-friendly unbleached
                 paper.

     The lamps APPEAR.  PAN OVER to wall...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Even the Vild hall clock of
                 galvanized steel, resting on the
                 Klipsk shelving unit.

     The clock APPEARS as the shelving unit APPEARS on the wall.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I would flip through catalogs and
                 wonder, "What kind of dining set
                 defines me as a person?"  We used to
                 read pornography.  Now it was the
                 Horchow Collection.

     A dining room set APPEARS.  Jack, the cordless phone still
     glued to his ear, walks INTO FRAME and continues.

                             JACK
                 No, I don't want Cobalt.  Oh, that
                 sounds nice.  Apricot.

     Jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I had it all.  Even the glass dishes
                 with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
                 proof they were crafted by the
                 honest, simple, hard-working
                 indigenous peoples of wherever.

     He rummages through the refrigerator.  It's practically
     empty.  Jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses
     a butter knife to eat it.

     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before an INTERN, who
     studies him with bemusement.

                             INTERN
                 No, you can't die of insomnia.

                             JACK
                 Maybe I died already.  Look at my
                 face.

                             INTERN
                 You need to lighten up.

                             JACK
                 Can't you give me something?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red
                 Seconals.

                             INTERN
                       (overlapping w/ above)
                 You need healthy, natural sleep.
                 Chew valerian root and get some more
                 exercise.

     The Intern ushes Jack to the door.  They step into the...

     INT. HALLWAY

     The Intern walks away from Jack, picks up a chart.

                             JACK
                 I'm in pain.

                             INTERN
                       (facetious)
                 You want to see pain?  Swing by First
                 Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the
                 guys with testicular cancer.  That's
                 pain.

     The Intern moves into the other room.  Jack stares after him.

     EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack heads for the front door.

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all
     listening to a group member speak at a lectern.  The SPEAKER
     has pale skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying.

                             SPEAKER
                 I... wanted three kids.  Two boys and
                 a girl.  Mindy wanted two girls and
                 one boy.  We never could agree on
                 anything.

     The Speaker cracks a sad smile.  Some men chuckle, happy to
     lighten the mood.

                             SPEAKER
                 Well, she had her first child a month
                 ago, a girl, with her new husband...
                 And, Thank God.  I'm glad for her,
                 because she deserves...

     The speaker breaks down, WEEPS UNCONTROLLABLY.

     Jack watches.  A couple of the men go up to the speaker,
     comforting him, leading him away.  A LEADER takes the stand.

                             LEADER
                 Everyone, let's thank Thomas for
                 sharing himself with us.

     Jack, uncomfortable, joins EVERYONE ELSE:

                             EVERYONE
                       (in unison)
                 Thank you, Thomas.

                             LEADER
                 I look around this room and I see a
                 lot of courage.  And it gives me
                 strength.  We give each other
                 strength.

     Jack looks around.  Many of the men are sniffling, sobbing.
     Jack squirms in his seat.

                             LEADER
                 It's time for the one-on-one.  Let's
                 follow Thomas's example and open
                 ourselves.

     Everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off.
     Jack stands, uncomfortable.

                             LEADER
                 Can everyone find a partner?

     Bob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward Jack,
     shuffling his feet.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The big moosie, his eyes already
                 shrink-wrapped in tears.  Knees
                 together, invisible steps.

     Bob takes Jack into an embrace.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You
                 know that chest expansion program you
                 see on TV?  That was his idea.

                             BOB
                 ...using steroids.  I was a juicer.
                 Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for
                 racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm
                 bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids
                 won't return my calls...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Strangers with this kind of honesty
                 make me go a big rubbery one.

     Bob breaks into sobbing, putting his head on Jack's shoulder
     and completely covering Jack's face.  After a long beat of
     crying, Bob raises up his head, looks at Jack's NAMETAG.

                             BOB
                 Go ahead, Cornelius.  You can cry.

     They look at each other.  Slowly, Jack's eyes grow wet.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Then... something happened.  I was
                 lost in oblivion -- dark and silent
                 and complete.

     Bob pulls Jack's head back into his chest.  Jack tightens
     his arms around Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I found freedom.  Losing all hope was
                 freedom.

     Jack pulls away from Bob.  On Bob's chest, there's a WET
     MASK of Jack's face from how he looks weeping.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Babies don't sleep this well.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies sound asleep.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I became addicted.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack moves into a "group hug" of sickly people, men and
     women.  In view is a sign by the door "Free and Clear."

     INT. OFFICE BUILDING BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Jack stands with a weeping middle-aged WOMAN.  He begins to
     cry along with her.  A sign by the door: "Onward and Upward."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If I didn't say anything, people
                 assumed the worst.  They cried
                 harder.  I cried harder.

     INT. PUBLIC BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

     Everyone, including Jack, sits back in their seats, EYES
     CLOSED.  The Leader speaks into a microphone.

                             LEADER
                 Tonight, we're going to open the
                 green door -- the heart chakra...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host
                 to cancer or parasites; I was the
                 warm little center that the life of
                 this world crowded around.

                             LEADER
                 ...And you open the door and you
                 step inside.  We're inside our
                 hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a
                 white ball of healing light.  That's
                 right, the pain itself is a ball of
                 healing light.

     Jack, eyes closed, is silent...

                             LEADER
                 It moves over your body, healing you.
                 Keep this going and step forward,
                 through the back door of the room.
                 Where does it lead?  To your cave.
                 Step forward into your cave.

     INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     Jack walks along, moving through an ICE CAVERN...

                             LEADER'S VOICE
                 That's right.  You're going deeper
                 into your cave.  And you're going to
                 find your power animal...

     Jack comes upon a PENGUIN.  The penguin looks at him, cocks
     his head to signal Jack forward.

                             PENGUIN
                 Slide.

     The penguin jumps onto a patch of ICE and slides away.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jack walks out a doorway, saying goodbye to people.  He
     walks down the sidewalk, shining with peace.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Every evening I died and every
                 evening I was born again.  Resurrected.

                                                      CUT BACK TO:

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - RESUMING

     Jack's still in an embrace with Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Bob loved me because he thought my
                 testicles were removed too.  Being
                 there, my face against his tits,
                 ready to cry -- this was my vacation.

     MARLA SINGER enters.  She has short matte black hair and
     big, dark eyes like a character from japanese animation.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And, she ruined everything.

     Marla looks around, raises a cigarette to her lips.

                             MARLA
                 This is cancer, right?

     Bob and Jack stare, dumbfounded.

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - LATER

     Everyone paired-off.  MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND JACK'S FACE
     as he stares... MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND MARLA'S FACE.
     She's drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This ... chick ... Marla Singer ...
                 did not have testicular cancer.  She
                 was a liar.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Marla sits with the group, smoking, listening intently while
     a member speaks.  Jack spies on her.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 She had no diseases at all.  I had
                 seen her at my melanoma Monday night
                 group ...

     INT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     Marla sits at the end of a row, smoking.  All the faces down
     the row are turned toward her, incredulous...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 ... and at "Free and Clear," my blood
                 parasites group Thursdays.

     Jack leans out further than the others, scornful.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 -- And, again, at "Seize The Day," my
                 tuberculosis Friday night.

                                                      CUT BACK TO:

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

     Jack watches... Marla's eyes are closed, her head on the
     shoulder of the MAN she's embraced by.  She opens her eyes,
     catching Jack's stare.  Jack looks away.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Marla -- the big tourist.  Her lie
                 reflected my lie.

     Marla rests her chin on the man's shoulder.  Tears roll down
     her cheeks.  She wipes at them.

     EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

     Marla walks out,  The support group's dispersing.  Jack
     exits amongst them.  He spots Marla walking away.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And suddenly, I felt nothing.  I
                 couldn't cry.  So, once again, I
                 could not sleep.

     Jack stares after Marla for a long moment.  He walks away.

     INT. BEDROOM - LATER

     Jack, in underwear, is cross-legged on the floor, assembling
     IKEA furniture, CORDLESS PHONE shouldered to his ear.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 No, I just can't believe that card is
                 declined -- Okay, okay, let me give
                 you a different card number.

     Jack gets his wallet off the floor, pulls out another card
     and, MOS over the following, he reads it into the phone.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Next group, after guided meditation,
                 after we open our chakras, when it's
                 time to hug, I'm going to grab that
                 little bitch, Marla Singer, pin her
                 arms against her sides and say...

     INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     CLOSE ON JACK as he CLAMPS his arms around Marla.

                             JACK
                 Marla, you liar, you big tourist.  I
                 need this.  Get out.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack, in pajamas, stares at Home Shopping Network on his TV.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When you have insomnia, you're never
                 really asleep and you're never really
                 awake.  I hadn't slept in four days...

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack walks in and joins the crowd, looking around.  People
     are chattering with each other.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 -- But, in here, in everyone, there's
                 the squint of a five-day headache.
                 Yet they forced themselves to be
                 positive.  They never said
                 "parasite;" they said "agent."  They
                 always talked about getting better.

                             LEADER
                 Okay, everyone.

     Everyone sits in chairs.  Jack catches sight of Marla.

                             LEADER
                 To open tonight's communion, Chloe
                 would like to say a few words.

     Taking the lectern is CHLOE, a pale, sickly girl whose skin
     stretches yellowish and tight over her bones.  She wears a
     head bondage.  She clears her throat.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Ahh, Chloe.  Chloe looked the way
                 Joni Mitchell's skeleton would look
                 if you made it smile and walk around
                 a party being extra nice to everyone.

                             CHLOE
                 Well, I'm still here -- but I don't
                 know for how long.  That's as much
                 certainty as anyone can give me.  but
                 I've got some good news -- I no
                 longer have any fear of death.

     APPLAUSE from around the room.

                             CHLOE
                 But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
                 No one will have sex with me.  I'm so
                 close to the end and all I want is to
                 get laid for the last time.  I have
                 pornographic movies in my apartment,
                 and lubricants and amyl nitrate ...

     The LEADER gingerly takes control of the microphone.

                             LEADER
                 Thank you, Chloe.  Everyone, let's
                 thank Chloe.

                             EVERYONE
                 Thank you, Chloe.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER

                             LEADER
                 Now, you're standing at the entrance
                 to your cave.  You step inside your
                 cave and you walk.  Keep walking.

     Jack's face, eyes closed, is motionless.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If I did have a tumor, I'd name it
                 Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on
                 the roof of your mouth that would
                 heal if only you could stop tonguing
                 it, but you can't.

                             LEADER
                 Now, find your power animal.

     INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     Jack finds Marla smoking a cigarette.  Marla cocks her head,
     indicating whe wants him to --

                             MARLA
                 Slide.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - RESUMING

     Jack's eyes open and turn to Marla, watching her blow smoke
     rings with her eyes closed.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER

     Everyone stands and mills about, pairing-off.

                             LEADER
                 Pick someone special to you tonight.

     Jack sees the ghastly spectre of Chloe ambling towards him.
     He tries to smile.  She smiles with a twisted, dying mouth.

                             CHLOE
                 Hello, Mr. Tayler.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I never gave my real name at support
                 groups.

                             JACK
                 Hi, Chloe.

                             CHLOE
                 We've never actually talked.

     Chloe's eyes are eerily bright with desperation.  Jack, in
     a sincere attempt at levity, chokes out:

                             JACK
                 You look good.  You ... look ... like
                 a pirate.

     Chloe laughs, a little too much.  Jack squeezes out a laugh.
     Then he sees Marla, off by herself.  Someone heads for her.

                             JACK
                 Excuse me, I have to...

     Jack gives a quick nod to Chloe and darts towards Marla.
     Chloe watches him go.

     STAY ON JACK AND MARLA as Jack CLAMPS his arms around her.
     He whispers into her ear.

                             JACK
                 We need to talk.

                             MARLA
                 Sure.

                             JACK
                 I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You
                 aren't dying.

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy
                 way, we're all dying.  But you're not
                 dying the way Chloe is dying.

                             LEADER
                 Tell the other person how you feel.

                             JACK
                 You're a tourist.  I saw you at
                 melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular
                 cancer.

                             MARLA
                 And I saw you practicing this...

                             JACK
                 Practicing what?

                             MARLA
                 Telling me off.  Is it going as well
                 as you hoped... ?
                       (reads his nametag)
                 "... Mr. Taylor."

                             JACK
                 I'll expose you.

                             MARLA
                 Go ahead.  I'll expose you.

                             LEADER
                 Share yourself completely.

     Marla puts her head down on Jack's shoulder as if she were
     crying.  Jack pulls her head back up.  She deadpans at him.

                             JACK
                 Why are you doing this?

                             MARLA
                 It's cheaper than a movie, and
                 there's free coffee.

                             JACK
                 These are my groups.  I was here
                 first.  I've been coming for a year.

                             MARLA
                 A year?  How'd you manage that?

                             JACK
                 Anyone who might've noticed either
                 died or recovered and never came back.

                             LEADER
                 Let yourself cry.

                             MARLA
                 Why do you do it?

                             JACK
                 I... I don't know.  I guess... when
                 people think you're dying, they
                 really listen, instead...

                             MARLA
                 -- Instead of just waiting for their
                 turn to speak.

                             JACK
                 Yeah.

     Brief recognition between them, broken as the Leader passes.

                             LEADER
                 Quietly, now.  Share with each other.

     Jack waits till the Leader's out of earshot.

                             JACK
                       (warning)
                 It becomes an addiction.

                             MARLA
                 Really?

     Jack sighs, then pulls back.

                             JACK
                 Look, I can't cry with a faker
                 present.

                             MARLA
                 Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not
                 my problem.

                             JACK
                 Please.  Can't we do something... ?

     Marla starts out of the room.  Jack follows her.

                             LEADER
                 Now, the closing prayer.

     EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     Marla gets to the sidewalk, moving quickly along.

                             JACK
                 We'll split up the week.  You can
                 have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --

                             MARLA
                 You take tuberculosis.  My smoking
                 doesn't go over at all.

                             JACK
                 I think testicular cancer should be
                 no contest.

                             MARLA
                 Well, technically, I have more of a
                 right to be there than you.  You
                 still have your balls.

                             JACK
                 You're kidding.

                             MARLA
                 I don't know -- am I?

     Jack follow Marla into...

     INT. LAUNDROMAT - CONTINUOUS

     Marla walks with authority up to an unwatched DRYER.  She
     takes out clothes, picks out jeans, pants and shirts.

                             MARLA
                 I'll take the parasites.

                             JACK
                 You can't have both parasites.  You
                 can take blood parasites --

                             MARLA
                 I want brain parasites.

                             JACK
                 Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and
                 organic brain dementia --

                             MARLA
                 I want that.

                             JACK
                 You can't have the whole brain!

                             MARLA
                 So far, you have four and I only have
                 two!

                             JACK
                 Then, take blood parasites.  It's
                 yours.  Now we each have three.

     Marla gathers the chosen garments and heads out past Jack...

     EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

     Jack follows, bewildered.

                             JACK
                 You... left half your clothes.

     HONK!  Jack starts.  Marla's led him into the street with
     traffic barreling down.

     Marla walks on, oblivious as CARS screech to a halt, HORNS
     BLARING.  Jack dashes, following...

     INT. THRIFT STORE - CONTINUOUS

     Marla drops the pile of clothes on a counter.  An old CLERK
     sifts through the clothes, begins writing on a pad.

                             JACK
                 You're selling those?

     Marla steps down hard on Jack's foot.  He winces in pain.

                             MARLA
                       (for the Clerk to hear)
                 Yes, I'm selling some chothes.

     The Clerk starts to ring up the assessed amounts.

                             MARLA
                 So, we each have three -- that's six.
                 What about the seventh day?  I want
                 ascending bowel cancer.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The girl had done her homework.

                             JACK
                 I want ascending bowel cancer.

     The Clerk gives a strange look as he hands money to Marla.

                             MARLA
                 That's your favorite, too?  Tried to
                 slip it by me, eh?

                             JACK
                 We'll split it.  You get it the first
                 and third Sunday of the month.

                             MARLA
                 Deal.

     They shake.  Jack tries to withdraw his hand; Marla holds it.

                             MARLA
                 Looks like this is goodbye.

                             JACK
                 Let's not make a big thing out of it.

     She walks to the door, pocketing money, not looking back.

                             MARLA
                 How's this for not making a big thing?

     Jack watches her go.  A moment, then he follows after...

     EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

     Jack hesitates, unsure, then run/walks to catch up to her...

                             JACK
                 Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange
                 numbers?

                             MARLA
                 Should we?

                             JACK
                 In case we want to switch nights.

                             MARLA
                 I suppose.

     Jack takes out a business card, writes his number on the
     back, hands it to her.  She takes the pen, grabs his hand
     and writes her number on his palm.  She walks into the
     street, causing more SCREECHING and HONKING.  She turns,
     holds up the card.

                             MARLA
                 It doesn't have your name.  Who are
                 you?  Cornelius?  Mr. Taylor?  Dr.
                 Zaius?  Any of the stupid names you
                 give each night?

     Jack starts to answer, but the traffic noise is too loud.
     Marla just shakes her head, turns, and keeps moving.  A BUS
     moves into view, obscuring her.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This is how I met Marla Singer.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     The plane touches down; the cabin BUMPS.  Jack's eyes open.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at O'Hare.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     Jack snaps awake again, looking around, disoriented.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at SeaTac.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK

     The rear of a CRASHED CAR sticks up by the side of the road.
     Jack stands, marking on a clipboard.  The SUN SETS behind.

     INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

     Jack stands at a gate counter.  An ATTENDANT smiles at him.

                             ATTENDANT
                 Check-in for that flight doesn't
                 begin for another two hours, Sir.

     Jack looks with blearing eyes at his watch, steps away and
     looks at an overhanging CLOCK.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Pacific, Mountain, Central.  Lose an
                 hour, gain an hour.  This is your
                 life, and it's ending one minute at
                 a time.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     Jack's eyes snap open as the plane LANDS.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at Air Harbor
                 International.

     INT. AIRPORT WALKWAY

     Jack stands on a conveyor belt, briefcase at his feet.  He
     watches PEOPLE MOVING PAST on the opposite conveyor.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If you wake up at a different time
                 and in a different place, could you
                 wake up as a different person?

     Jack misses seeing TYLER on the opposite conveyor belt.
     They pass each other.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     Jack sits next to a BUSINESSMAN.  As they have idle
     CONVERSATION, we MOVE IN ON Jack's tray.  An ATTENDANT'S
     HANDS set coffee down with a small container of cream.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Everywhere I travel -- tiny life.
                 Single-serving sugar, single-serving
                 cream, single pat of butter.

                                                      CUT TO:

     HANDS place a dinner tray down.

                 Microwave Cordon Bleu hobby kit.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Jack brushes his teeth in the MIRROR.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Shampoo/conditioner combo.  Single-
                 serving mouthwash, tiny bar of soap.

     Jack picks up an individual, wrapped Q-TIP, looks at it.  He
     moves out of the bathroom into...

     MAIN ROOM

     Jack sits on the bed.  He turns on the TV.  It's tuned to
     the "Sheraton Channel," shows WAITERS serving people in a
     large BANQUET ROOM.  Jack stops brushing his teeth, feels
     something on the bed, lifts it -- a small DINNER MINT.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     Jack sits next to a frumpy WOMAN.  They chat.  Jack turns to
     look at his food, takes a bite.  He turns back and it's...

     --a BALD MAN next to him, talking.  Jack takes another bite,
     turns back and it's...

     --a BUSINESSMAN next to him.  Jack takes another bite, turns
     back, and it's...

     --a BUSINESS WOMAN next to him.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The people I meet on each flight --
                 they're single-serving friends.
                 Between take-off and landing, we have
                 our time together, but that's all we
                 get.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - LANDING

     Jack's eyes snap open.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at Logan.

     INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     A giant corrugated METAL DOOR opens.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 On a long enough time line, the
                 survival rate for everyone drops to
                 zero.

     Two TECHNICIANS lead Jack to the BURNT-OUT SHELL of a
     WRECKED AUTOMOBILE.  Jack sets down his briefcase, opens it
     and starts to make notes on a CLIPBOARDED FORM.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'm a recall coordinator.  My job is
                 to apply the formula.  It's a story
                 problem.

                             TECHNICIAN #1
                 Here's where the infant went through
                 the windshield.  Three points.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 A new car built by my company leaves
                 somewhere traveling at 60 miles per
                 hour.  The rear differential locks up.

                             TECHNICIAN #2
                 The teenager's braces around the
                 backseat ashtray would make a good
                 "anti-smoking" ad.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The car crashes and burns with
                 everyone trapped inside.  Now: do we
                 initiate a recall?

                             TECHNICIAN #1
                 The father must've been huge.  See
                 how the fat burnt into the driver's
                 seat with his polyester shirt?  Very
                 "modern art."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Take the number of vehicles in the
                 field, (A), and multiply it by the
                 probable rate of failure, (B), then
                 multiply the result by the average
                 out-of-court settlement, (C).  A
                 times B times C equals X...

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - MOVING DOWN RUNWAY

     Jack is speaking to the BUSINESSWOMAN next to him.

                             JACK
                 If X is less than the cost of a
                 recall, we don't do one.

                             BUSISNESS WOMAN
                 Are there a lot of these kinds of
                 accidents?

                             JACK
                 Oh, you wouldn't believe.

                             BUSINESS WOMAN
                 ... Which... car company do you work
                 for?

                             JACK
                 A major one.

     Turgid silence.  Jack turns to the window.  He sees a
     PELICAN get SUCKED into the TURBINE.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Every time the plane banked too
                 sharply on take-off or landing, I
                 prayed for a crash, or a mid-air
                 collision -- anything.

     Jack's face remains bland during the following: the plane
     BUCKLES -- the cabin wobbles.  People panic.  Masks drop.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 No more haircuts.  Nothing matters,
                 not even bad breath.

     The side of the plane SHEARS OFF!  Screaming PASSENGERS are
     sucked out into the night air, flying past the quivering
     wind.  Magazines and other objects fly everywhere.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Life insurance pays off triple if you
                 die on a business trip.

     Jack remains in his same position, same bland expression.

     DING! -- the seatbelt light goes OUT.  Jack SNAPS AWAKE.
     EVERYTHING IS NORMAL.  Some passengers get out of their
     seats.  From next to Jack, a VOICE we've heard before...

                             VOICE
                 There are three ways to make napalm.
                 One, mix equal parts of gasoline and
                 frozen orange juice...

     Jack turns to see TYLER.  Without turned to Jack, Tyler
     continues:

                             TYLER
                 Two, equal parts gasoline and diet
                 cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter
                 in gasoline until the mixture is
                 thick.

                             JACK
                 Pardon me?

     Tyler turns to Jack.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This is how I met --

                             TYLER
                 Tyler Durden.

     Tyler offers his hand.  Jack takes it.

                             TYLER
                 You know why they have oxygen masks
                 on planes?

                             JACK
                 No, supply oxygen?

                             TYLER
                 Oxygen gets you high.  In a
                 catastrophic emergency, we're taking
                 giant, panicked breaths...

     Tyler grabs a safety instruction CARD from the seatback,
     hands it to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Suddenly, we become euphoic and
                 docile.  We accept our fate.

     Tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures.

                             TYLER
                 Emergency water landing, 600 miles
                 per hour.  Blank faces -- calm as
                 Hindu cows.

     Jack laughs.

                             JACK
                 What do you do, Tyler?

                             TYLER
                 What do you want me to do?

                             JACK
                 I mean -- for a living.

                             TYLER
                 Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's
                 what you do." -- And be a smug little
                 shit about it?

     Jack laughs.  Tyler reaches under the seat in front of him
     and lifts a BRIEFCASE.

                             TYLER
                 You have a kind of sick desperation
                 in your laugh.

     Jack points to his own briefcase.

                             JACK
                 We have the same briefcase.

     Tyler turns the top of his briefcase toward Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Open it.

     Jack looks at Tyler, then pops the latches and raises the
     lid to reveal quaintly-wrapped bars of SOAP.

                             TYLER
                 Soap -- the yardstick of civilization.
                       (reaches in his pocket)
                 I make and sell soap...

     Tyler hands Jack his card.  "THE PAPER STREET SOAP COMPANY."

                             TYLER
                 If you were to add nitric acid to the
                 soap-making process, one would get
                 nitroglycerin.  With enough soap, one
                 could blow up the world, if one were
                 so inclined.

     Tyler SNAPS the briefcase shut.  Jack stares.

                             JACK
                 Tyler, you are by far the most
                 interesting "single-serving" friend
                 I've ever met.

     Tyler stares back.  Jack, enjoying his own chance to be
     witty, leans closer to Tyler.

                             JACK
                 You see, when you travel, everything
                 is small, self-contained--

                             TYLER
                 The spork.  I get it.  You're very
                 clever.

                             JACK
                 Thank you.

                             TYLER
                 How's that working out for you?

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 Being clever.

                             JACK
                       (thrown)
                 Well, uh... great.

                             TYLER
                 Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.

     Tyler stands, looks towards the aisle.

                             TYLER
                 ... As I squeeze past, do I give you
                 the ass or the crotch?

     Tyler moves to the aisle, his ass toward jack, walks away...

                             TYLER
                 We are defined by the choices we make.

     Tyler goes to the curtain dividing First Class, slaps the
     curtain aside and sits in an empty seat.  Jack watches.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How I came to live with Tyler is:
                 airlines have this policy about
                 vibrating luggage.

     INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT

     Utterly empty of baggage.  No people except for Jack and a
     SECURITY TASK FORCE MAN.  The Security TFM, smirking, holds
     a receiver to his ear from an official phone on the wall.

                             SECURITY TFM
                       (to Jack)
                 Throwers don't worry about ticking.
                 Modern bombs don't tick.

                             JACK
                 Excuse me?  "Throwers?"

                             SECURITY TFM
                 Baggage handlers.  But when a
                 suitcase vibrates, the throwers have
                 to call the police.

                             JACK
                 My suitcase was vibrating?

                             SECURITY TFM
                 Nine time out of ten, it's an
                 electric razor.  But, every once in
                 a while ...
                       (whispers)
                 ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy
                 not to imply ownership in the event
                 of a dildo.  We use the indefinite
                 aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your
                 dildo."

     Jack sees, through the window, Tyler, at the curb, throwing
     his briefcase into the back of a shiny, red CONVERTIBLE.
     Tyler leaps over the door into the driver's seat and PEELS
     OUT.  jack turns away, looks at the Security TFM.

     In the background, a HARRIED MAN dashes after Tyler and the
     convertible, SCREAMING.

                             JACK
                       (to Security TFM)
                 I had everything in that bag.  My
                 C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...

                             SECURITY TFM
                       (into phone)
                 Yeah, uh huh... yeah?
                       (pause, still on phone)
                 Oh...

     EXT. EMPTY RUNWAY

     A lone SUITCASE sits on the concrete.  SECURITY PERSONNEL
     keep their distance.  KABOOM!  The suitcase explodes.

     INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - RESUMING

     The Security TFM, shakes his head, hangs up.

                             SECURITY TFM
                 I'm terribly sorry.

     The Security TFM hands Jack a claim form.  Jack snatches it,
     disgusted, takes out a pen, starts filling out the form.

                             SECURITY TFM
                 You know the industry slang for
                 "Flight Attendant?"  "Air Mattress."

     INT. TAXI - MOVING - NIGHT

     Along a residential street.  Jack looks ahead, sees a tall,
     grey, bland BUILDING on the corner.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Home was a condo on the fifteenth
                 floor of a filing cabinet for widows
                 and young professionals.  The walls
                 were solid concrete.  A foot of
                 concrete is important when your next-
                 door neighbor lets her hearing aid go
                 and has to watch game shows at full
                 volume...

     The taxi turns a corner and Jack sees the front of the
     building.  A diffuse CLOUD of SMOKE wafts away from a BLOWN-
     OUT SECTION of the fifteenth floor.  FIRETRUCKS, POLICE CARS
     and a MOB are all crowded around the lobby area.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 -- Or when a volcanic blast of debris
                 that used to be your furniture and
                 personal effects blows out your floor-
                 to-ceiling windows and sails flaming
                 into the night.

     EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BUILDING

     Jack, gaping at the sight above him, absently gives the
     Cabbie money.  The taxi pulls away.  Jack starts toward the
     building.  He pushes through the fray of people, into the...

     INT. LOBBY

     The DOORMAN sees Jack enter, gives a sad smile, shakes his
     head.  Jack starts for the elevator.

                             DOORMAN
                 There's nothing up there.

     Jack presses the button.  The Doorman moves next to him.

                             DOORMAN
                 You can't go into the unit.  Police
                 orders.

     The elevator doors open.  Jack hesitates.  The doors close.
     Jack heads out the lobby doors.  The Doorman follows...

     EXT. CONDO BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

     Jack walks past SMOKING, CHARRED DEBRIS -- a flash of ORANGE
     from the Yang table, a CLOCK FACE from the hall clock, part
     of an arm from the GREEN ARMCHAIR.  His feet CRUNCH glass.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How embarrassing.

                             DOORMAN
                 Do you have somebody you can call?

     Jack comes to his REFRIGERATOR lying on its side.  He
     reaches down and takes a note: "MARLA --" and a phone
     number, from under a BANANA MAGNET.

     CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S STOVE

     Hissing.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The police would later tell me that
                 the pilot light might have gone
                 out... letting out just a little bit
                 of gas.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack gets to a PAYPHONE.  The Doorman follows, watching him.

                             DOORMAN
                 Lots of young people try to impress
                 the world and buy too many things.

     Jack picks up the receiver, puts in a quarter.  He looks at
     Marla's number a long moment.

     CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S ENTIRE CONDO - KITCHEN AND LIVING ROOM

     The SOUND of the HISS...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The gas could have slowly filled the
                 condo.  Seventeen-hundred square feet
                 with high ceilings, for days and days.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack replaces the receiver.  He pockets Marla's number, digs
     out a small FILOFAX.  He flips through the pages for phone
     numbers and addresses.  Most of the pages are blank.

                             DOORMAN
                 Many young people feel trapped and
                 desperate.

     INSERT - CLOSE ON THE BASE OF JACK'S REFRIGERATOR

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Then, the refrigerator's compressor
                 could have clicked on...

     Click.  KABOOM!  SCREEN GOES WHITE.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack looks at the Doorman.  Tyler's BUSINESS CARD falls from
     the Filofax.  Jack catches it.

                             DOORMAN
                 If you don't know what you want, you
                 end up with a lot you don't.

     The Doorman walks away.  Jack stares at Tyler's card.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If you asked me now, I couldn't tell
                 you why I called him.

     Jack re-deposits the quarter, dials Tyler's number.  It
     RINGS... and RINGS and RINGS.  Jack sighs and hangs up the
     phone.  A moment, then the phone RINGS.

                             JACK
                 Hello?

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 Who's this?

                             JACK
                 Tyler?

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 Who's this?

                             JACK
                 Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the
                 plane.  We had the same briefcase.
                 I'm... you know, the clever guy.

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 Oh, yeah.

                             JACK
                 I just called a second ago.  There
                 was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick
                 up my phone.  What's up?

                             JACK
                 Well... let me see... here's the
                 thing...

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

     A small building in the middle of a concrete parking lot.

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

     Jack and Tyler sit in the back, with a pitcher of BEER.

                             JACK
                 You buy furniture.  You tell
                 yourself: this is the last sofa I'll
                 ever need.  No matter what else
                 happens, I've got the sofa issue
                 handled.  Then, the right set of
                 dishes.  The right dinette.

                             TYLER
                 This is how we fill up our lives.

     Tyler lights a cigarette.

                             JACK
                 I guess so.

                             TYLER
                 And, now it's gone.

                             JACK
                 All gone.

     Tyler offers cigarettes.  Jack declines.

                             TYLER
                 Could be worse.  A woman could cut
                 off your penis while you're asleep
                 and toss it out the window of a
                 moving car.

                             JACK
                 There's always that.

                             TYLER
                 I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe
                 it's a terrible tragedy.

                             JACK
                 ...no ...no ...

                             TYLER
                 I mean, you did lose a lot of nice,
                 neat little shit.  The trendy paper
                 lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit,
                 am I right?

     Jack laughs, nods.  He shakes his head, drinks.

                             TYLER
                 But maybe, just maybe, you've been
                 delivered.

                             JACK
                       (toasts)
                 Delivered from Swedish furniture.

                             TYLER
                 Delivered from armchairs in obscure
                 green stripe patterns.

                             JACK
                 Delivered from Martha Stewart.

                             TYLER
                 Delivered from bullshit colors like
                 "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."

     They laugh together.  Then, silence.  They drink.

                             JACK
                 Insurance'll cover it.

                             TYLER
                 Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the
                 list.

                             JACK
                 What list?

                             TYLER
                 The "now I get to go out and buy the
                 exact same stuff all over again"
                 list.  That list.

                             JACK
                 I don't... think so.

                             TYLER
                 This time maybe get a widescreen TV.
                 You'll be occupied for weeks.

                             JACK
                 Well, I have to file a claim...

                             TYLER
                 The things you own, they end up
                 owning you.

                             JACK
                 Don't I?

                             TYLER
                 Do what you like.

                             JACK
                       (looks at watch)
                 God, it's late.  I should find a
                 hotel...

                             TYLER
                 A hotel?

                             JACK
                 Yeah.

                             TYLER
                 So, you called me up, because you
                 just wanted to have a drink before
                 you... go find a hotel?

                             JACK
                 I don't follow...

                             TYLER
                 We're on our third pitcher of beer.
                 Just ask me.

                             JACK
                 Huh?

                             TYLER
                 You called me so you could have a
                 place to stay.

                             JACK
                 No, I...

                             TYLER
                 Why don't you cut the shit and ask if
                 you can stay at my place?

                             JACK
                 Would that be a problem?

                             TYLER
                 Is it a problem for you to ask?

                             JACK
                 Can I stay at your place?

                             TYLER
                 Yes, you can.

                             JACK
                 Thank you.

                             TYLER
                 You're welcome.  But, I want you to
                 do me one favor.

                             JACK
                 What's that?

                             TYLER
                 I want you to hit me as hard as you
                 can.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 I want you to hit me as hard as you
                 can.

     Freeze picture.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Let me tell you a little bit about
                 Tyler Durden.

     EXTREME CLOSE-UP - FILM FRAME

     -- And we see it's PORNOGRAPHY.

     INT. PROJECTIONIST ROOM - THEATRE - NIGHT

     Jack, in the foreground, FACES CAMERA.  In the BACKGROUND,
     Tyler sits at a bench, looking at individual FRAMES cut from
     movies.  Near him, a PROJECTOR rolls film.

                             JACK
                 Tyler was a night person.  He
                 sometimes worked as a projectionist.
                 A movie doesn't come in one big reel,
                 it's on a few.  In old theaters, two
                 projectors are used, so someone has
                 to change projectors at the exact
                 second when one reel ends and
                 another reel begins.  Sometimes you
                 can see two dots on screen in the
                 upper right hand corner...

     Tyler points to the side of OUR FRAME and the TWO DOTS
     briefly APPEAR ONSCREEN.

                             TYLER
                 They're called "cigarette burns."

                             JACK
                 It's called a "changeover."  The
                 movie goes on, and nobody in the
                 audience has any idea.

                             TYLER
                 Why would anyone want this shitty job?

                             JACK
                 It affords him other interesting
                 opportunities.

                             TYLER
                 -- Like splicing single frames from
                 adult movies into family films.

                             JACK
                 In reel three, right after the
                 courageous dog and the snooty cag --
                 who have celebrity voices -- eat out
                 of a garbage can, there's the flash
                 of Tyler's contribution...

     In the AUDIENCE, CHILDREN suddenly start squirming,
     confused, looking at each other.

     A WOMAN abruptly stops sucking her soda straw, feeling
     vaguely terrible.  Her uncomfortable HUSBAND slowly leans
     back in his seat.

     Jack and Tyler watch from the projection booth window.

                             TYLER
                 One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's
                 how long it's up there.

                             JACK
                 No one really knows that they've seen it.
                 But they did.

                             TYLER
                 A nice, big cock.

                             JACK
                 Only a hummingbird could have caught
                 Tyler at work.

     INT. LARGE BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

     Tyler moves around one of many tables, setting down SOUP
     BOWLS.  Jack stands in the same position, FACING CAMERA.

                             JACK
                 Tyler also worked as a banquet waiter
                 at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.

     The GUESTS command the WAITERS with snaps of fingers.

     INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     Jack turns and WE PAN to Tyler, standing by a CART with a
     giant SOUP TUREEN.  His hands are at his open fly and he's
     in position to piss into the soup.

                             JACK
                 He was the guerrilla terrorist of the
                 food service industry.

                             TYLER
                 Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.

     Jack waits.  The SOUND of a STREAM of LIQUID is HEARD.

                             TYLER
                 ... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.

                             JACK
                 He farted on meringue; he sneezed on
                 braised endive; and, with creme of
                 mushroom soup, well...

                             TYLER (O.S.)
                 Go ahead.  Say it.

                             JACK
                 You get the idea.

     EXT. PARKING LOT OF TAVERN - RESUMING

     Tyler and Jack come out the back door.

                             JACK
                 I don't know about this.

                             TYLER
                 I don't know, either.  I want to find
                 out.  I've never been hit, have you?

                             JACK
                 No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?

                             TYLER
                 I don't want to die without any
                 scars.  How much can you really know
                 about yourself if you've never been
                 in a fight?  Come on... you're the
                 only person I've ever asked.

                             JACK
                 Me?

     Jack stares at him.

                             TYLER
                 Why not you?  I'm letting you go
                 first.  Do it.

                             JACK
                 This is crazy.

                             TYLER
                 Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.

                             JACK
                 Where do you want it?  In the face?

                             TYLER
                 Surprise me.

     Jack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse -- hits Tyler's
     neck -- makes a dull, flat sound.

                             JACK
                 Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.

                             TYLER
                 Like hell.  That counted.

     Tyler shoots out a straight punch to Jack's chest.  Jack
     falls back against a car.  His eyes tear up.

                             TYLER
                 How do you feel?

                             JACK
                 Strange.

                             TYLER
                 But a good strange.

                             JACK
                 Is it?

                             TYLER
                 We've crossed the threshold.  You
                 want to call it off?

                             JACK
                 Call what off?

                             TYLER
                 The fight.

                             JACK
                 What fight?

                             TYLER
                 This fight, pussy.

     Jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under
     Tyler's ear.  Tyler punches Jack in the stomach.  Tyler and
     Jack move clumsily, throwing punches.  They breathe heavier,
     drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact.

     EXT. CURBSIDE - LATER

     Jack and Tyler sit on the curb, watching sparse headlights
     on the nearby freeway.  Their eyes are glazed with endorphin-
     induced serenity.  They look at each other, laugh.  Look away.

                             TYLER
                 If you could fight anyone... one on
                 one, whoever you wanted, who would
                 you fight?

                             JACK
                 Anyone?

                             TYLER
                 Anyone.

     Jack thinks.

                             JACK
                 My boss, probably.
                       (pause)
                 Who would you fight?

                             TYLER
                 My dad.  No question.

     A long pause as Jack studies Tyler's face.

                             JACK
                 Oh, yeah.
                       (nodding)
                 I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew
                 him, till I was six.  He went and
                 married another woman, had more kids.
                 Every six years or so he'd do it
                 again -- new city, new family.

                             TYLER
                 He was setting up franchises.  My
                 father never went to college, so it
                 was really important that I go.

                             JACK
                 I know that.

                             TYLER
                 After I graduated, I called him long
                 distance and asked, "Now what?"  He
                 said, "Get a job."  When I turned
                 twenty-five, I called him and asked,
                 "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know.
                 Get married."

                             JACK
                 Same here.

                             TYLER
                 A generation of men raised by women.
                 I'm wondering if another woman is the
                 answer we really need.

     Another pause.  Jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles.

                             JACK
                 We should do this again sometime.

     Tyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to Jack.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT

     A street sign: "PAPER STREET."  A PAPER MILL stis on one
     side, facing a lone HOUSE on the other.  The rest of the
     land is grass and weeds.  It's a grand, old three-story,
     long abandoned.  Tyler leads Jack toward it.

                             JACK
                 Where's your car?

                             TYLER
                 What car?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I don't know how Tyler found the
                 house, but he'd been there for half
                 a year.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

     Tyler leads Jack through the FRONT DOOR...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It looked like it was waiting to be
                 torn down.  Most of the windows were
                 boarded up.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENT LATER

     Tyler and Jack climb CREAKY STAIRS to the 2ND FLOOR LANDING.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 None of the doors locked.  The stairs
                 were ready to collapse.  I didn't
                 know if he owned it or he was
                 squatting.

     Tyler opens the door to a ROOM...

     INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Jack enters, stis on the creaky BED.  Dust drifts upwards.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Neither would have surprised me.

     INT. SHOWER - MORNING

     Jack turns on the water.  LOUD VIBRATIONS from the walls.
     Water spits in starts.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Nothing worked.  The rusty plumbing
                 leaked.  Turning on a light meant
                 another light in the house went out.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the tavern's lights are off.  Tyler and Jack FIGHT.
     FIVE GUYS stand around watching.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack, his face showing NEW BRUISES AND CUTS, makes coffee
     with a wire-mesh strainer.  Tyler shuffles in, wearing a
     flannel bathrobe.  He spears pieces of bread on a fork,
     starts roasting them over a burner.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 There were no neighbors.  Just
                 warehouses and the paper mill.  The
                 fart smell of steam, the hamster cage
                 smell of wood chips.

     EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - NIGHT

     Jack sits watching as Tyler SWINGS an old GOLF CLUB --
     THWACK -- sends a golf ball soaring down the desolate street.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 At night, Tyler and I were alone for
                 half a mile in every direction.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  TEN GUYS YELL, standing around Jack
     and Tyler, who FIGHT.  THREE CARS are parked in the lot.

     INT. BASEMENT - DAY

     Jack sits on basement stairs, watching as Tyler, knee-deep
     in water, works at an open FUSEBOX, flipping breakers in a
     certain order, showing Jack how it's done.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When it rained, we had to kill the
                 power.  By the end of the first
                 month, I didn't care about TV.  I
                 didn't mind the warm, stale
                 refrigerator.

     INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT

     CANDLES BURN.  Tyler and Jack are seated across from each
     other on the buckled floor, reading MAGAZINES.  Rain DRIPS
     from the ceiling.  No furniture.  THOUSANDS of MAGAZINES.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The previous occupant had been a bit
                 of a shut-in.

                             TYLER
                       (of magazine)
                 Hum.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 Oh, a new riot control grenade...
                       (reading)
                 "...the successful combination of
                 concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash-
                 blasts and simultaneous high-velocity
                 disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."

     Tyler begins RIPPING the ARTICLE from his magazine.

                             JACK
                       ("Reader's Digest")
                 "I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in
                 first person.  "Without me, Joe could
                 not take in oxygen to feed his red
                 blood cells."  There's a whole
                 series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."

                             TYLER
                 "I get cancer, and I kill Joe."

     Tyler tosses his article in a pile of other articles,
     chooses another magazine.

                             JACK
                 What are you reading?

                             TYLER
                 Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week.
                 New Republic.

                             JACK
                 Show-off.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  Jack and Tyler stand amidst FIFTEEN
     GUYS around TWO GUYS FIGHTING.  The crowd YELLS MORE WILDLY
     than before.  In the background are EIGHT PARKED CARS.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I should have been haggling with my
                 insurance company.  I should have
                 been looking for a new condo...

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jack walks along.  He stops, looking at a CHURCH with
     SUPPORT-GROUP-PEOPLE milling around the entrance, drinking
     coffee and sodas.  Marla's there, amongst them, smoking.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 .... I should have been upset about
                 my nice, neat, flaming little shit.

     Jack's face shows no reaction.  He continues to walk.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 But I wasn't.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack, in work clothes, interlocks his fingers and POPS his
     knuckles, picks up a saucepan with coffee and sips.  Tyler,
     in waiter's uniform, comes to have Jack straighten his tie.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Most of the week, we were Ozzie and
                 Harriet.

     Jack picks up his briefcase and walks out the door.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 But, Wednesday night, ever Wednesday
                 night...

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  No one around, but there are at
     least TWENTY-FIVE CARS parked in the full lot.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 ... we were finding something out: we
                 were finding out, more and more, that
                 we were not alone.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     A SLIDE SHOW progresses, run by a chipper salesman, WALTER.
     Jack sits, deadpan, with a PUFFY LIP and a BRUISED cheek.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Thursday mornings, all I could do was
                 think about next week.

     Boss gives Jack a dubious look.  Walter's next SLIDE: a
     COMPUTER SCREEN.

                             WALTER
                 The basic premise of cyber-netting
                 your office is -- make things more
                 efficient.

                             BOSS
                 Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

                             WALTER
                 Absolutely.

     Walter continues, his sales pitch drowned out by Jack's V.O.:

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Walter, the Microsoft account exec.
                 Walter, with his smooth, soft hands.
                 Maybe he was thinking about the free-
                 range potluck he'd been to last
                 weekend, or his church-group car-wash
                 fund-raiser.  Or, probably not.

     Walter moves to Jack and slaps him in the shoulder.

                             WALTER
                 I showed this already to my man here.
                 You liked it, didn't you?

     Jack smiles.  His teeth are RED with BLOOD.  They GLOW
     eerily in the dim light.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You can swallow a pint of blood
                 before you get sick.

                             WALTER
                 Jesus, I'd hate to see what happened
                 to the other guy.

     Jack keeps the smile frozen on his face.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Screw Walter.  His candy-ass wouldn't
                 last a second Wednesday night.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

     Out of silent darkness, HEADLIGHTS appear from all
     directions.  CARS PULL UP and park in the already-packed
     lot.  YOUNG MEN get out and march into the tavern...

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

     The men, including Jack and Tyler, enter and stand against
     the back wall, waiting.  The bartender, IRVINE, calls out:

                             IRVINE
                 Drink up people.  We're closing.

     Irvine flicks on the LIGHTS.  Drunken customers squint and
     get the message.  They plop down money, leaving.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It was right in everyone's face.
                 Tyler and I just made it visible.

     Irvine hits a button and the JUKEBOX loses power.  Members
     of the waiting army begins to share secret looks.  Finally,
     one buy locks the door.  Two other guys close the blinds.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It was on the tip of everyone's
                 tongue.  Tyler and I just gave it a
                 name.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - SAME

     A BOMB-SHELTER.  Concrete walls.  One BARE BULB above, Tyler
     standing directly beneath it.

                             TYLER
                 Welcome to fight club.

     The guys mill around, finding partners.  Everyone brims with
     eagerness, but tries to act cool.  CHATTER gets LOUDER.
     Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, Tyler at center.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Every week, Tyler gave the rules that
                 he and I decided.

     PEAKING CHATTER, till Tyler raises his arms and the CHATTER
     DIES.  A couple of COUGHS, FEET SHUFFLING, then, SILENCE.

                             TYLER
                 The first rule of fight club is --
                 you don't talk about fight club.  The
                 second rule of fight club is -- you
                 don't talk about fight club.  The
                 third rule of fight club is -- when
                 someone says "stop" or goes limp, the
                 fight is over.  Fourth rule is --
                 only two guys to a fight.  Fifth
                 rule -- one fight at a time.  Sixth
                 rule -- no shirts, no shoes.  Seventh
                 rule -- fights go on as long as they
                 have to.  And the eighth and final
                 rule -- if this is your first night
                 at fight club, you have to fight.

     Tyler steps back.  A short guy, RICKY, and a GOATEED MAN
     take off shirts and shoes and step to the center.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk --
                 couldn't remember whether you ordered
                 pens with blue ink or black ink ...

     The two fighters circle, then begin throwing PUNCHES...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 But Ricky was a god for ten minutes
                 last week when he trounced an actuary
                 twice his size.

     Harder, faster PUNCHES between the two.  SWEAT flies.
     SHOUTS become DEAFENING.  Ricky's getting the best of
     Goateed Man, POUNDING him...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Sometimes all you could hear were
                 flat, hard packing sounds over the
                 yelling, or the wet choke when
                 someone caught their breath and
                 sprayed...

                             GOATEED MAN
                       (spittle-lipped)
                 Ssssstop... !

     INT. OFFICE PARK RESTAURANT - DAY

     Jack, eating lunch, watches the BROKEN-NOSED WAITER with a
     GOATEE -- from the above fight -- converse with a MAITRE D'.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Even if I could tell someone they had
                 a good fight, I wouldn't be talking
                 to the same man.

     The Goateed Waiter approaches Jack and sets a refill soda
     down on the table.  The two of them briefly make eye contact.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Who you were in fight club is not who
                 you were in the rest of the world.

     INT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM - DAY

     Jack stands over a copy machine, hit by flashes of light.
     He glances over his shoulder, watches Ricky, wearing an
     apron, push a supply cart.  Ricks nods at Jack.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You weren't alive anywhere like you
                 were there.  But fight club only
                 exists in the hours between when
                 fight club starts and when fight club
                 ends.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack, playing SOLITAIRE on his computer, daubs blood from
     his mouth with a handkerchief.  Boss, passing by the
     doorway, looks in at Jack, irritated.

                             BOSS
                 What are you getting yourself into
                 every week?

     Jack keeps playing Solitaire.  Boss enters, folds his arms.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 After fight club, everything else in
                 your life gets the volume turned
                 down.  You can deal with anything.

                             BOSS
                 Have you finished those reports?

                             JACK
                       (handing him reports)
                 Yes.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The people who had power over you
                 have less and less.

     Jack looks at Boss.  Reflexively, Jack's tongue plays with
     his teeth.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 By this point, I could wiggle most of
                 the teeth in my jaw.

     EXT. STREET - DUSK

     Tyler and Jack walk, both smoking cigarettes.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 A guy came to fight club for the
                 first time, his ass was a wad of
                 cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he
                 was carved out of wood.

                             JACK
                 If you could fight any celebrity?

                             TYLER
                 Alive or dead?

                             JACK
                 Doesn't matter.

                             TYLER
                 Hemingway.  You?

                             JACK
                 Shatner.  William Shatner.

     They reach a BUS STOP as a BUS arrives, tossing their
     cigarettes, getting on board...

     INT. BUS - DUSK

     The bus is crowded.  As Tyler and Jack walk toward the back,
     Jack studies the faces of OTHER PASSENGERS...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 We all started seeing things
                 differently.  Wherever we went.

     They hold hand grips.  Jack looks up at an ADVERTISEMENT; a
     CALVIN KLEIN ad featuring a tan, bare-chested MUSCLE STUD.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I felt sorry for all the guys packing
                 into gyms, trying to look like what
                 Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said
                 they should.

     Tyler looks at Jack, looks at the C.K. advertisement.

                             TYLER
                 Self-improvement is masturbation.
                 Self-destruction is the answer.

     A MAN in a suit KNOCKS Tyler's shoulder as he passes.  The
     Man takes a handle, close by.  Jack's pissed, staring at the
     man, who stares back.

                             JACK
                       (to Tyler, so the
                        Man can hear)
                 You could take him.

     Tyler looks to Jack, glances over his shoulder at the Man.
     Tyler casually picks a small scab off Jack's nostril.

                             TYLER
                 The trick is not to care.

     Tyler stares forward.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Tyler HITS the floor, stomach first.  HIS OPPONENT lands on
     top of him, grappling, trying for a CHOKE HOLD.  The
     surrounding CROWD, Jack included, SCREAMS at them...

     Tyler and the Opponent wrestle desperately, and Tyler flips
     his attacker, gets on top, sprawling to pin him.  Tyler
     turns -- starts reining PUNCHES into the Opponent's GROIN...

                                                      CUT TO:

     Jack lands a couple of BLOWS to HIS OPPONENT'S stomach --
     brings up a left uppercut that smashes the Opponent's jaw.
     Tiny spatters of BLOOD adorn the walls, along with sweat.

     Jack catches sight of a swollen-faced Tyler, watching
     appreciatively, a smile growing slowly on his face.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Fight club wasn't about winning or
                 losing.  It wasn't about words.

     The Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack.  Jack
     snakes his arm into a counter headlock.  They wrestle like
     wild animals.  The crowd CHEERS maniacally.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 They hysterical shouting was in
                 tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.

     Onlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering LOUDER.
     The Opponent SMASHES Jack's head to the floor, over and over.

                             JACK
                 ... stop...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When the fight was over, nothing was
                 solved, but nothing mattered.

     Everyone moves in as the Opponent steps away.  Tyler pushes
     through the crowd.  Others lift Jack up.  They turn their
     attention to the floor, to a BLOOD MASK of Jack's face --
     similar to the TEAR MASK on BOB'S SHIRT.

                             TYLER
                 Cool.

     Jack limply shakes his Opponent's hand.

                             OPPONENT
                 How about next week?

                             JACK
                 Look at me.  How about next month?

     Everyone helps Jack walk.  He's sweating, bleeding, smiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Afterwards, we all felt saved.

     INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

     A NURSE tends to Jack while Tyler watches.

                             TYLER
                 He fell down some stairs.

     The Nurse doesn't look at Tyler, just keeps tending to Jack.

                             JACK
                 I fell down some stairs.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Sometimes Tyler spoke for me.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

     Tyler and Jack share the cracked MIRROR.  Tyler's clipping
     at his hair with blunt, ill-suited SCISSORS.  Jack's
     brushing his teeth, spitting out pink foam.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Fight club became the reason to cut
                 your hair short and trim your
                 fingernails.

                             TYLER
                 Any historical figure.

                             JACK
                 Okay... Ghandi.

                             TYLER
                 Good answer.

                             JACK
                 You?

                             TYLER
                 Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys
                 fight till they're burger.

     Jack reaches in his mouth, exploring, pulls -- yanks a
     TOOTH.  Jack looks at it.  Tyler puts scissors down, done.

                             TYLER
                 Remember, even the Mona Lisa's
                 falling apart.

     Jack drops the tooth in the sink with Tyler's hair.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

     Jack enters, buttoning his shirt.  The PHONE RINGS.

                             JACK
                 Hello?

     INTERCUT WITH...

     INT. MARLA'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - SAME

     Marla's in the HALL, on the PAYPHONE, twisting the phone
     cord around her neck.

                             MARLA
                 Where have you been the last few
                 weeks?

                             JACK
                 Marla?

     Jack looks through the archway and sees Tyler, in his gummy
     flannel bathrobe, doing sit-ups.  Jack leans, cups the phone.

                             JACK
                       (quietly)
                 How did you find me?

                             MARLA
                 The forwarding number.  I haven't
                 seen you at any support groups.

                             JACK
                 That's the idea -- we split them.

                             MARLA
                 You haven't been going to yours.

                             JACK
                 I found a new one.

                             MARLA
                 Really?

                             JACK
                 It's for men.

                             MARLA
                 Like testicular cancer?

                             JACK
                 Look, this is a bad time...

                             MARLA
                 I've been going to debtor's
                 anonymous.  You want to see some
                 truly fucked up people?

                             JACK
                 I'm just on my way out...

                             MARLA
                 Me too.  I got a stomach full of
                 Xanax.  I took what was left of a
                 bottle.  Might've been too much.

     Jack looks exasperated, turns TO LOOK INTO THE CAMERA.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Picture yourself watching Marla
                 Singer throw herself around her
                 crummy apartment.

                             MARLA
                 This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
                 This is probably one of those cry-for-
                 help things.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This could go on for hours.

                             JACK
                 So you're staying in tonight?

                             MARLA
                 Do you want to wait to hear me
                 describe death?

     Jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the
     hook, walks out the back door.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                 Do you want to listen and see if my
                 spirit can use the telephone?

     Thru the archway: Tyler leans to look in, curious.

     INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     GRUNTS of PLEASURE and EXERTION.  Glimpses of TORSOS, ASSES,
     LEGS, ARMS, BREASTS, and FEMALE HAIR, all DRENCHED in SWEAT.
     Sheets RIP.  Bodies hit the FLOOR.  Insane GRUNTING and
     LAUGHING.  A flash of MARLA'S FACE.

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - SUNRISE

     Jack sits up in bed, looks around the room.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING

     Jack steps out of his room.  The neighboring door is closed.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler's door was closed.  I'd been
                 living here two months, and Tyler's
                 door was never closed.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     Jack stares into the TOILER, looking at SIX USED CONDOMS.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack sits at the table, sips coffee, read Reader's Digest.
     He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching.

                             JACK
                 You're not going to believe what I
                 dreamt last night.

     Marla walks in, straightening her dress, looks like she's
     been raped by a hurricane.  Jack's jaw drops.

                             MARLA
                 I can hardly believe anything about
                 last night.

     Marla goes to pour coffee.  She takes a swig, GARGLES and
     SPITS it in the sink.  She gives Jack a lascivious smile.

                             JACK
                 What are you doing here?

                             MARLA
                 What... ?

                             JACK
                 What the hell are you doing here?

     Marla stares at him a beat, then drops the cup in the sink.

                             MARLA
                 Fuck you.

     Marla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out.
     Jack gets up, watches her stomp away.

     Jack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after
     Marla.  He's in his usual sweatpants.  He grins at Jack,
     then moves away, pours himself coffee.  Jack, smoldering,
     slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest.  Tyler
     puts his foot on a countertop, does stretching exercises.

                             TYLER
                 She's a piece of work.  Get this --
                 I come in here last night, the
                 phone's off the hook...

     Jack pretends to read, quickly glances at Tyler.  TYLER'S
     VOICE FADES...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I already knew the story before he
                 told it to me.

     INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler enters, gently lifts the handset and listens.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                       (from handset)
                 I'll tell you when I'm floating out
                 of my body.

     Tyler smiles.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How could Tyler, off all people, think
                 it was a bad thing that Marla Singer
                 was about to die?

     INT. MARLA'S - 8TH FLOOR LANDING - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler, a wry smile on his face, ambles up the stiars,
     looking at the rotting walls.  He reaches the top of the
     stairs and heads for Marla's room.  Before he can knock,
     Marla's hand shoots out and grabs him...

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

     Marla pulls Tyler inside and shuts the door.  Her drugged
     eyes look him over.

                             MARLA
                 You got here fast.

     She staggers and sits on the bed.  She slides off, along
     with the blanket and sheets, to the floor.

                             MARLA
                 The mattresses are all sealed in
                 slippery plastic.

     She tries to focus her eyes on Tyler.

                             MARLA
                 Did I call you?

     Tyler studies her with cynical curiosity, looks at a DILDO
     lying atop a dresser.  Marla follows his gaze.

                             MARLA
                 Don't worry.  It's not a threat to you.

     SIRENS and vehicles SCREECHING outside can be HEARD; doors
     opening and SLAMMING; running FOOTFALLS.

                             MARLA
                 Oh, no!  Somebody called the cops...

     She gets to her feet, grabs Tyler, pulls him out the door.

     INT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK)

     Marla LOCKS her door, then pulls Tyler toward the STAIRCASE.
     COPS and PARAMEDICS charge up with oxygen and medical kits.
     Marla and Tyler flatten against the wall to let them pass.

                             COP
                 8-G!  Where's 8-G?

                             MARLA
                       (pointing)
                 End of the hall.

     The rescuers keep running.

                             MARLA
                       (calling after)
                 The girl who lives there used to be
                 a charming, lovely girl, but she's
                 lost faith in herself...

                             COP
                 Miss Singer, let us help you!  You
                 have every reason to live!

     Marla yanks Tyler's arm, heading down the stairs.

                             MARLA
                 She's a monster!  Infectious human
                 waste!  Good luck trying to save her!

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler makes coffee.  Marla slouches against the refrigerator.

                             MARLA
                 If I fall asleep, I'm done for.
                 You're gonna have to keep me up all
                 night.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)

     Tyler chuckles, shakes his head.

                             TYLER
                 Unbelievable, huh?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was obviously able to handle it.

     Tyler stands across from Jack, gets a cigarette from a pack.

                             TYLER
                 I mean, this girl... uh, you're not
                 into her or anything... ?

                             JACK
                 No.  Not at all.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I am Jack's Raging Bile Duct.

     Tyler lights his cigarette.

                             TYLER
                 You're sure?

                             JACK
                 Yeah, I'm sure.

                             TYLER
                 Good.  This chick was up on the table
                 with her legs in the stirrups before
                 the doctor even walked in the room.
                 The things that she said... I've
                 never heard a woman talk like that...

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler smokes, post-coital.  Marla puts her lips to his ear.

                             MARLA
                       (whispering)
                 I want to have your abortion.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)

     Tyler laughs, shakes his head.  Jack's gripping his Reader's
     Digest just a little too tight.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How could Tyler not go for that?
                 Night before last, he was splicing
                 sex organs into "Little Mermaid."

     Tyler sits, studies Jack's face.

                             TYLER
                 You're okay with this?

                             JACK
                 I'm fine.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Put a gun to my head and paint the
                 wall with my brains.

     Tyler smokes.

                             TYLER
                 She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay
                 away from that one.

                             JACK
                 Oh, and my pace is more librarians.

                             TYLER
                 Hey... don't knock librarians.

                             JACK
                 Marla doesn't need a lover.  She
                 needs a case worker.

                             TYLER
                 She needs an exorcist.  This isn't
                 love.  This is sport-fucking.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 She'd invaded my support groups, now
                 she's invading my home.

                             TYLER
                 Listen... do me a favor... sit here
                 a minute...

     Tyler pulls out a closer chair, motions to it.  Jack puts
     down his Reader's Digest and moves to that chair.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 You've gotta understand something
                 about me.  I have a little rule,
                 okay?  Don't ever talk to her about
                 me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind
                 of shit.

     Tyler fixes Jack with a friendly, but firm stare.

                             TYLER
                 If you ever say anything about me or
                 about what happens here in this
                 house, to her or anyone -- I will
                 find out.  And you'll never see me
                 again.  Promise me.

                             JACK
                 Okay.

                             TYLER
                 Promise you won't.

                             JACK
                 Yes, I promise.

                             TYLER
                 Promise?

                             JACK
                 I said I promise!

                             TYLER
                 That was three times you promised.

     Tyler smiles, gets up and leaves.  Jack sits smoldering.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If only I had wasted a couple of
                 minutes and gone to watch Marla die,
                 none of this would have happened.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack watches TV at HIGH VOLUME.  SOUNDS of SEX from upstairs.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies calmly on his bed, staring at the ceiling.  Sounds
     of THUMPS and CRASHES from beyond the wall.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                       (muffled through wall)
                 Miserable fucking discharge!

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I could've moved to another room, one
                 on the third floor -- so I wouldn't
                 have heard them.  But I didn't.

     INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

     SOUNDS of RAIN.  Jack flips FUSES off, then walks upstairs.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - SAME

     Jack walks, HEARS Marla SCREAM in orgasm.  He reaches the
     landing.  Tyler's door is ajar.  Jack peeks in...

     Marla's legs are sprawled on the bed.  The door PUSHES OPEN
     WIDER -- Tyler, naked, stands CLOSE TO CAMERA.

                             TYLER
                 What are you doing?

     Jack steps back.

                             JACK
                 I... uh... just going to bed.

     Tyler scratches his head, wears a RUBBER GLOVE.

                             TYLER
                 You want to finish her off?

                             JACK
                 Uh... nah...

     Jack continues toward his room.

     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Jack brushes his teeth.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I became the calm, little center of
                 the world.  I was the Zen master.

     CLOSE UP - COMPUTER MONITOR

     Haiku is BEING TYPED in a trendy, italicized font.

                              "Worker bees can leave
                               Even drones can fly away
                               The queen is their slave"

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I wrote little haiku poems.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack's clothes are PERMANENTLY STAINED with BLOOD.  He sits
     in Zen pose, cigarette in mouth, finishes typing Haiku.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I faxed them around to everyone.

     He hits "SEND," gets the "ERROR CHIME" SOUND.  He presses
     this key over and over.  Boss enters.

                             BOSS
                 Is that your blood?

                             JACK
                 Some of it, yes.

     Boss stares at Jack like he's from Mars.

                             BOSS
                 Take the rest of the day off.  Come
                 back tomorrow with clean clothes.
                 Get yourself together.

     INT. HALLWAY - SAME

     Jack's leaving, looks like a war casualty, passing COWORKERS
     who coldly stare at him.  His face is totally passive.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I got right in everyone's hostile
                 little face.  Yes, these are bruises
                 from fighting.  I'm comfortable with
                 them.  I am enlightened.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - SUNSET

     Jack walks toward the HOUSE.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You give up the condo life, give up
                 all your flaming worldly possessions,
                 go live in a dilapidated house in the
                 toxic waste part of town...

     INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN - SUNSET

     Jack walks in.  SOUNDS of VIOLENT SEX and a POLAROID CAMERA
     from upstairs.  Pieces of PLASTER fall from the ceiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 ... and you come home to this.

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                       (laughing)
                 You fucking slut!!

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                 Thank you, sir, may I have another!
                 Thank you sir, may I have another... !

     Jack rolls his eyes, takes off his pants.  He runs water in
     the sink, finds a tiny bit of SOAP and scrubs at the blood
     stains.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers it.

                             JACK
                 Yeah.  Speaking.

     INTERCUT WITH...

     INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE

     A cop, DETECTIVE STERN, refers to a file.

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 This is Detective Stern with the
                 arson unit.  We have some new
                 information about the "incident" at
                 your condo.

                             JACK
                 Yes?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 I don't know if you're aware... your
                 front door -- it seems someone
                 sprayed freon into the lock, then
                 tapped it with a chisel to shatter
                 the cylinder.

                             JACK
                 No, I wasn't aware...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I am Jack's Cold Sweat.

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Does this sound strange to you?

                             JACK
                 Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.

     Jack starts to sweat, scrubs his pants obsessively.

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 The dynamite...

                             JACK
                 Dynamite?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium
                 oxalate and potassium perchloride.
                 Do you know what that means?

                             JACK
                 What does that mean?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 It means it was homemade.

                             JACK
                 This is... really a shock...

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Whoever set this homemade dynamite
                 could've blown out the pilot light
                 days before the explosion.  The gas,
                 it seems, was just a detonator.

                             JACK
                 Who do you think could've done this?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 I'll ask the questions, son.

                             TYLER
                       (whispering in Jack's ear)
                 Tell him...

     Jack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see Tyler
     standing right next to him.

                             JACK
                 Huh?

                             TYLER
                       (overlap w/below)
                 "The liberator who destroyed my
                 property has re-aligned my paradigm
                 of perception."

                             JACK
                 Shhhhhh!
                       (into phone,
                        overlap w/above)
                 I don't know what to make of this,
                 sir, I really don't...

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Do you know anyone who'd have the
                 expertise or motive to do something
                 like this?

                             TYLER
                 "I reject the basic assumptions of
                 civilization, including material
                 possession."

     Jack pushes Tyler away, cups the receiving.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo.
                 I loved every stick of furniture.
                 The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were
                 me.  The dishes were me.  The plants
                 were...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'd like to thank the academy...

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Well, if any ideas come to you, give
                 me a call.  In the meantime, don't
                 leave town.  I may need to bring you
                 in for questioning.

     END INTERCUT

     Jack hangs up.  Tyler shrugs.

                             TYLER
                 Could be worse.  You could be cursed
                 with the three terrible Karmas.  You
                 could be beautiful, rich and famous.

     Jack turns away, continues to scrub his pants.  Marla's
     FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming downstairs...

     Jack really grinds the soap against the pants, splashing
     water.  He turns, sees Marla enter.  Tyler is GONE.  Marla
     lights a cigarette.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Except for their humping, Tyler and
                 Marla were never in the same room.

                             MARLA
                 I got this dress at a thrift store
                 for one dollar.

                             JACK
                       (keeps scrubbing)
                 Worth every penny.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 My parents pulled this exact act for
                 years -- one came in, the other
                 disappeared.

     Marla begins a slow, exotic dance, moving very close to
     Jack.  She lifts her dress dangerously high, dancing close
     to Jack's body, almost touhcing.

                             MARLA
                       (seductive)
                 It's a bridesmaid's dress.  Someone
                 loved it intensely for one day, then
                 tossed it.  Like a Christmas tree --
                 so special, then, bam -- it's
                 abandoned on the side of the road,
                 tinsel still clinging to it...

     Jack becomes very aware of having no pants on, presses
     against the counter.  Marla pulls her hemline further up.

                             MARLA
                 Like sex crime victims, underwear
                 inside-out, bound with electrical
                 tape.

                             JACK
                       (coldly)
                 It suits you.

     She leans in very close to Jack's ear, whispers hoarsely:

                             MARLA
                 You can borrow it sometime.

     Jack takes a step away, keeps scrubbing.  Marla blows smoke
     in his face.  Jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the
     sink.  Marla backs away, fed up, storms out, going UPSTAIRS.

                             TYLER (O.S.)
                 Get rid of her.

     Jack turns to see Tyler in the doorway.

                             JACK
                 You get rid of her.

                             TYLER
                       (pointing at Jack)
                 Don't mention me.

     Marla's FOOTSTEPS are coming DOWNSTAIRS.  Jack looks to the
     archway, then back at -- Tyler's GONE.  Marla enters, shoes
     and balled up clothing under one arm, looking for something
     on the junk strewn table.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'm six years old again, passing
                 messages between my parents.

                             JACK
                 I, uh... think you should go now.

     Marla ignores, still searching the table, tossing things,
     pushing other things off to the floor.

                             JACK
                 It's time for you to leave.

                             MARLA
                 Don't worry, I'm leaving.

     Marla finds what she wanted, a pack of cigarettes.  She
     moves up into Jack's face.

                             MARLA
                 You're such a nutcase, I can't even
                 begin to keep up.

                             JACK
                 Goodbye.

     She laughs, spins on her heels.  As she exits the back door,
     she sings "This Merry-Go-Round" from "Valley of the Dolls."
     Jack watches her through the kitchen window.

                             TYLER (O.S.)
                 Nice work.

     Jack turns.  Tyler's right behind him.  Through the window,
     Marla can be seen walking away.  Tyler picks up the remnant
     of SOAP Jack's been using, holds it up to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 To make soap, first we have to render
                 fat.

     Jack looks at Tyler.

     CLOSE UP - SIGN: "DANGER - BIOHAZARD."

     EXT. FENCED-IN BIOHAZARD WASTE DUMP SITE - NIGHT

     Tyler stands inside the fence.  Jack's atop the fence,
     struggling to cross BARBED WIRE.  He wobbles, gets over,
     snags his shirt.  Jack falls, RIPPPPP.  Tyler helps.

     FOOTSTEPS.  A FLASHLIGHT BEAM.  Tyler pulls Jack behind a
     DUMPSTER, one of DOZENS.  A silhouette of a SECURITY GUARD
     moves along the perimeter, flashlight first.  He walks away.

     MOVE BACK to Tyler and Jack, who emerge from hiding.  Tyler
     eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster.

                             TYLER
                 The best fat for making soap --
                 because the salt balance is just
                 right -- comes form human bodies...

     Tyler lifts the lid -- it CREAKS.

                             JACK
                 What is this place?

                             TYLER
                 A liposuction clinic.

     From the dumpster, Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized,
     thick plastic bag full of PINK GOO.

                             TYLER
                 Paydirt.  From society's richest
                 asses and thighs.

     TIME CUT: Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence, carrying
     BAGS of fat.  One of Jack's bags RIPS, spilling the goo down
     the chain-link fench.  Jack slips and slides.  Tyler laughs.
     Tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Jack and Tyler each stir a boiling pot.

                             TYLER
                 As the fat renders, the tallow floats
                 to the surface.  Remember the crap
                 they taught you in Boy Scouts.

                             JACK
                 Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.

                             TYLER
                 This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll
                 mix it back in when we make the soap.

     Tyler sticks a spoon into a pot, lifts up a scoop of the
     glycerin layer.  Then, he crabs a can, opens it.

                             TYLER
                 Lye -- the crucial ingredient.
                       (adding lye to mix)
                 Ancient peoples found their clothes
                 got cleaner if they washed them at a
                 certain spot in the river.  Why?
                 Because, human sacrifices were once
                 made on the hills above this river.
                 Year after year, bodies burnt.  Rain
                 feel.  Water seeped through the wood
                 ashes to become lye.  The lye
                 combined with the melted fat of the
                 bodies, till a thick white soapy
                 discharge crept into the river.

     Tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet.  He takes
     Jack's hands and KISSES the back of it.

                             TYLER
                 The first soap was made from the
                 ashes of heroes.  Like the first
                 monkeys shot into space.

     The saliva shines in the shape of the kiss.  Tyler pours a
     bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand.

                             TYLER
                 Without sacrifice, without death, we
                 would have nothing.

     Jack's whole body JERKS.  Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand
     and arm.  Tears well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens.

                             TYLER
                 This is a chemical burn.  It will
                 hurt more than you've ever been
                 burned and you will have a scar.

     Jack looks -- the burn is swollen, glossy, in the shape of
     Tyler's kiss.  Jack's face spasms.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the
                 back of my hand.

                             TYLER
                 Look at your hand.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Guided meditation worked for cancer,
                 it could work for this.

     SHOT OF A GREEN MAPLE LEAF, GLISTENING WITH DEW.  RESUME:

     Tyler looks at Jack's glazed and detached eyes.

                             TYLER
                 Come back to the pain.  Don't shut
                 this out.

     Jack, snapping back, tries to jerk his hand away.  Tyler
     keeps hold of it and their arms KNOCK UTENSILS off the table.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I tried not to think of the words
                 "searing" or "flesh."  I imagined my
                 pain as a ball of healing white light.

     SHOT OF A FOREST, IN GENTLE SPRING RAINFALL.  RESUME:

     Tyler JERKS Jack's hand, getting Jack's attention...

                             TYLER
                 Stop it.  This is your pain -- your
                 burning hand.  It's right here.  Look
                 at it.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I was going to my cave to find my
                 power animal.

     SHOT OF THE INSIDE OF JACK'S FROZEN ICE CAVE.  RESUME:

     Tyler JERKS Jack's hand again.  Jack re-focuses on Tyler...

                             TYLER
                 Don't deal with this the way those
                 dead people do.  Deal with it the way
                 a living person does.

     SHOT OF INSIDE THE ICE CAVE - ON MARLA, LYING NAKED UNDER A
     FUR COAT, TURNING HER HEAD TO LOOK TOWARDS US.  RESUME:

     Jack tries to pull his hand free.  Tyler won't let go.
     Jack's eyes glaze over again.  Jack speaks, whiny from pain:

                             JACK
                 I... I think I understand.  I think
                 I get it...

                             TYLER
                 No, what you're feeling is premature
                 enlightenment.

     SHOT OF A GREEN FOREST WITHOUT RAIN.  RESUME:

     Tyler SLAPS Jack's face, regaining his attention...

                             TYLER
                 This is the greatest moment of your
                 life and you're off somewhere,
                 missing it.

                             JACK
                 No, I'm not...

     SHOT OF TREES ENGULFED BY A FOREST FIRE.  RESUME:

                             TYLER
                 Shut up.  Our fathers were our models
                 for God.  And, if our fathers bailed,
                 what does that tell us about God?

                             JACK
                 I don't know...

     SHOT OF EMBERS POURING FROM THE HELLISH FOREST FIRE.  RESUME:

     Tyler SLAPS Jack's face again...

                             TYLER
                 Listen to me.  You have to consider
                 the possibility that God doesn't like
                 you, he never wanted you.  In all
                 probability, He hates you.  This is
                 not the worst thing that can happen...

                             JACK
                 It isn't... ?

                             TYLER
                 We don't need him...

                             JACK
                 We don't... ?

     SHOT OF INSIDE ICE CAVE - NAKED MARLA PULLS JACK DOWN ON TOP
     OF HER - JACK KISSES HER - CIGARETTE SMOKE COMES FROM HER
     MOUTH - JACK COUGHS.  RESUME:

     Jack is a wide-eyed zombie...

                             JACK
                 ... Marla ... ?

                             TYLER
                 Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We
                 are God's unwanted children, with no
                 special place and no special
                 attention, and so be it.

     Jack looks at Tyler -- they lock eyes.  Jack does his best
     to stifle his spasms of pain, his body a quivering, coiled
     knot.  He bolts toward the sink, but Tyler holds on.

                             TYLER
                 You can go to the sink and run water
                 over your hand.  Look at me.  Or you
                 can use vinegar to neutralize the
                 burn, but first you have to give up.
                 First, you have to know that someday,
                 you are going to die.  Until you know
                 that, you will be useless.

     Jack spasms with a shiver of pain...

                             JACK
                 You ... you don't know what this
                 feels like, Tyler.

     Tyler shows Jack a LYE-BURNED KISS SCAR on his own hand.
     Tears begin to drip from Jack's eyes.  Tyler grabs a bottle
     of VINEGAR -- pours it over Jack's wound.

     Jack closes his eyes, holds his hand... slumps to the floor.

                             TYLER
                 Congratulations.  You're a step
                 closer to hitting bottom.

     INT. BARNEY'S - DAY

     Jack and Tyler, in trench coats, looking like deaht-warmed-
     over, wait as a BUYER fills out forms.

     There are bars of "The Paper Street Soap Company" soap on
     the counter.  Jack looks like he's half-expecting to get
     arrested.  His hand is BANDAGED.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler sold the soap to department
                 stores at twenty bucks a Ear.  God
                 knows what they charged.  How ironic.
                 We were selling rich women their own
                 fat asses back to them.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack sits at his desk, playing a game on his computer,
     smoking a cigarette.  Boss enters.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was wearing a yellow tie.  It must
                 be Thursday.  I didn't even wear a tie
                 to work anymore.

     Boss slaps a piece of PAPER down on Jack's desk.

                             BOSS
                 "The first rule of fight club is you
                 don't talk about fight club."

     Jack snuffs his cigarette in an ashtray, stares up stoically.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I must've left the original in the
                 copy machine.

                             BOSS
                 "The second rule of fight club...
                 Is this yours?

                             JACK
                 Hmm?

                             BOSS
                 You don't get paid to abuse the copy
                 machine.

                             JACK
                 "Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an
                 image.

                             BOSS
                 Pretend you're me.  You find this.
                 What would you do?

     Jack rises slowly, walks to his door, shuts it.

                             JACK
                 Me? I'd be very careful who I talked
                 to about this.  It sounds like
                 someone dangerous wrote it... someone
                 who might snap at any moment,
                 stalking from office to office with
                 an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas
                 semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round
                 after round into colleagues and co-
                 workers.

     Jack moves very close to Boss, picks up the PAPER and starts
     tearing it into pieces.

                             JACK
                 Might be someone you've known for
                 years... somebody very close to you.
                 Or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing
                 me every little piece of trash you
                 pick up.

     Jack puts the PAPER in his trash.  Bass stares with a tinge
     of outrage, a tinge of fear.  PHONE RINGS.  Jack answers it.

                             JACK
                 Compliance and Liability.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                 My tit's going to rot off.

                             JACK
                 Just a second.
                       (to Boss; smiles)
                 Could you excuse me?  I need to take
                 this call.

     Boss goes to the door, stares at Jack a beat, then leaves.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 What are you talking about?

     INTERCUT WITH - CLOSE UP OF MARLA...

                             MARLA
                 Would you do something for me?  I
                 need you to check and see if there's
                 a lump in my breast.  I can't afford
                 to throw money away on a doctor.

                             JACK
                 I don't know ...

                             MARLA
                 Please.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral
                 in her book.

     EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET

     Jack walks down the sidewalk, seeing Marla take two BOXES
     from a VAN with the sign "MEALS ON WHEELS."

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Marla leads Jack inside.

                             JACK
                 This is a sweet side of you.  Picking
                 these up for ...
                       (reads the boxes:)
                 "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines."
                 Where are they?

                             MARLA
                 Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive
                 and I'm in poverty.  You want any?

                             JACK
                 No, thanks.

                             MARLA
                 Good.

     He stares at her while she eats.

                             MARLA
                 What happened to your hand?

     Jack awkwardly puts his bandaged hand behind his back.

                             JACK
                 Nothing.

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Marla stands facing a MIRROR with her shirt open.  Jack
     stands behind her with his hand on the bottom side of her
     breast.  Marla's hand guides his.

                             JACK
                 Where?  Here?

                             MARLA
                 Here.

                             JACK
                 There?

                             MARLA
                 Here.

                             JACK
                 Here.

                             MARLA
                 Feel anything?

                             JACK
                 No.

     Jack's head is behind Marla's.  They speak softer, slower.

                             MARLA
                 Make sure.

                             JACK
                 Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.

                             MARLA
                 You feel nothing?

                             JACK
                 Nothing.

     Marla turns around and faces him, begins to button her shirt.

                             MARLA
                 Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.

                             JACK
                 No... no problem.

                             MARLA
                 I wish I could return the favor.

     Jack touches his own chest, shakes his head.

                             JACK
                 I think everything's okay here.

                             MARLA
                 I could check your prostate.

                             JACK
                 Uh ... nah.

                             MARLA
                       (pause)
                 Well... thanks, anyway.

     Marla leans to kiss him -- lingers for a bit longer than
     just friendly.  Jack pulls away.

                             JACK
                 So.... are we done?

     Marla sighs.

                             MARLA
                 Yeah, we're done.  See you around.

     EXT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack emerges from the lobby.  He looks up at Marla's window,
     watches her silhouette.  He walks away, right into -- Big
     BOB, the moose, eating a donut and drinking orange juice.

                             BOB
                 Cornelius!  How are you?

                             JACK
                 Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?

                             BOB
                 Better than I've ever been in my life.

                             JACK
                 Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men
                 Together?"

     An intense look of born-again fervor comes over Bob's face.

                             BOB
                 No.  I found something new.

                             JACK
                 Really, what's that?

                             BOB
                       (quietly)
                 The first rule is... you aren't
                 supposed to talk about it...

                             JACK
                 Oh.

                             BOB
                 And the second rule about it is...
                 you're not supposed to talk about it.
                 And the third rule...

                             JACK
                 Bob, Bob... I'm a member.

                                  BOB
                 You are?!

                             JACK
                 Look at my face.

     Bob roughly slaps Jack's shoulder.

                             BOB
                 That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking
                 great! Congratulations.

                             JACK
                 Yeah, both of us.

                             BOB
                 You know about the guy who invented
                 it? I hear all kinds of things.
                 Supposedly, he was born in a mental
                 institution.  They say he only sleeps
                 one hour a night.  You know about
                 this guy?  Tyler Durden?

     INT. BASEMENT - ELECTRONICS WKREHOUSE - NIGHT

     The CROWD SCREAMS insanely as Bob and Jack go at it in the
     circle of light.  Bob's eyes are wild with glee.

     EXT. BASEMENT DOOR - ELECTRONICS WAREHOUSE - LATER

     Everyone sneaks out of this new location - we've seen none
     of these guys before - it's a new chapter.  Jack and Bob
     Stagger out last, Jack being in worse shape.  They both grin
     with religious serenity.  Bob hugs Jack.

                             BOB
                 Thank you.  Thank you.

     Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a
     sack, completely enervated from the beating he took.

                             JACK
                 You're welcome.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Fight club -- this was mine and
                 Tyler's gift... our gift to the world.

     INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Jack has his briefcase on the table, looks at PAPERWORK.
     Tyler wanders in, carries a dirty pot to the sink.  Jack
     takes out a cigarette, lights up.  He offers the pack...

                             TYLER
                 No thanks, I quit.

                             JACK
                 You quit?

                             TYLER
                 Yeah.  Where you headed?

                             JACK
                 Work.  Going to work.

     Tyler scratches his chin absently.

                             JACK
                 What... ?

                             TYLER
                 Nothing.  Do what you like.

     Tyler walks out the way he came.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack sits staring at his SCREEN SAVER.

     INT. BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack steps into the open doorway, knocks on the doorframe.
     Boss looks up from his large, expensive desk.

                             JACK
                 We need to talk.

                             BOSS
                 Okay.  Where to begin?  With your
                 constant absenteeism?  With your
                 unpresentable appearance?  You're up
                 for review...

                             JACK
                 I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.

     Boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged.

                             JACK
                 Let's pretend.  You're the Department
                 of Transportation, and you discover
                 that our company intentionally did
                 nothing about leather seats cured in
                 third world countries with chemicals
                 we know cause birth defects?  Brake
                 linings that fail after a thousand
                 miles.  Fuel injectors that burn
                 people alive.

                             BOSS
                 Just who the fuck do you think you
                 are?!  Get out!  You're fired!

                             JACK
                 What about this?  Keep me on payroll
                 as an outside consultant.  In
                 exchange for my salary, I'll keep my
                 mouth shut.  I won't need to come to
                 the office.  I can do this job from
                 home.

     Boss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage.

                             BOSS
                 You little fucker!  I oughta...

     Jack PUNCHES HIMSELF in the nose.  Blood starts to trickle.
     He punches himself in the jaw, throws himself back as if by
     the force of the punch, SLAMS against a framed picture and
     SHATTERS the glass.  He falls to the floor.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge.

     Jack gets back to his feet.

                             JACK
                 Please... don't hit me again, please.
                 I'm your responsibility...

     He PUNCHES himself in the stomach, then in the jaw again.
     He reels backwards, pulls down a hanging shelf, its contents
     flying.  He hits the floor.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 For some reason, I thought of my
                 first fight -- with Tyler.

     Jack crawls toward Boss, dripping blood, grabs Boss's leg.

                             JACK
                 Please... give me the paychecks like
                 I asked for.  I won't be any trouble.
                 You won't see me again.

     Jack climbs up Boss's leg while Boss tries to shake him off.
     Boss stumbles back into his desk, knocking off belongings.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Under and behind and inside
                 everything this man took for granted,
                 something horrible had been growing.

     Jack crawls high enough to grab Boss's belt, hoisting
     himself up.  He dribbles blood an Boss's clothing, SMUDGES
     blood from his face onto the knuckles of Boss's hand.

                             JACK
                 Please... please...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And right then, at our most excellent
                 moment together...

     Two SECURITY GUARDS enter and gape at the sight.  Behind
     them stand CURIOUS WORKERS, looking in.

                             JACK
                       (gurgling blood)
                 Please don't hit me again.

     INT. TYLER'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE FOYER - DAY

     Jack holds a CHECK in front of Tyler's face.

                             JACK
                 Six months advance pay.  Six months!

                             TYLER
                 Fucking sweet.

                             JACK
                 Okay, and... and...

     Jack digs in his pocket, takes out a thick bundle of CARDS.

                             JACK
                 Forty-eight airline flight coupons.
                 Plus... hold on... just a minute...

     Jack holds up a finger, going to open the front door.  He
     drags an unwieldy SHOPPING CART in behind him; filled with
     his COMPUTER, PHONE, FAX and other office equipment.

                             JACK
                 I am now officially self-employed.

     Jack looks at the cart, then back at Tyler, proud.

                             TYLER
                 Good for you.

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - BASEMENT - NIGHT

     LOUD.  An enormous CROWD of guys, including Jack and Bob,
     stands around Tyler, who's in the center of the circle,
     holding up his hands to quiet them...

                             TYLER
                 I look around... I look around and
                 see a lot of new faces.

     An enthusiastic RUMBLE from the crowd.

                             TYLER
                 Shut up!  Which means a lot of you
                 have been breaking the first two
                 rules of fight club.

     A glum silence falls.  Guys look at each other.

                             TYLER
                 I see in fight club the strongest and
                 smartest men who have ever lived --
                 an entire generation pumping gas and
                 waiting tables; or they're slaves
                 with white collars.
                             (more)

                             TYLER (cont)
                 Advertisements have them chasing cars
                 and clothes, working jobs they hate
                 so they can buy shit they don't need.
                 We are the middle children of
                 history, with no purpose or place.
                 We have no great war, or great
                 depression.  The great war is a
                 spiritual war.  The great depression
                 is our lives.  We were raised by
                 television to believe that we'd be
                 millionaires and movie gods and rock
                 stars -- but we won't.  And we're
                 learning that fact.  And we're very,
                 very pissed-off.

     The crowd erupts into a DEAFENING CHORUS of agreement.  Jack
     looks at the blazing excitement in the eyes of the crowd.

                             TYLER
                 We are the quiet young men who listen
                 until it's time to decide.

     A fat, MIDDLE-AGED MAN stomps down the stairs, pushing into
     the crowd, followed by a TALL, HEFTY THUG who holds a GUM.

                             TYLER
                 Who are you?

                             FAT MAN (LOU)
                 Who am I?!  There's a sign on the
                 front that says "Lou's Tavern." I'm
                 fucking Lou.  Who the fuck are you?!

                             TYLER
                 Tyler Durden.

     Tyler extends his hand for a shake, but Lou SLAPS it away.

                             LOU
                 Who told you motherfuckers you could
                 use my place?

                             TYLER
                 We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

                             LOU
                 Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a
                 broken collarbone.

     Everyone glances guiltily at each other.

                             LOU
                 He don't own this place, I do.  How
                 much money's he getting for this?

                             TYLER
                 There is no money.

                             LOU
                 Really?

                             TYLER
                 It's free to all.

                             LOU
                 Ain't that something?

                             TYLER
                 Yes, it is.

                             LOU
                 Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone
                 outta here now!

                             TYLER
                 You're welcome to join our club.

                             LOU
                 Did you hear what I just said?!

                             TYLER
                 You and your friend.

     Lou SLUGS Tyler in the stomach, doubles him over.

                             LOU
                 You hear me now?

     Tyler gains his breath, determined.  He looks up, turns his
     head, looking to Jack.  Jack watches, wide-eyed.

     Tyler straightens, facing Lou.

                             TYLER
                 No, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

     Lou PUNCHES Tyler in the face.  Some of the guys move
     forward, but the Thug points his gun.  Jack-runs forward
     anyway -- Lou PUNCHES him in the face.

     More guys move forward, but Tyler waves them off, facing Lou.

                             TYLER
                 We really need to use this place.

     Lou proceeds to beat the shit out of Tyler, PUNCHING his
     face, his stomach.  Tyler collapses to the floor.  Lou
     starts KICKING his.  Tyler bleeds from the mouth and face.

                             TYLER
                 That's it.... that's good.  Get it
                 all out.  You'll feel better.

     Lou flushes red with exasperation, KICKS more.  Finally,
     sweating, bewildered, Lou stops.  He looks to the Thug, who
     is just as bewildered.

     Suddenly, Tyler SPRINGS UP, grabs onto Lou...

                             TYLER
                 Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and
                 this whole fucking world...

     Tyler's blood spatters on Lou.  Lou tries to shake Tyler
     off, but Tyler BITES Lou's NECKTIE.  The Thug grabs Tyler
     and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling Lou.  Lou
     slaps at Tyler's face, but recoils from the blood.  Tyler
     spits and shouts through clenched teeth...

                             TYLER
                 You don't know where I've been.

     Tyler bear hugs Lou, pulls him to the floor.  Tyler rubs his
     bloody face into Lou's face.  The Thug lifts Tyler.  Tyler
     clings to Lou's belt, dragging Lou as he is dragged...

                             TYLER
                 We need this place.  We need it.
                 Please let us keep it, please...

     Blood dribbles out of Tyler's mouth, spattering Lou.

                             LOU
                 What are you doing?!

                             TYLER
                 Pleeeeeease!

                             LOU
                 Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the
                 basement!  Get off me!

                             TYLER
                 We need some towels, Lou.  We need
                 replacement light bulbs.

                             LOU
                 Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!

                             TYLER
                 Thank you.  Thank you, sir...

                             LOU
                 Let go of me!!

     Tyler lets go of Lou's belt.  Lou scrambles away.  The Thug
     drops Tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood.  Lou gets to
     his feet, looks at Tyler, then at the rest of the guys.  He
     and the Thug back away... slamming the door behind.

     Fight club surrounds Tyler.  They help him up, move him to
     a crate.  Tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his
     breathing labored... then, he sits back, crossing his legs
     and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike.

                             TYLER
                 This week, each of you has a homework
                 assignment.  You're going to go out
                 and start a fight with a total
                 stranger...
                       (pause, drooling blood)
                 You're going to start a fight... and
                 you're going to lose.

     Jack beams in appreciation.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Ricky trips a passing YUPPIE.  The Yuppie falls.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Not as easy as it sounds.  People'll
                 do just about anything to avoid a
                 fight.

     The Yuppies gets up, angry, and Ricky PUNCHES him...

                             YUPPIE
                 Hey!  Wha... What the hell... what
                 are you doing?!  Who are you?!!

     The Yuppie backs away.  Ricky follows...

                             YUPPIE
                 Get away from me!  Keep away!
                 NO... !

     Ricky TACKLES the Yuppie.  The Yuppie struggles spastically.

                             YUPPIE
                 Who are you!?  Why are you attacking
                 me... ?!

     Having no recourse, the Yuppie begins trading blows.

     EXT. AUTO SHOP - DAY

     A MECHANIC WITH A BATTERED FACE uses a hose to wash the
     sidewalk.  As MEN pass, he jerks the hose up and SPRAYS them.

                             FIRST MAN
                 Hey... hey...

                             SECOND MAN
                 Watch out, jackass!

     These men continue on their way.

     The Mechanic sprays a third man, a SEMINARY STUDENT, who
     looks down, stunned.

                             SEMINARIAN
                 You... you did that on purpose!

     The Mechanic DOUSES the Seminarian.  The Seminarian grabs
     the hose, wrestling the Mechanic for it.  The Mechanic
     shoves the Seminarian, who responds with a half-assed PUNCH.
     The Mechanic purposely takes it.  The Seminarian starts to
     run away.  The Mechanic sprints after him, PUNCHING the
     Seminarian in the back of the neck.  They fight.

     INT. RECORD STORE STOCKROOM - NIGHT

     A FIST smashes a JAW.  Guys CHEER.  An arm snakes around a
     neck and squeezes, blood and sweat dripping.  It's the
     YUPPIE and the SEMINARIAN fighting.  Tyler walks around the
     perimeter of the circle.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Now nobody was the center of fight
                 club except the two men fighting.
                 The leader walked around in the
                 crowd, out in the darkness.

     Tyler hands ENVELOPES out to the crowd.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Everyone took a homework assignment.

     EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT

     Ricky and another FIGHT CLUBBER paste up a BILLBOARD which
     reads: "DID YOU KNOW? YOU CAN USE YOUR OLD MOTOR OIL TO
     FERTILIZE YOUR LAWN! -- ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY."

     INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE

     HANDS use a MARKER, writing on a FILE: "Disinformation."

     EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY

     Jack and Tyler, in work gloves, armed with TOOLS, work
     together to lift the entire METAL PLATE of EXIT SPIKES from
     the ground.  They reverse it, then replace it.

     MOMENTS LATER

     Jack and Tyler walk away, each carrying a 4x4 plank of WOOD.

                             JACK
                 There's fight club in Delaware City.

                             TYLER
                 I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.

     As they pass PARKED CARS, they SWING the planks against
     front bumpers -- activating ALARMS and INFLATING AIR BAGS...

                             JACK
                 Local 8 just started in Penns Grove.
                 And, Bob said he was at fight club in
                 Newcastle last week.

                             TYLER
                 Newcastle?  Did you start that one?

                             JACK
                 I thought you did.

     In the background, a CAR quickly EXITS the parking lot --
     front tires EXPLODING, wheel rims throwing sparks.

     INT. FAMILY HOUSEHOLD -- NIGHT

     FATHER, MOTHER, YOUNG DAUGHTER and SON, eat dinner, watching
     TELEVISION.  Suddenly, the TV IMAGE turns to SNOW and static.

     Family members stop eating.  Father picks up the REMOTE,
     points it -- all channels are SNOW.

     Father turns the TV OFF.  He and his family members look at
     each other, utensils in hand, uncomfortable.

     EXT. CITY ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

     The Yuppie SWINGS a BASEBALL BAT -- DESTROYS a digital
     SATELLITE DISH.  The Yuppie and the Seminarian move on,
     climbing to a neighboring rooftop.  They come upon another
     DISH.  The Seminarian takes the bat, takes a SWING...

     INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE

     HANDS place NEWS CLIPPINGS into a FILE: "Mischief."

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - ON GROUND - DAY

     Two AIRPLANE MAINTENANCE,MEN, with bruised faces, rip open
     a box from a PRINT SHOP.  They dig up AIRPLANE SAFETY
     INSTRUCTION CARDS and begin inserting them into each
     seatback.  We SEE a CARD - it shows passengers SCREAMING
     and FLAILING ABOUT IN TERROR.

     INT. BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT

     Huge office.  Rows and rows of desks.  FIGHT CLUB MEMBERS
     work: one guy moving from COMPUTER MONITOR to COMPUTER
     MONITOR, using a DRILL to drill a hole into the top of each.

     Other guys follow behind, with FUNNELS and CANS of GASOLINE,
     filling each monitor with gasoline.

     INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE

     Files and newspaper clippings are piled up.  HANDS write on
     a new FILE FOLDER: "Arson."

     EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY

     The Yuppie crumbles a loaf of stale bread into a bucket,
     stirring it with a big spoon, mixing in a BOTTLE of EX-LAX.

     Nearby, Rob throws handfuls of wet BREADCRUMBS to PIGEONS...
     HUNDREDS of PIGEONS -- a rooftop feeding-frenzy.

     EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

     Tyler and Jack cross the parking lot, towards the
     convenience store.  Jack wears a BACKPACK.

                             TYLER
                 Let me have that a minute...

     Tyler takes the BACKPACK, unzips it, searching the contents.

                             JACK
                 What are we doing?

                             TYLER
                 Homework assignment.

                             JACK
                 What is it?

     Tyler takes out a HANDGUN, hands the backpack back.

                             TYLER
                 Human Sacrifice.

     Jack turns white, staring at the gun.

     EXT. BEHIND THE CONVENIENCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER

     The BACK DOOR opens and Tyler brings the store's CLERK out
     at gunpoint, forces him to his knees.  Jack follows,
     freaked.  Tyler points the gun at the Clerk.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 On a long enough time line, the
                 survival rate for everyone drops to
                 zero.

                             CLERK
                 Please... don't...

                             TYLER
                 Give me your wallet.

     The Clerk fumbles his wallet out of his pocket and Tyler
     snatches it.  Tyler pulls out the DRIVER'S LICENCE.

                             TYLER
                 Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning,
                 apartment A.  A small, cramped
                 basement apartment.

                             RAYMOND
                 How'd you know?

                             TYLER
                 They give basement apartments letters
                 instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're
                 going to die.

     Tyler rummages through the wallet.

                             TYLER
                 Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?

                             RAYMOND
                 Yesssss...

                             TYLER
                 Your mom and dad will have to call
                 kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up
                 your dental records, because there
                 won't be much left of your face.

                             RAYMOND
                 Please, God, no...

     Raymond begins to weep, shoulders heaving.

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

                             TYLER
                 An expired community college student
                 ID card.  What did you used to study,
                 Raymond K. Hessel?

                             RAYMOND
                 S-S-Stuff.

                             TYLER
                 "Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?

     Tyler rams the gun barrel against Raymond's temple.

                             TYLER
                 I asked you what you studied.

                             JACK
                 Tell him!

                             RAYMOND
                 Biology, mostly.

                             TYLER
                 Why?

                             RAYMOND
                 I... I don't know...

                             TYLER
                 What did you want to be, Raymond K.
                 Hessel?

     Raymond weeps and says nothing.  Tyler COCKS the gun.
     Raymond GASPS.

                             TYLER
                 The question, Raymond, was "what did
                 you want to be?"

     A beat.

                             JACK
                 Answer him!

                             RAYMOND
                 A veterinarian!

                             TYLER
                 Animals.

                             RAYMOND
                 Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---

                             TYLER
                 Stuff.  That means you have to get
                 more schooling.

                             RAYMOND
                 Too much school.

     Tyler shoves Raymond's wallet back into Raymond's pocket.

                             TYLER
                 Would you rather be dead?

                             RAYMOND
                 No, please, no, God, no!

     Tyler moves the gun right between Raymond's eyes.

                             RAYMOND
                 NOOOOO!

     Tyler UNCOCKS the gun, lowers it.

                             TYLER
                 I'm keeping your license.  I know
                 where you live.  I'm going to check
                 on you.  If you aren't back in school
                 and on your way to being a
                 veterinarian in six weeks, you will
                 be dead.  Get the hell out of here.

     Raymond staggers to his feet, heads down an alleyway.  Jack
     and Tyler watch Raymond flee, then Tyler looks at Jack.

                             JACK
                   I feel sick.

                             TYLER
                   Imagine how he feels.

     Tyler brings the gun to his own head, pulls the trigger --
     CLICK.  Empty.

                             JACK
                 I don't care, that was horrible.

     Tyler walks away.

                             TYLER
                 Tomorrow will be the most beautiful
                 day of Raymond K. Hessell's life.

     Jack watches Tyler go.

                             TYLER
                 His breakfast will taste better than
                 any meal he has ever eaten.

     Jack turns to look the direction Raymond ran.  He finally
     turns back, following after Tyler.

     INT. BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT

     SLOW MOTION: in the deserted office, gasoline filled
     COMPUTER MONITORS begin to EXPLODE...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM... !

     EXT. CITY STREETS -- MORNING

     Luxury AUTOMOBILES are parked, splattered with BIRD SHIT.

     EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAWN

     VIEWED OUT 3RD STORY WINDOW: Tyler uses a RAKE, dragging it
     across rocks and dirt.  He stops a moment, rake on his
     shoulder, staring off.  Then, back to work...

                             TYLER
                       (muttering quietly)
                 ... You are not how much money you
                 have in the bank.  You are not the
                 shoes you wear.

     Tyler's marking a large SQUARE in the weeds and rubble of
     the backyard, kicking rocks away, dragging the rake...

                             TYLER
                 You are not the contents of your
                 wallet...

     INT. CITY BUS - NIGHT

     The DRIVER has a broken nose.  The bus is empty, except for
     Jack, in the very last seat, sleepy.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He had a plan.  Maybe you just didn't
                 see it till it hit you between the
                 eyes.
                       (pause)
                 But, it started to make sense... in
                 a Tyler sort of way.  No fear.  No
                 distractions.  The ability to let
                 that which does not matter truly
                 slide.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT

     Jack gets off the bus.  As the bus pulls away, we see it
     dropped Jack off right in front of the house.

     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack enters.  Tyler, dressed in FATIGUES and splattered with
     PAINT, grabs BEERS from the refrigerator.

                             JACK
                 Hey.

                             TYLER
                 Hey.

     Jack notices ROPE and RAPPELLING TOOLS on the table.  Tyler
     comes to hand Jack a bunch of beers, nod to the living room.

                             TYLER
                 Go on in.  We're celebrating.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Jack, bewildered, enters carrying beers.  Tyler does NOT
     follow.  BOB, RICKY and several other fight club guys sit in
     front at the TV, chanting not too loudly, all also dressed
     in FATIGUES and splattered with PAINT.

                             RICKY
                 You are not your job.

                             OTHERS TOGETHER
                 You are not your job.

                             RICKY
                 You are not how much money you have
                 in the bank.

                             BOB
                 Shhhh, wait... they're back to it...

     Bob goes to turn up the TV.  One guy, sixteen years old with
     an angelic face, ANGEL FACE, gets up to take beer from Jack.

                             ANGEL FACE
                       (to Jack)
                 Great, thanks.

     Angel face starts distributing beer amongst his cohorts.

                             BOB
                 Shhhhh!  Watch!

     Jack looks to the TV -- it shows a LIVE shot of the "PARKER
     MORRIS BUILDING."  The building has a GIANT, GRINNING FACE
     PAINTED on it -- two BROKEN WINDOWS for EYES, with flames
     pouring out... FIRETRUCKS spray water.

                             REPORTER (V.O.)
                 Police Commissioner Jacobs has just
                 arrived... just a second... excuse
                 me, Commissioner, could you tell us
                 what you think has happened?

     COMMISSIONER JACOBS, a wrinkled official, turns to camera.

                             COMMISSIONER JACOBS (V.O.)
                 We believe this is related to the
                 recent acts of vandalism around the
                 city.  It's some kind of organized
                 group, and we are coordinating a
                 rigorous investigation.

     Jack turns, sees Tyler in the archway, watching him.  Tyler
     tips his beer to toast, pulls back, out of sight.

                             JACK
                 What did you guys do?

     They all BURST INTO LAUGHTER.  They look at Jack and shake
     their heads.  Jack doesn't get it.  Suddenly, the guys'
     faces turn to stone.  Bob sits rigid.

                             BOB
                 The first rule of Project Mayhem
                 is... you do not ask questions.

     Jack stares at them.

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

     A luxurious BANQUET.  Commissioner Jacobs guzzles champagne.
     He rises and starts out of the room.  Jack, in a WAITER'S
     UNIFORM, looks apprehensively to OTHER WAITERS: BOB...
     RICKY... ANGEL FACE -- who all give each other a look.

     INT. HALLWAY

     Jacobs saunters down an empty hall.  He stops to check his
     tie in a mirror.  He pushes open the door of the MEN'S
     BATHROOM -- face to face with TYLER.

     INT. BATHROOM

     Tyler GRABS Commissioner Jacobs, pulling him into the
     bathroom.  He slaps a piece of tape over Jacobs' mouth.  The
     OTHER "WAITERS" rush in.  Jack stays back to keep the door
     shut.  Tyler and the others hold Jacobs, pulling down his
     pants.  Bob snaps a rubber band -- reaches to Jacob s crotch.

                             TYLER
                 Wrap it around the top of his hackie-
                 sack.

                             BOB
                 Man, his balls are ice cold.

     Ricky produces a KNIFE, moves it down to Jacob's testicles.
     Jacobs is bug-eyed.  Jack, red-faced, keeps his distance.

                             TYLER
                 You're not going to continue your
                 "rigorous investigation."  You will
                 publicly state that there is no
                 underground group.  Or -- imagine,
                 the rest of your life with your
                 scrotum flapping empty.

                             JACOBS
                       (mouth taped)
                 ... no... please, no...

                             TYLER
                 We'll send one to the New York Times
                 and one to the Los Angeles Times.
                 Press release style.  Your nuts will
                 be bicoastal.  Understood?  The
                 people you're after are everyone you
                 depend on.
                             (more)

                             TYLER (cont)
                 We do your laundry, cook your food
                 and serve you dinner.  We guard you
                 while you sleep.  We drive your
                 ambulances.  Do not fuck with us.

     Ricky makes a dramatic cut with the knife, causing Jacobs to
     JUMP -- Ricky holds up the severed RUBBER BAND.

     EXT. HOTEL - LATER

     Jack, Tyler and the others file quickly out the back SERVICE
     ENTRANCE.  Tyler gives Angel Face a hearty slap on the back.
     Angel Face smiles at Tyler, nods, grinning.

     Jack sees this, his eyes narrowing, stops walking.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Fight club in full swing.  Jack battles Angel Face, BEATING
     the shit out of him with unprecedented viciousness.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I felt like putting a bullet between
                 the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't
                 screw to save its species.

     The crowd shouts maniacally, save Tyler, who watches with an
     inscrutable stone face.

     Angel Face tries to speak, but Jack POUNDS too hard.  Blood
     flies.  The crowd begins to grow QUIETER.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I wanted to open the dump valves on
                 oil tankers and smother all the
                 French beaches I'd never see.

     Finally, Angel Face lies still, unconscious.  Jack stops,
     stares down, numb.  Jack walks away -- the crowd parts to
     let him pass.  Jack scans faces... finds Tyler.

                             TYLER
                 Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?

                             JACK
                 I felt like destroying something
                 beautiful.

     EXT. STREET NEAR LOU'S TAVERN - LATER

     RAINING.  Tyler and Jack walk through pools of streetlight.
     A idling car HONKS.  Tyler leads Jack toward it.  A bruised-
     faced VALET PARKER thrown keys to Tyler, but Jack intercepts.

                             VALET
                 There you are, Mr. Durden.  Airport
                 parking, long term.

                             JACK
                       (motions to car)
                 After you, Mr. Durden...

                             TYLER
                 No... after you.

     INT. STOLEN CAR

     Tyler gets in the driver's seat.  Jack gets into the front
     passenger seat.  Ricky and the mechanic are in back.

     EXT. STREET

     Tyler pulls the stolen car away from the curb.  It has two
     bumperstickers: "RECYCLE YOUR ANIMALS" and "MAKE MINE VEAL."

     INT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - LATER

     RAIN GUSHES down.  Jack stews, silent.  The car moves down
     a HIGHWAY, intermittently illuminated by oncoming headlights.

                             TYLER
                 Something on your mind?

                             JACK
                 No.

     Tyler shrugs; turns on the RADIO, ignores Jack.

                             JACK
                 Why wasn't I told about "Project
                 Mayhem?"

                             TYLER
                 What should I have told you?

                             JACK
                 Why wasn't I involved from the
                 beginning?  You and I started fight
                 club together.

                             TYLER
                 Fight club was the beginning.  Now
                 it's out of the basements and there's a
                 name for it -- Project Mayhem.

                             RICKY AND MECHANIC
                       (together)
                 The first rule of Project Mayhem is
                 you do not ask questions.

                             JACK
                 This is as much mine as yours.

                             TYLER
                 Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it
                 about you and me?

                             JACK
                 You know what I mean.

                             TYLER
                 What do you want?  A statement of
                 purpose... ?

                             JACK
                 Look...

                             TYLER
                 Should I E-mail you?  Should I put
                 this on your "action item list?"

                             JACK
                 I want to know --

                             TYLER
                 What do you want to know about
                 Project Mayhem?

                             RICKY AND MECHANIC
                       (together)
                 The first rule of Project Mayhem --

                             JACK
                       (to Ricky and Mechanic)
                 Shut up!!
                       (to Tyler)
                 I want to know what's going on.

     Tyler steers the car into the opposite lane, accelerates...
     Opposing HEADLIGHTS get closer fast...

                             TYLER
                 This does not belong to us.  We are
                 not the leaders.  We are not special.

                             JACK
                 What are you doing?!

                             TYLER
                 We are the all-singing, all-dancing
                 crap of the world.  We are all part
                 of the same compost heap...

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

     Tyler steers back into the proper lane.  The other CAR flies
     past, HORN SOUNDING...

                             JACK
                 What the hell ... ?!

                             TYLER
                 You choose your level of involvement.
                 I won't make decisions for you.

                             JACK
                 I'm not asking you to.

                             TYLER
                 You're asking questions that don't
                 have answers.  You know just as much
                 about Project Mayhem as anybody else.

                             JACK
                 I don't think that's true.

     Tyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up.
     Through the windshield: oncoming headlights -- a TRUCK.

                             JACK
                 Tyler... what is this... !

     Jack fights	to turn the wheel, but Tyler uses both hands.

                             TYLER
                 What will you wish you'd done before
                 you died?

                             RICKY
                 Paint a self-portrait.

                             MECHANIC
                 Build a house.

                             TYLER
                       (to Jack)
                 And you?

                             JACK
                 I don't know!  Nothing!

                             TYLER
                 If you died right now, how would you
                 feel about your life?

                             JACK
                 I would feel nothing about my life?
                 Is that what you want to hear?!

     The oncoming truck HONKS and FLASHES its LIGHTS.  It moves
     to the other side of the road.  Tyler steers there, too.

                             TYLER
                 I want to hear the truth.

                             JACK
                 Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck
                 you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of
                 this.  How's that?

                             TYLER
                 Why do you think I blew up your condo?

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 Hitting bottom isn't a weekend
                 retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You
                 have to forget everything you know,
                 everything you think you know --
                 about life, about friendship, about
                 you and me.

     Nearing impact with the oncoming truck, Tyler takes his
     hands off the wheel -- Jack keeps his grip, turns the
     wheel... the car swerves...

     The truck ROARS past, spraying water, HORN BLASTING.

     Tyler looks at Jack, his hands in the air.  Jack looks at
     Tyler with dead eyes.

                             JACK
                 Okay, okay... fine...

     Jack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air.
     Tyler studies Jack face, impressed.  Tyler makes no move to
     take the wheel.

     THROUGH THR WINDSHIELD: a STALLED CAR ahead on the side of
     the road, surrounded by flares.

     Jack and Tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the
     shoulder... heading for the stalled car.  Their faces are
     illuminated by the light of the flares.  Tyler smiles.

     They SMASH into the stalled car -- AIRBAGS INFLATE!  The
     back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass-
     over-tea-kettle ROLL down a hill...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'd never been in a car accident.
                 This must've been what all those
                 statistics felt like before I filed
                 them into my reports.

     The car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof.

     EXT. OVERTURNED CAR

     Tyler crawls from the passenger side.  He walks around...
     opens the driver's side door and drags Jack out into the
     mud.  Ricky and the Mechanic climb out the broken rear
     window.  Tyler sits beside the stunned, wounded Jack.

                             TYLER
                 We just had a near-life experience.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Jack lies in bed, traumatized, eyes empty, staring at the
     ceiling.  Tyler sits in a nearby chair.

                             TYLER
                 In the world I see -- you're stalking
                 elk through the damp canyon forests
                 around the ruins of Rockefeller
                 Center.  You will wear leather
                 clothes that last you the rest of
                 your life.  You will climb the wrist-
                 thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears
                 Tower.  You will see tiny figures
                 pounding corn and laying-strips of
                 venison on the empty car pool lane of
                 the ruins of a superhighway.

     Tyler stands, gives Jack's head a pat.

                             TYLER
                       (leaving)
                 Feel better, champ.

     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack sits at the table, sips coffee.  He's pale, dazed,
     seems broken.  He hears the faint SOUND of SAWING and
     HAMMERING, unsure of where it's coming from.

     Marla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the
     counter.  Her back is to Jack as he looks at her.  She pours
     ccffee and lights a cigarette.  A beat of silence, then:

                             MARLA
                 I'll be out of your way in a sec.

     She seems to be as weak as Jack.

                             JACK
                 You... don't have to... leave.

                             MARLA
                 Whatever.

                             JACK
                 Really... I mean it.
                       (pause)
                 Have you been going to your groups?

                             MARLA
                 Chloe's dead.

                             JACK
                 When?

                             MARLA
                 Do you care?

                             JACK
                 I don't know.

                             MARLA
                 It was the smart move on her part.

     Marla turns to face Jack, a grim expression on her face.
     There's a BRUISE on her ARM.  Jack gets up, moves closer.

                             JACK
                 Why are we both... caught up like
                 this... with... ?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I came so close to saying Tyler's
                 name, I could feel it vibrate inside
                 my mouth.

     Marla looks a him, waiting.

                             JACK
                 I don't understand.  Why does a weak
                 person have to go out and find a
                 strong person... to hang onto?

                             MARLA
                 What do you get out of it?

     Faint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING.  Jack can't quite
     figure where it's coming from.

                             JACK
                 You hear that?

                             MARLA
                 Hear what?

                             JACK
                 That... sawing and hammering.

                             MARLA
                 Have we been talking too long?  Must
                 we change the subject?

     Jack turns -- through the crack of the open basement door,
     Tyler's staring at Jack from the bottom of the stairs.

                             TYLER
                       (harsh whisper)
                 You're not talking about me, are you?

     Jack reacts, turns back to Marla.

                             JACK
                       (to Marla and Tyler)
                 No.

                             MARLA
                 That day you came over to my place to
                 play doctor... what was going on
                 there?

                             TYLER
                       (still a whisper)
                 What are you talking about?

                             JACK
                       (to Marla and Tyler)
                 Nothing.

                             MARLA
                 Nothing?  I don't think so.

                             TYLER
                       (whisper)
                 This conversation...

                             JACK
                 This conversation...

                             TYLER
                 ... is over.

                             JACK
                 ... is over.

     Marla comes to touch Jack's hair.  Jack closes the basement
     door.  Marla sees the kiss-scar on Jack's hand, grabs his
     hand.  Jack tries to pull it back, but Marla keeps a grip.

                             MARLA
                 What is this?  Who did this?

                             JACK
                 ... A person.

                             MARLA
                 Guy or girl?

                             JACK
                 Why would you ask if it's a guy or a
                 girl?!

                             MARLA
                 Why would you get bent if I asked?

                             JACK
                 Let go of me...
                       (pulls his hand free)
                 Leave me alone.

                             MARLA
                 You're afraid to say.

     Marla backs away, closes her eyes, struggling with
     frustration.  She leaves out the back door, not looking back.

     Jack leans against the wall.  After a moment, he opens the
     basement door, heads downstairs...

     INT. BASEMENT STAIRCASE

     Tyler walks upstairs, passing as Jack continues down...

     INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

     Jack looks around.  TRIPLE-DECKER BUNKS clutter the
     basement, as many as can fit into the space.

                             JACK
                       (calling upstairs)
                 Tyler... ?  What's this for?

     From upstairs, the SOUND of the DOORBELL.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack opens the door.  Ricky stands on the porch, staring
     ahead in subordinate military style.  He's in black pants,
     black shirt, black shoes, holds a PAPER BAG, with an army
     surplus MATTRESS rolled-up at his feet.

                             JACK
                 Um... what can I do for you, Ricky?

     Tyler steps up beside Jack, looks Ricky over.

                             TYLER
                 You're too young.  Sorry.

                             JACK
                 Wait a minute...

     Tyler comes back inside, shuts the door.

                             JACK
                 "Too young?"

                             TYLER
                 If the applicant is young, we tell
                 him he's too young.  Old, too old.
                 Fat, too fat.

                             JACK
                 "Applicant?"

                             TYLER
                 If the applicant waits at the door
                 for three days without food, shelter
                 or encouragement, then he can enter
                 and begin training.

                             JACK
                 "Training?"  Tyler...

     EXT. PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack comes out, walks around Ricky, hands in his pockets,
     unsure.  Tyler watches, nods for Jack to go ahead.

                             JACK
                 Uh, look.  You're too... young to...
                 train here.  You should probably be
                 on you way.

     No response from Ricky, who remains at attention.  Jack goes
     back inside.  Tyler closes the door.

     EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

     Ricky remains at attention.  Jack bursts out with a BROOM,
     knocks the brown bag out of Ricky's hand, kicks it away.

                             JACK
                 Are you deaf?!  I told you to leave!
                 You will never get inside this house!

     EXT. PORCH - MORNING

     Ricky's still there.  Tyler comes out, friendly.

                             TYLER
                 Look, friend, I'm sorry for the
                 misunderstanding.  It's not the end
                 of the world.  Just go away.  You're
                 trespassing and I will call the
                 police.  Nothing personal.

     EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

     Ricky, same spot.  Jack bursts outside with the broom again.

                             JACK
                 You're never getting through this
                 door, you stupid little weasel!  Look
                 at me when I talk to you... !

     He WHACKS Ricky in the shoulder with the broom.

                             JACK
                 What is your major malfunction!?

     INT. JACK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     At the window, Tyler sips coffee, watches this scene on the
     PORCH below.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Sooner or later, we all became what
                 Tyler wanted us to be.

     EXT. PORCH - MORNING

     Ricky's there.  Bob is now next to him, in black, with a
     paper bag in hand, mattress at his feet.  Tyler steps out.
     Jack stays in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob.  To all the
     following questions, Ricky answers "Sir!" --

                             TYLER
                 You have two black shirts?  Two pair
                 black trousers?  One pair black
                 boots?  Two pair black socks?  One
                 black coat?  Three hundred dollars
                 personal burial money?  Go inside.

     Ricky goes in.  Tyler turns to Bob.

                             TYLER
                 You're too old.  Sorry.  And, you're
                 too fat.  Nice seeing you.

     Bob looks genuinely hurt.  He picks up his mattress and
     starts away.  Tyler looks at Jack and rolls his eyes.  Jack
     follows Bob...

                             JACK
                 Bob... Bob, wait...
                       (leading Bob back)
                 Let me explain this to you...

     EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT

     CRICKETS CHIRP.  Bob stands at at rigid attention.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

     Tyler and Jack stand in bathroom doorway, watching Ricky
     finish SHAVING off all of his HAIR.  Tyler comes to give the
     top of Ricky's head a sharp SLAP.

                             TYLER
                 A monkey, ready to be shot into
                 space.  A Space Monkey, ready to
                 sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem.

     From here on, all those with shaved heads: "SPACE MONKEYS."

     EXT. PORCH - DAY

     Jack looks out the window.  Bob stands motionless.  There's
     another "applicant," a SHORT GUY, beside Bob.  Ricky comes
     out the front door with the BROOM...

                             RICKY
                       (to Bob)
                 You're too fucking old, fatty!  We
                 don't want your kind here!
                       (to short guy)
                 You're too short.  Go away, stumpy!
                 Go back to the circus!

     Ricky HITS them with the broom, then goes in, SLAMS THE DOOR.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 So it went...

     EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

     Tyler works with a HALF DOZEN SPACE MONKEYS, preparing the
     square of backyard.  They pull weeds, clear rocks; working
     with shovels, rakes, etc.  They cart away WHEELBARROWS of
     rocks and carry in SACKS of FERTILIZER.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler built his army.

     IN THE KITCHEN WINDOW, Jack watches...

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Jack keeps watching out the window, eats toast.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 To what purpose, might one ask?
                 Well, one might ask, if not for the
                 first rule of Project Mayhem.

     Jack turns to look around the kitchen.  THREE SPACE MONKEYS
     work -- one SCRUBBING the FLOOR, one WASHING DISHES, one
     SCRUBBING the walls.  Jack walks out.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 In Tyler We Trust.

     INT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY

     Jack opens his eyes, awakening to sunlight thru the window.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And, then...

     INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAY

     Jack slowly pushes open the door to Tyler's room...

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

     The room is empty.  Jack stares.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was gone.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Jack comes downstairs... finds DOZENS of SPACE MONKEYS.

     INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Jack enters.  Space Monkeys render fat and make soap.  They
     pinch HERBS, adding them to the mix.  They add VODKA.  Off
     to the side, a couple Monkeys stir a vat of RICE.  On the
     wall is a big bulletin board with HUNDREDS of DRIVER's
     LICENSES; a sign above it: "HUMAN SACRIFICES."

                             FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY
                 "You are not a beautiful and unique
                 snowflake.  You are the same decaying
                 organic matter as everything else.
                 We are all part of the same compost
                 heap."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Planet Tyler.

     Jack dips a spoon into the rice, chomps on it irritatingly.

                             FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY
                 "We are the all-singing, all-dancing
                 crap of the world."

     Jack picks up a BOTTLE of VODKA.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I had to hug the walls, trapped
                 inside this clockwork of Space
                 Monkeys, cooking and working and
                 sleeping in teams.

     INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack enters, vodka in hand.  TEN SPACE MONKEYS here, reading.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The house became a living thing, wet
                 inside from so many people sweating
                 and breathing.  So many people
                 moving, the house moved.

     Jack walks out.

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Jack enters.  Angel Face reads a book, marks on a chart.
     Space Monkeys shuffle PAPERS and NEWS CLIPPINGS.  Walls are
     lined with FILES, each labeled with a STREET ADDRESS, under
     SIGNS: "Mischief," "Disinformation," "Arson."

     Jack's eye lingers on "Arson." He starts flipping through
     a file.  Angel Face comes to take the file from him.

                             ANGEL FACE
                 That wouldn't interest you.

                             JACK
                 Where's Tyler?

                             ANGEL FACE
                 The first rule of Project --

                             JACK
                 Right, right.

     As Angel Face replaces the file, Jack notices -- a LYE-
     BURNED KISS-SCAR on the back of Angel Face's hand.

     EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT

     Jack takes a swig of vodka, smokes.  In the BACKGROUND, a
     Space Monkey WHACKS an APPLICANT with a BROOM.  It's a
     ritual; no words.  Other Space Monkeys tend the garden.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'm all alone.  I Am Jack's Broken
                 Heart.

     Jack drops his cigarette in the gravel, steps on it.  A
     Space Monkey immediately comes to clean it up.

                             JACK
                 Get away from me!

                             MARLA'S VOICE (O.S.)
                 Who are all these people?

     Jack turns, sees Marla with an overnight bag.

                             JACK
                 The Paper Street Soap Company.

                             MARLA
                 Can I come in?

                             JACK
                 He's not here.

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 He's not here!  Tyler's not here
                 anymore!  He's gone away!

     Marla stares at Jack, miserable.  A tear runs down her
     cheek.  She turns and walks away.  Jack watches her go.
     There's a LOUD COMMOTION from the house, VOICES SHOUTING.
     Jack heads to the back door...

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Jack enters.  Ricky crawls, bleeding from a gunshot wound to
     the LEG.  Space Monkeys begin a rudimentary job of treating
     the wound.  Other Space Monkeys carry in a DEAD BODY in
     BLACK CLOTHES and SKI MASK, putting it on the table.

                             JACK
                 What's going on?

     Space Monkeys stare at the body.  The Mechanic, sweating,
     gets to his knees and pulls the ski mask off the corpse --
     it's BOB, with a gunshot wound to the HEAD.

                             JACK
                 Bob... oh, Christ...

     Jack pushes past a Space Monkey, stares down, stricken...

                             JACK
                 What... what happened... ?

                             MECHANIC
                       (out of breath)
                 We were on assignment...

     EXT. SCULPTURE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     A SCULPTURE adorned with a giant GLOBE on top.

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 We were supposed to kill two birds
                 with one stone:

     A SERIES of EXPLOSIONS blasts the GLOBE free.  It ROLLS...

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 A piece of corporate art...

     The GLOBE ROLLS downhill, to the street -- rolling over one
     parked LUXURY CAR after another, crunching car roofs and
     causing windows to explode...

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 ... and trash a trendy coffee bar.

     Then, the GLOBE arrives at the lobby of a HOTEL...
     BROADSIDES a limo, RICOCHETS... ROLLS directly into the
     front of a closed ARROSTO coffee bar, SMASHING windows...
     DECIMATING coffee push-pats...

     EXT. PARK - AERIAL VIEW - (FLASHBACK CONTINUOUS)

     Bob, the Mechanic and Ricky FLEE, LAUGHING at their
     handiwork.  They split up, running O.S.

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 We had it all worked out, man.  It
                 went smooth... until...

                             HARSH VOICE
                 Police!  Freeze!

     O.S. SOUNDS of GUNSHOTS and FLASHES of MUZZLE FIRE.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - (RESUMING)

     The Mechanic looks up from Bob's corpse.

                             MECHANIC
                 They shot Bob... they shot him in the
                 head.  Those fuckers...

     Jack walks away from Bob's corpse, distraught, holds his
     head, turns to look back, his eyes filling with tears.

                             ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY
                 We gotta do something.

                             RICKY
                 We got to get rid of the evidence.
                 We have to get rid of this body.

                             ANGEL FACE
                 Bury him...

     Jack looks around in disbelief.

                             JACK
                 What... ?

                             ANGEL FACE
                 The garden.  Take him there.  Move,
                 people.  Let's do this!

     Several Space Monkeys gather around Bob's body.

                             JACK
                 No... !

     Space Monkeys stop.  Jack gets between them and Bob, SHOVES
     a few Space Monkeys back...

                             JACK
                 Get your hands off him!  Get off...!
                 What the hell do you think you're
                 doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a
                 man... !  You killed him!

                             ANGEL FACE
                 He was killed in action.

                             JACK
                 No!  Look at you!  You're... you're
                 running around in ski masks,
                 exploding things...

                             ANGEL FACE
                 He was killed serving Project Mayhem.

                             RICKY
                 It's what he would have wanted, sir.

                             JACK
                 What he wanted?  Look... look at him.
                 Look at him!  What does he want?
                       (wipes tears,
                        points at Bob)
                 This is a person.  This is not a cog
                 in your machine...

                             RICKY
                 But, this is Project Mayhem.

                             JACK
                 No, no.  This is a man -- this man
                 has a name...

                             RICKY
                 But, in Project Mayhem, we have no
                 names.

                             JACK
                 No!  Wrong!  This man's name is
                 Robert Paulson.

                             RICKY
                 Robert Paulson?

                             JACK
                 Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead,
                 because of you...

                             MECHANIC
                 I understand.

     Everyone just stares at Jack.

                             MECHANIC
                 In death, a member of Project Mayhem
                 has a name.

                             JACK
                 No -- !

                             MECHANIC
                 His name is Robert Paulson.

                             RICKY
                 His name is Robert Paulson!

                             JACK
                 No!

                             ALL SPACE MONKEYS
                 His name is Robert Paulson!

                             JACK
                 Stop that -- !

                             ALL SPACE MONKEYS
                       (louder)
                 His name is Robert Paulson!  His name
                 is Robert Paulson...

     Jack backs away, surrounded, PUSHES his way out of the room.

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack barges in, goes to the desk, rifling through drawers.
     He finds FLIGHT COUPONS, used and unused.  The used coupons.
     have the flight information, including the destination
     cities.  The PHONE RINGS.  Jack answers it...

                             JACK
                 Tyler?

                             DETECTIVE STERN'S VOICE
                       (from phone)
                 This is Detective Stern of the arson
                 unit.  I'd like to see you in my
                 office tomorrow morning...

     Jack, in a panic, HANGS UP.

     INSERT - AN AIRPLANE TAKES OFF...

     INT. PLANE CABIN - DAY

     Jack sits stiffly in a seat.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I went to the cities on Tyler's used
                 tickets stubs.

     INSERT - A SIGN: "LA GUARDIA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT"

     EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

     Jack hurries from the terminal, runs to a TAXI ...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 In every city, I branched out from
                 the airport to downtown, bar-
                 hopping...

     INT. TAXI - IN MOTION, MID-CITY - NIGHT

     Jack's looks out the window, intently watching buildings.

                             JACK (V.0.)
                 I didn't know how or why, but I could
                 look at fifty different bars, and
                 somehow I just knew...

                             JACK
                       (to driver, points)
                 Here.  Let me out, right here...

     INT. BAR - NIGHT

     Jack enters.  He sees several MALE PATRONS with FIGHT
     BRUISES.  Jack moves to the bar.  The BARTENDER has a broken
     arm and swollen face.

                             JACK
                 I'm looking for Tyler Durden.

                             BARTENDER
                 Never heard of him.

                             JACK
                 This is an emergency.  It's important
                 I find him.

                             BARTENDER
                 I wish I could help you... sir.

     The bartender WINKS at Jack.

     INSERT - AERIAL VIEW - CHICAGO SKYLINE - DAY

                             JACK (V.0.)
                 ...as soon as I set foot off the
                 plane...

     INSERT - AERIAL VIEW - DALLAS SKYLINE - NIGHT

                             JACK (V.).)
                 ...I knew fight club was close.

     INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT

     Jack RUNS through the airport, lugging his suitcase.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler was setting up franchises, all
                 over the country.

     INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY

     The PROPRIETOR, his head bandaged, is confronted by Jack.

                             JACK
                 I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't
                 you help me?

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                 Sir, you're disturbing the other
                 patrons with your laudish behavior.

                             JACK
                       (pointing)
                 There's no one else here.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                 I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest
                 idea what you're talking about.

                             JACK
                 Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I
                 just need to know if you've seen
                 Tyler Durden.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                 I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such
                 information to you, nor would I, even
                 if I had said information you want,
                 at this juncture be able.

     Jack looks around, incredibly frustrated.

                             JACK
                  You are a moron.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                  I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.

     Jack gives up, shoves his way out the door.

     INT. CITY BUS - DAY

     Jack sits on the bus, looking out the window.  The bus stops.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Under and behind and inside
                 everything I took for granted,
                 something horrible had been growing.

     OUT THE WINDOW, a CONSTRUCTION WORKER with a BROKEN NOSE
     works a jackhammer.  He stops, wipes his brow.

     INT. SPORTS BAR - DAY

     TVs show football.  Jack is seated with TWO BRUISED PATRONS.

                             BRUISED PATRON #1
                 No one's ever seen him.  No one knows
                 what he looks like.

                             BRUISED PATRON #2
                 He has facial reconstructive surgery
                 every three years.

                             JACK
                 That's the stupidest thing I've ever
                 heard.

                             BRUISED PATRON #1
                 Is it true about fight club in Miami?

                             BRUISED PATRON 12
                 Is Mr. Durden building an army?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Am I asleep... ?

     INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

     Jack sits awake.  Everyone around him is asleep.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Have I slept?  I'm not sure if Tyler
                 is my bad dream or if I'm Tyler's.

     EXT. MID-TOWN STREETS - DAY

     Jack steps off the sidewalk, hailing a TAXI...

     EXT. CITY ALLEY - DAY

     The alleyway's deserted.  Jack heaft to rusty CELLAR DOORS.
     He opens the doors, looks around, heads down stairs...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I was living in a state of perpetual
                 deja vu.

     INT. DANK BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

     Jack enters this dark basement, walks ahead in the dim
     light.  The place is damp and empty.  Jack stops, looks down.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Everywhere I went, I felt I had
                 already been there.

     At his feet -- DRIED BLOOD on the concrete floor.

     INSERT - AERIAL VIEW - PHOENIX SKYLINE - DAY

     INT. ANOTHER BAR - DAY

     Jack walks in.  The place is empty.  He walks to a KITCHEN
     DOOR, opens it and peers in at... a GROUP of KITCHEN WORKERS
     solemnly stand in a circle, chanting...

                             KITCHEN WORKERS
                 His name is Robert Paulson.  His name
                 is Robert Paulson...

                             MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                       (from behind Jack)
                 Welcome back, sir.

     Jack whirls, startled -- facing the wounded BARTENDER, who
     wears a NECK BRACE, his nose a smashed eggplant.

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 How have you been?

                             JACK
                 ... You know me?

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 Is this a test, sir?

                             JACK
                 Yes... it's a test.

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 You were in here last Thursday night.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 You were standing right where you are
                 now, asking how good our security is.
                 It's tight as a drum.

                             JACK
                 Who do you think I am?

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 Is this part of the test?

     Jack nods slowly.  The Bartender holds up his hand, shows
     the KISS SCAR on the back of his hand...

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 You're the one who did this to me.
                 You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Please return your seatbacks to their
                 full upright and locked position.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack bursts inside, out of breath, runs to grab the phone,
     punches a number, doesn't bother to turn on the lamp.

     INTERCUT WITH...

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - SAME

     Marla answers.

                             MARLA
                 Yeah?

                             JACK
                 Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we
                 ever had sex?

                             MARLA
                 What kind of stupid question is
                 that?!

                             JACK
                 Because the answer's "yes" or because
                 the answer's "no?"

                             MARLA
                 Is this a trick?

                             JACK
                 Will you just answer me, for
                 Christsake?!

                             MARLA
                 You mean, you want to know if I think
                 we were just having sex or making
                 love?

                             JACK
                 We did make love?

                             MARLA
                 Is that what you're calling it?

                             JACK
                 Answer the question!

                             MARLA
                 You fuck me, then snub me.  You love
                 me, you hate me.  You show me your
                 sensitive side, then you turn into a
                 total asshole!  Is that a pretty
                 accurate description of our
                 relationship, Tyler?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 We've just lost cabin pressure.

                             JACK
                 What did you say... ?

                             MARLA
                 What is wrong with you?

                             JACK
                 Say my name.

                             MARLA
                 What... ?

                             JACK
                 Say my name!  What's my name!?

                             MARLA
                 Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you
                 fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm
                 coming over there...

                             JACK
                 Marla, no, wait...

     As Marla HANGS UP.  Jack stares at the receiver, dazed...

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 We've got six fight clubs in Chicago
                 now...

     Jack spins, dropping the phone -- TYLER sits beside him.

                             TYLER
                 Four in Milwaukee.

                             JACK
                 What's this all about, Tyler?

                             TYLER
                 And, we're definitely filling a void
                 in the rural South.

                             JACK
                 Why do people think I'm you?

                             TYLER
                 You broke your promise.  You talked
                 to her about me.

                             JACK
                 Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?

                             TYLER
                 Why did you do that?

                             JACK
                 Answer me, Tyler.

                             TYLER
                 Why do people think anything?

                             JACK
                 I don't know!  Tell me!

     Tyler shakes his head in disgust, extremely irritated.

                             TYLER
                 People think that you're me, because
                 you and I happen to share the same
                 body.

                             JACK
                 What... ?

                             TYLER
                 Is this really news to you?

                             JACK
                 What are you talking about... ?

                             TYLER
                 Sometimes I control it, and you
                 imagine yourself watching me...

     JACK stands surrounded by eager fight club MEMBERS, under
     the bare bulb, talking and behaving like Tyler...

                             JACK
                 The first rule of fight club is --
                 you don't talk about fight club.

     FLASHBACK - CURBSIDE - NIGHT

     JACK sits alone on the curb, watching the nearby freeway.
     He talks to someone beside him, but nobody's there.

                             JACK
                 Anyone?
                       (thinks)
                 My boss, probably.
                       (pause)
                 Who would you fight?

     Jack listens, looks at the empty space beside him.

                             JACK
                 Oh, yeah.
                       (nodding)
                 I didn't really know my Dad...

                 done...

     FLASHBACK - BUILDING - NIGHT

     The Parker Morris Building.

     JACK, Bob, Ricky, Angel Face and another GUY rappel down the
     side, SPRAYING PAINT.  JACK is "TYLER" in demeanor,
     mannerisms, speech...

                             JACK
                       (shouting)
                 You are not your job.  You are not
                 how much money you have in the bank.

     TWO WINDOWS SHATTER OUTWARD -- TWO MEN look out and yell:

                             BRUISED MAN #1
                 I am not my job!

                             BRUISED MAN #2
                 I am not how much money I have in the
                 bank!

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

     Jack's having trouble catching his breath.  Tyler stands.

                             TYLER
                 There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing
                 from you... one simple promise.  Now
                 look what you've done!

                             JACK
                 This isn't possible...

                             TYLER
                 We're going to have to do something
                 about Marla...

                             JACK
                 What... what are you saying?

                             TYLER
                 It's okay.  We okay... a little
                 codependent, sure, but...

     Jack shakes his head in disbelief, in denial...

                             JACK
                 No!  This isn't true.  We... we were
                 around other people, together, both
                 of us...

                                  TYLER
                 You never talked to me in front of
                 anyone else.

                             JACK
                 Wrong, wrong -- what about the car
                 crash... the two guys in the backseat?

                             TYLER
                 What about them?  They're lunatics.

                             JACK
                 You took me to the house.

                             TYLER
                 The house is rented in your name.

                             JACK
                 You have jobs.

                             TYLER
                 Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.

                             JACK
                 What about Marla?

                             TYLER
                 What about Marla?

                             JACK
                 She's... you... you're fucking her.

                             TYLER
                 Um, well... technically, no.

     Jack stands, trying to absorb, feeling ill, trying to find
     words, then -- he suddenly FAINTS to the floor, OUT COLD.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It's called a "changeover."  The
                 movie goes on, and nobody in the
                 audience has any idea.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - PRE-DAWN

     Jack's eyes snap open.  He sits up, alone.  He remembers the
     previous night... looks at himself in the mirror... looks at
     the clock -- 4:35am.

     INT. HALLWAY

     The room door SLAMS OPEN as Jack bursts out of the room,
     carrying his suitcase, SPRINTING for the STAIRWELL...

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Jack races down, three steps at a time, dragging his
     suitcase - BOOM, BOOM, BOOM - behind him...

     INT. LOBBY

     Jack hurries to the front door, his suitcase half-broken
     open, passing the front desk.  A DESK CLERK calls after him.

                             DESK CLERK
                 Sir... sir?  Are you checking out?

                             JACK
                 Yes.

     The clerk follows the length of the counter, waves a PAPER.

                             DESK CLERK
                 Please initial this list of phone
                 calls.

                             JACK
                 Bill me!

     Jack goes out the door, freezes.  He rushes back in, going
     to the desk -- snatches the bill, studies it: many NUMBERS.

                             JACK
                 Wait...when were these made?

                             DESK CLERK
                 It says right there, sir... between
                 two and three-thirty this morning.

     Jack looks at the clerk, at the bill, at the clerk.

                             JACK
                 I need a copy of this.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - DAY

     Jack stares out the window, his face set hard.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Had I been going to bed earlier every
                 night?  Have I been sleeping later?
                 Has Tyler been in charge longer and
                 longer?

     EXT. PAPER STREET - DAY

     A TAXI halts.  Jack leaps out, points to the GRUNGY CABBIE.

                             JACK
                 Wait here.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE, LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack walks in to find the place EMPTY and DESERTED.  He
     continues on into the KITCHEN, gawks at BATHTUBS and
     CANISTERS holding vast amounts of liquid.  There are HOSES,
     GAS MASKS, BEAKERS, TEST TUBES and PUMPS.

     He picks up a BOTTLE labeled "NITRIC ACID."

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM

     Jack sits by the PHONE, pulls out the HOTEL BILL, runs his
     finger up and down the list of PHONE NUMBERS...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Deja vu, all over again...

     Jack finger stops on a NUMBER.  He dials, phone to his ear.

                             VOICE
                       (from phone)
                 Eighteen-eighty-eight.

     Jack sees a file on the wall: "1888 CENTURY PARK EAST."

                             JACK
                 Who is this?

                             VOICE
                 Maintenance.

                             JACK
                 Listen, something is going to happen,
                 something terrible...

                             VOICE
                 Very good, Sir.

                             JACK
                 Excuse me?

                             VOICE
                 Don't worry about us, sir.  We're
                 solid.

                             JACK
                 Now wait, there's been a mix-up.
                 Everything's changed...

                             VOICE
                 You told me you'd say that.

                             JACK
                 Abort the plan.

                             VOICE
                 You told me you'd say that, too.

                             JACK
                 Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist
                 dickhead?!

                             VOICE
                 Well, sir, you said you might.

     Jack HANGS UP, desperately dials the next number on the bill.

                             DIFFERENT VOICE
                       (front phone)
                 Twenty-one-sixty.  Maintenance.

     Jack sees a file: "2160 PICO BOULEVARD."  He throws the
     phone, pocketing the bill.  He grabs up all the FILES.

     EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET

     Jack's TAXI halts.  Marla walks out of the lobby doors, sees
     Jack getting out of the cab, laden with files...

                             JACK
                 Marla!

     Marla makes a sharp turn, walking away.  Jack follows,
     hugging the files to his chest, catching up.

                             JACK
                 Marla...

                             MARLA
                 Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me
                 with a fucking broom.  I thought they
                 were going to break my arm.

                             JACK
                 I'm sorry, I...

                             MARLA
                 The were burning their fingertips
                 with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.

                             JACK
                 Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's
                 going to take a tremendous act of
                 faith on your part for you to hear me
                 out.

                             MARLA
                 Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.

     Marla heads into a DINER.  Jack follows...

                             JACK
                 -- A little more faith than that.

     INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER

     Marla sits in a BOOTH.  Jack sits across from her.

                             MARLA
                 I don't want to hear anything you've
                 got to say.

                             JACK
                 Give me a minute, Marla, alright...
                 just sixty seconds.

                             MARLA
                 Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.

                             JACK
                 Absolutely, you have every right.  I
                 need you to do me a favor.

                             MARLA
                 I've done you enough favors.

     A WAITER with a BLACK EYE appears at the table.

                             WAITER
                 Sir!  Anything you order is free of
                 charge, sir.

                             MARLA
                 Why is it free of charge?

                             JACK
                 Because... I'm Tyler Durden.

                             MARLA
                 Then, I'll have the clam chowder...
                 fried chicken and a baked potato with
                 everything and a chocolate chiffon
                 pie.

     Jack look to the pass-through WINDOW into the kitchen where
     THREE COOKS look out with STITCHES in their faces.

                             JACK
                 Clean food, please.

                             WAITER
                 In that case, sir, may I advise
                 against the lady eating the clam
                 chowder?

                             JACK
                 Thanks, no clam chowder.  That's it.

     The waiter snaps to attention and leaves.

                             MARLA
                 You got about thirty seconds.

                             JACK
                       (takes a deep breath)
                 I know that I've been... unwell.  I
                 know it's been like there's two sides
                 to me.

                             MARLA
                 Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr.
                 Jackass.

                             JACK
                 I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've
                 only just realized

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 I mean, the depth and breadth of our
                 relationship has only recently been
                 illuminated for me.  I know this...
                 I know us hasn't been such a great
                 thing for you...

                             MARLA
                 Whatever.
                       (to waiter)
                 I'll take my food to go...

     Marla's getting up to go, but Jack rises, fed up, takes her
     by the arm, putting her back in her seat.

                             JACK
                 Sit down!  Sit down and give me my
                 last fifteen seconds without opening
                 your mouth!

     Marla crosses her arms.  Jack collects himself.

                             JACK
                 I'm trying to tell you -- and this is
                 where you have to trust me -- but, I
                 think your life might be in real
                 danger.

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 You have to get out of here.  Leave
                 as soon as possible.  Go to any rural
                 town, away from any major city...

                             MARLA
                 You are an insane person.

                             JACK
                 Marla...

                             MARLA
                 No, no, shut up!  I've had enough.
                 I tried, Tyler... I have tried...

     Marla's getting upset, tears coming to her eyes.

                             MARLA
                 There's a part of you I really like,
                 but I can't do this anymore.  I just
                 can't.  This is killing me...

                             JACK
                 I'm sorry, but I...

                             MARLA
                 What?!  You're sorry?  I don't
                 believe that for a minute.

     Marla gets up.  Jack grabs for her, but she's gone, heading
     for the door.  Jack gathers his files, runs to follow...

     EXT. DINER - MOMESTS LATER

     Jack pushes out the door, files under one arm, catching up...

                             JACK
                 I can't explain.  You wouldn't
                 believe me anyway.  I'm trying to
                 protect you...

     Jack grabs her arm, tries to hail a TAXI, but the taxi races
     past.  Marla pulls free, screaming at him...,

                             MARLA
                 Let go of me!

                             JACK
                 Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for
                 me, if you never do anything else...

     Jack spots a BUS idling further up the street.

                             MARLA
                 Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to
                 see you again!

                             JACK
                 Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll
                 never have to see me again.
                       (digs in his pocket)
                 Here... here...

     He pulls MONEY from his pocket, holding it out.

                             JACK
                 Take this money, get on this bus...
                       (pointing to bus)
                 Get on, and I promise you, I'll never
                 bother you again, if that's what you
                 want.  Please...

     Marla looks at Jack, numb.

                             MARLA
                 Tyler...

                             JACK
                 I'm begging you.  Get on the bus.
                 Get on the bus.

     Marla takes the money from Tyler, walks towards the bus.  As
     they approach it, Jack shields his eyes, afraid to look...

                             MARLA
                 Why are you doing this?

                             JACK
                 I can't let myself see where you're
                 going.  Go wherever it takes you,
                 remember... keep away from major
                 cities...

     Marla stands at the doors of the bus, heartbroken, gives one
     last look at Jack.

                             MARLA
                       (holds up the money)
                 I'm not paying this back.  I consider
                 it "asshole tax."

                             JACK
                 Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away
                 a couple of weeks, at least.

     Jack's still covering his eyes.  Marla gets on the bus.

                             MARLA
                 Tyler...

     Jack finally looks to her.

                             MARLA
                 You are the worst thing that ever
                 happened to me.

     DOORS HISS SHUT.  The BUS LEAVES, heading away.  Jack seems
     relieved.  Then, a SCREAM is HEARD from MARLA...

     Jack turns, looks... THROUGH THE BUS WINDOWS: the bus is
     filled with BALD MEN IN BLACK: Space Monkeys.

     Jack SPRINTS after the bus...

     The bus speeds away.  Onboard, Space Monkeys subdue Marla.

     Jack falls to the asphalt, rolls, files-flying.

                             JACK
                 Son of a bitch!

     INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Jack RUNS to the front desk, crazed, dumps the armload of
     files on the desk in front of the DESK SERGEANT...

                             JACK
                       (loudly)
                 I want you to arrest me.  I'm the
                 leader of a terrorist organization
                 responsible for acts of vandalism all
                 over the city.  Detective Stern in
                 arson knows who I am...

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

     Detective Stern and THREE DETECTIVES stand, staring at Jack,
     who's seated.  On the table are the phone bill and files.

                             JACK
                 There are probably several hundred
                 members in the metropolitan area.
                 Chapters are sprouting in at least
                 five other major cities.  They're
                 tightly-regimented, with many cells
                 capable of operating without a
                 central leader.  Check this address:
                 1537 Paper Street.  You'll find the
                 body of Robert Paulson buried in the
                 garden.  You'll also find numerous
                 tubs used to make gallons of
                 nitroglycerin.  The plan, I believe,
                 is to blow up these credit card
                 headquarters and the TRW building.

                             STERN
                 Why these buildings?

                             JACK
                 You are not your job.  You are not
                 how much money you have in the bank.

                             STERN
                       (to other detectives)
                 Keep him talking.

     Stern leaves.  A beat, then, the remaining Detectives smile
     at Jack with REVERENCE.

                             FLAT-TOP DETECTIVE
                 I really admire what you're doing.
                 You're a brave man to order this.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             REDHEAD DETECTIVE
                 You're a genius, sir.

     They grab Jack and force him on his back on the table.
     Flat-Top has a rubber band; the Bald Detective has a knife.

                             BALD DETECTIVE
                 You know the drill.  You said if
                 anyone ever tries to interfere with
                 Project Mayhem, even you, we got to
                 get his balls.

     Flat-Top PULLS Jack's pants completely off, tosses them
     aside.  Jack SCREAMS.  Flat-Top holds his legs.

                             FLAT-TOP
                 It's useless to fight.

                             REDHEAD
                 This is really a powerful gesture,
                 Mr. Durden.  It'll set quite an
                 example.

                             JACK
                 No... you're making a mistake!

                             FLAT-TOP
                 You told us you'd say that.

                             JACK
                 I'm not Tyler Durden!

                             BALDY
                 You told us you'd say that, too.

                             JACK
                 Okay, I am Tyler Durden and I'm
                 ordering you to abort the mission!

                             FLAT-TOP
                 You said you would definitely say
                 that.

                             BALDY
                 What's our best time for a "cut and
                 run?"

                             FLAT-TOP
                 Four minutes.

                             BALDY
                 Is somebody timing this?

                             REDHEAD
                       (looks at his watch)
                 Wait till the second hand gets to the
                 twelve.

     A KNOCK at the door.  Flat-Top slaps a hand over Jack's
     mouth.  He and Redhead block view of the table as Baldy
     opens the door a crack.  Stern mutters:

                             STERN
                 Some of this info checks out.  Let's
                 go to the place on Paper Street.

     Baldy glances back at the other Detectives, leaves, closing
     the door.  The two remaining Detectives continue.  Jack kicks
     and screams and writhes.  The Detectives wrangle him, but
     with more difficulty, now that Baldy's gone.

                             REDHEAD
                       (checking his watch)
                 Mr. Durden, you're going to fuck up
                 the time!

     Jack gets one leg free, KICKS, knocks Flat-top backwards --
     Flat-Top SLAMS the wall, falls.  Redhead lets go of one of
     Jack's arms, jams his elbow into Jack's throat... cutting
     off the airway.  Jack's face reddens... he's choking...

     Jack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls Redhead's GUN
     and points it at him.  Redhead backs off. Jack gets up,
     gasping for air, PISTOL-WHIPS Flat-top as he rises.

     Jack grabs one of the files off the table.

     EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Jack, without pants, in BOXER SHORTS, escapes out the BACK
     DOOR.  He looks at the ADDRESS on the file folder.

     EXT. STREET

     Jack SPRINTS down the middle of the street, gun in hand,
     looking like a complete madman.  Cars almost hit him.

     EXT. BANK BUILDING - LATER

     Jack, sweating and panting, stops, looks... then heads
     toward the BUILDING with the address "1888."

     EXT. 1888 LOBBY

     Jack tries the door.  Locked.  He lifts a cast iron bench,
     runs forward -- RAMS it into the glass.  The bench
     immediately recoils from the glass, SLAMS Jack's groin!
     Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package.
     Then, he rises, SHOOTS the glass...

     INT. 1888 LOBBY

     Jack pushes through the broken glass.  He sprints for the
     "PARKING" door...

     INT. GROUND LEVEL - PARKING

     Jack enters, looks -- NO CARS.  He bolts to the STAIRS...

     INT. TOP-LEVEL PARKING AREA - SEVENTH FLOOR

     Jack enters, heaving.  Again, NO CARS.  He moves from one
     SUPPORT POST to another, searching.  He finally spies,
     across the garage, NINE LARGE CANISTERS, heavily-WIRED.

     Jack runs to the BOMB, frantic.  He walks around it.
     There's a DIGITAL CLOCK, ticking down from "10:05"...

     Jack moves to pull the lid off one CANISTER, looks inside..

                             TYLER
                 Could be worse...

     Jack looks -- Tyler's seated, his back against one post.

                             TYLER
                 You could be standing under 37
                 stories of steel and concrete with a
                 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped
                 to the support... oh, maybe it
                 couldn't be...

                             JACK
                       (points at bomb)
                 You... you can't be serious about
                 this.

                             TYLER
                 What a ridiculous thing to say.

                             JACK
                 I can't let you...

                             TYLER
                              ...go through with this?
                 What are you going to do?

                             JACK
                 I'm going to...

                             TYLER
                           ...stop me?

                             JACK
                 I'm not going...

                             TYLER
                            ...to let this happen!

                             JACK
                 Stop finishing...

                             TYLER
                         ...your sentences!  They're
                 our sentences.  Get your mind around
                 that.

     Tyler gets up walks to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 What are you doing running through
                 the streets in your underpants?  We
                 both use that body.

                             JACK
                 Since when is Project Mayhem about
                 murder?

                             TYLER
                 The buildings were evacuated thirty
                 minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding
                 exactly as planned.

                             JACK
                 You don't know that.  There could
                 still be people inside.

     Tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms.

                             TYLER
                 Maybe.  Maybe a couple of guys with
                 shaved heads couldn't synchronize
                 their watches.  Good riddance.

     Jack looks back to the BOMB, goes to it, wipes sweat off his
     face.  He starts finger the MANY WIRES, sorting them.

                             TYLER
                 I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you
                 know which wires, in what order...

                             JACK
                 If you know, I know.

     Jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go
     through the tangle of colored wires.

                             TYLER
                 Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I
                 spent the whole day thinking about
                 the wrong ones.

     Jack chooses one wire, GREEN, holds it in his fingers.

                             JACK
                 If I'm wrong, we're both dead..

                             TYLER
                 This is not about martyrdom.

     Jack twists the GREEN WIRE around his finger.

                             JACK
                 I'm pulling the green wire.

                             TYLER
                 Green?  Did you say green?

     Tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look,
     seems genuinely concerned.

                             JACK
                 Yes...

                             TYLER
                 Don't pull the green wire.  Pull
                 anything but the green wire.

                             JACK
                 Fuck you.

                             TYLER
                 I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.

     Jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers
     trembling.  The SOUND of a VEHICLE is HEARD from below...

                             TYLER
                 Hear that?  Marla's here.  Just in
                 the nick of time, eh?

     Jack looks to Tyler.  Tyler points towards the SOUND...

                             TYLER
                 See for yourself.

     Jack releases the wire, walks to a RAILING, gun in hand,
     keeps an eye on Tyler.  Jack looks over the railing...

     BELOW, a BUS idles.  The doors open and MARLA'S dragged out,
     kicking and screaming, carried by SIX SPACE MONKEYS...

                             MARLA
                 You motherfuckers...

     They carry Marla into the BUILDING'S ENTRANCE.

     Jack leans against the railing, exhausted.

                             TYLER
                 I've got everything.  The bombs.  The
                 army.  I've got Marla.

                             JACK
                 Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew
                 a hole in his head.  Was that part of
                 your plan?

     Tyler thinks, shrugs.

                             TYLER
                 Bob was a grown man.  In any great
                 struggle, there will be casualties.
                 Wouldn't that be implicit in the
                 name?  Project "Mayhem."

                             JACK
                 Fuck your struggle.  I want out.

                             TYLER
                 You want out?

                             JACK
                 I quit.

                             TYLER
                 Not an option, for the most obvious
                 of reasons.  You need to get with the
                 program.
                       (looks at his watch)
                 Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.

     Tyler's walks away.  Jack looks at the gun in his hand.  He
     points the gun at Tyler...

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

                             TYLER
                       (still walking away)
                 What?

                             JACK
                       (COCKS the gun)
                 Defuse the bomb.

     Tyler stops walking.

                             TYLER
                 Ask me nicely.

                             JACK
                 Defuse the bomb, please.

                             TYLER
                 Defuse the bomb?

                             JACK
                 Yes.

     Tyler strides towards the BOMB.  Jack trains the gun...

                             JACK
                 Please.

     Tyler looks at the BOMB, reaches over to it.  He grips the
     GREEN WIRE, yanks it out -- the CLOCK STOPS.

     Jack lowers his gun.

                             TYLER
                 I did that for you.  As a gesture.
                 Now, how fast can you run?  There are
                 ten other bombs, in ten other
                 buildings in the immediate area.  If
                 you're going to get them all, you
                 better get cracking.
                       (looks at watch)
                 Six minutes.  Green wires, remember.
                 I'll be upstairs.

     Jack's stunned.  Tyler walks across the parking garage, past
     Jack, heading for the STAIRS.

     Jack aims the gun at Tyler's back, FIRES!

     Tyler ducks to one side, impossibly quick, avoiding...

     Tyler spins to face Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Whoa!  What was that all about?

     Jack aims... FIRES!

     Tyler DODGES behind a post as the BULLET THROWS CONCRETE.

     Jack edges forward, gun held in both hands, moves around the
     post... Tyler is NOT THERE.  Jack turns, takes slow steps,
     moving the gun from side to side...

     Suddenly, a FIST ENTERS FRAME -- SLUGS Jack's face.

     Jack falls.  The gun goes CLATTERING across the floor...

     Jack turns, looking... Tyler's GONE.  Jack looks to the gun,
     scrambles to his feet, running to pick up the gun...

     Tyler KICKS Jack in the chest, sends Jack sprawling.

     Jack rolls, holding his chest.  He looks up, sees Tyler run
     into the STAIRWELL.  Jack grabs the gun and follows...

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Jack smashes the door open.  The stairwell's empty.  Jack
     RUNS up a flight of stairs, kicks open ANOTHER DOOR...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack steps forward, gun up... TWO INTERLOCKED HANDS SLAM
     down onto his head.  Jack drops to the floor.

     Tyler backs away, laughing.  Jack gets to his feet, aims his
     gun...

                             TYLER
                 Fire at will.

     Jack clenches his teeth, FIRING -- nothing happens to Tyler.
     Jack FIRES TWICE -- no effect.  Tyler raises his arms.

                             TYLER
                 What did you expect?

     Jack charges.  Tyler dodges, PUNCHES, knocks the gun out of
     Jack's hand.  They FIGHT, trading PUNCHES, grappling, taking
     each other to the floor...

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Banks of SECURITY MONITORS sit unmanned.

     ON ONE MONITOR: Jack is seen in the lobby, on the floor,
     alone, wrestling himself.  He swings his left hand up,
     punching empty air, then swings his right hand -- PUNCHING
     himself in the side of the head...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Tyler and Jack fight viciously, bloodied.  Tyler manages to
     get his hands around Jack's throat, starts BANGING Jack's
     head against the floor...

     SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.

     ... Jack's got his hands around his own throat, BANGING his
     own head against the floor, over and over...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack manages to break Tyler's grip, KICKS Tyler away.
     Tyler springs to his feet, RUNS, heading for a STAIRCASE.

     Jack gets up, breathing hard, holding his head, follows...

     ON THE STAIRS, Tyler reaches the LOFT LEVEL, above the
     lobby, disappears around a corner.  Jack's right behind,
     turning the corner -- Tyler's NOT THERE.

     Jack receives a SHARP SLAP on the back of the head.  He
     wheels.  Tyler isn't there.  A TAP on his shoulder.  Jack
     turns around -- WHAM! -- Tyler PUNCHES his face.  Jack falls
     against the loft railing.  Tyler comes forward, SWINGS...

     SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.

     Jack PUNCHES himself square in the nose!

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack's dazed.  Tyler grabs Jack's shirt, pulls him forward,
     SWINGS HIM -- THROWS him DOWN THE STAIRS...

     Jack TUMBLES horribly down... HITS BOTTOM, striking his head
     on the floor.  Jack PASSES OUT...

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

     INT. LARGE SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR

     CLOSE ON: Jack's head jerks back as he SNAPS AWAKE.  He
     looks around, trying to focus his eyes...

     JACK'S P.O.V. -- TRACKS in the sawdust of the floor, from
     where his body was dragged across to where he is how.

     CLOSE ON: Jack tries to comprehend.  He turns his head --
     TYLER'S HAND brings the GUN up, PUTS THE GUN IN JACK'S
     MOUTH.  Jack freezes, looks around with his eyes...

                                                      PULL BACK TO:

     Tyler is seated in Jack's lap.  Tyler holds the gun in
     Jack's mouth, his arm around him.  This huge room is being
     remodeled.  Tyler and Jack are seated near floor-to-ceiling
     windows affording a spectacular view of the CITY.

     Tyler looks at his watch.

                             TYLER
                 One minute.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I think this is about where we came
                 in.

                             TYLER
                       (looking out window)
                 This is the beginning.  We're at
                 ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
                 few words, to mark the occasion.

                             JACK
                 i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

     Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

                             JACK
                       (still distorted)
                 I still can't think of anything.

     Tyler checks his watch.

                             TYLER
                 It's getting exciting now.

     Jack turns, so he can see down -- 31 STORIES.

                             TYLER
                 Look what we've accomplished.
                       (checks watch)
                 Thirty seconds.
                       (looks out windows)
                 Out these windows, we will view the
                 economic collapse.  One step closer
                 to global equilibrium.  I'm glad
                 you're here with me.

     Tyler watches the skyline, WHISTLES at tune, waiting.

                             JACK
                       (distorted)
                 Can't you call it off... ?

                             TYLER
                 It's out of our hands.
                       (looks at watch)
                 This is it.

                             JACK
                 Please...

                             TYLER
                 Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see
                 alright?  10... 9... 8....

     Tyler looks out the windows, at SURROUNDING BUILDINGS,
     excited.  Jack closes his eyes, despairing.

                             TYLER
                 5... 4... 3... 2...

     Out the window, the SKYLINE remains unchanged.  Nothing.  A
     long beat.  A very dark scowl comes over Tyler's face.

     Jack opens his eyes.  More waiting.  Tyler looks genuinely
     surprised, pissed-off.

                             TYLER
                 What the fuck -- ?

                             JACK
                 Paraffin.

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                       (relieved)
                 Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the
                 nitro with paraffin.  I saw it
                 floating in the bomb.
                             (more)

                             JACK (cont)
                 They must've run out of cotton and
                 Epsom salt.  Paraffin is iffy at best.

     Tyler rises, taking the gun from Jack's mouth, starts
     pacing.  Jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile.

                             TYLER
                 Damn it!  God-damn it...

                             JACK
                 Not exactly according to plan.

                             TYLER
                 Do we have to do everything
                 ourselves?!

     Tyler stops walking, lets out a sigh of disgust.  He reaches
     into his pocket, taking out a WALKIE TALKIE.

                             TYLER
                       (into WALKIE TALKIE)
                 ... Codename Rooster.  Passcode First
                 Strike...

     Jack's eyes go wide.

                             JACK
                 NO...

                             TYLER
                       (into WALKIE TALKIE)
                 Proceed with remote detonation.

     Jack leaps -- TACKLES Tyler.  The GUN is knocked away.  Jack
     STRIKES Tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles
     off...

     Jack gets the gun, turns, pointing it.  Tyler's getting to
     his feet, sees the gun, annoyed.  Jack stands.

                             TYLER
                 Haven't we already done this?

     Jack SHOOTS TWICE.  Bullets pass right thorough Tyler.
     Tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie-talkie to the
     floor and STOMPS on it, CRUSHING it.

                             JACK
                       (pointing)
                 How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking
                 figment of my imagination... you're
                 psychogenic fugue state...

                             TYLER
                 Fuck that, maybe you're my
                 hallucination.

     Jack falters, pointing at Tyler's feet.  There's no walkie-
     talkie there.  Jack looks down, sees the WALKIE-TALKIE
     CRUSHED under his own foot.

                             JACK
                 Oh... Christ...

     Jack holds his head, walks around, at his wit's end.

                             JACK
                 Why... why... why... ?

                             TYLER
                 Why what?

                             JACK
                 Why can't I get rid of you?  Why
                 can't I just wish you away?

                             TYLER
                 You need me.

                             JACK
                 No, no, I don't.
                       (pause)
                 I thank you, I really do.  Thank you,
                 but I don't need you anymore.

                             TYLER
                 Look, I can be selfish, I know that.
                       (pause)
                 I'm not blind to my own failings...

                             JACK
                 Noooo, please...

     Jack backs up against a window, numb and weary.

                             TYLER
                 From now on, we'll share Marla.
                 We've been spending too much time
                 apart...

                             JACK
                 ... no, no, no...

                             TYLER
                 No more running off without you.
                 From here on out, we do it together.

                             JACK
                 Why are you doing this?!

                             TYLER
                 I'm doing this for us.

                             JACK
                 Please understand... I've gotten all
                 I can from this, Tyler.

                             TYLER
                       (sullen)
                 If I leave, you will be right back
                 where I found you...

                             JACK
                 I swear on my life, I won't...

                             TYLER
                 You will.  You know you will.

     Jack stares at Tyler, tears welling up, hangs his head.  He
     looks at the gun in his hand...

                             TYLER
                 Can you live with that?

     Jack stares at the gun a long time... then...

     Jack brings the gun up, PUTS THE GUN IN HIS MOUTH.

     Tyler cocks his head.

                             TYLER
                 What are you doing?

                             JACK
                 What have you left for me?

                             TYLER
                 Why do you want to do that? Why do
                 you want to put that gun in your
                 mouth?

                             JACK
                 Not my mouth.  Our mouth.

     Tyler is calm.

                             TYLER
                 This is interesting.

     Tyler smiles in appreciation, slowly walks forward, stands
     very close to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Why are you going with this, Ikea-
                 boy?

                             JACK
                 It's the only way to get rid of you...

     Jack COCKS the hammer on the gun.

                             TYLER
                 I can see you feel very strongly.  I
                 feel strongly too.
                       (pause)
                 Hey, you and me.
                       (pause)
                 Friends again?

     Their eyes are locked, unblinking.  Long silence.

                             JACK
                 Do something for me.

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                 Appreciate something.

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                 Look at me...

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                 My eyes are open.

     EXTREME SLOW MOTION:

     Jack's finger squeezes the trigger...

     KABLAM! -- Jack's cheeks INFLATE with gas.  His eyes bulge.
     BLOOD flies out from his head.  The WINDOW behind him
     SHATTERS.  SMOKE wafts out of his mouth and tear ducts.

     RESUME NORMAL SPEED as the GLASS FALLS behind Jack...

     Tyler stands, in gunsmoke, eyes glazed, sniffs the air...

                             TYLER
                 What's that smell... ?

     Jack slumps to the floor... Tyler falls...

     Tyler hits the ground.  The back of TYLER'S HEAD is BLOWN
     OPEN, revealing blood, skull and brain.

     Suddenly, a GROUP of SPACE MONKEYS burst into the room,
     moving forward to Jack.  TYLER'S BODY IS GONE.

                             TALL SPACE MONKEY
                 Are you all right, sir... ?!

     Jack quakes, holding the side of his head; a ragged hole
     blown in his CHEEK.  He's bleeding hard, but he's alive.

                             JACK
                 I'm okay...

     Jack looks to the Space Monkeys, trying to get his eyes to
     see.  TWO SPACE MONKEYS enter with Marla.  One holds a gun
     to Marla as she struggles.

                             SHORT SPACE MONKEY
                 Are you sure?  You look terrible,
                 sir!  What's happened?

                             JACK
                 Everything's fine.

                             ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY
                 Sir, you look really awful!  Do you
                 need medical assistance?

     Jack sees Marla, tries to get to his feet, falls...

                             JACK
                 Bring the girl to me.  The rest of
                 you get out.  Now!

     The Monkeys bring Marla, releasing her, saluting.

                             MARLA
                 What happened... ?

                             JACK
                 Don't ask.

     Marla crouches, takes out wadded TISSUES and tries to apply.
     them to Jack's wound.  Space Monkeys are leaving, hesitantly.

                             JACK
                 Get to the rendezvous point.  Move it!

     Jack and Marla are left alone.

                             MARLA
                 My God, you're shot...

                             JACK
                 Yes.

     Jack tries to got up.  Marla helps him.

                             MARLA
                 Who did this to you?

                             JACK
                 I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm
                 fine...

     MASSIVE EXPLOSION... the glass walls rattle...

     Jack and Marla look -- OUT THE WINDOWS: a BUILDING EXPLODES;
     collapsing upon itself.  Then, ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES
     into a massive cloud of dust.  Jack and Marla are
     silhouetted against the SKYLINE.  Jack looks to Marla,
     reaches to take her hand.

                             JACK
                 I'm sorry... you met me at a very
                 strange time in my life.

     Marla looks at him.  ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES and COLLAPSES
     inward... and ANOTHER BUILDING... and ANOTHER...

     The FILM SLOWS, then ADVANCES ONE FRAME at a TIME -- SHOWING
     SPROCKET HOLES on the SIDES.  EACH FRAME is an IMPLODING
     BUILDING -- then, ONE FRAME IS A PENIS.  Then, the IMPLODING
     BUILDING again.  SPEED UP the frames, LOSE the sprocket
     holes, RESUME NORMAL SPEED...

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

                                                end
