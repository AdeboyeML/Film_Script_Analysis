          A darkness like no other, a silence that is unsettling.
          Sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across
          the void of outer space. Our own motion is only realized as
          an enormous object slowly moves towards us, taking shape.
          A SPACE SHIP of unimaginable size, a tubular freighter easily
          ten times larger then any aircraft carrier. At first glance
          it appears lifeless and adrift, but slowly the small glow of
          cockpit windows come into view as we move closer.
          Moonlight cuts across the hull, displaying the name; EDEN.

          Where were you... when Eden was lost?
          Like every other kid on my block, I was
          in the middle of a dream, envious of
          those who were chosen to be part of
          mankind's greatest quest. Dreaming of
          the unknown and trying to imagine what
          only the lucky few would encounter.

          Inside the flight deck it's ghostly vacant, rows of empty
          flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently
          blinking. With half filled coffee-cups and jackets hung over
          the seat backs... it appears the control deck has been
          suddenly evacuated.
          Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship.

          Only a few... who would be right.

          appear, smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the
          bright white paneling and several broken computer screens.
          The muffled SCREAMS grow louder and clearer... an argument
          between men, panicked rage over-lapping.

          violent confrontation. One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep
          chamber, banging on the glass and pleading with panic.
          Another OFFICER is on the floor, mortally wounded, his body
          still twitching with his head bashed in. The INSANE OFFICER,
          a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal, typing
          in commands with a casual and emotionless nature.
          Blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose

          Inside a coffin-size chamber, a dim glow of light seeps

          attached to his face, tubes of liquid feeding into his arms.
          CORPORAL BOWER, military physique, chiseled features. His
          chest lightly expanding, blood pulsating through his veins.
          Lights FLICKER PAST and his body comes to life, muscles
          flinching, breath quickening. He squirms with discomfort,
          ripping away the mask. He gasps, trying to SCREAM.

          out, struggling to rip away the feeding tubes. He HITS the
          floor, naked and gasping. His pores ignite, dripping sweat.
          He tries to get to his feet, but his legs wobble underneath
          him, collapsing. He yells at the floor.

          Hey...? HEY!!? Someone?
          A constant low RUMBLE is present, joined by the occasional
          MOAN and CREAK of a large ship. A SHUDDER travels through
          the room with a random FLICKER of LIGHTS to reveal...
          A massive steel compartment, tangled with technology. It's
          cold and institutional. High-tech computer terminals slope
          out of the floor. The FLICKER passes, taking us into black.
          We hear him: fumbling through the room, switches are thrown
          with no result and compartments are pulled opened and...
          SNAP! A glow stick comes to life.
          He squints at his darkened surroundings with confusion. A
          drip of liquid catches his eye and he staggers back to his
          sleep pod. He grabs the dangling tubes that were ripped from
          his arm and he sucks on the tube, pulling as much liquid into
          his mouth as possible.
          After a few heavy gulps, he suddenly heaves towards the
          floor. He painfully forces himself to drink, gasping.
          He looks up to notice two sleep chambers next to his own. He
          leans closer with the glow stick to see the first one, the
          name plate reading; 2nd Lt. Cooper. It's EMPTY.
          The third pod's name plate reads; LT. PAYTON. Deep inside
          there is the figure of a man, asleep under a mask.

          travels through his body while he staggers towards a nearby
          computer terminal. He taps the keys on a computer terminal.
          Nothing. He frowns, leaning closer.

          He ducks below the tables as a FIGURE slowly enters the room,
          carrying a long steel spear-like device with a splinter of
          blinding BLUE FIRE on the tip, fueled with a chemical sprayer
          like a welder's torch.
          His obstructed view reveals the FIGURE as a tribal warrior,
          scantily clad, elongated muscular frames, pale skin coated in
          hydraulic fluid. Bald head with clumps of tangled hair. It
          moves smoothly and silently, jabbing the tip of the flaming
          device into each corner and crevasse, as if flushing out

          The FIGURE quickly spins his direction and SNAPS a lever on

          instantly into darkness.
          BOWER holds his breath with fright, back pedalling on his
          knees as his eyes try to adjust to the dark. He takes an
          uneasy breath to realize... there is more then one.
          Slowly moving out of the shadows, four more HUNTERS slowly
          emerge, like a unified pack on the prowl. They carry an
          assortment of crudely made weapons, spears and blades of
          sharpened metal.
          The apparent leader of the pack is HEFLIN, the largest and
          strongest of the group and he directs the pack with an
          assortment of odd vocal sounds, deep HISSES from the throat
          and gargled CACKLES.
          On command, the one HUNTER flips a lever and the BLUE FLAME
          crackles back to life with a burst of flammable liquid. The
          hunt continues, the pack weaving through the debris,
          following NADIA'S path.

          weaves through a compartment filled with filtration units and
          a maze of piping.
          BOWER spots a clear path but BUMPS into glass. He realizes
          the compartment is separated by thick glass dividers. He
          changes directions and sees SHEPARD crawling through a vent.
          He tries to follow as... a BLUE TORCH moves past the doorway,
          bare feet running across steel. A collection of HISS and
          CACKLES grow louder.
          BOWER crawls under piping to hide. He notices the activation
          lights on his weapon fading... and he quietly tries to give
          the energy lever a few turns... but the WHINE seems too loud.
          He spots SHEPARD twenty feet away, hidden behind a console.

          material, but for safety precautions, it's unable to
          penetrate man-made materials like lead, glass or steel. It's
          unable to puncture the ship's hull.
          The energy blast is an electrical discharge that CRACKS like
          lightening and echoes like thunder. The blast HITS the side
          of the wall with a deafening RIPPLE of aftershocks,
          shattering anything fragile and knocking over anything not
          fastened down within a thirty foot radius. This little thing

          glistening with a layer of hydraulic fluid along with tribal

          He slowly lifts his shoulders while lowering his head, much
          like the fluid motions of a reptilian predator.
          BOWER frantically cranks the energy lever and raises it
          toward HEFLIN, completely unaffected by the threat. He
          squeezes the trigger and...
          KA-WHAP! The gunshot is THUNDEROUS, HITTING the unseen glass
          divider between them. The safety glass absorbs the blast,
          sending a SHUDDER through the hull.
          HEFLIN barely flinches, stepping closer with a HISS. Off his
          command, the HUNTERS take chase, swarming in every direction,
          searching for a route around the glass divider.

          Inside an empty storage tank, a comfortable living space has
          been created; numerous chairs surround a make-shift dinner
          table made from storage crates with hand-made candles and

          filtration screens. The music is playing from crackling
          speakers hidden in the darkened circular catwalk overhead.
          TANAKA goes straight for the food and as soon as NADIA steps
          through the hatch... a wire SNAPS! Levers clank and a mouse-
          trap has triggered... SLAMMING the hatch closed. Trapped!
          They instantly turn back to the door, yanking and tugging in

          Another lever is turned and... F00000SH! A stream of vapor
          shoots out of several vents along the wall. The colorless

          toward his direction and TANAKA throws his weapon, HITTING
          one of the HUNTERS directly in the head.
          TANAKA jumps to the neighboring catwalk and breaks through a

          command and the HUNTERS ignite in a chain-reaction, grabbing
