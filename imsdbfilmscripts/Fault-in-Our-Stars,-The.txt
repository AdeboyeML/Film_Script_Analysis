          HAZEL GRACE LANCASTER (16) lies in the grass, staring up at
          the stars. We're CLOSE ON her FACE and we hear:

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           You have a choice in this world, I
           believe, about how to tell sad
           stories.

          CUT TO a SERIES OF QUICK IMAGES:
          - Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS "GUS"
          WATERS (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place.
          [They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple.]

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           On the one hand, you can sugar coat
           - the way they do in movies and
           romance novels.

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus sit on a BENCH
          overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country.
          She rests her head on his shoulder.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Where villains are vanquished
           and... heroes are born and...
          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus kiss in a dark room.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... beautiful people learn
           beautiful lessons...

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus fall onto a bed together.
          They look deep into one another's eyes.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... and nothing is too messed up
           that can't be fixed with an apology
           and a Peter Gabriel song.

          BACK TO Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. Were
          those dreams or were they memories? Still unclear.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           I like that way as much as the next
           girl, believe me. It's just not the
           truth.

          Hazel closes her eyes.

           Late in the Winter of my 17th
           year...

          There are, however, some key and obvious differences.
          First, you'll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which
          help her to breathe.

          Second, you'll notice her hair - which we couldn't see in the
          grass. It's much shorter than the "Perfect" version, the
          result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few
          years before.

           HAZEL (V.O.)

           I'm not depressed.

          Hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table. Her
          mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains
          to the DOCTOR:

                          FRANNIE
           ... she eats like a bird. She
           barely leaves the house,

          - HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM. She sits watching game shows in the
          middle of the afternoon. Her Mom brings her a sandwich. A
          glass of water. And then a whole host of prescription meds.
          Hazel eyes them with indifference.

          underlined copy of a novel ("An Imperial Affliction" by Peter
          Van Houten). She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of
          delight. A YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his
          shoulder playfully. He spins her around. Hazel watches a beat
          - goes back to the book.

           ... some days she won't even get
           out of bed.

          Hazel, oxygen tank in toe, gets out of the car with Frannie's
          assistance.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... to make my parents happy.

           whole time?

                          FRANNIE
           Of course not, no. I...
           (she totally is)
           I have errands to run.
          Hazel knows she's not planning to run any errands. She
          doesn't press the issue.

                          HAZEL
           Ok.

           The only thing worse than biting it
           from cancer - is having a kid bite
           it from cancer.
          As Frannie gets back in the car, she shouts to her daughter:

          INT CHURCH - SAME
          Hazel walks towards the elevator. An EXTREMELY SICK LOOKING
          KID holds it open for her. Hazel thinks better of it.

                          HAZEL
           I'll take the stairs.
          The KID nods. The doors shut. Hazel is reminded - it could
          always be worse. She turns to go, walking right into:

          A SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL BOY (we will come to know him as GUS).
          Tall, lean, muscular, straight short mahogany hair, blue
          eyes. Hazel has never seen a better looking kid in her life.

          My bad. No, it's...

                         
          For a brief moment, the Earth stops. They stand looking at
          one another. Hazel is speechless.

                          HAZEL
           Excuse me.
          With the Beautiful Boy watching, a wan smile on his face,
          Hazel shuffles off as fast as she can, ducking into:

                         

          INT BATHROOM - SAME
          Hazel catches her breath. Shakes her head. Surprised at
          herself.
          She looks in the mirror. So doesn't like what she sees. The
          Earth starts moving again. CUT TO:

                         

          INT CHURCH BASEMENT - LATER
          Hazel sits in the Circle of Sick.

                          PATRICK
           Who would like to begin?
          No volunteers. Hazel catches sight of the Beautiful Boy,
          sitting next to Isaac. He seems to be watching her, that same
          flirty smile on his face. She self-consciously looks away.

           10.

                         

                          PATRICK
           Isaac, I know you're facing a
           challenging time. Perhaps you would
           like to say something...
          Isaac nods, rises.

                          ISAAC
           Yeah, um... I'm Isaac. 17. Eye
           cancer.

                          (BEAT)
           It's looking like another surgery
           in a couple weeks. After which,
           well, I'll be blind...
          Hazel tries to focus on what Isaac's saying but it's
          difficult. She still feels the Beautiful Boy's gaze on her.

                          ISAAC
           Not that I'm complaining or
           anything. I know a lot of you have
           it way worse but, still, I mean,
           you know, being blind's gonna
           suck...
          As Isaac shares, the Beautiful Boy doesn't look away from
          Hazel. Hazel finds this intimidating. And intimidation
          irritates her. So she decides to play the game with him,
          meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly.
          A staring contest.

                          ISAAC
           ...My girlfriend helps. And friends
           like Augustus here...
          Isaac nods towards the Beautiful Boy who now has a name -
          AUGUSTUS. He still doesn't look away from Hazel.

                          ISAAC
           So... yeah. That's what's up.

           ALL IN UNISON
           "We're here for you Isaac."
          The staring contest continues another few beats until:

                          PATRICK
           And does your friend want to speak?
          This causes the Beautiful Boy to momentarily look away. Aha,
          he's lost the contest! Hazel smiles, flicks her eyebrows up
          as if to say "Victory is mine!" He smiles back at her, the
          most radiant smile on the planet. He turns back to the Group.

                          GUS
           Hi. I'm Augustus Waters. 17. Had a
           touch of osteosarcoma bout a year
           and a half ago - lost this baby as
           a result...

           11.

                         
          Gus holds up his right leg - a prosthetic.

                          GUS
           But really I'm just here at Isaac's
           request.

                          PATRICK
           And how are you feeling Augustus?

                          GUS
           Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller
           coaster that only goes up, my
           friend.
          Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Embarrassed, she stops
          smiling and looks away.

                          PATRICK
           Perhaps you'd like to share your
           fears with the group, Augustus.

                          GUS
           My fears?
          Gus thinks about this.

                          GUS
           Oblivion.

                          PATRICK
           Oblivion?
          ANGLE ON Hazel, intrigued.

                          GUS
           Yeah, see... I intend to live an
           extraordinary life. To be
           remembered. If I'm scared of
           anything it's... not doing that.
          Patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that.

                          PATRICK
           Would, uh, anyone like to speak to
           that?
          And Hazel's hand goes up. Even Patrick is surprised by that.

                          PATRICK
           Hazel! That's unexpected.
          Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. Augustus
          watches her, waits for it.

                          HAZEL
           I just wanna say... there will come
           a time when, you know, all of us
           are dead.
          Gus is now even more fixed on her than before.

           12.

                         

                          HAZEL
           It might be tomorrow. Might be a
           million years from now but... it's
           gonna happen. And when it does,
           enough generations will come and
           go, there'll be no one left to
           remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or
           Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us,
           right?
          The look on Gus's face is unreadable.

                          HAZEL
           Oblivion's inevitable. And if that
           scares you, well, I suggest you
           ignore it. God knows it's what
           everyone else does.
          A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face,
          not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO:

                         

          EXT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - LATER
          Hazel waits for her Mom's car to appear.
          Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a
          redhead, MONICA (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow
          against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird. Between
          kisses, we can hear:

                          ISAAC MONICA
          Always. Always.

                         
          And Hazel hears:

                          GUS
           Literally.
          Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing
          right next to her.

                          GUS
           I thought we were in a church
           basement but apparently we were
           literally in the heart of Jesus.
          Hazel smiles.

                          HAZEL
           Someone should probably tell him,
           don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda
           dangerous keeping all these kids
           with cancer in your heart.
          Gus laughs.

           What?

                          GUS
           I didn't say anything.

           that?

                          GUS
           Because you're beautiful.
          Hazel is taken aback. No one's ever said that to her before.

                          GUS
           I enjoy looking at beautiful people
           and I decided a while back not to
           deny myself the simpler pleasures
           of existence. Particularly given
           that, as you so astutely pointed
           out, we're all gonna die pretty

          Hazel isn't surprised that other girls know Gus. Of course
          they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at
          each other. She hears:

           "Always" is their thing. They'll
           "always" love each other and
           whatnot. Must have texted "always"
           to each other at least four million
           times this year.
          They continue to watch the show. It's pretty gross. Isaac
          squeezes Monica's breast like a clown horn.

                          GUS
           I've got a car.
          He shrugs. Hazel has never seen someone so confident.

                          HAZEL
           You could be an axe murderer.

          As Hazel mulls this over, Gus reaches into his pocket and
          pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! Hazel is in
          disbelief. He flips the box open, puts a cigarette between
          his lips.

                          HAZEL

           What, you think that's cool? Oh you
           idiot! There's always a hamartia,
           isn't there? And yours is - even
           though you had FREAKING CANCER you
           give money to a corporation for the
           chance to acquire EVEN MORE
           CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so
           well.
          As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on
          his face. Hazel does not find it so amusing.

                          HAZEL
           Let me tell you... not being able
           to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks.

          Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him.

                          HAZEL
           A fatal flaw.
          Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still
          etched on his face.

                          GUS
           They don't hurt you unless you
           light them.

                          GUS
           It's a metaphor. See? You put the
           thing that kills you between your
           teeth. But you don't give it the
           power to do the killing.
          Hazel is floored. And impressed.

                          HAZEL
           Metaphor.
          Gus holds her gaze. And it's at this point Frannie pulls up.

          Hazel is terrified. Turns out, Gus is the world's worst
          driver. When he brakes, her body flies forward against the
          seatbelt. And when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck
          snaps back in the seat. Gus sees the look on her face.

          The chair lands against the bed. Gus hands Isaac something
          else to throw, a pillow. Isaac grabs the pillow and slams it
          against the wall. He dives on it and beings pummeling the
          pillow like a maniac.

          showing the next several days. They include:
          - Hazel and Gus drinking coffees at a cafe. He's
          enthusiastically telling a story and she's enjoying every
          moment of it.
          - Hazel helping Gus become a better driver. It's no use.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           "I was wondering if you wouldn't
           mind answering a few questions I

           I'm very lucky.
          ANGLE ON Hazel, checking herself out in the mirror. Seems to
          like what she sees a lot more than before.
          BACK ON Gus and Michael, downstairs:

           Son, you have to understand...
           Hazel's still pretty sick. She will
           be the rest of her life.
          ANGLE on Hazel, who can hear all of this. She stops what
          she's doing and listens.

          Behind the Indianapolis Museum of Art is 152 Acres of Gardens

          Gus picks a STICK up from the dirt. Draws a BIG CIRCLE in it.

                          GUS
           See this? This circle is virgins...
          Now Gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle.

                          GUS
           And this... is 17 year old dudes
           with one leg.
          Hazel laughs. Point made. He grabs her hand, helps her walk
          up a tiny hill. Once up there, Gus lays a blanket on the
          ground. They sit, looking out over a rather odd SCULPTURE - a
          set of GIANT WHITE BONES where children can jump and play.

          Hazel and her Parents sit at a very large conference table
          along with Dr. Maria and THREE OTHER ONCOLOGISTS - her whole
          "Cancer Team."

           The great news is... Phalanxifor

           growth.

           The not so great news is we're
           still seeing serious problems with
           fluid accumulation.

                          (BEAT)
           So how should we proceed?
          Silence. Hazel looks around the room, waits for someone to
          answer. No one does.

                          HAZEL
           Um, I feel like I'm not the most
           qualified person to answer that.

                          ONCOLOGIST #1
           I was talking to Dr. Simmons.
          DR. SIMMONS (late 60s, white beard, old school) speaks next.

           DR. SIMMONS
           It's a strange case. Normally the
           tumors start resisting the
           treatment. But that hasn't happened
           here - yet.
          Hazel hears the "yet" the loudest.

           DR. SIMMONS
           Unfortunately, the drug may be
           worsening the edema.

           DR. MARIA
           But if we stopped it entirely,
           we're likely to face even graver
           dangers.

                          MICHAEL
           So we're gonna do nothing?

           DR. MARIA
           That's what we have to decide. The
           truth is... very few people have
           been on Phalanxifor as long as
           Hazel has. We don't really know the
           long term effects.
          That comforts no one.

                          HAZEL
           Can't I just get like a lung
           transplant or something?
          The Doctors look at one another like "who wants to take that
          one?" Eventually:

           DR. MARIA
           You would not be considered a...
           strong candidate for a transplant.
          Hazel takes that in, nods, tries to pretend it didn't bother
          her. Sensitive Michael on the other hand starts to cry a
          little bit. He grabs Frannie's hand.

           DR. SIMMONS
           We're trying to prevent endothelial
           growth while at the same time
           preventing immunosorbent...
          As Dr. Simmons drones on with some cancer gobbledygook,
          Hazel's eyes remain firmly fixed on her parents. She hates
          what she's doing to them. And seeing them holding hands,

          old Hazel. Her father is weeping off to the side while her
          mom stands over her, holding her hand, and asking:

           (through the tears)
           Are you ready, sweetie?
          13-year old Hazel nods. The doctors get to work. The
          anaesthetic takes hold and Hazel goes under. But not enough.
          Cause she totally hears her mother say:

                          FRANNIE

          INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM
          Hazel comes out of the memory when her parents see her
          staring at them. She tries to shake it off. Dr. Simmons is
          still talking nonsense when:

                          HAZEL
           I have a question.

           Can I still go to Amsterdam?
          Dr. Simmons can't help himself. He laughs. Everyone looks at
          him. He clears his throat.

           That would not be wise at this
           juncture.

          Frannie races out of her room in a towel, dripping wet.

           Did you ever call the Genies to
           tell them the trip is off? I just
           got an email from Peter Van
           Houton's assistant. She still
           thinks we're coming.
          Frannie purses her lips and squints past Hazel. Clearly
          unsure what to say.

          Hazel can't move all that fast to hug her Mom so Frannie
          comes to her and they embrace. After:

                          FRANNIE
           I'm getting back in the tub now.
          When she leaves Hazel grabs her cell phone. ANGLE ON IT.
          Hazel sends Gus the following text: "STILL FREE MAY 3? :-)"
          A moment later Gus responds: "EVERYTHING'S COMING UP WATERS!"
          Hazel is over the moon with excitement. She smiles, then
          tries to calm herself, knowing it's the best thing.

          Luggage waits by the door, including oxygen tanks and medical

          dressed and excited for the trip.

          Michael finishes loading up the car. Kisses his wife goodbye.
          He embraces Hazel. She hugs him back and of course he starts
          to cry.

           For what?
          Michael lets go of her and wipes away his tears. They look at
          each other. Unable to help himself, he grabs her for another
          hug. Hazel lets him, laughing.

                         

          INT / EXT CAR - LATER
          The car is packed with oxygen tanks, a suitcase for clothes,
          another for medicines and back-up medicines just in case etc.
          Frannie pulls up to Gus's house. They get out of the car and
          head to the front door, buzzing with excitement.
          As they get close, they can hear a commotion inside. A
          WOMAN'S VOICE yelling something unclear, followed by:

           GUS (O.S.)

           BECAUSE IT'S MY LIFE, MOM. IT

           BELONGS TO ME!
          Frannie immediately puts her arm around Hazel and quickly
          spins her back to the car.

                          HAZEL

                          FRANNIE
           We can't eavesdrop, Hazel.
          Back at the car, far out of earshot, they wait. Hazel unsure
          what that was about. Frannie politely honks the horn.
          A moment later Gus emerges from the house, smiling. A travel
          bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his lips.

                          GUS

                          (TO FRANNIE)

           Ok.

                          HAZEL
           Ok.
          Frannie doesn't know what to make of any of that. She just
          says, when they stop and look at her:

          equipment.

                         

          INT AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER
          They wait in line for the security checkpoint. When it's
          Hazel's turn she unhooks the plastic nubbins from her nose.
          Gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt.
          Hazel takes slow, careful steps through the metal detector.
          She seems determined to get through this without any help.
          But upon reaching the other side it's clear that even these
          few steps without oxygen were a struggle.
          Hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady
          herself. As soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula
          back in place. Still light-headed, Hazel closes her eyes and
          focuses on her breathing. She catches her mom looking at her,
          nervously.

          INT AIRPORT GATE - LATER
          Arriving at the Gate area they draw curious looks from the
          OTHER PASSENGERS: Hazel with her oxygen tank, Gus with his
          noticeable limp and Frannie helping with the equipment.
          A YOUNG COUPLE gets up so that Hazel and Gus can sit.

                          HAZEL
           Oh that's not necessary.
          But they give up their seats anyway. Hazel and Gus take them.
          We see various Passengers watching. Hazel ignores the
          attention until a LITTLE GIRL (6, cute braids) appears.

           59.

                          HAZEL
           It's called a Cannula. These tubes
           give me oxygen and help me breathe.
          The GIRL'S MOTHER swoops in, a little frantic.

                          HAZEL
           I dunno. Wanna try?
          Hazel removes her cannula and let's the Little Girl try it.

           Tickles.

           Well... I'd love to give you my
           cannula but... I kinda really need
           the help.

          reattaches it.

                          LITTLE GIRL
           Thanks for letting me try it.
          They smile at each other before the Little Girl walks back to
          her family. She waves. Hazel waves back.

          INT AIRPLANE - MOMENTS LATER
          Hazel sits in the middle with Frannie on the aisle and Gus at
          the window. He looks around, antsy.

           Have you never been on a plane
           before?
          Gus shakes his head, he has not. And he's nervous. He pulls a
          cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth. Within
          seconds a FLIGHT ATTENDANT rushes over.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
           Sir, you can't smoke on this plane.
           Or... any plane.

          The Flight Attendant shoots him a look.

                          HAZEL
           It's a metaphor. He puts the
           killing thing in his mouth but
           doesn't give it the power to kill
           him.

           That metaphor is prohibited on

          The engines roar to life and the plane accelerates towards
          take off. Gus is getting more worried by the second. He grabs
          the arm rest, his eyes wide.

                          HAZEL
           Ok?
          Gus doesn't say it back. Hazel laughs.

                          HAZEL
           This is what it feels like to ride
           in a car with you.
          Gus grabs Hazel's hand as the plane lifts off. He looks out
          the window - they're flying! - and then back to Hazel.

                          GUS
           We're flying! Look!
          Hazel smiles at his enthusiasm.

           Something like that.
          Meanwhile, the landscape outside is flat and dusty, with dirt
          tracks and the occasional concrete building. In other words,
          it looks more like Indianapolis than Holland.

           Yes and no. Amsterdam is like the
           rings of a tree. It gets older as
           you get closer to the center.
          Soon enough, the cab takes an off-ramp and turns a corner and
          suddenly, it's as if they're transported - not only to
          another universe but to another time as well.
          We see MULTI-COLORED ROW HOUSES lined on both sides of a
          windy CANAL. HOUSEBOATS float against the edges and everyone
          rides BICYCLES down cobblestone streets. They're astounded.

           You have reservations at a place
           called Oranjee. Mr. Van Houten set
           it up. Very fancy according to the
           Book. And romantic.

           with an older boy on the streets of
           a foreign city famous for its vice
           and debauchery... is totally cool
           with you. Is that what you're
           saying?

          INT HOTEL ROOM - LATER
          Frannie opens the door to find Gus in a perfectly tailored
          BLACK SUIT, cigarette dangling from his mouth.

           Thank you ma'am.
          A few beats later Hazel emerges from the bathroom. She wears
          a knee-length, pale blue SUNDRESS. And she looks...

                          GUS
           Wow.

          Gus offers Hazel his arm. She takes it. They're ready to go.

          INT/EXT AMSTERDAM - ON THE TRAM - LATER
          Hazel and Gus ride the crowded tram through the city. ELM
          TREES line the canals, their pale petals blowing into the
          wind like a spring snowstorm.
          An OLD COUPLE stands to give up their seats - this happens
          all the time. Hazel again tries to protest and again it falls
          on deaf ears. She and Gus sit. They look out the window onto
          the city. Excited. The night just beginning.

                         

          EXT ORANJEE RESTAURANT - LATER
          At the edge of the canal, near an ancient bridge. Hazel and
          Gus are shown to a TABLE right next to the water.

           Your table, Mr. And Mrs. Waters.
          Gus pulls out Hazel's chair for her. A WAITER brings them a
          bottle of CHAMPAGNE as they sit.

                          HOSTESS
           The champagne is our gift.
          Hazel and Gus look at each other. Is this a dream? The
          champagne is poured and Gus raises his glass.

                          GUS
           Ok.
          Hazel raises hers.

                          HAZEL
           Ok.
          They clink glasses and sip.

           Do you know what Dom Perignon said
           after he invented champagne?

           `Come quickly,' he said. `I am

          Hazel and Gus smile.

           Welcome to Oranjee. Would you like
           a menu or will you have the chef's
           choice?
          Gus looks at Hazel. She shrugs.

           65.

                         

                          GUS

           And can we get more of this?

                          WAITER
           We have bottled all the stars for
           you this evening, my young friends.
          The Waiter leaves. Hazel and Gus look at each other.

                          GUS
           Thank you for coming to Amsterdam.

           Thank you for wearing that dress
           which is like whoa.
          Hazel shakes her head, trying not to smile but unable not to.
          The Waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate:

                          WAITER
           Belgian white asparagus with a
           lavender infusion.

           There are no words.
          Meanwhile, down on the water a BOAT passes, filled with
          merry, drinking LOCALS. One of them raises a glass to them
          and says something in Dutch.

           I mean, they told me I had like an
           85% chance to be cancer-free. Great
           odds, sure. But that meant a year
           of torture, the loss of my leg, and
           still a 15% chance it might fail.

                          HAZEL
           I have one of those. Bought it for
           my 15th birthday. Don't think I'd
           wear it on a date, though.

          unfair. Hazel looks out at the water as she says:

          At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces.
          Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed
          door, they hear this:

          So it is PETER VAN HOUTEN. Gus and Hazel can't believe it.

           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
           They are Augustus and Hazel, the
           young fans with whom you've been
           corresponding.
          Gus and Hazel smile at hearing their names. Perhaps this will
          help things take a turn for the better.

           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
           The Americans?

           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
           You invited them, remember?

           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
           You know why I left America,
           Lidewij? To never have to encounter
           Americans. Get rid of them.
          Hazel and Gus can't believe it. This is terrible!

           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
           I will not do this Peter. Be nice.
          At which point, the door opens - opened by the Woman whose
          voice they'd been hearing - Van Houten's assistant LIDEWIJ
          (30s, Dutch, pretty in a bookish way). She virtually shoves
          Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel.
          And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten. One beat,
          two beats. No one knows what to say. Finally:

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Which of you is Augustus Waters?
          Gus raises his hand tentatively.
          Van Houten sizes them up. Without another word, he turns and
          walks inside - at least this time, leaving the door ajar.

                          LIDEWIJ
           Please. I am sorry. Come in.
          Hazel and Gus share one more awkward glance before Gus takes
          a step. Hazel follows. They walk:

                         

          INT VAN HOUTEN'S HOME - SAME
          Lidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile
          it's creepy. The walls are empty and white, there's a single
          couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair. That's it.
          Van Houten sits in the chair.
          Off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and
          twist-tied.

                          HAZEL

           Fan mail. 18 years worth. He never
           opens it.
          Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his
          slippers. He motions for them to sit on the couch.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Yours are the first missives to
           which I've replied and look where
           that got me.
          Hazel and Gus take their seats.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Scotch?

                          HAZEL
           Um, no thanks.

                          GUS
           It's 11am.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Just me then, Lidewij. Scotch and
           soda.

                          LIDEWIJ
           Perhaps some breakfast first Peter?

                          VAN HOUTEN
           She thinks I have a drinking
           problem.

                          LIDEWIJ
           I also think the Earth is round.
          Nevertheless, Lidewij pours Peter half a glass and hands it
          to him. He takes a sip, then sits up straight.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           So you like my book.

                          HAZEL
           Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made
           meeting you his Wish so that we
           could come here and talk to you.
          Van Houten says nothing. Takes a long pull on his drink.

           Did you dress like her on purpose?

          Van Houten says nothing to that.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           I do not have a drinking problem. I
           have a Churchillian relationship
           with alcohol: I can crack jokes and
           govern England and do anything I
           want to do. Except not drink.
          He glances over at Lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass.

           Incidentally, thank you for dinner

          Lidewij sighs but she does as she's told. A few seconds
          later, some loud Swedish rap song blasts from the speakers.
          Hazel and Gus sit through this, totally baffled.

          The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before
          Gus has enough. He gets up and turns off the music.

           The tortoise has a ten yard head
           start. In the time it takes you to

           see, you can only decrease his

           past the tortoise as long as you
           don't contemplate the mechanics
           involved but the question of how

           You're really not gonna tell us?

                          VAN HOUTEN
           I would like you... to leave.

           78.

                         
          Hazel is furious. Gus stands next to her, touches her arm is
          if to say "come on, enough of this guy." CUT TO:

                         

          EXT VAN HOUTEN'S HOUSE - SAME
          Gus and Hazel come out of the house, practically shaking. As
          they get to the street, Van Houten has one more thing to say.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Have you ever stopped to ask why
           you care so much about your silly
           questions?
          A beat.

                          HAZEL
           Go fuck yourself.
          Van Houten doesn't have a response to that. He just shuts the
          door. And when he does, that's when Hazel gets emotional.

                          GUS
           Hey. It's ok. It's ok...
           (beat, an idea)
           I'll write you a sequel.
           (she cries harder)
           I will. Better than any shit that
           drunk could write. With blood and
           guts and sacrifice. You'll love it.
          Hazel nods, then wipes away tears. She fakes a smile and Gus
          gives her a hug. Afterwards:

                          HAZEL
           I spent your Wish on that asshole.

                          GUS
           You did not spend it on him. You
           spent it on us.
          They embrace once more.

                          HAZEL
           I wanted...

                          GUS
           I know... I know. Apparently the
           world is not a wish-granting
           factory.
          This gets a real smile from Hazel. That's when Lidewij comes
          outside. Clearly she's been crying too.

                          LIDEWIJ
           I'm so sorry. Circumstance has made
           him cruel. I thought meeting you
           would help him, if he would see
           that his work has shaped real
           lives, but... I'm very sorry.

           79.

                         
          Hazel says nothing. Gus holds her in a very protective way.

                          LIDEWIJ
           Perhaps we can do some sightseeing.
           Have you seen the Anne Frank House?

                          GUS
           I'm not going anywhere with that
           monster.

                          LIDEWIJ
           He is not invited.

                         

          EXT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - LATER
          Lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news.

                          LIDEWIJ
           I'm afraid there's no elevator.

                          HAZEL
           Oh, um, that's alright.

                          LIDEWIJ
           No, there are many stairs. Steep
           stairs.

                          HAZEL
           I can do it.

                          HAZEL --

                          HAZEL
           I can do it!
          Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments
          today. They are going inside. CUT TO:

                         

          INT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
          A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of
          Holland. Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of
          BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour. Many of
          them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.

                          LIDEWIJ
           Shall we?
          Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So
          far so good. They find themselves in an office space.

                          LIDEWIJ
           This is the bookcase that hid the
           Frank family and four others.
          The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set
          of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time.

           80.

                         
          Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks
          at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the
          climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen
          tank.
          Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored
          breathing the entire time.
          ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting.
          Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages.
          Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She's
          definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall
          to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.

                          GUS
           You're a champion.
          Hazel smiles. When she's feeling up to it they walk into the
          next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more
          narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this
          he looks at Hazel:

                          GUS
           That's enough --

                          HAZEL

                          (RESOLUTE)
           I'm ok.
          Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we're aware of her
          every breath. It's dark. And it's becoming very difficult.
          Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull
          herself through.
          Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the
          wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her.

                          GUS
           We're at the top. That's it.
          Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern.
          She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here.
          And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway.
          This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding
          for as long as they could. There's a TIME LINE detailing
          their story.

                          LIDEWIJ
           The only member of the whole family
           to survive was Otto, Anne's father.
          Gus takes Hazel's hand.

                          LIDEWIJ
           I don't know how you go on, without
           your family.

           81.

                         
          Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads
          Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO
          details the last days of Anne Frank's life. Over it, we hear
          a YOUNG GIRL's VOICE reading from the diary.
          The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the
          same. The room is dark.

           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
           "At such moment's, I don't think
           about the misery..."
          Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the
          cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it.

           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
           "...but about the beauty that still
           remains."
          Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she
          watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him.
          Their eyes meet. The emotions build...

           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
           "Try to recapture the happiness
           within yourself. Think of all the
           beauty in everything around you...
           and be happy."
          And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-me-
          against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they've
          experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a
          small eternity.
          Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly
          notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second,
          they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do...
          When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the
          whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts "bravo!" Hazel blushes,
          Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. CUT TO:

                         

          INT GUS'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER
          They fall onto Gus's bed, kissing. Hazel is very in the
          moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous. As they kiss:

                          GUS
           It's above my knee.
          She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt.

                          GUS
           It tapers a little and then it's
           just skin --

           What?

           82.

                         
          Hazel pulls away from him.

                          GUS
           My leg.

                          HAZEL
           Oh get over yourself.
          Hazel kisses him again. Now he tries to pull her shirt off
          but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. He can't figure
          it out. Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. They
          shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical
          Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them:

                          HAZEL
           I love you, Augustus Waters.

                          GUS
           I love you too, Hazel Grace.
          They resume kissing. And we CUT TO:

                         

          INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
          Gus wakes up in the bed. He looks around for Hazel but she
          isn't there. On the bed is a piece of paper. A note.
          It reads: "Dearest Augustus..."
          Beneath that is a BIG CIRCLE, labeled "Virgins." And in that
          circle is a SMALLER SECOND CIRCLE labeled "17 year old dudes
          with one leg." We'll notice part of that circle is now
          outside the bigger circle. Gus flashes that signature smile.

                         

          EXT CAFE - DAY
          Hazel and Gus sit with Frannie drinking coffee in the sun at
          an outdoor cafe. They're re-enacting yesterday's events.

                          HAZEL
           "Get up you fat bastard."

                          GUS
           "I can't stand up, I'm too drunk."

                          HAZEL
           I said "get up."

                          HAZEL
           God, what an asshole.
          They both giggle at the whole thing.

                          FRANNIE
           And then what happened?

                          HAZEL
           Then we went to the Anne Frank
           museum.

                          FRANNIE
           And after that?
          A quick glance between Hazel and Gus.

                          HAZEL
           We just... walked around.
          Hazel and Gus smile, thoroughly in love but trying to keep it
          in check in front of her Mother.

                          FRANNIE
           Sounds lovely.
          A few beats later.

                          FRANNIE
           Listen... I'm gonna stretch my legs
           a little. Give the two of you some
           time to talk.

                          (THAT'S WEIRD)
           Um... ok...
          As she stands up to leave, Hazel thinks she catches Gus and
          Frannie making eye contact for a brief second. Once Frannie
          has left them:

                          HAZEL
           That was weird.
          Gus doesn't respond except to say:

                          GUS
           Shall we?

                         

          EXT AMSTERDAM STREET - LATER
          They start to walk. Gus takes a cigarette out of his pack,
          sticks it between his lips. Hazel notices he's struggling
          with something.

                          HAZEL
           Augustus?

           There's something I have to tell
           you...
          They walk in silence a few beats.

                          GUS
           Just before you went into the
           hospital... There was this... I
           felt this... ache in my hip.
          Hazel grabs onto his arm, a lump already forming.

                          HAZEL
           Oh no...
          Gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth, clenches his teeth
          tightly, trying not to cry.

                          GUS
           I had a PET scan.
          Gus sits down on a BENCH. Looks up at her. Tries to smile.
          Before he even says it, she knows.

                          GUS
           It lit up like a Christmas tree,
           Hazel...

           Oh god.

                          GUS
           The lining of my chest, my liver...
           everywhere.

                          HAZEL
           Oh my god no!
          Hazel loses it in that moment, falling on top of him, hugging
          him for dear life, her head in his lap.

                          HAZEL
           I'm so sorry, Augustus. I'm so so

                          SORRY --

                          HAZEL
           It's so fucking unfair!
          A beat. Gus still trying not to cry.

                          GUS
           Apparently the world is... not a
           wish-granting factory.
          And at that point, Gus lets it go, lets himself cry and be
          sad and feel awful.
          But just for a second. Then he shakes it off, pulls Hazel's
          face up to his, tries again to smile through the tears.

                          GUS
           Don't you worry about me, Hazel
           Grace. I'll find a way to hang
           around and annoy you for a long
           time.
          She hugs him, perhaps a little too tightly. He winces.

          Hazel is asleep. Suddenly, her phone buzzes. She looks at it -
          "Gus" - then she looks at the clock - 2:35am. A pit grows in
          her stomach. A quick panicked beat before she answers:

          Hazel drives like a maniac down the street, eventually
          finding herself at the Speedway gas station.
          Gus's car is alone in the parking lot and she pulls up next
          to it. She gets out of her car, opens his driver's side door,
          and finds him sitting there, his shirt stained with vomit and
          blood. She gags from the smell.

           I wanted to attend my funeral. By
           the way, will you speak at my
           funeral?
          Hazel looks at him like "of course, silly" and then kisses
          him on the mouth.

           Sweet. I'm hopeful I'll get to
           attend as a ghost, but just to make
           sure, I thought I'd - well, not to
           put you on the spot, but I thought
           I'd arrange a pre-funeral.

           ... when the cancer, which was made
           of him, stopped his heart, which
           was also made of him.
          Her bedroom door opens. It's Frannie and Michael. This only
          confirms her worst fears. She starts to cry. Her parents
          embrace her in the bed.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           It was unbearable. The whole thing.

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SAME
          Hazel sits in the car in the dark. She's blaring the loudest
          music she can possibly blare - a means of drowning out the
          horrors of the world. Over which we hear this:

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           One of the first things they ask
           you in the ER is to rate your pain
           on a scale from 1 to 10. I'd been
           asked this question hundreds of
           times and I remember once, early
           on, when I couldn't catch my breath
           and it felt like my chest was on
           fire, and the nurse asked me to
           rate the pain and though I couldn't
           speak, I held up 9 fingers.
          The loud music isn't protecting Hazel as well as she hoped.
          She falls apart nonetheless.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Later on, when I'd been feeling
           better, the nurse came in and she
           called me a fighter. "You know how
           I know," she said. "Because you
           called a ten a nine."

          Hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back,
          watching people she's never seen before approach the Waters
          family and extend their deepest condolences.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           And this was it. The great and
           terrible ten.

           He loved you so much.
          Hazel nods. Hugs them back.

           He loved you so much too.
          More MOURNERS approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded in
          the receiving line. Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN. She's
          not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep
          breath, wills herself to walk towards it.
          Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee.
          Immediately, Hazel breaks down. And immediately, she catches
          herself.

           It's ok, you hear me? It's ok.
          She leans forward and kisses his cheek. She looks around.
          Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights
          and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of
          the coffin. A MINISTER approaches at that moment.

                          MINISTER
           I think we're ready to begin.
          Hazel nods and walks back to her parents, taking her seat in
          the middle of the room.

                          MINISTER
           Augustus Waters fought hard for
           many years. His battle was a
           courageous one and his strength was
           a source of inspiration for each
           and every one of us...
          Hazel frowns. This is all such bullshit. And she hears:

                          MALE VOICE
           What a load of shit, eh kid?
          Hazel recognizes that voice. But it doesn't make sense. She
          turns around and, sure enough, it's Peter Van Houten.

          Everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes. Hazel keeps
          staring at Van Houten, too shocked to do a thing.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           We need to fake pray now.
          Van Houten bows his head. Hazel, still stunned, slowly turns
          back to the Minister, trying to make sense of this unexpected
          appearance.

           Now I call on Augustus's close
           friend Isaac to say a few words.
          Isaac stands, walks up to the podium with someone's help.
          Hazel sneaks one more look at Van Houten. Yup, it's really
          him. That makes no sense to her. Isaac starts to speak.

                          ISAAC
           Of all the things I've lost in my
           life, this hurts the most.
          And Isaac stops talking. It's unclear if that was the end or
          if he just can't go on. He returns to his seat. The Minister
          walks back up.

                          MINISTER
           And now we'll hear from Gus's...
           special friend Hazel Lancaster.
          Hazel stands, walks up to the podium. A few titters in the
          room at the words "special friend."

                          HAZEL
           I was his girlfriend.
          Some laughter from the crowd. She takes out her notes.

           There's a beautiful quote in Gus's
           home that reads "if you want the
           rainbow, you gotta deal with the
           rain."
          Hazel continues to speak but we over it, WE HEAR instead:

           decided, aren't for the dead.

          Off to the side, we see Van Houten, also not watching the
          burial. He's watching Hazel. CUT TO:

           a while.
          Hazel hugs Mom and Dad, walks alone towards the parking lot.
          As she gets to the car, Van Houten approaches.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Could I hitch a ride?
          Hazel doesn't want to help this man.

           Just to the bottom of the hill.
          Hazel exhales. Fine. Once they're both in the car:

          Van Houten removes a FLASK from his coat pocket. Takes a

          give up when she sees it - crumpled up into a ball beneath
          the passenger's seat. She reaches under, pulls it up, and
          unwraps it. As she reads, WE HEAR:

           Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good person
           but a shitty writer. You're a
           shitty person but a good writer.
           We'd make a good team. I don't want
           to ask you any favors but if you
           have the time, and from what I saw
           you have plenty, please fix this
           for me. It's a eulogy for Hazel.

           Hazel knows the truth. She didn't
           want a million admirers, she just
           wanted one. And she got it. Maybe
           she wasn't loved widely but she was
