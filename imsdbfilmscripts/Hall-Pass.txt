          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Very late. All is quiet. Then a battered MINI-VAN blows by
          a row of hedges that have been pruned to read: 'WELCOME TO
          CAPE COD.' A moment later a FLASHING COP CAR flies by in HOT

          PURSUIT.

          INT. MINI-VAN - SAME

          The WINDSHIELD IS GONE and the wind blows back the hair of
          two BEAT-UP-LOOKING MEN. The driver, FRED SEARING, 40-ish,
          has a look of determination and resolve on his chunky face,
          despite the BLACK EYE and BLOOD-STAINED TISSUE dangling out
          of his nose. The nervous passenger is RICK MILLS, 38.

                         RICK
          Pull over, man!

                         FRED
          No way, I can out-run 'em!

                         RICK
          No you can't--not in this thing!
          Another POLICE CRUISER FISHTAILS OUT OF A SIDE STREET and

          JOINS THE CHASE.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Oh God, now there's two of 'em!

                         FRED
          I don't care--I'm not stopping 'til
          we get there!

          Are you crazy?!

                         FRED
          Yeah, I'm crazy! I'm crazy about my

          ESTABLISHING SHOT OF A CAPE COD HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          Rick and Fred come SKIDDING UP to the EMERGENCY ENTRANCE
          followed by the two police cruisers. When they stop, we see
          that somebody has spray-painted 'HORNY OLD MAN' on the side
          of the mini-van.
          Fred jumps out and SPRINTS toward the entrance. SEVERAL COPS
          spring from their cars and give chase. Before Fred can reach
          the front doors, he gets KNOCKED VIOLENTLY to the ground.
          Rick climbs out of the passenger seat with HIS HANDS RAISED.

          ON TV SCREEN - a video shows several YOUNG PEOPLE, early-
          20's, sunning themselves at the beach. A YOUNG-LOOKING RICK
          hams it up for the camera.

          RICK (O.S.)
          See the stud in the blue shorts?
          That's me the summer I got out of
          college.

          LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Wow, Dad, you used to have muscles.
          REVERSE ANGLE reveals EMMA, 6, and GUNNAR, 4, sitting on
          either side of Rick.

                         RICK
          I still have a few.

                         GUNNAR
          Where?
          Rick shoots him a look.

                         RICK
          They're hidden.
          BACK ON TV SCREEN - A PRETTY GIRL with a knockout body comes
          up and puts her arms around Rick.

                         EMMA
          Who's that girl?

          No, I mean the young one standing
          next to you.

                         RICK
          That's Mommy.

                         EMMA
          Mommy used to have long hair? And
          she wore a bikini?

          How come she doesn't wear a bikini
          anymore?

                         GUNNAR
          Is it because of her fat ass?

                         RICK
          I guess. What? No. Who said Mommy's
          got a fat ass?

                         GUNNAR
          Mommy.

                         RICK
          Well, uh, I don't appreciate that
          language, Gunnar. You've got the
          best mom in the whole world--don't
          ever say anything bad about her.
          Just then, MAGGIE comes GRUNTING into the room carrying a ONE-
          YEAR-OLD BABY in one arm and a basket of laundry in the
          other. She's in her late-30's, cute, with short, manageable
          mommy hair. She's wearing SWEATPANTS, an OVERSIZED T-SHIRT,
          and NO MAKE-UP.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Hey beautiful, you better get a
          move on--we're supposed to be
          meeting Fred and Grace soon.

                         MAGGIE
          I know, I know, I'm trying.

                         RICK
          Well how long you gonna be?

                         MAGGIE
          Forty-five minutes--sooner if you
          help with the kids.
          Maggie looks to him, hopeful.

          Maggie shoots him a look and Rick smiles.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I'm kidding. Okay, kids, first one
          in the tub gets college paid for.
          Emma and Gunnar just stare at him.

          Rick and Maggie walk along hand-in-hand. They're dressed-up
          and happy-looking.

                         RICK
          I miss going out with you on
          Saturday nights.
          She smiles at him.

                         MAGGIE
          I know, it's just like the old
          days.
          Rick pulls Maggie close as they walk.

                         RICK
          Maybe we should make a rule that we
          go out at least six nights a week
          without the kids.
          Maggie GIGGLES.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I'm serious. We should go out every
          week--just you and me.
          A BEAUTIFUL BLONDE walks past them and Rick gives a QUICK
          GLANCE back AT HER ASS.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I think it'd be healthy.

          just kind of spacey today.

          GRACE (O.S.)
          Come on, we're late!
          REVERSE ANGLE reveals Fred Searing and his wife GRACE, 38,
          waiting outside a restaurant. Fred sports a full-head of
          hair that's maybe a little too stiff. Grace is short and
          appealing in a Rachel Ray kind of way. Fred leans in to kiss
          Maggie as Rick kisses Grace.

                         MAGGIE
          Grace, let me ask you something:
          Does Fred ever check out other
          women in front of you?

                         GRACE
          No, Fred's not a gawker.
          Grace pats a pleased-looking Fred on the head.

          Come on, Mags, let's go say hi to
          Dr. Lucy.

          back at her for like half a second.

                         FRED
          There's your problem, dumb-ass--
          it's the wrong order. You don't
          wait for the girl to walk past and
          then glance back. You turn when
          she's still fifteen feet in front
          of you...then you wait for her to
          walk into your line of vision.

          right.

          Observe.
          Before the woman reaches them, Fred turns to his left and
          holds the look until the Attractive Woman's ASS ENTERS HIS
          VIEW and he watches her walk away.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          You see? I can't help it if her
          butt walks where I'm already
          looking.

          He was standing right next to you.
          I can't let him know that I know--

          You should see him. He's got some

          LOOKING THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW at Fred. He's sitting

          slung back as he JERKS-OFF (just below frame) to the MUSIC.
          A POLICE CRUISER passes in the b.g., then a moment later
          BACKS INTO FRAME and STOPS NEXT TO FRED.

          the waitresses, or maybe somebody
          he saw at work that day? Then when

          something I'd never done before: I
          pretended to be asleep.

          INT. RICK & FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

          Fred is sitting on his bed flipping through his address book
          until he comes to Missy Frankenfield. He hits the
          SPEAKERPHONE and DIALS. Several RINGS later:

          MISSY FRANKENFIELD (V.0.)
          Hi, this is Missy. Sorry I missed
          your call. I'm out of town for a
          few days, and I may have limited
          cell reception. Please leave a
          message and I'll get back to you as
          soon as I can. BEEP.
          Fred mouths the word 'shit', then picks up the receiver.

                         FRED
          Hey, Missy, this is Fred Searing.
          I . uh, I dust wanted to give you a
          ring and, um...well, give me a call
          when you get back. It's kind of an
          emergency. Well, not life-
          threatening, but--
          The machine CUTS HIM OFF. Fred HANGS UP, dejected. He sits
          there for a BEAT, then grabs his keys and GOES OUT THE DOOR.

          TIGHT ON FRED - he's wearing SHADES and has a BASEBALL CAP
          pulled down over his eyes.
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL that he's outside a MASSAGE PARLOR. As
          he approaches the massage parlor entrance, a bunch of LADIES
          walk out of the TRAVEL AGENCY just to the right so Fred veers
          into the DRY CLEANERS to the left.

          Fred ENTERS and immediately bumps into Kimmy Long (Ed's wife)
          standing in line behind several other WOMEN. She is
          accompanied by her 7-year-old daughter and neither of them
          look happy to see him.

                         FRED
          Oh, hi.
          Kimmy nods blankly. The Daughter glares at him. Fred
          nervously steps up next to them in line, passing time as he
          waits for the sidewalk to clear.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Um, I don't think I got a chance to
          tell you how impressed I was with
          your new place. Absolutely elegant.

          stands behind the desk with an accordion wall behind her.

          DRY CLEAN KOREAN LADY
          Mr. Searing, you pick up last week--
          no more clothes here!
          Fred smiles uncomfortably at Kimmy.

          That's right...

          Well, gotta get going--I have a
          meeting across town in ten minutes.
          See ya.
          Fred EXITS.

          EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

          Fred comes out of the dry cleaners, makes sure the coast is
          clear, then DUCKS INTO THE MASSAGE PARLOR.

          INT. MASSAGE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

          A YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN is behind the counter.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          You want massage?
          Fred looks around. There's an OLD KOREAN LADY sitting on a
          couch. He looks at the Young Korean Woman and nods.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN (CONT'D)
          You fill out.
          The Young Korean Woman hands Fred a form. Fred puts it down
          and covertly moves in.

                         FRED
          I'd prefer no paper trail.

          print.
          The Young Korean Woman hands him back the form.

          How I know what you want if you no
          fill out form?

          Um, couldn't I just tell you?
          She stares at him for a LONG BEAT.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          So, what you waiting for?!
          Fred glances back at the Old Korean Lady, then WHISPERS in
          the Young Korean Woman's ear. She nods and looks at him.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Okay.. .but must see I.D. first.
          Fred SIGHS and pulls out a hundred-dollar bill.

                         FRED
          How about a C-note so I don't have
          to fill out any forms or show any
          I.D.'s?
          The Young Korean Woman thinks about this for a moment, then
          SLIDES OPEN THE ACCORDION WALL behind her, REVEALING...
          THE DRY CLEANERS NEXT DOOR - the Dry Cleaning Korean Lady
          looks back at him, along with Kimmy Long, her daughter, and

          thrilled to be in such capable hands. Grace is getting

          Wow. You can really move out there.
          Maggie shrugs modestly.

                         MAGGIE
          Thanks. I was a dance major in
          college.

          Really? I always wondered--what do
          you do with a degree in dance?

          Well, as it turned out, nothing.

                         (BLUSHING)
          I guess the original plan was to go
          to New York and try to hook-up with
          one of the big dance companies, but
          then I got married and. . .your
          priorities change.
          She looks away, maybe a little embarrassed.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Anyway, that was fun. I haven't
          danced this much in a long time.

          Well you gotta make time for the
          stuff you love or you'll forget who
          you are.
          Maggie appreciates the sentiment. She makes strong eye-
          contact with Rick for a moment, but catches herself and looks
          away.

          to have an affair with--you'd never
          have to worry about screaming out
          the wrong name during sex.
          Maggie smiles at this, but she seems a nick uncomfortable.

          Rick is parked across the street from FITNESS FIRM HEALTH
          CLUB. He's reading the newspaper and glancing at the
          entrance for Leigh. Suddenly there's a LOUD TAP on the
          window and Rick looks over to see Flats (who we met at Rick's
          poker night) standing outside with a shit-eating grin. Rick

          shorts and an old Springsteen t-shirt. He hesitates, then
          grabs a SWEATSHIRT out of the car and TIES IT AROUND HIS
          WAIST. Rick hurries down the sidewalk toward Leigh.

          We hear a FLUSH. Rick shuffles out of a stall and moves to a
          sink. While he washes his hands, a young, NAKED, METROSEXUAL-
          TYPE whips his leg into the sink beside him. Rick slowly
          turns to look.

          he fills his hand with SHAVING CREAM and the hand DISAPPEARS
          BETWEEN HIS OWN LEGS. The guys continue their conversation,
          unfazed. Then the Metrosexual starts to SHAVE HIS BALLS.

          Just as Rick starts to go under, the two young naked

          jump in the hot tub and heave him ashore. As Rick GASPS for

          and you railed miserably. You
          struck out, you were oh-for-
          everything. So now we do it my way,
          which is...
          The guys look at Coakley like Richard Gere looks at the Dalai
          Lama.

          Rick and Fred are visibly deflated.

                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
          Guys, you're not trying to get
          married here--you're trying to get
          laid.

                         RICK
          Aren't you the guy who goes to the
          Hawaiian Tropic finals every year?
          Is that for the ugly girls?

                         COAKLEY
          I go to the Tropic finals because
          Miss North Dakota's gonna lose and
          she's gonna need a hug. And quite
          often you can parlay a hug into a
          hand-job. Rick, you're up--get us
          two bottles of Moet and six
          glasses.
          Rick shoots Fred a look, then weaves his way through a scrum
          of PEOPLE up to the bar. He tries to flag down a bartender
          but can't get anyone's attention.

          PAIGE (O.S.)
          Hi, Mr. Mills.
          Rick turns to see that he's crammed in beside his babysitter
          Paige who's looking a LITTLE TIPSY.

          She pulls out her license and holds it up.

                         PAIGE
          Yeah, I'm here with my Aunt Meg.
          Paige points across the club to AUNT MEG, a striking redhead,
          early 40's, who's talking to a couple of YOUNG MEN.

                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
          She's the best. Forty-two years old

          Nice.
          Rick continues to try to get the bartender's attention.

                         PAIGE
          So, Rick, how's the hall pass
          going?
          Paige smirks at Rick who shrinks a little.

                         PAIGE

          I baby-sit for the Putneys and I
          heard Gary talking about it the

          In fact, I thought it was very
          classy of you to be staying at the
          Holiday Inn Express instead of
          bringing girls back to your home
          with all the kids' pictures and
          schoolwork taped up everywhere.
          Rick forces a smile.

          Thank you.
          A male BARTENDER, 25, finally appears in front of Rick.

                          RICK (CONT'D)
          Yeah, um, two bottles of Moet and
          six glasses please.
          Paige eyes Rick as she sips her drink.

                         PAIGE
          So does it work both ways?

                         RICK
          What?

          one, too.

          you that night, it's because...I
          was.
          Rick flinches at this. Just then the Bartender returns with
          the champagne. Rick fumbles through his pocket and finally
          pays. Then he's left alone with Paige and her coed-in-love-
          with-the-professor eyes and her suddenly heaving cleavage.

                         RICK
          Yeah. Um...I have to go, Paige, but
          it was great seeing you.
          Paige grabs Rick's arm as he tries to go. She looks suddenly
          annoyed.

          Just then Wannabe from the coffee shop swoo s in and gives
          Leigh a kiss on the cheek. He has a pair of headphones
          hanging around his neck.

          When Leary and Boshane heard about
          your guy's hall pass, they
          convinced their wives to give them
          one, too.
          A smiling Leary tries to HIGH-FIVE Rick, but he's having none
          of it. He turns to Baker, livid.

                         RICK
          You weren't supposed to tell anyone
          about the hall pass!

                         LEARY
          They didn't say anything. Our wives
          heard about it at the pool.

                         RICK
          No! At the pool?!
          Rick rubs his face, distressed.

                         BOSHANE
          Yep. And then about three days ago--
          after some hard-core negotiating--
          we managed to push the bill
          through.
          The guys LAUGH. Rick can hardly believe what he's spawned.

                         RICK
          Really? So...how's it going?

                         BOSHANE
          That's right. It's about going
          bowling and, uh, staying up late,
          and being able to do what you want
          to do when you want to do it.

          The guys TAP their beer cups, then EXIT toward the back deck.
          A dejected and defeated Rick watches them go, then turns and
          pushes his way through the crowd to the front door. As he
          OPENS THE DOOR to leave, he finds himself FACE-TO-FACE WITH

          you'd left.

                         LEIGH
          No. I told you, I just had to talk
          him off the ledge. I calmed him
          down and sent him on his way.

          Oh. Uh, great.

          So where's that game room? I

          She smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away, we go...

          INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

          Rick and Leigh walk down the hall to the game room. He opens
          the door and flips on the light.
          THEIR POV - there's a pool table, a few pinball machines, a
          bar, and a bed.

                         LEIGH
          I'll be right back--I just have to
          use the bathroom.
          Rick nods, then watches as Leigh walks off and disappears
          into the bathroom. He takes a DEEP BREATH. This is it.
          Just then he hears O.S. LAUGHTER. Rick heads down the
          hallway and pushes open a door.

          Hey, I was thinking about this hall-
          pass business. It's really ironic,

          Rick glances down the hall to see if Leigh has returned.

          How's that?

                         COAKLEY
          Well think about it. There's two
          kinds of guys who cheat on their
          wives: The guy who does it behind
          her back, and a guy like you who
          has his wife's permission.

                         RICK
          Well it's not really cheating if I
          have permission.

                         COAKLEY
          Yeah, whatever. The point is, if
          you asked a hundred people who the
          better CJuy is, ninety-nine of 'em
          would pick you, because you're
          being honest--there's no deceit
          involved.
          Rick is growing uncomfortable.

          But the funny thing is, the other
          guy, the cheater, the bad guy, he
          has to live with all that guilt and
          anxiety, while his wife's running
          around happy as a clam because she
          doesn't know anything. And you, the
          good guy, you've got no guilt at
          all because you just laid it all on
          your wife's shoulders.

          All right, let him up.
          The young officers get off Fred and help him up. Fred rushes
          to the Doctor, who seems very serious.

                         FRED
          Please tell me she's gonna be okay.

                         DOCTOR
          She is. Your wife broke her nose
          and she got shaken up a bit, but
          all in all she's a very lucky
          woman.

                         FRED
          You got that wrong, doc. I'm the
          lucky one.
          Fred is visibly relieved as the doctor smiles and walks off.

          Fred turns to Rick and the two men hug and then Rick grabs
          Fred by the shoulders and looks him in the eye.

          and I'm gonna go home and take care
          of mine.
          Fred nods, emotional, as the cops look at each other,
          unmoved. Rick starts to walk away.

                         FRED
          Rick...
          Rick stops and turns at the door.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          You go love that lady!
          The Burly Officer rolls his eyes and steps up to Rick.

                         BURLY OFFICER
          Uh, before you 'go love that lady',

          Rick pulls up in the wrecked mini-van and gets out.

          INT. BEACH COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

          Rick steps quietly into the house. He sees two empty bottles
          of wine and two half-filled glasses on the coffee table.
          Then he hears Maggie's O.S. VOICE coming from the bedroom.

           The day I lost my virginity. March
          25th, 1988 at approximately ten-
           thirty in the evening.
          Maggie thinks about this.

          What are you talking about? We were
          dating then.
          Rick nods. She looks at him, not sure if she understands.

                         RICK
          You were my first. And you were my
          last. And you were everything in
          between.
          As it all sinks in, Maggie STARTS TO WELL UP.

          So...is that why you were crying

          EXT. BEACH COTTAGE - DAWN

           The sky is lightening but the sun hasn't risen yet. A taxi-
          van pulls up and Fred gets out. (Fred has a BLACK EYE.) He
           helps Grace out of the van, then pays the DRIVER. (Grace has
          TWO BLACK EYES and her nose is HEAVILY BANDAGED.) When the
          taxi drives off, Fred helps Grace toward the house.

                         FRED
          .And what were you doing driving
          around at one o'clock in the

          Well...I was upset so I went for a
          drive--you know, to think--and I
          must have hit a patch of sand, and
          before I knew it I was into the
          pole.
          Fred stops and looks her in the eye.

                         FRED
          I'm sorry, Grace.

          For what?

                         FRED
          For putting you through all this.
          Grace looks awash in guilt.

                         GRACE
          It's not your fault, Fred.

                         FRED
          Yes, it is--of course it's my
          fault. This isn't you--driving
          around all night, thinking--you're
          not a thinker.
          When she looks up at him, he forces a smile. But she doesn't
          smile back.

                         GRACE
          Look, Fred, we have to talk
          about... about what happened this
          week.
          Fred takes a DEEP BREATH and looks around, trying to avoid
          the moment.

          Grace lowers her head guiltily.

          Yeah. Yeah, we do.
          When she looks back up, she NOTICES the SPRAY-PAINTED and

          Grace looks at him, confused. Suddenly Fred falls to his
          knees.

          sweetie... can we please just never
          talk about what happened this week?
          Grace's eyes flicker about, hardly believing her luck.

                         GRACE
          Um...deal.
          Fred gets up and THROWS HIS ARMS AROUND HIS WIFE.
