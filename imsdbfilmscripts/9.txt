                        Experiment 208, day 20...
          
          
          INT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - DAY

          We see an early incarnation of a MACHINE (this will be the
          inner brain of the FABRICATION MACHINE). We see the
          scientist, in a white coat.
          
           We pull back to see the Scientist is playing a complicated
          MULTI-LEVEL 3-D chess game on a MULTI-LEVEL GAME BOARD with
          the MACHINE. The Scientist makes an elaborate multi-level
          move. The Machine reaches an arm out into the chess game but
          then malfunctions and strews the game everywhere.
          
          We pull back further to see the back and legs of the
          DICTATOR, with black-uniformed soldiers flanking him. The
          regime's emblem can be seen on the uniforms.
          
                                  DICTATOR
                    Useless.
          
                                  SCIENTIST
                       Please.   Give it a chance.
          
          We're on the machine, which is clicking and jerking as it
          malfunctions.
          
                                  DICTATOR (V.O.)
          One more.      That's all.
          We turns to leave. We hear the clicking of boots as the
          soldiers accompany him out.
          
          We see the scientist's dejected face as he comes towards the
          camera to turn it off.


                                                                     CUT TO:

          INT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - NIGHT
          
          The grainy footage rolls again; we see the scientist moving
          away from the camera (having just turned it on).
          
          The lab is shadowy, late at night. We see his worktable for
          the first time, covered with discarded sketches, a furiously
          filled-in journal, and pieces of failed machinery (the floor
          is also similarly littered). The TALISMAN sits on the
          worktable. Nearby is a small old-fashioned tiny little box.
          
                              SCIENTIST
                        (tired, but dictating to
                         keep the documentary
                         record complete)
                    My last possible solution....
                        (muttering to himself)
                    It must work...
          
          He gently brushes his fingers over the little box as though
          for good luck. He picks the TALISMAN up off the table. He
          moves over to insert the talisman into the port of the
          machine.
          
          His back to us, he faces the machine. We see him putting
          something over his face (but only from behind).
          
          There is a sudden FLASH OF GREEN LIGHT and the machine JOLTS,
          and then suddenly, starts up...lighting up, electricity
          crackling, parts moving in smooth coordination, etc.
          
          The scientist waits, watching. The machine continues to run.
          Its arms move smoothly, almost curiously.
          
          The scientist puts the device covering his face down and gets
          up and comes towards camera.
          
          We see the camera's POV as the scientist comes towards us:
          CLOSE on the scientist's face, which is exhausted, cheeks
          sunken, eyes wide, pupils dilated.
          
          Pull back to show the machine purring, suddenly full of a new
          sort of energy. Something new has happened.
          
          The scientist switches off the camera and:
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          
                                                                      3.
          
          
          
          INT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - A DAY LATER
          
          The machine zips through the complex 3-D chess game at
          lightning speed, checkmating the scientist in seconds as the
          Dictator watches.

          The scientist laughs fondly and pats the machine.
          
                                 DICTATOR
                      Perfect.

                      You see, it evolves.
          
          The scientist proudly gives the machine to the dictator. A
          flash goes off: someone is taking a picture O.S.
          
          The dictator exits; we hear the click of boots and see as
          much as possible of the soldiers flanking him.
          
          OUT OF SIGHT OF THE SCIENTIST,
          
          CLOSE on the machine: the dictator is gripping it with a
          nasty firmness. The machine seems to try to squirm away.
          The director's BLACK-GLOVED HAND grasps it harder.
          
           he machine, responding to the brutality, lashes an arm out
          and grabs the nearest soldier (seen from the back, we see
          only the uniform and helmeted head) by the back of his arm,
          BREAKING his ARM. The soldier falls (if possible).
          
           he dictator CONTINUES ON WITHOUT BREAKING STRIDE.

          Talisman off.

          and raw materials from which "9" is made: burlap, hinges,
          bits of Machinery.
          
           9" blinks and turns around, his head darting this way and
          that, trying to make sense of his surroundings.
          
          He walks over to the edge of the tabletop. He peers over, and
          sees...
          
          ...the SCIENTIST LYING DEAD ON THE FLOOR.
          
           lumped on the floor, we clearly see: the scientist's
          skeletal hand is clutching a tiny box.
          
          He hears a clattering sound and turns to see
          A
              loose window shutter. He goes over to the window.

           usting machine carcasses, bombed-out ruins, and emptiness
          stretch as far as he can see.
          
          Terrible, life-ending destruction.
          
           here is no other living being anywhere.
          
          9 stares in disbelief and horror and fear. He can't make any
          sense of it... or the room... or the endless miles of
          lifeless wasteland stretching out in front of him.
          
           e seems to be completely alone.

          moves to go outside.

          He stops and is strangely drawn to the TALISMAN. He turns
          and takes it, stowing it inside his zippered chest before he
          heads out.

          SEQ. 029 - EXT. WASTELAND - DAY
          
          9 moves warily in the dusty, grim light, along the deserted
          RUINS of the outside streets. It is the remains of war.
          
          Pulverized HULKS of BUILDINGS, torn-open suitcases, scattered
          clothes, rusting cars and the grim debris of human
          civilization surround him.
          
          He sees a dead body slouched next to a suitcase in the front
          seat of a car.
          
          Banners hang on the buildings with a three prong symbol on
          them.
          
           achines lie deserted on the sides of roads.
          
          Distracted by the spectacle, 9 stumbles and lands on a ragged
          old flyer: REVOLT!    He looks back at the War Machines and
          Dictator flags.    He sees a vandalized poster of what appears
          to be a dictator/leader.
          
          9 looks around him, trying to piece together what happened.
          Suddenly there is a clanking sound in front of him.
          
          9 sees a light flicker on in the shattered hulk of a war
          Machine.
          
           LOSE on 9 as the light crosses his face.
          
          Scared, he ducks behind a huge piece of debris.   9 grabs a
          piece of metal lying in front of him.
          
          The shadow moves closer, 9 shakes nervously. The figure
          emerges with spear in hand and 9 swings the weapon at him
          with all his might.
          
          9 hits him square in the chest. It is another ragdoll: 2. 2
          is propelled backwards and falls to the ground on the debris
          behind him. 9 quickly tries to hide.
          
                              2

          But 2 is looking at 9 with surprise.   He struggles to get up,
                               2
          speaking with urgency to 9.
          
          
                        (firmly, kindly, almost
                         eagerly; like trying to
                         soothe a wild animal)
                    Wait... I am a friend.

                    Friend... I am a friend.
          
          9 now sees he has hit a ragdoll, similar to himself. He
          hesitates, not sure what to make of this. 2 extends his
          hand, calmly, eagerly. 9 hesitates again, then, still timid,
          but showing a little bravery, drops his weapon and goes to
          help 2 up.
          
          We see that 2 is much older, much more decrepit, much more
          primitively constructed: he is made from patchwork bits of
          OLD LEATHER SHOES. A SHOELACE stitches up his front and is
          tied in a bow at his neck. Bits of leather FRAY off him.
          His feet are primitive small HINGES. Half of a pair of
          eyeglasses, like an enormous MONOCLE, is attached to 2's hat.
          
          9 helps straighten 2's monocle. 2 smiles at him. We see
          that 2 is like a wise mentor, a kindly professor with a
          contagious eagerness and imaginativeness.
          
          2 peers eagerly at 9.   He circles 9 and spots the number on
          his back.

                    Yes... yes... I always thought
                    there'd be one more.
          
          He nods and smiles. He extends his hand to shake 9's hand.
          While doing this, he takes 9's hand and studies it, nodding
          with eager excitement. We see that 9's hand is more
          sophisticated than 2's.
          
                              2 (CONT'D)

          2 turns slightly, and 9 sees his number and tries to say it.
          But no sound comes out of his mouth.
          
            looks at him, nodding, again, the kind mentor. He's
          interested, observing without judging; curious, kindly and
          ready to help.
          
                                2 (CONT'D)
                      You can't speak.
          
          With a friendly, disarming smile, he taps 9's zipper. 9
          unzips himself and 2 peers in. 2 looks up, happy that he can
          help.
          
                                2 (CONT'D)
                      Yes, yes...
          
          2 looks around nervously and hurries over to his roller-skate
          cart covered with detritus - odds and ends, a broken china
          doll.
          
                                2 (CONT'D)
                      ...come with me.

          2 finds the china doll.
          
                                2 (CONT'D)
                      Here!
          
          As 2 rummages through the chest of the china doll 9 picks up
          a bullet casing from 2's cart and starts tapping it. 2 turns
          with the doll's voice box in his hand.

                      No! Stop!
          
          2 eases the bullet away from 9, then smiles gently at 9,
          EXPLAINING:

                      Some things in this world are
                      better left where they lie.
          
           e puts the bullet to one side and kneels, prying into 9's
          chest. 2 begins to connect the doll's voice box.

                    But if you know where to look,
                    these ruins are full of riches.
          
          2 concentrates, a look of pleasure on his face as he twists a
          few more wires. Static and unclear sound come out at first,
          but as 2 tunes the voice further...
          
                              9
                        (as his voice is "tuned
                         in".. starting with pure
                         static, then slowly
                         moving into a voice)
                    Chhhhhhh.....chhhhehhhh...

                    ...almost there...
          
          9 gets a little panicky look on his face at the strange
          sounds coming out of him. 2 puts a calm hand on his
          shoulder. 9 calms down and tries again.
          
                               9
                    Friend?   Friend?

                    No. There are others.
          
            and 2 stare at each other. 9 looks at 2 in wonderment,
          then reaches out and touches 2's chest where he hit it.
          
          2 beams at 9, happy 9 can speak, happy he was able to help,
          and happy that 9, with his first words, is concerned about
          others.
          
            glow beams from within 9's chest.   2 stares.   9 removes the
          TALISMAN from his chest.

          2 attempts to reach for his spear but the Beast holds him
          down with its razor-sharp feet.
          
          The Beast is attracted to the Talisman. It picks it up with
          one of its jagged claws and looks at it quizzically.
          
            cringes.    His movement makes his hiding place teeter,
          creaking.
          
           he Cat Beast WHIRLS at the sound. Picking up 2's struggling
          body, the Cat Beast stalks towards the noise, right up to 9's
          hiding place, sniffing through its hollow nostrils. 9
          cringes in terror. The Cat Beast probes with one of his
          claws INTO the tin can. 9 recoils. The claws do not find
          him and retreat. 9 is relieved.
          
          A beat, then:
          
          9 feels himself violently LIFTED UP and SMASHED.
          
          We see the Cat Beast has picked up the entire tin can and is
          smashing it to get at what's inside it.   Failing, it hurls
          the tin can aside.
          
          9 is almost knocked out. Trying to stay conscious, he
          struggles towards the entrance of the can.
          
           is POV: through his haze and through the broken edges of the
          opening to the can, he sees the Cat Beast GRAB the Talisman
          and the struggling 2 in his sharp-toothed mouth, and
          disappearing into the smoky mist.
          
          9 can just make out, in the distance, the silhouettes of
          
          THREE TALL SHAPES.

          Another RAGDOLL pushes into the workroom. This is a bigger
          ragdoll, the most primitive one we have seen. He has
          primitive wooden hinges for feet. He is very frayed and
          patched together. The number 1 is painted on his back.
          
              and 9 whirl around.       5 CRINGES.

          1 carries himself with authority. He wears a red cloak, and
          a strange mother of pearl and wire hat bound together as an
          almost papal-like headpiece, and carries a staff made from an
          old gear, with a bell attached.
          
            pulls at 9 with his staff, displaying the number on his
          back.

            turns and glares at 5 like a general glaring at a new
          private, expecting an explanation for a misdeed. 5 cringes
          back, obviously intimidated by 1.

                    I saw him from the watchtower and I
                    thought...
          
          
                     ou'll lead The Beast straight back
                    to us! How many times have I told
                    you?
          
          
                    The Beast--that's what took 2!   If
                    we hurry we could save him--
          
                               1
                        (CURTLY)
                    If the Beast took him, that's the
                    end of it.
          
                              9
                    But he was still alive--
          
          5 turns with sudden hope to 9.   2 might still be alive?
          
                              1
                    No, we have RULES.
          
          1 smashes his staff against the ground.
          
          Immediately, a knife comes through the curtain revealing
          another RAGDOLL: a large ragdoll, with the number "8" on his
          arm.

                        (TO 8)
                    Our new guest seems confused.
                        (condescendingly, to 9)
                    Perhaps I can help you achieve some
                    clarity.
          
          8 is very large, and designed for great strength. He is
          almost as evolved in his design as 9, but his design favors
          primarily brute force.
          
          He has armored himself with curved pieces of tin and metal.
          He carries the blade of a large kitchen knife, with a nail he
          has attached for a handle. On his back he has slung another
          knife--half of a scissors; the scissors handle loops up above
          his head.

          Ragdolls 2, 5, 6, 8, and 1 hide under an old helmet,
          frantically trying to escape the explosions BURSTING around
          them. 7 appears with 3 and 4. We get the sense that 7 is
          the reckless one, the only one determined to SCOUT AROUND and
          see what's out there.
          
          
                        (TO 1)
                    I found others...
          
          They are welcomed in by the other dolls. They turn to 1, who
          is clearly the leader, to see what to do next. 1 decides: he
          points forward, and they all run a few feet while underneath
          the helmet.
          
          A plane crashes in the background, causing 5 to fall behind
          (he has both eyes).
          
           hrough a dirty MIST we see War Machines enter with their
          weapons.
          
          A RESISTANCE FIGHTER throws a Molotov cocktail at one of the
          Machines. It turns and SHOOTS a round of gunfire.
          
          A MUSTARD GAS BOMB is launched from the top of the Machine.
          It heads straight at 5 but he runs and gets KNOCKED to the
          ground, barely missing it.
          T
           he bomb lets out a yellow CLOUD that envelops the area and
          KILLS PLANTS ON CONTACT.
          
          7 turns and sees 5 lying face-down on the ground.   1 urges
          her to stay with the others.

          But, again, brave and slightly reckless, she runs through the
          yellow cloud to help him. She brings him back to the group.
          His left eye is damaged. The others cower. 2, the gentle
          mentor of the group, puts a comforting hand on 5's damaged
          eye. 7, always the scout, brave and fearless, points off to
          the right, and addresses 1.   She knows what's out there;
          she's seen it.

          1 looks around calculatingly, like Patton: the general taking
          charge. He thinks, judiciously, then:

                        (TO 7)
                    Go ahead.
          
            nods and darts off.      1 turns to the others, who wait for
          their instructions.

          They hurry off, increasingly enveloped by the YELLOW CLOUD.
          
          The yellow CLOUD TRANSITIONS into STEAM...

                      I'm going. I'm going to look for
                      him.
          
          He turns to 5.

            is terribly torn. He wants to, but he's never done
          anything like this before. He's always done as he's told.
          He hesitates:

                    I can't.
          
          9 looks directly into his eyes. He knows how 5 loved and
          admired his mentor and everything he did. He understands
          that 5 would like to be like 2, to do what 2 would have done.

                    But wouldn't he have come for you?
          
          9 waits, hopefully. But 5 looks away. He wants to do it,
          but he doesn't have the nerve. 9 nods, compassionately. He
          turns away. 5 hesitates, looking down, then:
          
                              5
                        (more determined)
                    Wait!
          
          5 grabs the map off the wall and rolls it up.   He walks
          towards 9.

          crumbling, disintegrating buildings surround them.

          hat lying in the dirt. He bends down to pick it up, brushing
          the dust off the top. 5 looks sadly at 2's broken hat.

          filling with hope, gets up too. 5 puts 2's hat on his
          quiver. 9 offers 2's staff to 5 but 5 gestures to 9 for him
          to hold it.
          
          They continue on, through the debris and devastation.     A
          storm is starting to come up. The wind howls loudly.

          They exchange a look. This is the first time 5 has said
          something to actually challenge 1's rules. 9 notices this

          tries to keep leading them forward.
          
          They come to a field full of trip mines and dangerous tank
          trap pits.   A parachute blows in the wind on a tree branch.
          
          5 turns the map one way and the other with growing panic.

          As he turns the map to look at it, the wind picks up and
          blows the map out of 5's hands. It blows away into the
          distance and gets stuck on a pole.
          
          5 reaches after it desperately but can't retrieve it.      He
          looks in despair at 9.

          OF THE BEAST.
          
          They inspect the footprints. 9 moves bravely towards the
          trench entrance. 5 resists, afraid.
          
          
                    No... it's too dark.

          a battery and electrical wire from his chest, winds the wire
          around the battery and places it inside the hat.

          smiling at 9.

          has happened to 2.

                      Yes. He will.
          
          9 is conveying with his simple words that he believes 2 IS
          still alive and he WILL be impressed when he sees the
          lightstaff.
          
          9 shines the light to gesture "this way."
          
          5 smiles tremulously at 9, almost more grateful for his
          sympathy and support than necessarily believing him. He
          follows 9 to the mouth of the trench.
          
          The camera pans over to reveal catlike scratchmarks on a side

          travel through earlier.

          The FACTORY: A enormous, destroyed old stone building, its
          caved-in ceiling revealing huge boilers, scarred old metal
          walkways and catwalks dangling, dust-covered rotting turbines

          Enormous metal arms lie motionless. Huge steel hooks tower
          over the belt, with sharp-edged pieces of Machinery dangling
          from them.
          
          They look around in horror.
          
           arge pieces of Machinery, pipes, and ducts dangle from the
          ceilings. Layers of dust cover everything like eerie
          blankets. Bundles of wires lie ripped from their moorings.
          
           ools and shards of glass and metal are strewn around the
          floor, twisted into strange melted shapes.

          now see 2, imprisoned in an old   birdcage. In the b.g., the
          CAT BEAST lurks, next to a pile   of what seems like debris and
          broken machinery. The talisman    is on the floor next to the
          Cat Beast. The Cat Beast seems    to be looking for something
          in the debris. The Cat Beast's    back is to us.

          He motions towards the Beast.
          
          5 and 9 try to pry the bars open. 2 tries to help. They
          just manage to pry the bars open and get 2 out when--
          
          Suddenly a light SHINES above them. They look up and see --
          
          The Cat Beast beaming his light from his eye. It GROWLS.
          
          The three dolls run away frantically.    The Cat Beast chases
          after them.
          
          9 gets cornered but swipes the Beast and manages to escape.
          9 jumps a heap of debris but stumbles. 5 and 2 pull him up
          to higher ground.
          
              shoots his crossbow at the Cat Beast, shattering his eye.
          
          2 manages to hide in a tube.
          
          9 and 5 run away but get stuck at the end of a table.

          They climb onto another piece of debris, only to encounter
          the Cat Beast, now in front of them.
          
           he Cat Beast slashes a claw out and knocks them over.    The
          Cat Beast moves closer and closer. They are doomed.
          
           uddenly there is a strange rhythmic moaning sound.   The Cat
          Beast turns, distracted.
          
          We pan over and see a mysterious creature that seems to be
          half ragdoll, half bird, with a bird-skull head swinging a
          weapon over its head.   THIS IS 7. 7 releases the weapon--a
          strap of leather with weighted shot at either end. The
          weapon flies through the air with a low whooshing sound and
          strikes the Cat Beast, entangling it.
          
          7, 5, and 9 now charge the Cat Beast. 5 shoots his crossbow,
          entangling the Beast's paw and hobbling it. 9 and 2 both
          LURE THE CAT BEAST IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, deliberately
          goading and further causing it to become entangled in the
          machinery.   7 now leaps up over the Beast and brings the
          full weight of her spear down on the Cat Beast's neck. The
          head of the Beast comes off and lands at their feet.
          7
              now pulls off her bird-skull helmet.
          
                                5

                                5
                      You've come back!

                      to join the fight.
          
           he hands 5's map back to him.
          
          9 comes over with her shield (lost during the fight).    7
          looks 9 over.

          They move towards her but she turns and looks at 9.     2 and 5
          nod proudly towards 9. 7 nods.
          
           hey all look at the fallen Cat Beast.

          They all turn to leave. 5 and 7 support 2 on either side of
          him, helping 2 along.   9 hangs back to look at the machine
          again, and suddenly sees the TALISMAN, lying on the floor.
          
          5, 7, and 2 have continued on without him and do not see him
          as he picks it up.
          
            looks at the strange object with ENORMOUS CURIOSITY. He
          turns it and see the RUNES on the side of it. He turns and
          inspects it closely.   He turns and discovers, on the
          machine, a PORT with the SAME RUNES.
          
          
                        (blurting out)
                    Look!
          
          The others now turn to see him. They see him holding the
          talisman close to the machine's port... about to
          experimentally put the talisman INTO the port.
          
                                  2
                    No!   Stop!       NO!
          
          2 tries to break free and stagger towards him but it is too
          late. 9 puts the talisman into the port.
          
           othing happens for a moment.
          
          Then suddenly, horribly, the ground begins to SHAKE.

          A mechanical ARM emerges and PINS 7, 9, and 5.
          
          As dust and debris rain down, we see one hideous RED EYE
          begin to come up.
          
           s 2 tries to scramble to safety, the other three ragdolls,
          pinned by the mechanical arm, stare in horror. We see that
          the "pile of Machinery" has risen to reassemble into an
          monstrous, towering FABRICATION MACHINE attached to the
          ceiling of the building.
          
          It is enormous, a spherical shape with a dozen folded
          appendages, each with different fabrication tools at the end
          of its long spindly robotic arms.
          
          2 tries to crawl away but the Machine grabs him with his
          robotic arm.
          T
           he Machine points the talisman towards 2 and it OPENS up to
          a sparking green glow. 2 struggles in the Machine's claw but
          the strange green energy SHOOTS directly into 2's mouth and
          eyes, painfully  his soul.
          
           NGLE on 2 as his soul is being taken.
          
          2 slumps over, his LIFELESS CARCASS smoking in the grip of
          the Machine.
          
           NGLE on the green glow as it PASSES into the machine. The
          sound has drawn its attention. The Machine turns towards
          them and grabs at them with its enormous claw. 9, 5, and 7
          turn and flee.
          
          The Fabrication Machine's arms chase after them. 5 shoots
          his grappling hook onto a switch. 9 and 7 grab onto him.
          
          Frantically working together, the three of them manage to
          escape the Machine's horrifying arms. [  Important to make
          sure the Machine is understood to be tethered to the
          Factory.]
          
          They see in the distance a pipe that leads out.
          
          In the Machine's RED POV, they run into it just as the
          Machine's arm is behind them but can't fit into the hole.

          6 emerges from his shadowy corner and comes over to 9. He
          has a drawing of the Talisman and seems to want to show it 9,
          urgently.

          1 bangs his staff against the floor. 8 stands at attention.

          8 PUNCHES 9 out of the way, knocking him to the edge of the

          outside. 1 starts to back away.

          The WINGED BEAST tail crashes through the stained glass
          window and breaks into the floor right next to 9.
          
                                                                      42.

          5, 6, 8 and 9 huddle together. Suddenly the Winged Beast
          comes crashing in the window behind them, knocking over the
          thurible and splashing hot coals all over the floor.

          5, 6, 8 and 9 see the Winged Beast emerge from the smoke
          pouring out of the upset thurible.
          
          The Winged Beast SHRIEKS at them. It catches its foot on the
          runner leading up to 1's empty throne. The hymnboard/
          calendar topples away to reveal 1 hiding behind it. 1
          instinctively clutches his staff causing the bell at the top
          of the staff to RING and attracting the Winged Beast's
          attention.
          1
            flees. 8 charges the Beast but it SCYTHES its wing towards
          him and knocks 8 across the floor. 8 slides across the floor
          to 1, who stands next to 6's picture of the Cat Beast.
          
          1 pushed the picture of the Cat Beast away to reveal a HIDDEN
          PASSAGEWAY. 1 runs away as 8 looks at the others for a brief
          moment before also running away.
          
          The Winged Beast turns its attention to 9, 5, and 6. The
          ragdolls run for the bucket and bell-ropes, but 9 trips. The
          Winged Beast advances towards him.   5 reaches out to 9.  9
          gestures to him to continue without him.
          
          As 9 recovers himself and makes a break for the bucket, 5
          starts to lower the bucket down. Just as the Winged Beast is
          about to catch up with him, 9 LEAPS down the shaft and lands
          in the bucket with 5 and 6.
          
          Angrily, the Beast lashes its harpoon tail down at them,
          piercing the bottom of the bucket. The bucket rocks and 6 is
          sent FLYING OUT but 5 CATCHES him in the nick of time.

          The Winged Beast starts reeling its harpoon tail in. Jerking
          back and forth, the bucket ascends, drawing the ragdolls
          closer and closer to the Beast.
          
          9 spots a SMALL LEDGE next to a stained glass window.
          
          He opens the side of the bucket and gestures that they should
          jump.
          
          The others hesitate, but then 9, 6, and 5 jump out of the
          bucket onto a swinging rope, and onto the ledge. The Winged
          Beast plummets down the shaft after them.

          The ragdolls squeeze through a small crack in the stained
          glass emerging onto a ledge overlooking the Cathedral's roof.
          
          9 sees 1 and 8 running across the roof and points to 5 and 6
          to look down there. Down on the roof, 1 and 8 see 5, 6, and
          9. 1 pushes past 8 and runs farther out, towards the front
          of the Cathedral. 8 follows.
          S
           uddenly, the Winged Beast SMASHES through the glass behind
          them. It struggles to get through the window but can't quite
          fit.
          
          6 is very vulnerable out there.
          
          9 turns to 5.
          
                                9
                      Take him inside.
          
              now climbs out on the gargoyle purposefully.
          
          The Winged Beast FLIES UP into the air, circling lazily.    1
          and 8, running on the top of the roof, are very exposed.
          Hawklike, the Winged Beast sails towards them.
          
          8 steps up to defend 1. He flips his salt-shaker helmet down
          over his face as armor, pulls out his scissor knife and
          stands his ground... waiting... waiting for the Winged Beast
          to soar in closer...
          
          And then, at the last possible moment, he HURLS his scissor
          knife at the Winged Beast. It flies through the air and
          catches in the Beast's propeller.
          
          Knocked off balance, the Beast swoops down. 1 ducks out of
          the way but it knocks 8 off his feet. 8 slides down the
          sloped edge of the roof, towards GAPING HOLE.

          Just as 8 is about to fall into the hole, he catches on to
          the edge. His other blade plummets through the hole as he
          hangs, desperately... his grip SLIPPING...
          
          9 catches up to where 1 is.

          The Winged Beast circles around and sets its harpoon tail to
          shoot. 1 squints into the sun as the Winged Beast, backlit,
          swoops down towards them. He sees a glare come from the tin
          roof. 9 gets an idea.    He gestures to 1 to help him. 1
          scowls, but has no alternative but to help him.
          
          9 peels back a piece of the roof, with 1 helping him.   The

          Blinded by the glare, it MISSES and almost hits 8.
          
          The harpoon imbeds itself into a rafter inside the Cathedral.

          and more taut...
          
          The Winged Beast is pulled hard into the roof and slides

          The Winged Beast plummets after them onto the wing. It picks
          itself up, spots the cowering ragdolls, and opens up his
          bladed beak screaming.
          
          The Winged Beast starts to charge them when suddenly--
          
          7 DROPS DOWN from a high parapet and leaps onto the Winged
          Beast's neck.

           mmediately, the beast throws her off towards the others.
          She'd dropped her spear; she goes to pick it up and
          
           PFFFFFFT> immediately, her leg is IMPALED by the Winged
          Beast, which has fired its harpoon. She is impaled next to

          But as she speaks, the Beast begins to reel her in.       She
          fights viciously.

            grabs her forked spear and hands it to her. She grabs her
          forked spear and stabs it into the plane.   The harpoon's
          cable is pulled taut 9
                               between her leg and the Winged Beast.
          
          
                          (yelling to the others)
                      The cable! Cut it!
          
          8 runs to recover the blade that slipped from his grasp as he
          slid down the roof, then runs over and SLICES with all his
          brute force through the cable. The cable flies up in the air
          and WRAPS itself around the propeller on the end of the wing.
          
          The Winged Beast jerks back, towards the propeller, causing
          the whole wing of the plane to tilt, and the ragdolls to
          slide. 5 and 6 tumble into the plane's engine room.

          7 clutches her staff. 9 slides by her and grabs on to the
          harpoon, still lodged in her leg.
          
          9's staff slides by, and 9 catches it just before it falls
          off the wing. As 8 climbs up onto the same buttress fragment
          that 7's spear is lodged in, 1 slides down the wing, past 9.

          1 grabs 9's staff. Dangling, he sees that the Winged Beast
          is close behind, snapping at him with its beak.
          
          9 sees 5 and 6 in the engine room.

          6 nods. 5 points to the wires. 5 and 6 gather wires and set
          to work. They ZAP the propeller to life and it GROANS... then
          whines into motion as it starts taking up the power it had
          generated. It goes faster... faster...
          
          Even as the Beast is slowly drawn towards the propeller, it
          struggles forward and grabs 1's cape in its beak.
          
          As the Winged Beast pulls 1 closer, 9 strains to hang on to
          1, and 7 strains with the added weight on the harpoon
          sticking out of her wounded leg.
          
                               1

                     Let it go!
          
          1 glares furiously, hesitates, then undoes the clasp. The
          Winged Beast falls backwards down the wing, DIRECTLY INTO THE
          DEADLY BLADES.
          
          It is instantly shredded.
          
          Claws, feathers, and strange mechanical debris shower down.
          
           , 9, and 7 look in relief as the Beast is finally destroyed.
          
           fter the clasp is released, 1 has meanwhile recoiled into
          9's arms. There is a brief moment of awkwardness as 1 and 9
          realize how close they are physically to each other.

          1 begins to climb up the side of the wing, using dangling 9
          and 7 as a ladder.
          
          Perched on top of 7's staff, 1 reaches up for 8, who is
          crouched on the edge of the buttress. He grabs 8's hand,
          gesturing imperiously to 8 to pull him up.
          9
            looks at 7 urgently, nodding to her. She gets it
          immediately and grabs 1's leg, stopping him.
                  86                                                        186

                       ourselves!
          
          The plane teeters down to a 90 degree angle. 5 and 6 look up
          at the rest of the ragdolls from farther down the wing. 5 is
          concerned and almost panicked. 6 is almost zen-peaceful, as
          though he can foresee it will be all right.
          
              looks around and sees the rope tied around 7's waist.

                       Your rope.
          
          7 throws it down to 9 who ties it to his own waist. The plane
          tilts... it's hanging even more precariously now... about to
          fall out of the side of the Cathedral entirely...
          
          9 suddenly jumps down into the flames just as the plane
          starts to fall. 7 shouts with stress.
          
          The plane EXPLODES as it hits the ground, smoke rising from
          the crash. The rope pulls taut, and after the smoke settles
          we can see 9 dangling with 5 and 6.
          
          8 pulls the hanging chain of ragdolls up and onto the
          buttress fragment.

          up... towards the smouldering clock tower...

          The twins look up and nod their agreement. While the others
          have been talking, they have found a book cover and have lain
          2's body on it. They now put the sword on top of 2 like a
          fallen soldier and put his hands on his chest holding the
          sword.

                      to rescue them--

            just bows his head.    He's still mourning 8.   9 gives him a
          compassionate look.
          
          They turn towards the twins, and see them pick up 1's coin
          and place it on top of 2's face. They see that the twins
          have prepared 2's body for burial.
          
           hey all bow their heads. The twins now slowly send 2
          floating down the remnants of water in the drainpipe at the
          bottom of the fountain.
          
          5 pulls out the piece of burlap from 2's back with his number
          on it. He hands it to 9.
          
              looks at 5, 9, and the twins soberly.
          
          They look at him.    Slowly, they nod, as though accepting
          their mission.
          
          1 sighs heavily. Suddenly he looks so very old, so very
          tired. He stares down at 2 floating away. Slowly, he nods
          as well.

          We pan down, and see SEEKER DRONES (that the newly vitalized
          Fabrication Machine has constructed) floating in the air
          around the factory, tirelessly looking for enemies. One of
          them floats near to camera and its searchlight fixes on
          something. We follow the light down.
          
          The light reveals a PUMPING OIL DERRICK, also newly awakened.
          Its pump moves up and down in sinister rhythm.
          
          The light moves away from the derrick. Camera stops
          following the light and keeps moving down, arriving at the
          ground where we now see, in the darkness--
          
          THE RAGDOLLS. They huddle behind an oil pipe waiting for the
          Seeker Drone to pass. 1 is weak, but is supported by 5, who
          has been patching him, and is just finishing up, pulling the
          last thread out of the patch he's sewn onto 1. 1 is
          regaining his strength. The twins huddle behind 6.
          
            looks out past the pumping derricks and sees AN ENTRANCE TO
          A COAL CHUTE.

              darts purposefully towards the factory.
          
            looks around keenly, looking up for seeker drones, then
          runs out from cover, over to a huge barrel that lies half
          buried in the scorched earth.    A painting of the Dictator's
          symbol is stenciled on the side.
          
          He taps on the front. It is FULL. He looks up in the air at
          the seeker drones. They haven't seen him.
          
          We gestures to the others.
           e see the barrel is on top of a small hill that leads down
          to coal car tracks. The tracks lead to the open mouth of a
          coal chute that feeds into the factory.
          
          5 sees a bent spoon on the ground. He smiles, remembering 2
          and his ingenuity, and picks it up. He hands it to 1.

          With confidence now, he looks around. He sees a splintered
          pile of wood planks, the remains of a wooden derrick
          platform. He looks at the others and gestures to the wood.

          9 darts from hiding place to hiding place inside the darkened
          factory, moving towards the Fabrication Machine.
          
          He spots the half-blinded Seamstress and watches in HORROR as
          he sees that the Seamstress is giving 8 up to the Fabrication
          Machine. 9 is too late to do anything to stop the Machine
          from sucking 8's soul.
          
           here is a bright GREEN GLOW as 8's soul is sucked, and in
          the sudden illumination, 9 sees 7. She is sewn into the
          Seamstress--but is still alive!
          
           NGLE on 9 as he realizes she is still alive and he can still
          rescue her! From his hiding place he looks around for a way
          to rescue her. He inspects the machinery near him. He sees
          a LEVER and GEARS. He looks at his LIGHTSTAFF. He then
          spots a remnant of the FABRIC used to create the Winged
          Beast. We see he is formulating a plan. He darts his hand
          out to drag the fabric towards him.
          
           NGLE on the Fabrication Machine as it begins to power back
          up after taking 8's soul.
          
           NGLE on the Seamstress. She turns to get 7, and give her to
          the Fabrication Machine. We see the TERROR and DEFIANT FURY
          in 7's eyes, but she is immobilized and can do nothing.
          
          Suddenly the Seamstress hears a SOUND.   She whips around.
          P
           OV through the Seamstress's damaged eye: a MOVEMENT in the
          shadows.
          
           he Seamstress, distracted from her morbid mission with 7,
          slithers towards the movement.
          
          In the shadow we see a RAGDOLL with GLOWING EYES. 7 sees
          this and registers recognition, relief, and also TERROR at
          what will be 9's fate. But she is unable to move or speak
          and now, just as 9 could only watch 8's soul being sucked
          out, 7 can only helplessly watch as the Seamstress slithers
          closer and closer to its prey. We see the misery on 7's
          face.
          
          The seamstress raises her needles and STRIKES the ragdoll,
          sewing wildly.

          The ragdoll SWINGS OUT from a string attached to a lever.
          The lever now moves down (because of the weight of the
          ragdoll) and SWITCHES on machinery. Gears start to turn and
          we see the ragdoll is attached and begins to drag the trapped
          seamstress in, arms first.
          
           he gears CRUNCH the ragdoll. 7 FLINCHES... but then her
          expression turns to amazement as she suddenly sees it is not
          a ragdoll at all but is 9'S LIGHT-STAFF DRESSED IN FABRIC.
          Instinctively, she looks up, a sudden hopeful look on her
          face... just as
          
          9 SWINGS IN and lands on the SEAMSTRESS, tearing a hole in
          her back. He slides down the length of her body, FREEING 7.
          
          7 and 9 fall to the ground as the gears now CRUSH THE
          SEAMSTRESS.

          5, 1, 6, and the twins crouch behind the barrel. We see they
          have built two paths of wooden boards leading down to the
          entrance of the coal chute, have dug a trench under the
          barrel, and have placed a long bar of metal beneath the
          barrel.

          They all pull down with all their weight. The barrel lifts
          and teeters, then tips and RACES DOWN THE HILL. At the
          bottom, it launches off the boards, spinning into the air and
          landing on the rails to the coal chute with a sparking crash.
          
           he ragdolls race down after it.
          
          The barrel rolls and comes to a stop right at the mouth of
          the coal chute.

          and the twins try to drag the Drone down.
          
            brandishes the match. We suddenly hear the sound of the
          SPIDERS. 1 looks down the tunnel.

          1 strikes the match on the side of the oil barrel and is
          about to light the rag. 5 grabs his arm.

                    No!    Not yet--
          
          They tussle over the lighted match when suddenly--
          
                              9'S VOICE
                    What did I tell you?      Light it!
                    Now!
          
          7 and 9 run towards them. The eyes of the spiders can be
          seen right behind them. 1 looks at the burning match in his
          hands, thinking about what he almost did...

          1 sets the rag on fire. The ragdolls jump behind the barrel
          and PUSH it into the tunnel. 7 and 9 just make it, leaping
          out of the tunnel as the flaming barrel HURTLES down the
          tunnel--DRAGGING the SEEKER DRONE with it--crunching over the
          unseen Beasts--and landing in the factory and --
          
          BLAM!!!!
          
          THE FACTORY EXPLODES.

          The ragdolls walk up to the hill away from the explosions.

          it.

                       And some of us very much alive.
          
          9 warmly clasps her arm. She pats his hand.     They look with
          great affection and appreciation at each other.
          
          The twins chatter: they've found an old Victrola lying in the
          debris, with an old warped record still on it. They climb
          onto the record, tripping the needle arm onto the disc, and
          begin walking on the record.
          
          A scratchy old melody comes from the large Victrola
          amplifying horn. 7 smiles at the sound of the music. She
          leaps on the record, joining them. As they walk faster, the
          music speeds up.
          
          1 comes up behind them. He looks deep in thought.     He
          catches his hat as it begins to slip off his head.

          1 goes to sit down and rest, sitting on a brick. 5 heads
          over towards the others. But 9, seeing 1's contemplative
          mood, stops next to 1. 1 looks up at him.

                      haven't I?
          
          9 looks at 1, not sure how to respond. 1 now also sees 2's
          old staff that 9 is still holding onto.
          
          He looks over at 9.

                      I lost sight... of many things.
          
           e looks at 9 as though to beg his forgiveness.    9 sits down
          next to him.
          
          
                      We've both made mistakes.

                      What's past is past.
          
          They look at each other for a beat, then look over to the
          others, relaxing together on the Victrola.
          
            holds out his hand to 1. 1 gives 9 his hand and 9 helps
          him up. As 1 stands, his heavy headpiece falls off and
          shatters.
          
            looks in horror.    But 1 just looks at it, shrugging and
          slightly smiling.

                      It was always so heavy.

          H
           e now runs his hand over his head, which we now see has a
          funny looking pony-tail like protuberance.   9 hesitates,
          then can't help CHUCKLING. 1 sees him, then starts to LAUGH
          as well.
          
          9 and 1 go over together to the Victrola. 7 notices as 9
          helps 1 climb up on the Victrola and starts to celebrate.
          
          9 joins 7 near the needle and 6 sits on the crank as it spins
          around. Everyone is enjoying the music.

          He picks one out.
          
          But it rolls away from him.  It rolls towards the hill and
          then down the hill. 5 runs after it.
          
          Behind him, unseen by anyone, the talisman crackles and glows
          slightly.

          --the enormous Fabrication Machine, RISES UP, free of the

          apparition...
          
          They leap off the spinning Victrola, hitting the needle and
          the music SCRATCHES TO A HALT.

          5 faces the Machine as the green of the TALISMAN shoots out
          at him, sucking his soul into its portal. The Machine's eye
          turns green showing it has absorbed the soul, then back to
          glowing red.

          The Machine again SHAKES and then seems momentarily paralyzed
          as it ingests the soul, giving the ragdolls a moment to flee,
          scrambling, desperately trying to get up the hill and escape.
          1 looks over to the bridge. His general's instincts kick
          back in.

          7 and 9 have almost managed to pry the Machine loose, and are
          about to send it plummeting to its destruction.
          
          6 breaks free from 1's hold. 1 grasps after him, trying to
          stop him. 1 only grabs onto 6's key. 6 runs out onto the
          bridge.

          and turns.

          The bridge starts to give way 9 and 7 run to the other side.
          9's light staff slides and falls down into the dark crevice.
          
          The Fabrication Machine is now hanging off of one side of the
          bridge, still holding on to 6.
          9
            and 7 flee wildly across the disintegrating bridge. They
          make it across to the other ragdolls at the other end of the

          The Fabrication Machine tries to back up on the bridge but
          ends up getting caught in the beams, which form a cage around
          him. The other ragdolls yell to 6 from the other side of the
          bridge.
          
          The Fabrication Machine brings 6 up to its eye.

          include: the original machine... the talisman... sketches of

          manuscript...

          slightly altered if necessary for our uses here; if we still
          want to hear the radio it should be mixed in very low, so we
          are aware of it but it doesn't interfere with the scientist's
          dialogue. This is constructed so the scientist can be in
          V.O. only until the end, but if possible we can also see the
          back of the scientist in the first few pieces of footage].

          The scientist puts the strange face mask on and 9's POV is
          suffused with a GREEN GLOW.   The talisman clicks shut, the
          soul transfer completed. We hear the scientist fall to the
          ground, his soul depleted.

          simply touches the Scientist's hand, tenderly. He looks up,
          a new, resolute look in his eyes.

                              9
                    He... he used his own soul.

          as its claw SMASHES down, DEMOLISHING THE CANNON.
          
          The dolls fly back from the blast. 9 is the only one
          standing. 9 deliberately walks towards the Machine. 7

          from getting 9. The Machine sends her flying. She lands
          badly and can't get up immediately. The Machine regroups,
          then begins to re-approach 9. 9 stays put.

          They all cringe with horror.

          At the end of each spoke is the burlap skin of one of the
          fallen ragdolls, with its number stretched across a pole.

          9 stands in front of the last pole, holding 5's skin in his

          The journal. The tiny box. They put them down to the side.

          BURSTS. A huge GREEN GLOW reaches up to the sky and the

          8 emerges and walks to his number. He nods to 9, 7, and the
          twins. They nod back, acknowledging the fierce warrior.
          
          2 comes out with 5 close behind.   5 places an arm around 2.
          
            emerges from the Talisman energy.   He sees his key and
          caresses it.
          
          1 emerges and comes over to stand next to 9. He nods,
          acknowledging that 9 has finally completed the mission.     He
          looks up to the sky. The others follow his gaze.
          
          Together, spirits and living, they all watch together, and
          watch as the beam shoots up to the sky. We see THE SKY
          CHANGING, HEALING, RENEWING ITSELF.

          The souls of the slain ragdolls now rise and dissipate into
          the healing energy.
          
          9 and 7 watch.   7 puts her arm around 9.
          
          The twins chatter: they've taken 6's key and tried it in the
          little box's keyhole. It opens the box. 7 and 9 go over as
          the box is opened:
          
          It is a music box.
          
          As they see themselves reflected in it, they see the word
          "HOPE."
