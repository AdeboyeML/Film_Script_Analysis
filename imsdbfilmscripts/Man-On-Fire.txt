"Man On Fire"

OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE

EXT.   MEXICO CITY - DAY

High over the city on a bright Sunday morning, the sun
pounding its way through the orange haze of smog. As we
descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets:
the sounds of a Mass being sung.

A CATHOLIC CHURCH

The big wooden doors open to release the parishioners
inside. Feature a tall, lanky 18-YEAR-OLD. Holding his
GIRLFRIEND'S hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin.
They don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a
faucet's been cranked down. They move toward a Mercedes
500. As a CHAUFFEUR holds the back door open for them...

A GRAND MARQUIS

Squeals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside
the Mercedes. FOUR MEN get out flashing  badges. In a
moment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff-
arming the chauffeur. As the girlfriend  cries and the
gossip among the parishioners begins...

The Grand Marquis pulls away.

INT.   GRAND MARQUIS - DAY

They shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat.
These guys are not the police.

A switchblade is flicked open. Practiced hands slit the
boy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels.
Eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf.

Duct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head.

EXT.   WOODED AREA - DAY

The Marquis is parked across from another CAR. FOUR NEW
GUYS wait as Eighteen is hauled out of the Marquis. His
clothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin. He
stands naked, bound and blind. Eighteen is handed over
from one group to the other.

INT. TELEPHONE - UPSCALE HOME - MEXICO CITY - DAY

The phone rings. A bomb going off. Eighteen's
distraught FATHER (family photos of the boy on the wall)
answers.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    2.


REVERSE TO REVEAL a battery of POLICE and NEGOTIATORS in
the room with him. One of them listens in, waves fingers
at him as the negotiations begin.

INT.   VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF AN 8' X 4' CELL - DAY

A wall smeared with God-knows-what. Facing   it, Eighteen
stands naked blindfolded and shivering. The   back of his
leg still bleeds. He shifts nervously as a   little JACK
RUSSELL TERRIER eagerly licks the blood off  his calf.

A MAN ('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates
by cell phone. Voice calm. As he runs numbers, he slaps
his thigh. Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear
scratched.

At a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the
ground. Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in
tape leaving one ear exposed.

CUT TO T.V. - Rosanna Garcia Guerrero, editor of REFORMA
newspaper, being interviewed, "...organized crime
syndicates...growth of kidnapping in Mexico over the last
two years."

EXT.   UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY

As a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox. A
glimpse of something we don't want to see. An ear
partially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear.

EXT.   CITY SQUARE - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT

A MERCEDES driving around the square, Eighteen's father
waving a white shirt out the window like a surrender
flag.

EXT.   BRIDGE - NIGHT (3 AM)

Footbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway.
Empty train blazes through. Dangerous, deserted downtown
neighborhood. Looks more like "war torn Beirut", burnt
out cars and trash. The 18 year old's father, naked to
the waist, walks from the family Mercedes over the
footbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi-
derelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of
fabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open. He
slams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves.

EXT.   DOWNTOWN MEXICO CITY - TWILIGHT

RUSH HOUR. A red stream of headlights separated from a
white stream of taillights by a narrow median.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                        3.


HORNS blare as a CAR stops. Eighteen, still blindfolded,
is dumped on the median. The car pulls away.

He stands there in the whirlwind. Pathetically SCREAMING
for help. More horns, shouts, no help.

END MAIN TITLES.   Goes to black.

                          CREASY'S VOICE
             Ezekiel 25:17 Blessed is he who in the
             name of charity and good will shepherds
             the weak through the valley of darkness
             for he is truly his brother's keeper and
             the finder of lost children.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Samuel Valencia Ramos and his lawyer Jordan Kalfus in the
privacy of an alcove table. Jordan is well heeled, well
connected and well oiled. In that order. Samuel, at 40,
already has the patrician look that has served the male
members of his family for generations. They discuss the
kidnapping, a headline on the paper Jordan tosses aside.

                          JORDAN
             The family paid the ransom and he was
             returned two days later.
                    (laughs; chews)
             His father still hasn't gotten up the
             nerve to ask him if they fucked him up
             the ass.

                          SAMUEL
             And now every mother with money in Mexico
             City wants bigger and better bodyguards.
             My own wife included.

                          JORDAN
             If she pisses you off, you get another one.

                          SAMUEL
                    (laughs grimly)
             Do you know what she told me last night?

                                                 FLASH TO:

INT.   SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT

Samuel sits at his baby    grand piano playing a gentle
rendering of 'Delibes'.     His American wife LISA stands
away from him. Just the     sight of her back reveals a
pitch perfect petulance.    She tells him:

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       4.


                          LISA
             A man's worth can be judged by what he
             has or what he owes. Only the amount
             matters.

                          SAMUEL
             And bankruptcy. Where will that put me
             in the social strata?

                          LISA
             I'm only asking for one thing. And it's
             not an extravagance. It's not even for
             me; it's for our daughter.

                             SAMUEL
             Our daughter.

She turns at that: a woman so beautiful it nearly hurts
to look at her. She stares, plays him like Chinese
Checkers.

                          LISA
             Our child's safety is at stake.

                          SAMUEL
                    (stops playing)
             These people are professionals. They
             don't waste their time taking children
             whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.

                          LISA
             Samuel, it is not something we should
             skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the
             car or outside the school was at least
             some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I
             feel totally exposed.

She just stares at him.    He melts.

                                                  RETURN TO:

INT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Jordan smiles at his client, enjoys seeing him squirm.

                          SAMUEL
             Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be
             as beautiful as her mother one day.

                           JORDAN
             Yeah?   And if she was ugly?

Samuel rolls his eyes. Jordan laughs.       Beheading two
cigars, he passes one to Samuel.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                5.


                         JORDAN
            All my clients have kidnap and ransom
            insurance.

                         SAMUEL
            I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and
            my family and when it runs out in sixty
            days, without a bodyguard, I will not be
            able to renew it.

                         JORDAN
            I know you need to please Lisa. An ass
            like that is hard to find. Good
            bodyguards are even harder.

                         SAMUEL
                   (interrupts)
            I know! I just had to let one go because
            I couldn't afford him!

Jordan lights his cigar.

                         JORDAN
            You need a bodyguard of some description.
            It's a dangerous world we live in. But
            you will get what you pay for. He
            doesn't need to be Superman, does he?
            Can you go fifteen grand?

                           SAMUEL
            For a year?

                         JORDAN
            For a few months. Hire someone cheap.
            You have to have a bodyguard to keep the
            insurance. Then fire him for
            incompetence. The important thing is
            Lisa's daughter will return to school.

Samuel finally follows the logic.

                         SAMUEL
            And Lisa will be able to save face.    We
            won't be the only family without a
            bodyguard.

                         JORDAN
            Her beauty fucks with your mind.

                         SAMUEL
            For an American she understands this
            country very well.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   6.


                           JORDAN
              She understands men.

As Samuel puffs his cigar in satisfaction...

EXT.    CORRIDOR - MEXICO CITY AIRPORT - DAY

As a 747 is towed by in the background, a MAN strides at
us. CREASY. Even in movement, he has a stillness, an
air of isolation. He's set apart from other living
things.

He wears dark sunglasses, carries a well-worn leather
bag. Inscrutable. Disconnected. A bit frightening.
The discipline of a soldier. The independence of a
gunslinger.

Automatic baggage teller (Red Light, Green Light).
Creasy feeds the machine with his perforated customs
card. Light flashes RED.

CUSTOMS MAN

He flips through Creasy's passport. Even the stamps have
stamps. Thailand. Somalia. Cuba. Columbia. Hong
Kong. Saudi Arabia. Every country in Europe. Guy's
been around.

Customs looks up from the ink blue American Eagle to the
deep matte black of Creasy's sunglasses.

NOTE:    Italics denotes the lines spoken in Spanish.

                           CUSTOMS
              Where are you coming from?

                           CREASY
              South America.

                           CUSTOMS
              Where are you staying in Mexico?

                           CREASY
              I'm on to Juarez.

                           CUSTOMS
              Why?

                           CREASY
              I have a friend there.

Customs looks at Creasy a moment. He doesn't look like a
man who has 'friends'. Finally, customs smiles.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   7.


                          CUSTOMS
             I cannot see your eyes, Senor.

Creasy slips off the sunglasses. His eyes are deserted.
Inevitable. Customs can only look into them a moment.
He indicates for Creasy to put his bags on a conveyor
belt leading to an X-ray machine. Creasy lifts his bag
onto the conveyor. The official hits the start button.
The bag drives forward towards the X-ray machine.

Creasy pauses, then offers up a license from his wallet.

                             CUSTOMS
             Senor?

                          CREASY
             It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia.
             The gun you're about to find in that
             suitcase.

Polaroid FLASH

Shot of Creasy straight on.     Shot of Creasy profile.

FLASH.   Fingers being fingerprinted.

JUMPCUTS - suitcase being stripped and ripped (MIDNIGHT
EXPRESS), pack of Marlboro, bottle of Jack Daniels,
glimpse a weathered Bible (New Testament), intercut with
seven pieces of blue steel separated in different parts
of the bag, ie. toiletries, underwear, lining of
suitcase.

The seven pieces laid together look remarkably like a
well travelled Sig Sauer 226. Creasy smiles.

EXT. JUAREZ, MEXICO FOUR BIG BURLY SUV'S - DRIVING
ACROSS THE BORDER CHECKPOINT - DAY

INT. SUV - DAY

Six Japanese BUSINESSMEN jabber on cellphones. PAUL
RAYBURN sits up front trying not to spill coffee on the
mini Uzi cradled in his lap. As his own cell phone
rings, he answers.

               When did Mexican Customs start getting
               smart?

RAYBURN's SUV

                             RAYBURN
               Creasy???   Where the fuck are you?

CUSTOMS JAIL

                             CREASY
               I'm here.

RAYBURN's SUV

                            RAYBURN
               What do you mean, I'm here?

CUSTOMS JAIL

                            CREASY
               I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico
               City International. Bring a bunch of
               cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.

INT. CUSTOMS AREA - A BACK OFFICE
Rayburn has 5K U.S. dollars laid out on      the desk between
him, the Customs official, and Creasy.       The remains of
the suitcase are spread around the room.       The main
offender, the gun being front and center      next to the
cash. Looks like the official is going       to fold.

                            RAYBURN
               This is going to cost you big time.

INT. STRIP BAR - Rethink Location

A stripper does a half hearted grind as Rayburn and
Creasy sit at the bar sharing a bottle of 'Jack'.

                            RAYBURN
               You got a secondary search and you had a
               gun.

                            CREASY
               Listen it was a calculated risk. I've
               done it a million times and never got
               caught.

                            RAYBURN

                         CREASY
            It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags
            coming off the plane.

                         RAYBURN
            This is Mexico, they do everything
            backwards.

Creasy hits the 'Jack'.

                         RAYBURN
            So what's wrong?

                         CREASY
            Nothing wrong.

                         RAYBURN
            Don't give me that bullshit.

Creasy changes subject.

                         CREASY
            So how's business?

                         RAYBURN
            Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap
            labor. Factory space. But they feel a
            lot safer living over the border in El
            Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They
            think I'm John-fucking-Wayne.

                         CREASY
            But don't you stay in El Paso?

                         RAYBURN
            Fuck, I love Mexico.   I live like a king
            down here.

Creasy takes a look around the Seedy Bar.

                         CREASY
            Yeah, right...

                         RAYBURN
            Oh, like you haven't been in worse
            places.

                         CREASY
            And a level five shithole is better than
            a level six. Your logic's inescapable.

Rayburn laughs. Creasy takes the bottle.     Creasy's hand
is mottled by old burn marks.

                            RAYBURN
               You been working?

                            CREASY
               Not for eight months. I was in Columbia
               looking around, but, nothing seemed
               interesting.

                            RAYBURN
               How long you staying, Crease?

                            CREASY
                      (shrugs)
               Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just
               wanted to see you, how you were. Came by
               on impulse.

Rayburn studies his friend a beat, just seeing the cracks
that weren't there last time they met.

                            RAYBURN
               You did something on impulse?

Creasy smiles.

INT.   PINTA'S BEDROOM - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT

Nine-year-old PINTA MARTIN RAMOS stares out at the
garden, a bit like Creasy, but only a ten yard stare.
Pinta's eyes brim with life. She folds her hands, closes
her eyes, prays. 'Chopin' drifts up from downstairs.
Samuel on the baby grand.

                            PINTA
               Dear God. I do not ask for health. Or
               wealth. People ask you so often that you
               can't have any left. Give me God what
               you still have. Give me what no one else
               asks for. Amen.

Pinta grabs a battered old TEDDY BEAR and climbs into
bed. She pulls the covers up, looks over as her door
opens.

Lisa enters.    Pinta is her daughter.

                            LISA
               You should be sleeping, baby.

            I'm trying, mom.

Lisa strokes her head, smiles.

                            LISA
            Good news.     You're going back to school.

                          PINTA
                    (sits up; excited)
            When?

                         LISA
            Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard.
            It may take a few days, but you're going
            back.

Pinta lets it sink in.   Lisa kisses her goodnight.

                         PINTA
            Could he speak English?     Emilio couldn't
            speak English.

                        LISA
            We'll see. And thank your father in the
            morning. A man always needs to be
            thanked.

EXT. - JUAREZ DESERT - DAWN

Four SUV's blast along a desert highway on their way to
pick up some Japanese businessmen. Rayburn rides
shotgun, Creasy in the back. Rayburn looks like he slept
in his clothes. Creasy looks crisp and clean.

                         RAYBURN
            That's right, a bodyguard.

Creasy looks at him blankly.

                         RAYBURN
            Your Spanish is good enough.     You
            certainly look the part.

                         CREASY
            You're crazy. People would hire a has-
            been, Ray? A drunk?

                         RAYBURN
            Well, you'd have to keep it under
            control.

                         CREASY
            And what if, just say, there was a kidnap
            attempt?

                         RAYBURN
            You do your best. They won't be paying
            you enough to perform miracles.

Creasy just shakes his head.

                         RAYBURN
            It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at
            half speed you're pretty damn good.

                          CREASY
            A bodyguard has to be close to someone
            all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not
            good at that.

                         RAYBURN
            So you'll be the silent type.    People
            will appreciate that.

Creasy shakes his head, looks out the window.

                         RAYBURN
            What are you doing here?

                         CREASY
            I came to visit you.

                         RAYBURN
            Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years.
            You don't visit.

                         CREASY
            A bodyguard... Who's the guy?

                           RAYBURN
            Samuel Ramos.    Owns one of the plants in
            Juarez. The    Jap car industry is in the
            toilet. He's    trying to persuade Ford to
            partner with   him. I think he's in
            trouble. He    asked me if I knew anyone he
            could trust.

                         CREASY
            Oh, now you think I can be trusted.

                         RAYBURN
            Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air.
            Then decide if you want to... stick
            around or not.

Rayburn throws him a VHS from the glove box.

                          RAYBURN
             Instructional tape on what I tell my
             clients about bodyguarding.

Creasy looks back at Rayburn who's just a little too
perceptive for comfort.

EXT.   MERCEDES - MEXICO CITY SUBURBS - DAY

A dark Mercedes maneuvers the turns.

INT.   MERCEDES - DAY

Creasy at the wheel.    Samuel sits in the back.   Studying.

                          SAMUEL
             You drive easily. Smoothly.

Creasy doesn't answer, just drives.

                          SAMUEL (CONT'D)
             Were you provided with a gun?

                             CREASY
             Yes.

                          SAMUEL
             Show me, please.

Creasy takes his right hand off the wheel, reaches under
his jacket and passes back a beat-to-shit looking PISTOL.

                             SAMUEL (CONT'D)
             What is it?

                          CREASY
             Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.

                          SAMUEL
             Have you used this type before?

Creasy just nods.   Doesn't like the show and tell.

                             SAMUEL
             Is it loaded?

                             CREASY
             It's loaded.

Samuel hands back the gun.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   14.


                          SAMUEL
             You will meet my wife first. She would
             like it if you are presentable, polite
             and respectful. You'll be the fifth
             candidate she's seen this week.

Samuel flips through a manila folder.

                          SAMUEL
             Your resume is impressive. Nine years in
             the Army. Extensive counter terrorism
             work. I shouldn't be able to afford you
             in my current state. What's the catch?

                          CREASY
                    (honest)
             I drink.

                          SAMUEL
             How does it affect you?

                          CREASY
             My coordination. Reaction time. If top
             professionals try to kidnap your
             daughter, the service will be on par with
             the pay.

                          SAMUEL
             And what if amateurs try it?

                          CREASY
             I'll probably kill them.   Is that likely?

                          SAMUEL
             No. And no one is to know of your
             drinking problem. That includes my wife.

As they pull up to the Ramos' impressive hacienda.

INT.   SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT

Where Lisa is flipping through TV channels; Sky News,
CNN, etc... Each one showing some terrorist act - West
Bank protest, Madrid car bombing.

Samuel and Creasy, meanwhile, enter behind her.      She
clicks it off, looks back at them.

            It's war. The weakest suffer the most.

                         LISA
            You're American.

            Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.

Lisa steps over, shakes Creasy's hand.    Gives him a quick
once over.

                         LISA (CONT'D)
            Would you like a drink?

Creasy doesn't hesitate, doesn't look at Samuel and has
no irony in his answer.

                            CREASY
            Thank you.     Scotch and a little water.

She steps to the bar to make it.

CREASY - FROM SOMEONE'S POV

Slightly sinister.   Watching from the frame of the door.

                         LISA
            You've done much of this work before?

                            CREASY
            Never.

Samuel sells, covers for Creasy's reticence.

                         SAMUEL
            He has experience in related work.     A
            great deal of it.

                         LISA
            Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?

Creasy hesitates for an imperceptible beat.

                          CREASY
            No.   I do not have family.

And then, somehow, Creasy is aware of being watched.        His
eyes flicker over, just in time to see...

PINTA

Crouched low. In the doorway. She stares back at him a
beat, then disappears around the corner.

SITTING ROOM

Creasy frowns.    Lisa steps over with Creasy's drink.

                            CREASY
               Thank you.

She makes a point of looking into his eyes. Creasy looks
back into hers with complete indifference, something she
has not experienced even from dying men.

She abruptly turns away.    Confused for a moment.
Finally:

                            LISA
               Pinta!

A few moments and Pinta arrives.       'Cool Hand Pinta'.

                            PINTA
               Yes, mom?

                            LISA
               This is Mr. Creasy.

Pinta walks over and very formally holds out her hand.
Creasy shakes it. An odd beat.

                            LISA
               Pinta, show him to his room.

Samuel reacts.    Creasy got the job.

                            PINTA
               This way, Mr. Creasy.

What an actress. As he follows her out.        Samuel sits at
his baby grand and begins to play.

               I think it's nice he's American.

            You realize that you've brought a killer
            into the house.

Samuel is stopped short by that one.    She steps over and
kisses her husband on the cheek.

                            LISA
            Thank you.     I feel better now.

EXT./INT. HOUSE - SUNSET

Pinta leads the way. All enthusiasm, away from her
parents. A 150 pound black German Shepherd greets them.
Sniffs Creasy's pant leg, unsure.

                         PINTA
            Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?

                         CREASY
            If they like me.

            My Dad loves the idea of having a dog
            around, but hates the fact he lives

Creasy follows her.   Frank pads along after them.

CREASY'S ROOM

Not like downstairs, but comfortable enough.

                         PINTA
            We fixed the room up two weeks ago.       Mom
            and I. It's nicer than before.

Creasy takes a stroll around it, ignoring her.

                         PINTA
            You've got a CD player if you like music.
            I like music a lot.

CAW! Creasy looks over at a CAGE on a stand holding a
MACAW. It tilts its head at the big man.

A TV and VHS machine in the corner.

                            PINTA
               That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him
               with when he left.

                               CREASY
               Who's Emilio?

                            PINTA
               My last bodyguard. He drove me to school
               in the morning and picked me up in the
               afternoon.

Finally Creasy turns, looks at her hard.

                            CREASY
               I'm here for you?

Pinta smiles huge, nods.

               In between you can take Mom shopping and

               Looks like he approves of you.

And then, walking on air, she's out the door.

Creasy sets up his room with meticulous precision that
comes from years in the military. Front and center he
arranges his shrine: an almost empty bottle of scotch and
a glass (engraved from an earlier encounter) next to a
pack of Marlboros and his weathered Zippo. Then, his
beaten up gun and holster. A well-travelled New
Testament is placed in the drawer.

CREASY'S BAG

He reaches in between the shirts, pulls out a fresh
bottle of scotch. He breaks the seal, unscrews the cap.

He pours a double... triple... wait, what do you call a
full glass of scotch?

CAW!   The macaw squawks it's disapproval.

He ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, tries to
catch it on the back of his hand. An old game with
himself.

His hand is too shaky. The bullet bounces off, hits the
floor. Creasy picks it up. Ejecting the magazine, he
starts to oil the weapon.

CAW! As the macaw squawks, Creasy looks up. It doesn't
feel like this relationship is going to work.

                          PINTA
             There's something about him.

Lisa turns, looks back at her daughter.

                          PINTA
             I think he's been sick. He's alright

              Well, think about going to sleep.   Good

Lisa exits.   Pinta looks over at the battered teddy bear.

                           PINTA
              Just like you, a big old bear.

CREASY

In his room. Tests his mag spring with his thumb, begins
loading up. The full magazine joins with those already
loaded.

Another glass of scotch is poured.

Creasy's hands oil the holster. The Sig Sauer is slipped
in. The holster is hung over the corner post of the bed.

A map is flattened. Creasy's finger traces various
routes, pencils them in. From the house to Pinta's
school.

The macaw squawks again. Creasy steps over, takes the
cage and carries it to the open window. He opens the
cage door.

Creasy's drinking in the dark next to the window,
listening to the sounds of Mexico City at night.

Brushing her hair, Pinta wanders to the window at the
sound of a car hood closing. Creasy is down below going
over the car; a dark BLUE MERCEDES. As he checks
underneath...

The "Car Wash Guy", Pedro, trying to engage Creasy.
Frank looks on, seems like he disapproves of Pedro.

INT.   MERCEDES - DAY

Creasy sits grimly behind the wheel. Pinta exuberant
beside him. Traveling route number one from home base to
school. Pinta looks at Creasy's hands on the wheel. The
back of the right one is swirled with scars.

                          PINTA
             Where are you from, Creasy?

                          CREASY
             The United States.

                            PINTA
             I know.    But which state?

Creasy checks the rearview mirror. A banged up white
TOYOTA COROLLA pulls out behind him.

                          CREASY
             No state in particular.

Pinta frowns; this is going to take some work.

                          PINTA
             My mom and me are from Houston, Texas.
             Have you been there?

Creasy has his eyes on the mirror.

                            CREASY
             No.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   22.


                         PINTA
            You can drive and talk at the same time,
            can't you?

                         CREASY
                   (turns left)
            No.

                            PINTA
            Why not?

                         CREASY
            I'm looking for potential.

Creasy checks the mirror. The white Corolla continues
the way it was going. False alarm.

                            PINTA
            Potential?     I don't understand.

                         CREASY
            Places where the road bends, places away
            from buildings, places where the traffic
            thins out. But you don't have to
            understand. I do. So no talking.

                         PINTA
            Are you going to quit?     My last bodyguard
            quit.

                         CREASY
            Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?

                         PINTA
            Someone gave him more money than we
            could.

                         CREASY
            I'm a bargain.

                         PINTA
            Being black, is that a positive or
            negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?

                         CREASY
            Time will tell.

                         PINTA
            There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City
            in the last six days. Four a day. What
            do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     23.


                          CREASY
             Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my
             fee or get a larger gun.

She looks at his scared right hand, then him.     All
curiosity.

EXT.   CONVENT SCHOOL GATES - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Creasy pulls the Mercedes up out front.   He notes the
high walls, the heavy gates.

                          PINTA
             Beep the horn.

Creasy hits it. A beat and then a   shutter opens at eye
level. Pinta waves from the car.    A moment later the
gate is being slowly pushed open by  an old WATCHMAN.
Creasy drives in toward a rambling,  ivy-clad building set
in spacious grounds.

COURTYARD

Creasy parks, get out of the car.   He looks around,
appraising the lay of the land.

                          PINTA
             Isn't it beautiful?

Pinta's name is called. An elderly gray-haired NUN walks
over from the entrance. Pinta runs over, kiss her
warmly on both cheeks, then leads her toward Creasy.

                          PINTA
             Sister Anna, the headmistress.
                    (to nun; proudly)
             This is Creasy, my bodyguard.

Sister Anna shakes his hand.

                           SISTER ANNA
             Mr. Creasy.

                          PINTA
             No, Sister, he told me just to call him
             Creasy. He's American. From no state in
             particular.

                          SISTER ANNA
             You must look after our Pinta. We're so
             happy to have her back in school. Run
             along now, Pinta.

Pinta waves goodbye, bounds away.   They watch her go.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   24.


                          SISTER ANNA
             She's late, Mr. Creasy.

                          CREASY
             Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes.
             I -- It won't happen again.

                          SISTER ANNA
             No offense, but I'm sorry that your
             profession needs to exist.

                          CREASY
             So am I, Sister.

                          SISTER ANNA
             Do you ever see the hand of God in what
             you do?

                          CREASY
             Not for a long time, sister.

                          SISTER ANNA
             The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil,
             but overcome evil with good."

                          CREASY
             Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.

Sister Anna is impressed.   She nods her 'props' to
Creasy.

                          CREASY
             I'm the sheep that got lost.

INT.   MERCEDES - CONVENT SCHOOL GATES - DAY

Creasy pulls out, starts down the street. He's only gone
a hundred meters when SIRENS kick up. A police car
behind him. Creasy shakes his head.

                          CREASY
             Here we go again.

Creasy pulls over, digs around the front seat as TWO
SLOPPY COPS head over.

                          SLOPPY COP ONE
             Do you speak English, Senor?

                           CREASY
             Yeah.   And Spanish.

                          SLOPPY COP ONE
             You have an identification?

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   25.


Creasy hands them his PASSPORT and a printed LETTER. A
legitimate firearms license for bodyguard work witnessed
by Rayburn.

Creasy deliberately puts one hand on the steering wheel,
then the other. Minimizing the confrontation.

                          CREASY
             It's a temporary license for the gun I'm
             carrying. I just went through all of
             this at the airport.

INT.   BIG BURLY SUV - DRIVING TOWARD THE BORDER - DAY

Six Japanese BUSINESSMEN jabber on cellphones. Rayburn's
daily routine. He sits up front an Uzi cradled in his
lap. As his own cell phone rings, he answers.

                          RAYBURN
             Rayburn here. Creasy, what's up?
                    (listens; laughs)
             Yeah?

                                                CUT TO:

POLICE LINE-UP WALL - As Creasy's MUG SHOT is flashed.

CREASY'S HAND - As he's fingerprinted.

                          CREASY
             There's still ink on my fingers from last
             week.

                                                CUT TO:

RAYBURN'S SUV

                          RAYBURN
             You got tossed. Don't trust the cops,
             especially the Judicials.
                    (listens; laughs again)
             Oh you know that?

INT. BAR - DAY

Creasy slams a Jack and Coke.

EXT.   HIGH STREET - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Creasy striding, the frivolous shoppers like another
species as he moves through them. Might as well wear a
shark fin. He spots something: a MUSIC STORE.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      26.


INT.   MUSIC STORE - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Creasy finds the section he's looking for, searches a
rack. There. As he pulls a particular CD, we are not
privy to what it is.

EXT.   COURTYARD - PINTA'S SCHOOL - DAY

Creasy waits, smoking a Marlboro light, separate from the
other drivers and bodyguards. The bodyguards stand
together sharing cigarettes and stories. Give him a
share of unfriendly looks. Creasy could care less.

The doors open and the children pour out. PINTA exits, a
huge grin as she spots Creasy. Creasy palms the
Marlboro. The frown on his might as well be chiseled in
marble.

INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING -DAY

Pinta rides shotgun alongside Creasy.     She looks out the
window, realizes...

                          PINTA
             We're taking a different way home.

                             CREASY
             That's right.

Pinta thinks about it, realizes what he's doing, smiles.

                             PINTA
             I understand.     Smart.

No answer from Creasy.     It's hard not to feel foolish
around this kid.

                          PINTA
             Did you like school, Creasy?

                             CREASY
             No.

                             PINTA
             Not at all?

                             CREASY
             No.

                             PINTA
             But why not?

Creasy's hoping she'll just shut up.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    27.


                              PINTA
              Hmmm?

                           CREASY
              It wasn't a school like yours and there
              was no Sister Anna.

                           PINTA
              So you were unhappy?

                           CREASY
              Being unhappy is a state of mind.   I
              never thought about it.

                              PINTA
              Oh...

Pinta watches Creasy a moment, trying to figure a way in.
She looks at his scarred right hand on the wheel.

Then, as she reaches out...

                           PINTA
              What happened to...

And touches it.

                              PINTA
              ...your hand?

Creasy gives her a look, devoid of humanity for an
instant.

                           CREASY
              No more questions.

When he speaks again he's colder; he's decided something.

                           CREASY
              I'm not paid to be your friend.   I'm paid
              to protect you.

They drive on in silence. Creasy finally glances over.
Pinta stares straight ahead, her chin quivering.

                           CREASY
                     (exasperated)
              And don't start crying.

                           PINTA
              I'm not crying.

But she is.   As Creasy stops at a red light...

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      28.


                            CREASY
               Look, this is the way I am.   I don't like
               questions. I --

And she's out the door.

                            CREASY
               Shit.

Creasy shoulders open his door, bolts out.

INTERSECTION

Creasy has barely straightened himself and Pinta is
already getting back in the car. This time in the
backseat.

Creasy sighs. The light goes green.     Scooters whine away
and horns blare.

MERCEDES

Creasy sits back behind the wheel.

                            PINTA
               You can take me home now, Mr. Creasy.

Creasy looks back at her, but she stares straight ahead.
As the chorus of horns continues, Creasy continues driving.

INT.   KITCHEN - RAMOS VILLA - DAY

Creasy sits at the table   with the old gardener GOMEZ
(we've seen him trimming   hedges and such in earlier
exteriors). Gomez's just    cleaned his plate and is going
after any remnants with a   crust of bread. Creasy hasn't
touched his.

MARIA, the cook, enters.    As she clocks Creasy's plate...

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - SUNSET

'Chopin' drifts across the courtyard. Samuel is a very
accomplished player.

Creasy sits in a chair in the twilight by the window, a
glass of scotch in his hand. A knock at the door.

                            CREASY
               Come in.

The door opens.    It's Lisa.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  29.


                         LISA
            Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you
            have everything you need.

                           CREASY
            I'm fine.

                         LISA
            Is the food alright?    Maria tells me that
            you didn't eat.

                         CREASY
            The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.

                         LISA
                   (smiles)
            It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if
            you have to... Do you mind if I talk to
            you for a moment?

He shakes his head. Lisa glides into the room like a
dancer, sits down at the foot of the bed.

                         LISA
            How are you getting along with Pinta?

                         CREASY
            We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a
            new toy.

                         LISA
                   (smiles)
            Yes, she told me.   Do you have children,
            Mr. Creasy?

                           CREASY
            No.

                         LISA
            You should know they're tenacious when
            they want something. And Pinta wants to
            be friends.

                         CREASY
            You're paying me to protect her, not
            amuse her. Right?

A beat and then Lisa nods.

                         CREASY
            Look. Maybe this isn't going to work.
            Maybe you should ask your husband to hire
            someone... more sociable.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    30.


                          LISA
             No, you're right. You were hired to
             protect her, that's enough. I'm
             confident you'll do that.

Lisa stands, is about to start out when she sees his gun
and holster hanging from the corner of the bed. It gives
her pause. Something sexy about it and Creasy's
proximity.

                          LISA
             I didn't realize you had a gun.    I know
             that's silly to say.

Creasy doesn't answer, just watches her.

                          LISA
             It makes it all seem so serious.

                          CREASY
             It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.

                          LISA
             Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with
             you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.

Finally, Lisa just shrugs and disappears out the door.
Creasy slugs down a gulp of scotch.

INT.   PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Pinta, blankets up, teddy bear beside her, says her
prayer.

                          PINTA
             Give me God what you still have.    Give me
             what no one else asks for.

Then, she listens as Linda Ronstadt's "Blue Bayou" starts
to drift through the open window, down from the room
above.

                          RONSTADT
             "I'm going back someday, come what may,
             to Blue Bayou..."

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT

He stands in the dark, in front of the glow of the
stereo. The empty bag from the record store. This is
the CD he bought. As the song ends, Creasy hits the back-
up button. "Blue Bayou" begins again. Creasy takes the
9mm from its holster. As he sits back in his chair...

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    31.


INT.   PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Pinta listens to the music, figures a way to dance to it.

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Creasy sits in the dark with his 'Blue Bayou'. Creasy
does not look right. Holding the 9mm, he ejects the
round, tries to catch it on the back of his hand. No
good.

He chambers another round.     Tries again.   Nope.

                          LINDA RONSTADT
             Well I'll never be blue, my dreams come
             true, on Blue Bayou...

INT.   PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Pinta still dancing, finding a way to be with Creasy
whether he knows it or not. Frank, the dog, watches her
every move, perplexed.

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT

As the song repeats, Creasy chambers yet another round.
Feels like he misses a beat as he loads one shell into
the chamber. Pinta sings along oblivious. Suddenly the
barrel is at his forehead and the trigger has been
pulled. No gun shot. A click. Hammer against shell.
Creasy is confused. He ejects the shell and catches it
in the palm of his hand. Macro photograph / a small dimple
on the back of the shell is the only evidence of his
actions. Pinta still dances.

INT.   RAYBURN'S BEDROOM - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT 3.A.M.

Rayburn in bed with his beautiful 19-year-old Mexican
WIFE and their four-year-old SON.

As she leans down to kiss her son, a cellphone rings.
Rayburn looks over at the nightstand. FIVE CELLPHONES
there, one of them ringing. Rayburn finds it.

                            RAYBURN
             Rayburn...    Creasy! What's wrong?

EXT.   RAMOS HOUSE - NIGHT

Creasy stands at the edge of the drive, the house dark
behind him. On his cell phone.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     32.


                         CREASY
            I said, have you ever had a nine
            millimeter round that just didn't go off?

                                        INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING:

Rayburn pulling away, sitting on the edge of the bed.

                         RAYBURN
            You mean a misfire?

                         CREASY
            I mean nothing. The hammer came down and
            nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.

                         RAYBURN
            I've heard of it. Never happened to me
            though. Maybe the firing pin's off.

                            CREASY
            Maybe...

Creasy is troubled about it all to say the least.

                         RAYBURN
            It's like we always used to say: a bullet
            always tells the truth. What were you
            shooting at?

Creasy doesn't answer.    He holds the bullet up, looks at
it.

                            RAYBURN
                      (focusing; concerned)
            Creasy?

                         CREASY
            Sorry I woke you, Ray.

Creasy clicks off the phone. He starts back toward the
house, but stops short again.

There she is. Pinta. Standing in the window of her
room. She's been watching him. It's like Creasy seeing
her for the first time. And she's been watching him
forever. No easy answer for it. They're connected
somehow.

INT. CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Fingers putting the special bullet into an old matchbox.
It takes it place of honor front and center on the
shrine. Next to the Marlboros and scotch. The New
Testament is set down nearby.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   33.


CU - Creasy asleep in his bed for the first time.

INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY

Silent Creasy driving. Lisa and Pinta in the back.
Creasy steals a look in the mirror. Pinta stares
straight ahead. But when Creasy looks away, Pinta steals
a look at him.

EXT.   STREET - MEXICO CITY - DAY

As the mercedes crosses an intersection, a white TOYOTA
COROLLA turns right, pulls in thirty meters behind it.

INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY

Creasy clocks the Corolla, frowns. He pulls a piece of
paper from his pocket. But nothing to write with.

                          CREASY
             Pinta, do you have a pencil?

                          PINTA
             I go to school, don't I?

Sarcasm. He stays calm, doesn't let on what he's
thinking.

                           CREASY
             Please?

Her little hand comes over the top of the seat with a
pencil. Creasy takes it, slows to let the Corolla catch
up. He squints into the mirror to read the plate.

Lisa is oblivious, but as Pinta looks back over her
shoulder...

BRAKE LIGHTS up ahead. Creasy lurches to a stop.    The
Corolla swerves around them disappears ahead.

                           CREASY
             Sorry.

                          LISA
             The traffic takes some getting used to.

As Creasy cranes for a view, another WHITE Corolla comes
by headed the opposite way. They're everywhere. This
relaxes Creasy's paranoia. As he laughs to himself.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       34.


EXT.   COURTYARD - CONVENT SCHOOL - DAY

They pull in through the gates. The Mercedes parks;
Creasy gets out. Pinta kisses her mother on the cheek.

                               PINTA
               Bye, Mom.

                            LISA
               Don't forget your towel.

Pinta gets out with book bag and her      towel. As she
starts to walk past Creasy without a      word, he holds out
her pencil. She holds up, shows him       a SECOND PENCIL,
continues on her way. Doesn't need       him.

MERCEDES

Creasy gets back in, starts away.

                            LISA
               She has swimming practice today.    You'll
               need to pick her up at the pool.

Creasy just nods. He doesn't want anything to do with
Lisa either. Thoughtful, Lisa looks out the window.

                            LISA
               I talked to her. She understands.     She
               won't bother you anymore.

As Creasy just drives.

EXT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Creasy waits in the street, stands by the Mercedes. He
checks his watch, looks around. The minutes do not pass
quickly. He looks over as the restaurant door opens and
Lisa exits with Jordan Kalfus and his Latin wife EVELYN.

                               LISA
                         (sees him)
               Creasy!
                      (stepping over)
               Meet Jordan and Evelyn.

Creasy nods.    They study him with interest.

                            JORDAN
               So you're the bodyguard?
                      (Creasy nods again)
               You used to be, what did they used to
               call it, a soldier of fortune?

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                 35.


Jordan doesn't quite hide his disdain. Creasy nods a
final time, lets his eyes drift to a 1000 yard stare.

                          EVELYN
                   (giggles)
            Does he talk?

As Lisa gives her a dirty look, Evelyn whispers...

                           EVELYN
            He's sexy...

Jordan looks in the direction Creasy looks.

                         JORDAN
            You see any danger out there?
                   (laughs)
            The fear's worse than the reality.

Just a blankness from Creasy.

                         JORDAN
            I always wanted to ask a bodyguard, would
            you take a bullet for your employer, for
            Samuel?

A condescending smile as Jordan awaits his answer.

                         CREASY
            I wasn't hired to guard Mr. Ramos.

                         JORDAN
            For Pinta then?

                           LISA
            Jordan!

                         CREASY
            If something happened, my reaction would
            be to fight to protect her. I have
            skills in that respect. Pinta would
            benefit by the fact that... I'm a
            soldier.

                         JORDAN
            What kind of an answer is that?

                         CREASY
            The answer is the truth.   The question is
            foolish.

Lisa smiles at the answer, kisses Jordan on the cheek.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     36.


                          LISA
             Jordan, thank you for the lovely lunch.
             I promise not to let Evelyn spend too
             much.

Evelyn doesn't see it, but Creasy does. Jordan just lets
his fingers trace the top of Lisa's ass.

As she and Evelyn head for the car, Creasy is there to
open the door.

MERCEDES

Creasy gets behind the wheel. Pulls into traffic. As he
goes, he checks the rear view mirror. Jordan remains
standing on the curb watching the car pull away.
Something odd about it all.

EXT.   PUBLIC POOL - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Loud. Chaotic. Reminiscent     of a lunatic asylum. Creasy
arrives at the public pool.    A practice. Several
bodyguards gather at one end   of the pool. Give Creasy a
less than friendly look. As    he looks for Pinta...

A GUN goes off.

Sees: The smoke from the starting pistol as the SWIMMERS
splash into the water.

He sees Pinta in the pool. The fifty yard dash. She's
in fifth. Then fourth. Creasy walks along beside her.
Third. Second and closing. And at the wall, still
second.

She surfaces, frustrated.    As she sees Creasy there...

INT.   MERCEDES - DAY

Creasy drives. Pinta in back, writing in her notebook.
Not speaking, but a weird sort of harmony. Finally.

                            CREASY
             You're fast.

                          PINTA
             Once I get in the water but not starting
             off. By the time I catch up, it's too
             late.

She keeps writing.   The number "2" over and over.

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Creasy sits in his chair drinking scotch.     All alone
needless to say.

Creasy takes the instructional VHS on bodyguards that
Rayburn gave him and plugs it into the VCR. It's in
Japanese. Shakes his head. He switches off the VCR and
surfs the TV channels instead. Sees talk show with the
editor of REFORMA newspaper, ROSANNA GUERRERO, talking
about organized crime in Mexico.

From out the window, a CAW, then again.     Yet again.

Finally, Creasy stands goes to the window. He leans out,
sees Pinta's window across the lawn from him.

Pinta standing on the terrace. Another CAW.

Creasy decides to play.    He CAWS in return.

Pinta looks around.    Creasy does a pretty good
impersonation.

Hears Pinta CAW again.

                          CREASY
             Hey... Pinta...

She looks up at him.

                          CREASY
             What are you doing?

                          PINTA
             Calling for Emilio's macaw.    I thought I
             heard him.

                          CREASY
             Do you think he'll come back?

                            PINTA
             Maybe.    Did you hear him?

                            CREASY
             No.

                          PINTA
             How do you think he got out?

                          CREASY
                    (a beat)
             Well, I let him go.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     38.


                          PINTA
             It's better to be free, right?

                           CREASY
             Yes.   Actually, he was driving me crazy.

Creasy disappears back inside. Pinta smiles big before
letting the stick drop to the ground.

                          PINTA
             I got you to talk, Creasy bear.

Blue Bayou plays.   Pinta now listens to Creasy's sound.

                          RONSTADT
             "...I'm so lonesome all the time, since I
             left my baby behind, on Blue Bayou."

EXT.   RAMOS VILLA - DAY

A DRIVER gets Samuel's and Lisa's luggage into a car.
They're on their way, kissing Pinta goodbye.

                          LISA
             I'll call you from Detroit, baby.

                          PINTA
             You're going to miss Mexican Halloween.
             The Day of the Dead.

                          SAMUEL
             You enjoy it for us, Pinta.

Lisa gives her a look. Don't make this harder than it has
to be. Finally, Pinta nods.

Creasy waits quite a discreet distance away by the
Mercedes. She steps over, stops to wave goodbye one last
time, then gets in back. As Creasy shuts the door.

INT.   MERCEDES - MEXICO CITY ROAD - DAY

Creasy drives, glances in the mirror at Pinta in the back
seat. She wipes away a tear just as it forms.

                          CREASY
             They'll be back in a week.

                          PINTA
             They can stay for two weeks.   I don't
             care.

She's got a toughness Creasy likes.   As she looks out the
window, he looks ahead.

INT.   KITCHEN - RAMOS VILLA - DAY

Creasy eats.

                            CREASY
               The food is excellent, Maria.     You have a
               real talent.

Maria beams with pleasure.

                            MARIA
               My pleasure, Creasy.

Pinta enters  in a RED SATIN DEVIL'S OUTFIT. She looks a
bit forlorn  as she sits at opposite ends of the table
from Creasy.   As she stares at her plate, Creasy starts
to laugh at  what an odd sight she is. All dressed up and
no place to  go.

Wrong move. Pinta stands, marches out of the room.        As
Maria and Creasy exchange a look...

EXT./INT.   WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY

Pinta the devil stares sadly out here window. Then there
it is! The macaw. Sitting on the opposite roof.

EXT.   ATTIC WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY

Pinta pushes it open, climbs out onto the slope of the
roof. This doesn't look like such a good idea. As she
crosses, disappears over the peak.

It's a game of catch me if you can. 'Bird' looks at
Pinta right in the eye. She gingerly moves closer. The
bird moves away, just out of her reach each time.

CHIMNEY

Pinta coming down the other slope.      There's the macaw.

                             PINTA
               Come on.   Come on.   Bird!

The fourth time Pinta's fingers are centimeters away.
She reaches and suddenly slides along the slick tile
covering this section of the roof. Frank's in the yard
barking loudly.

Near the edge, she manages to stop.      Whew!

She scrambles up a few feet. A tile snaps off. She
slides again. This time right off the edge.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      40.


She catches the rain gutter. Hangs thirty feet above the
ground. A concrete landing below. As the gutter creaks:

INT.   KITCHEN - DAY

                           PINTA'S VOICE
             CREASY!

Creasy is on his feet, out the door in a heartbeat.

EXT.   SIDE YARD - DAY

Creasy dashes around just as the gutter drops on one
side. Pinta drops ten feet, jerks to a stop as the
gutter stops, then drops the last twenty feet...

...landing in a hedge.   Creasy dashes over.

                           CREASY
             Pinta!

She's in a lot of pain, but moving her arms and head.
Frank's licking her face.

                           PINTA
             It hurts.

                           CREASY
             Where?

                          PINTA
                    (Short)
             Everywhere!

She puts her hands to the left side of her ribs.     Creasy
carefully probes with his fingers. She winces.

                          CREASY
             I don't think they're broken.     Anywhere
             else?

                           PINTA
             My ankle.

As Maria huffs and puffs her way up.

                          CREASY
             I'm going to get you out, okay?

Pinta nods. Creasy eases his arms under, around her,
lifts her out as gently as possible. She disappears in
his arms.

                             PINTA
             Oh, Creasy...

And she bursts into tears. Maria looks up at the thirty
foot fall. Begins to cross herself.

                            CREASY
             It's okay.    She's just scared.

Creasy cradles her, pats her back.      As Pinta says his
name like a mantra...

INT.   HOTEL ROOM - DETROIT - NIGHT

Lisa on the phone. Fantastic in a black evening dress.
The Ford car industry dinner awaits her entrance.

                          LISA
             You're sure she's alright?

Samuel enters from the bathroom, concern on his face.

                            LISA
             Okay, good,   you're sure.
                    (to   Samuel)
             He took her   for an X-ray, but it's just a
             bruise and   a sprain.

She turns her back so Samuel can zip her dress up.

                          LISA
             Thank you, Creasy.      Give her my love.

INT.   STAIRCASE - RAMOS VILLA - NIGHT

Creasy makes his way up, enters...

PINTA'S BEDROOM

Pinta in bed propped up by a pillow, teddy bear beside
her. Frank at the head of the bed.

                          PINTA
             The night you arrived, Mom asked you if
             you had a family and you lied, didn't
             you?

                          CREASY
             White lie. I didn't have a family. But
             I did have two kids. They're adults now.

It's a sensitive subject so Pinta moves on.      She nods.
Creasy looks at the bear. An odd beat.

                          CREASY
             Do you always sleep with him?

                          PINTA
             I'm too old for him.     Don't tell my
             friends.

                          CREASY
             I don't talk to them much.     Does he have
             a name?

Pinta thinks just a beat, then shakes her head 'no'.
Liar.

                          CREASY
             I spoke to your mother.     She sends her
             love.

Pinta nods. Creasy stands there a beat, then heads for
the door. Almost out, he looks back.

                           CREASY
             Some bodyguard I turned out to be.       Good
             night, Pinta.

He's halfway out the door.

                           PINTA
             Creasy?   Could you play the song?

Creasy is confused a moment, but when he sees her open
window, he realizes.

                           CREASY
             Blue Bayou.   You got it.

He goes.   As Pinta eases back with a sigh and a smile...

EXT.   MERCEDES - RAMOS HOUSE - DAY

Pedro the 'car wash guy' puts the finishing touches to
the Mercedes.

Using crutches, Pinta hobbles over. Creasy opens the
back door for her. But when she gets there, she
hesitates.

                          PINTA
             I think I'll sit in the front.     There's
             more room for my foot.

Creasy makes no big deal of it. He takes her crutches,
opens the front. As she scoots inside... Frank waits
and watches. Creasy calls to him.

                          PINTA
             He's only allowed to travel in the car on
             weekends. Dad says the car will smell
             'doggie'.

INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY

Both of them up front. Pinta is happy to be there and
Creasy doesn't seem to mind.

                          CREASY
             Did you sleep alright?

                            PINTA
             Yes.

                          CREASY
             How's the ankle? Can you put your weight
             on it?

                            PINTA
             It's   not too bad. Will it take a long
             time   before it's better? Our big swim
             meet   is in three weeks. Interschools.
             I was   going to swim in the one hundred
             meter   freestyle.

                          CREASY
             In a week you should be fine.

They drive on a few silent beats, until...

                          PINTA
             Doesn't matter. I always finish second.

                          CREASY
             You need to practice.

Pinta looks at him hopefully, but Creasy catches himself.
He's not going to coach a little girl. Finally...

                            PINTA
             I will.

INT.   KITCHEN - RAMOS VILLA - EVENING

Gomez, Maria and Creasy again joined by Pinta.    As Creasy
places a fork of meat into his mouth...

                          PINTA
             Creasy, what's a concubine?

Creasy opens his mouth, takes the fork of meat back out.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   44.


                         CREASY
            Why do you ask?

                         PINTA
            It was in a book at school.   Concubine.

Maria and Gomez wait to see how he'll answer.

                         CREASY
            Well, it's a sort of wife.

                         PINTA
            But the Emperor of China had 1000 of
            them! How can that be?

                         CREASY
            In the West, it's one wife for one
            husband, but different cultures have
            different rules.

                         PINTA
            It must be difficult having lots of
            wives.

                         CREASY
            You feel sorry for the husband?

                         PINTA
                   (in Spanish)
            Yeah. Can you imagine my mother
            multiplied by a thousand?

Maria and Gomez burst out laughing. So funny that Creasy
smiles. Pinta lights up at the sight. A huge victory.

                         PINTA
            Creasy, you're smiling.

He reverts to a frown. Now Pinta bursts out laughing.
And Creasy can't help but smile again.

                            CREASY
            I guess I am.

Pinta changes subject.

                         PINTA
            So how come you know so much about those
            countries?

                         CREASY
            I had to do my homework on them when I
            worked there. Also I enjoy history.

                          PINTA
             What did you do in Asia? Is that where
             you met the man with cigarettes?

                          CREASY
             No, that was in Columbia.

A MAN'S HAND.   BLACK.

Raises up against the blue sky. Like a kid playing
Cowboys and Indians. The finger pulls an imaginary
trigger.

RAMOS POOL

In her swimsuit and cap, Pinta crouches in makeshift
starting blocks.

                            CREASY
             Bang!

Pinta takes off. Splashes into the water.     Not to
Creasy's satisfaction.

                          CREASY
             No, no, come back.

Pinta turns in the water, looks back at him.

                          CREASY
             You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you
             react. You go. Don't listen for the
             sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate
             on the sound itself.

                          PINTA
             I don't understand.

                            CREASY
             Don't worry.    You will.

Creasy points at the blocks.    Pinta gets out of the
water.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  46.


Shivering, Creasy throws a towel around her and
rubs her down.

INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING

On the way to school. Pinta is stealing looks at
Creasy's right hand. She knows the answer must be
serious, but she has to ask.

                          PINTA
             Creasy, what happened to your hand?

Creasy looks at her a moment, deciding. Pinta
practically holds her breath, watches him, knows the
answer may come. Creasy checks the mirror, watches the
road.

                          CREASY
             A man asked me questions once.   He smoked
             a lot. There was no ashtray.

That's it. End of explanation. Creasy continues
watching the road. Pinta watches him.

                          CREASY
             Remember you asked me what state I was
             from?

                            PINTA
             Yes.

                          CREASY
             Where you're from isn't so much about
             geography; it's about events. Where
             you're from is what happened to you.

                          PINTA
             Good things happen, too, Creasy.
                    (smiles big)
             Like meeting me.

                          CREASY
                    (after a beat)
             I guess that really does make me a hard
             case.

As the two of them share a LAUGH...

INT.   3RD FLOOR HALLWAY - RAMOS VILLA - NIGHT

Lisa walking toward Creasy's room. As she moves to
knock, she sees the door is ajar, hears voices. She
peeks in.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     47.


Creasy and Pinta sit on the floor, pencils, papers and a
book spread out before them. Doing her history homework.

LISA'S POV - OF CREASY

He's charming and great with Pinta.     And sexy... Evelyn
was right.

                          PINTA
             Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?

                           CREASY
             No.

                          PINTA
             Did you used to?

                           CREASY
             Yeah.   Two or three.

Lisa continues to watch the little play. She smiles,
knocks on the door as she opens it. Pinta and Creasy
both look back over their shoulders.

                          LISA
             Creasy, tomorrow, after you drop off
             Pinta, could you come back to take me to
             get my hair done?

Creasy nods. They both continue to look at her.      She
gets the feeling she's interrupting.

                          LISA
             Alright, I'll leave you two to your
             history.

As she goes...

EXT.   HAIRDRESSERS - ZONA ROSA - DAY

Mexico City traffic is heavy. Cars and people. Creasy
stands by the car across the street. Cooling his heels.
He can just catch a glimpse of Lisa in the shop.

Suddenly the traffic seems to finish, expending itself.
The street goes ominously quiet. Creasy's antennae go
up.

A police car comes prowling down the empty street.
Creasy makes eye contact with the guys up front.

Then, Creasy spots a BUSINESSMAN coming out of a doorway
with a BODYGUARD attached. The bodyguard is speaking
into a two-way radio.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    48.


Creasy's sixth sense tweaks as a Mercedes 500 pulls up to
collect the businessman.

And the cop car disappears around the corner even as TWO
MEN start toward the businessman.

Lisa exits the hairdresser's.    Looks stunning.

Creasy starts across the street toward her.

A second car squeals around the corner behind the
Mercedes and everything goes to Hell.

GUNFIRE erupts.

And then Creasy is there.

His arm around Lisa's waist, sweeping her off her feet.
The next thing she knows she flattened on the ground in a
shop doorway, Creasy on top of her. Shielding her.

The bodyguard beside the businessman is killed. The body
guard in the Mercedes trades a full magazine before he's
shot.

A PEDESTRIAN is killed.

Liza screams as the glass above and behind them shatters.

The businessman is hustled into the back of the second
car.

Lisa sees the gun in Creasy's hands.

She hears the slamming of the car door, the screeching of
tires. A parked VAN also hauling ass out of there. But
then she's aware of something else.

Creasy on top of her.   She feels his weight, his heat...

                            CREASY
             Don't move.

She watches as he rises, goes to the curb. One bodyguard
is sprawled dead across the ground. Red blood on the
sidewalk. As Lisa closes her eyes.

INT.   MERCEDES - STREET - DAY

Lisa sits in the backseat. Through the window we can see
Creasy wrap up his statement to a member of the JUDICIAL
POLICE. Finally he gets in the car, starts to drive.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      49.


                          LISA
             Murdering people in the street... You
             had your gun, why didn't you shoot them?

The shoulders in front of her just shrug.

                          CREASY
             Nothing to do with me. Or you. Besides,
             there was another one in the passenger
             side of the van with a sawed-off shotgun.
             If I'd started shooting his friends, he
             would've had me. And you.

Quiet a beat. Lisa pulls a sliver of glass from her
hair, looks from it to Creasy.

                          CREASY
             A minimum close protection team consists
             of four men for high threat targets and
             environments. Even in a low threat
             situation, you need two guards plus a
             security trained driver.

She shakes involuntarily. It's hitting her.      As they
make eye contact through the mirror...

EXT.   HIGHWAY UNDERPASS - MEXICO CITY - DAY

The Mercedes parked. Creasy and Lisa up against it.
Fucking. No cultured way to put it. Like animals. A
primal release for both of them.

EXT.   COURTYARD - PINTA'S SCHOOL - DAY

Pinta waiting alone. Creasy's late. Then the gate
swings back; the Mercedes drives through. Smiling, she
hurries over, hops in the passenger seat.

MERCEDES - ROLLING

                          PINTA
                    (happy to see him)
             You're late.

                           CREASY
             I'm sorry.

                          PINTA
             You were never late before, I was
             worried.

Creasy doesn't answer.    He actually looks guilty.   Pinta
watches him a moment.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    50.


                          PINTA
             Where's my mother?

                          CREASY
             I dropped her at home.

                          PINTA
             It's no wonder you're late.      Why didn't
             she just come with you?

Creasy doesn't answer, just grunts. Pinta keeps looking
at him and it suddenly all makes sense.

He looks over at her, starts to say something, then
thinks better of it. Finally...

                          PINTA
             Do you think my mother likes you?

She's for sure pissed. Definitely aware and definitely
jealous. Creasy's a bit amazed, not sure how to respond.

                          CREASY
             I think she's afraid of me.      But not the
             same way most people are.

Pinta considers this.   Then..

                          PINTA
             I'm not afraid you, Creasy.

                          CREASY
             I know you're not.

                          PINTA
             Are you afraid of me?

Creasy looks at her, almost like he's deciding.

                             CREASY
             I used to be.     At first.   But not
             anymore.

Her smile is huge.

                             PINTA
             Good.

Heated. Steam rising off the water. PINTA stands with
her eyes closed. Creasy, standing beside her, brings TWO
BLOCKS together with a WHACK!

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       51.


Pinta flinches at the sound. She opens her eyes, shrugs
an apology at him. Creasy frowns, shakes his head.
Pinta closes her eyes again. He starts walking around
her. Frank oversees the whole program.

                          CREASY
             The gunshot holds no fear.    Say it.

                          PINTA
             The gunshot holds no fear.

                          CREASY
             You welcome the sound. The sound is what
             lets you go. The sound is what frees
             you. You are a prisoner in those blocks
             until you hear the sound.

Eyes closed, she's drifted off with his voice. And
Creasy WHACKS them together right in front of her face.

Pinta smiles at the sound.     Creasy smiles at the sight.

EXT.   RAMOS POOL - DAY

WHACK!   Pinta bolts from the blocks.    SPLASHES.

WHACK! WHACK! WHACK! Pinta surges.      Pinta arcs.    Pinta
knifes into the water.

Pinta touches the far wall of the pool, the finish line.
Creasy checks his watch, claps.

                          PINTA
             I'm tough, Creasy.    I'm tough as you.

                          CREASY
             There's no such thing as tough.    You're
             either trained or untrained.

Pinta raises her arms overhead, makes like Rocky across
the shallow end. Creasy shakes his head in amusement.

INT.   LISA'S BEDROOM - DAWN

First light is just tracing outlines against the window.
Lisa alone in bed, staring at the ceiling. Frightened at

As the Mercedes pulls in, another car is ahead of it.
Samuel is home, a DRIVER pulls his LUGGAGE from the
trunk.

Pinta gets out of the Mercedes.

                           PINTA
             Hi, Dad.

He gives her a pat on the head. Simultaneously, Samuel
fixes Creasy with a look, strides purposefully over. He
thrusts out his hand, shakes Creasy's.

                          SAMUEL
             I want to thank you, Creasy.   For what
             you did for my wife.

Creasy wants to choke, but he just nods, looks past
Samuel to Pinta who looks bemused. He doesn't even want
to know exactly what she knows.

The Car Wash Guy, - Pedro, ingratiates himself with
Samuel.

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Creasy's finger presses play. "Blue Bayou" begins.
Plaintive, haunting. As he moves to sit in his chair, he
passes the scotch bottle. It has gone unopened.

He ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, smoothly
catches it on the back of his hand. Rock steady.
Frank's tail wags.

EXT.   PARKING LOT - MUNICIPAL POOL - DAY

The big swim meet. Race day. A lot of security, men
speaking into their wrists. For a public gathering the
mood almost seems ominous. Creasy and Pinta exit the
Mercedes. Pinta watches wistfully as her fellow STUDENTS
stream toward the water with their PARENTS.

             What's so important in Los Angeles?

                          CREASY
             Your father has business.

                            PINTA
             Why today?    And why'd she have to go with
             him?

Creasy shrugs. No comforting answer for her.     He looks
around at some of the other bodyguards.

                          CREASY
             Good luck. I'll be waiting here when
             you're done.

But she's shaking her head adamantly.    Determined.

                          PINTA
             You're coming with me.

EXT.   SWIMMING MEET - MUNICIPAL POOL - DAY

A big MARQUEE has been set up alongside the pool.
Coltish girls in swimsuits. Parents socialize, drink
cocktails. Richly dressed. Bodyguards and security are
outside of it, on the perimeter.

Creasy looks completely out of place.

                          PINTA
             Stand near the finish line.

Pinta starts away.

                            CREASY
             Pinta.

She turns, looks back at him.

                            CREASY
            The blocks.

                         PINTA
                   (smiles; knows)
            I'm a prisoner in them.    Until the
            gunshot sets me free.

Creasy nods. He smiles. He's serious now. As he
watches her head off for the track, Sister Anna steps up.

                         SISTER ANNA
            Mr. Creasy, nice to see you.

And now Creasy is completely out of place.

                         CREASY
                   (apologetic)
            Pinta's parents are in Los Angeles.      I
            was going to wait in the courtyard,
            but...

She takes his arm, pats his hand.

                         SISTER ANNA
            Today you are her father.

As Creasy lets this sink   in, looks out where Pinta is
warming up. Sister  Anna   smiles, heads off to a group of
parents. We're left  with   Creasy. Confused Creasy. But
clarity is creeping in.    As the sky opens up around
him...

                                                   CUT TO:

STARTER'S PISTOL

Pointed up at precisely 45 degrees.    BAAAANGG!

STARTING BLOCKS

Eyes closed serenely, Pinta surges forward, leaving
everyone behind.

CREASY

Sees it. She hasn't even hit the water and he already
knows she's won.

PINTA

SPLASH! Ten meters in before she breaks the surface.
Her head sweeping left and then right.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   55.


Wherever her competitors are, it's somewhere behind her.
And the future, everything ahead, is wide open.

TURN WALL - UNDERWATER

Pinta somersaults, kicks off and is gone.

SURFACE

And the finish line seems to come to her.

THE CROWD

Cheers enthusiastically as she reaches the finish wall.

CREASY

Watches her, satisfied with what he's done.

Pinta hauls herself out of the water and runs.

A beeline for Creasy. And the poor fucker doesn't even
understand, until she's leaping the last few feet...

Into his arms.

                          PINTA
             I won, Creasy! I won!

She loves him...   Creasy hugs her.   He loves her back.

INT.   TRADITIONAL RESTAURANT - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT

A MARIACHI BAND roams. We see Creasy but not who he's
with. A date? As we come around it's Pinta. Sitting
with them, Rayburn and his wife. And a sleeping four-
year-old.

NOTE: Rethink following dialogue with reference to
Creasy / Rayburn background.

                          PINTA
             My Dad said all your friends were dead.

                          RAYBURN
             All but one. The most important one.
             When we were eighteen, we made an
             agreement to "take the world" together.

                          CREASY
             Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in
             love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said
             what happened to the plan?

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    56.


                         RAYBURN
            I said the plan was right here.

Rayburn looks at beautiful 19-year-old Alicia and their
four-year-old son sleeping.

                         CREASY
            I hung up on him. When I met Alicia, I
            got it.

Alicia blows Creasy a kiss.

                         CREASY
            Can I kiss her now, or after you've gone
            to bed?

Laughter.

                         PINTA
            Okay, I think now is as good as time as
            any.

She takes out a velvet pouch from her pocket. She holds
it out to Creasy. He looks at her, takes it from her
hand. His thick fingers fumble with a delicate
drawstring.

Pinta waits for his reaction as Creasy pours a simple,
but fine MEDALLION and chain into the palm of his hand.

                         PINTA
            I bought it with my own money.     I saved
            it.

Creasy is really affected, tries to hide it.    She takes
it, slips it over his head.

                         PINTA
            It's St. Jude, the patron saint of lost
            causes.

                         RAYBURN
            And hard cases. Creasy's the reason St.
            Jude became a Saint in the first place.

                         PINTA
            Yeah, that's right.

Creasy looks at it, considers.

                         CREASY
            Thank you, Pinta, it's beautiful.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  57.


Pinta kisses him. As the Mariachi band drifts over,
Rayburn grabs his wife by the hand.

                          RAYBURN
             Come on, baby. I feel like a third
             wheel. Watch the kid.

They dance. A waiter steps over, refills Creasy's water
glass. As he drinks...

                          PINTA
             Could I ask you a question?

                          CREASY
             Could I stop you?

                          PINTA
             You don't drink like you used to.

                          CREASY
             That's not a question.

                          PINTA
             I know because I go in your room and
             check the bottles.

                          CREASY
             Still not a question.

                          PINTA
             My mom drinks, too...    Why do people
             drink, Creasy?

                          CREASY
             Now that's a question. I don't know
             about your Mom. For me, the problem
             isn't in the glass. The problem's in
             between my ears.

                          PINTA
             You think too much?

                           CREASY
             Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't
             think enough.

Pinta nods, thinks she understands.

INT.   AIRPORT - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Samuel and Lisa on the moving escalator. Home from Los
Angeles. They look down through the glass, see Creasy
waiting for them below. And finally, Lisa frowns.

            He has to go, Samuel.

            What?   Who?

                            LISA
            Creasy.

                           SAMUEL
            Why?    You were so pleased with him.

                         LISA
            Pinta likes him too much.
                   (a beat)
            She thinks of him as a father.

                         SAMUEL
            That's ridiculous.

                            LISA
            It's not.

Samuel thinks about it, is almost apologetic.

                         SAMUEL
            I've just been so busy, Lisa.

                            LISA
            He has to go.

Samuel looks at her, wonders at her adamancy.

                         SAMUEL
            The three month trial ends in a week. I
            just won't confirm the position. That
            possibility was understood when I hired
            him.

Lisa gives him a look. She wants it done today.     But for
once, Samuel is stronger than his wife.

                         SAMUEL
            I won't create bad feelings. And another
            week won't make a difference.

Off the escalator, they turn toward Creasy waiting
unaware.

                         SAMUEL
            It will be a hard break.

             I wasn't thinking of Pinta.

smiling big.

             will play.

As Pinta marches out of the room...

EXT. RAMOS VILLA- DAY

The sounds of Samuel's baby grand resonates throughout
the villa. An impassioned rendering of a Mozart
symphony.

Pinta is looking for Frank. Today is Saturday and on
weekends Frank is allowed to travel with them. And today
she is claiming all her rights.

             Frank.   Frankie.

Pinta whistles.

             You should break all my fingers, Creasy,
             then tape them back together. I won't be
             able to play the piano, but I could still
             swim.

                          CREASY
             Don't be a baby. You're tougher than
             that.

                          PINTA
             There's no such thing as tough, Creasy.

             Be a swimmer.

                          PINTA
             I could do it. Remember the day   you
             wanted the pencil? I know why.    And I
             saw that car again. I wrote the   license
             number in my notebook. Except I   missed
             the last number.

Creasy checks his mirror, nothing back there now.     He
then looks at Pinta. A bit amazed.

                          CREASY
             You'll have to show me that number when
             we get home.

EXT.   VIA BUENOS AIRES - MEXICO CITY - DAY

A wide avenue. The Mercedes pulls up parks in the only
open spot. Creasy and Pinta get out. We walks her
across the street, along the lawn to the apartment
building. They look up at the sound of piano keys
tinkling above. Then:

Creasy looks at her, smiles to himself.   Pinta looks
back.

                          CREASY

            You'll be back in the water in twenty-
            four hours.

Creasy presses the buzzer. As they wait, Pinta sees
something, reaches down to pull a DANDELION from a crack
where the sidewalk meets the wall. She smiles at Creasy.

                         PINTA
            For you, Creasy.

Creasy takes it from her. He's saved by the bell as a
second buzzer answers the first. Creasy pulls the door
open. Pinta heaves a resigned sigh.

                         CREASY
            Remember 'dyslexic.'

As Pinta nods, disappears inside...

                                               DISSOLVE TO:

2ND FLOOR WINDOW

The curtains rustle in the breeze. The sound of badly
played scales. And then sounds of frustration.

Then, the sound of the teacher playing.   Pinta appears in
the window for just a moment.

CREASY

Looking up from the window of the Mercedes. As Pinta is
called back inside, Creasy checks out, twirls the
dandelion Pinta gave him. HUMS to himself. "Blue
Bayou."

                                               CUT TO:

THE STREET

Creasy leaning against the Mercedes. Traffic pounding
by. The dandelion is stuck in a button hole of his
shirt.

And then suddenly traffic thins out. Reminiscent of the
previous two kidnappings. It's a process. Creasy
straightens up.

A Judicial POLICE CAR cruises by, slowly. Creasy makes
eye contact with the two cops up front. The same guys
who were at Zona Rosa.

Creasy starts across the street toward the apartment
building. At the same time as...

The door bangs open. Pinta exiting. She spots Creasy, a
huge grin on her face. She was not accepted.

And a white TOYOTA COROLLA coming the other way.

The police car reverses back, cutting Creasy off from
Pinta. The COPS getting out, big smiles on their faces.

THE COROLLA

Slides to a stop in front of Pinta, blocking her path to
Creasy. And as TWO MEN leap out from the backseat...

                           CREASY
                     (drawing his 9mm)
              Run, Pinta, run!

But she's rooted with fear.

And the men are almost on her.

Creasy raises the 9mm overhead.    BANG!

And the sound frees her.   Pinta runs!

Ducking under a flailing arm.    Quick and lithe.   Trying
to reach her bodyguard.

The cops drawing Uzi's..

Creasy plants himself, the Sig Sauer now level.     He fires
twice into COP ONE, dead center in the chest.

Pinta runs.   Chased by the TWO MEN.

COP TWO returns fire wildly: the Mercedes hit in a ten
bullet line.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                        63.


Creasy fires two more rounds into COP TWO who's hit high
in the chest and throat. Precise.

Creasy pivots, strides calmly forward, firing at the men
chasing Pinta. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

MAN ONE goes down, hit in the ribs.

A bullet slams Creasy in the back, fired from inside the
Corolla.

Creasy fires back.    BOOM!    BOOM!

MAN THREE falls dead, hit just below his nose, just above
his teeth. The FAT DRIVER fires, now, and Creasy is hit
in the shoulder.

And Pinta disappears into the traffic.        Gone.

MAN TWO, who has abandoned chasing Pinta, fires again.

Creasy drops the 9mm as he is hit in the stomach.      He
falls to his knees.

The dandelion starts to come apart.      Drifting away, piece
by piece.

Slack-jawed, Creasy looks about. Sees the FAT DRIVER
heaving himself out of the Corolla while MAN TWO scans
for Pinta who's nowhere in sight.

She got away!   Creasy smiles even as he crumples over on
his side.

                              PINTA'S VOICE
            CREASY!

And Pinta is back. Running toward Creasy. She can't
leave him like this. She was safe and now she's back.

                              CREASY
            NOOO...

She runs to him, wraps her arms around him.

                              PINTA
            Creasy...

MAN TWO catches up, tears Pinta away, starts back for the
sedan. Creasy can only blink after them.

                            CREASY
              Pinta...

MAN TWO crams her in the back seat, follows. The fat
driver gets back in behind the wheel. As the door slams
shut, wheels spin, grip and the Corolla accelerates away.

We just see Pinta look back through the rear windshield.
An anguished image before she's pulled back down.

Creasy makes a wish.     Not for himself, but for her.

                           CREASY
              Don't die, Creasy, don't die.

And everything goes very, very,

INT.    HOSPITAL ROOM - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Creasy hooked up. Tubes running in and out of the
unconscious man. And he's suddenly surrounded.

The CHIEF of the Judicial Police and several uniformed
OFFICERS. At the foot of the bed several NEWSPAPER
REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS.

                           CHIEF
              This man, Senor Robert Creasy, an
              American citizen, is under arrest for the
              murder of two police officers, Hector
              Gonzalez and Pablo Lunara. He is also
              the prime suspect in the kidnapping of
              Pinta Martin Ramos.

One of the officers props up Creasy's head.     The chief
puffs his chest out and flashes flash.

INT.   SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - DAY

A bedraggled-looking Samuel sits with Jordan by the

Maria cries softly in a doorway.

MONTAGE - of chaos and panic. Judicial police are trying

Video cameras.

             amount they expect...

They react as two vehicles pull up outside. Chaos as the
front door opens. MEN IN SUITS, several POLICEMEN.
Their very well-groomed leader is COLONEL TAZINARI.

                          TAZINARI
             Senor Ramos. I am Ernesto Tazinari,
             commandante of the Judicial anti-
             kidnapping division.

                          JORDAN
             We do not need or want police
             involvement. I am the negotiator. We
             feel a better guarantee of getting Pinta
             back without your involvement.

                           TAZINARI
             I have a written order from the Public
             Ministry. Two police officers were
             killed.
                     (he holds up the phone)
             This is the Attorney General Navarro

              The law requires an intervention by the
              authorities "de officio."

A ringing phone sounds like an bomb exploding in the
room. A technician answers. Jordan takes the receiver.
We hear the conversation. The kidnapper only wants to
talk to the father. Everybody is one headsets,
monitoring. Samuel listens carefully. Jordan prompts
him with hand-written replies on a notepad. Samuel
negotiates the amount via notes from his lawyer.

QUICK CUTS:

                           SAMUEL
              It's impossible. I cannot afford thirty
              million. I will need to borrow the
              money.

Samuel proposes five million.   Kidnapper gets angry.
Demands 20 million.

They settle at ten million.   The kidnapper gives a list
of instructions.

Another showcase press conference.     More REPORTERS and

                           CHIEF
              The girl is a Mexican citizen. Her
              father is Samuel Valencia Ramos.

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - WINDOW OVERLOOKING PRESS
CONFERENCE

Rosanna, the woman we saw on T.V. earlier, stands
watching and listening. Incredulous and angry.

MIGUEL MANZANO the Director of AFI (also seen earlier
on TV), approaches with his two assistants and kisses
Rosanna on the cheek.

                           ROSANNA
              A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a
              9 year old. The bodyguard's American.
              Not only that he's black.

                           MANZANO
              Is that good or bad?

                           ROSANNA
              That's good. Really good. He shot and
              killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper
              died in the attack. They're saying he's
              responsible.

Manzano looks bemused, as he eats a sugary pastry.
Rosanna heads into the press conference.

INT.   ENTRY LOBBY - HOSPITAL - DAY

                           REPORTER ONE
              Beside the American in custody, are any
              other Americans involved in the
              kidnapping?

                           CHIEF
              We're looking into it.

Rosanna can't believe what she's hearing.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   68.


                          ROSANNA
             The two officers who were killed.
             Records show they were off duty at the
             time.

The Chief frowns at the sight of Rosanna, knows what a
royal pain in the ass she is. Manzano awaits his answer.

                             CHIEF
             I'm not sure.     All I know is they died
             bravely.

He turns, points out another reporter.

                          ROSANNA
             If they were off duty, why were they in a
             patrol car? What exactly were they doing
             at the scene of a kidnapping?

He stares back over at her, furious.     Rosanna smiles.

                          ROSANNA
             Were they known for their exceptional
             good luck?

It opens and out slides Rayburn. He looks down the
hallway. Press conference is still going down that way.
Rayburn heads the other way.

But as he tries to enter Creasy's room, he's met in the
door by TWO THUG COPS, in uniform.

                             COP ONE
             No visitors.

Cop two pokes a finger into Rayburn's chest.

             Who are you?

                          RAYBURN
             I'm here to see my friend.

Cop two pokes him again.     Goading him.

Rayburn swallows his anger, starts fishing for his
wallet. Suddenly, the thugs snap to attention. Manzano
is on the way down followed by ADJUTANT and TWO
PLAINCLOTHES.

Ignoring the proffered salutes, Manzano finishes his
pastry, licks his fingertips as he regards Rayburn.

                          MANZANO
             When I heard it was this hospital I was
             so pleased. There's a pastry shop
             nearby. Delgado's. Do you know it?

Rayburn shakes his head.

                          MANZANO
             The best pastries in Mexico.

Manzano holds out his right hand.

Creasy out of it still.    Rayburn and Manzano at the foot
of the bed.

                          RAYBURN
             He's not a cop killer.

                          MANZANO
             I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly
             adept at killing.

                          RAYBURN
             He was doing his job, protecting the
             girl. If police were involved, you
             figure it out. I'm here for him.

                           MANZANO
             So am I.

And Creasy stirs.   Rayburn leans into his friend, Manzano
just behind him.

                          RAYBURN
             You hear me, Crease?

Creasy's eyes slit open.

                          RAYBURN (CONT'D)

Cages of mangy looking mutts. Pull back to reveal Creasy

Rayburn sits nearby. He looks up as Creasy stirs, wakes
again. Creasy's eyes flicker to his friend, ask the
first question on his mind. Pinta...

Rayburn looks away, can't face his friend.   And suddenly,
Creasy knows.

                           CREASY
             She's dead.   Isn't she?

Rayburn finally nods. And with that gesture, God takes
everything away. It might as well be the Old Testament.
And we are about to get Biblical.

Creasy turns his head, looks up at the ceiling.

                          RAYBURN
             It was a fuck up. Someone hijacked the

                          NURSE
             A strange man. He has much experience of
             hospitals.

                          MANZANO
             Did he say so?

                           NURSE
             No.   But a nurse knows.

MUGSHOT

Manzano and the adjutant have pulled chairs up alongside
the bed. The adjutant flips through one of the binders.
Each page holds a single MUGSHOT. Each time Creasy
shakes his head, the adjutant flips to the next photo.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   75.


                           MANZANO
            Nothing?

Creasy shakes his head.

                         MANZANO
            Excellent work by the way. Three men
            dead. Only ten rounds fired.

Creasy shakes his head at the next shot.

                         MANZANO
            If two of the men in my division could
            shoot like that, I could get rid of the
            other thirty-six.

One of the dogs starts to bark. Another. Soon ten of
them. The VET ASSISTANT enters, shouts at them to quiet.
Manzano ignores it, motions the adjutant to flip pages.

                         CREASY
            What am I doing here?

                         MANZANO
            Believe it or not, you're safe here. The
            Judicial police will kill you. If they
            can.
                   (re: book)
            This page?

                           CREASY
            No.

The adjutant reaches the last page.   Creasy shakes his
head.

                         MANZANO
            You have a rather checkered past. Mr.
            Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages
            long.

                         CREASY
            Am I a suspect?

                          MANZANO
            No.   It would be convenient, but no.

As Manzano packs up his mugshot books...

                         CREASY
            Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen.
            Maybe then we'll get somewhere.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     76.


                          MANZANO
             All these photos you just saw were of
             policemen. Sadly they're protected. La
             Hermanidad. The brotherhood.

Manzano heads off.   As Creasy watches after him...

INT.   DOG PENS - NIGHT

Creasy sitting on the gurney, Rayburn buttons his shirt.

                           RAYBURN
                     (whispers)
             Okay?

Creasy nods. Rayburn gets Creasy's arm over his
shoulder, eases him off the gurney till his feet hit the
floor.

Creasy winces, but the two of them start to walk out.

EXT.   BACK SIDE - VETERINARIAN CLINIC - NIGHT

An SUV rolling away. Lights out, engine off. It coasts
a hundred yards before the engine turns over. Rayburn
behind the wheel. As it sweeps past camera...

INT.   SUV - ROLLING - NIGHT

Rayburn constantly checking the rear view.   No pursuit in
sight. He looks over at Creasy.

                          RAYBURN
             How do you feel?

Creasy looks over at him, finally shrugs.

                          CREASY
             Stomach's gone. But... okay.

                          RAYBURN
             I'll get you up to the border. Friend of
             mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop
             you right at the hospital.

Creasy's not really listening. He's been looking in the
passenger side view mirror. Nothing back there. Creasy
sits up. A bit of an effort.

                          CREASY
             Got a thing I gotta do first.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       77.


EXT.   VIA BUENOS AIRES - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Scene of the crime. Typical Mexican 'roadside shrines'
where the policemen fell. A pyre of flowers where Pinta
was scooped up, Creasy's blood still staining the
sidewalk alongside. A car pulls up...

Rosanna Guerrero gets out with a REPORTER and
PHOTOGRAPHER. She directs them in Spanish. The reporter
starts making notes; the photographer snaps photos of the
shrine.

Rosanna stands by the flower pyre. Something catches her
eye. A balled-up piece of paper and a half-burned candle
beside it. As she picks it up, she spots something else.

Across the street, Creasy walks. An awkward hitch in his
stride. Outside the apartment of the piano teacher,
surveying the scene with experienced eyes. Unaware of
Rosanna

CREASY (FLASHBACK)

Corolla.   Muzzle flashes.    Pinta screaming...

                             FEMALE VOICE
             Creasy...

Creasy wheels.   There's Rosanna.

                          ROSANNA
             A lot of people are looking for you.

                          CREASY
             I guess that makes you the smart one.

                          ROSANNA
             We're interested in the same thing.         I'm
             writing a story.

Creasy walks away from her.     Rosanna catches up and holds
out a plastic ziploc.

                          ROSANNA
             This might interest you.       I found it
             across the street.

Creasy empties the contents of the ziplock into his hand.
A small ball of paper and the remains of a black candle.
Creasy unballs the paper. It's a photo.

FLASH:   Creasy at the police station.      His photo taken.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     78.


                             ROSANNA
               It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The
               religion of La Hermanidad. There's a
               curse on you.

                            CREASY
               It's a little late.

He hands it back to her, not interested.    As he turns to
go.

                            ROSANNA
               What are you going to do?

Creasy doesn't answer.

                            ROSANNA
               I can help. I have a situation Mr.
               Creasy. There is a brotherhood called Le
               Hermanidad which protects both high
               ranking Government officials, corrupt
               police, and organized crime at a level
               that is very difficult for me to touch.
               I believe you were a victim of this
               organization. You and this story may
               help to unmask them.

Creasy looks carefully at Rosanna.    Right now he trusts
no one.

                            CREASY
               Thank you.

He walks away towards Rayburn.

EXT.   RAMOS HOUSE - DAWN

The SUV parked a discreet distance away. Rayburn grinds
out another cigarette, mutters to himself.

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - DAWN

Bruno lets him in. Nothings been touched.     Creasy
retrieves his bullet from his shrine along   with the
'Jack', Marlboros, and New Testament. Puts    his few
possessions in a bag. MOVE WITH him as he    silently
crosses out into the hall, heads toward...

PINTA'S ROOM

He stands there a moment. His pain entirely his own.
And then he goes to Pinta's little desk, finds her school
notebook buried in a pile. He flips through it until he
finds...

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                        79.


The LICENSE PLATE NUMBER Pinta jotted for him. Then he
notices the notebook is really a diary. Every page
references her day to day relationship with Creasy. "I
love you Creasy Bear." He hears soft footsteps. Creasy
turns.

Lisa stands in the doorway in her nightgown, her eyes
drilling through Creasy.

                            LISA
                      (softly)
               You let them take her.     She loved you and
               you let them take her.

Creasy just blinks at her as the words blast through him.

                            LISA
               Why are you here?     Why didn't you die?

                            CREASY
               Because...
                      (shrugs)
               I was already dead.

Eyes brimming, Lisa has no more words.       But Creasy comes
bearing cold comfort.

                              CREASY
               I want you   to know something.
                      (a   beat)
               I'm going   to kill them. Anyone who opens
               their eyes   at me.

Lisa doesn't answer, but the connection between them is
suddenly monumental. Finally, Creasy looks away. He
picks up Pinta's battered, old TEDDY BEAR.

                              LISA
               Creasy...

He turns, but she doesn't look back at him.

                            LISA
               Kill them, Creasy.

Creasy nods.    He will.    As he continues away...

                            LISA (CONT'D)
               Kill them all.

EXT. GARDEN / POOL - RAMOS HOUSE

Creasy exits the house and stands by the pool. Frank
appears tail wagging and attempts to comfort Creasy.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       80.


Leaves blow across the surface of the water. Underwater
slow motion, a wall turn. It looks remarkably like
Pinta.

"Blue Bayou" drifts through the air. Soft, in the ether
somewhere. Creasy hears it, half raises his head.

                          PINTA'S VOICE
             Why Blue Bayou, Creasy? Is that where
             you're from?

She's standing behind him. Wearing the all too familiar
one piece swimsuit, she towels her wet hair.

                          CREASY
             Blue Bayou is a dream, Pinta.     Like you.

                          PINTA GHOST
             Dreams are beautiful, Creasy-Bear, but
             life is better.

                          CREASY
                    (smiles)
             Why are you here?

                          PINTA GHOST
             I have to watch you now.

CLOSE ON CREASY

The words are a salve, a balm.     He turns, looks back over
his shoulder. He's all alone.

INT.   SUV - NEAR RAMOS - MEXICO CITY - DAWN

Rayburn looks over his shoulder, sees Creasy walking down
the street. Clutching a teddy bear.

Creasy gets in the car.    Rayburn drives.

                          RAYBURN
             You'll be Stateside by suppertime.

No answer.   Finally, as Rayburn lights a cigarette...

                          CREASY
             I'm going to need help, Ray.

Rayburn grinds out the cigarette he just lit, knows what
just was asked. Creasy needs help unleashing a plague.

            Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day
            the shape you're in. Unless you stop
            bleeding you should have your spleen
            removed.

                           CREASY
            Yes or no?

                         RAYBURN
                   (after a beat)
            I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave
            that up. Anything else? It's yours.

Creasy reaches into a pocket, hands Rayburn a hand
written list. Rayburn reads, his eyes widening.

                         RAYBURN
            Jesus, Creasy. You're talking war.

INT. PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL - MEXICO CITY

The surface breaks as Creasy enters the water     wearing a
red T-shirt to hide the bandages. He begins      a slow
laborious stroke.  A pale attempt at getting     back into
shape. A ribbon of  maroon trails him through     the water.

INT. GARAGE - SUBURBS MEXICO CITY - NIGHT *RETHINK

Fluorescents flicker on. A Fiat up on the hydraulic
lift. A section of the garage is portioned off by heavy
steel sheeting with a padlocked door.

One of the two men unlocks it.      Creasy and Rayburn enter.

Creasy stops by the pistols.

                         CREASY
            I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.

                         RAYBURN
            I know it's old fashioned, but it's

Next he's looking at grenades.   He hefts two different
choices.

                         CREASY
            I need less than standard packing. Can
            you knock up a case for fifteen of each?

He picks up a double barrel shotgun, checks the line of
it. He flicks open the breach, snaps it shut.

                         CREASY
                   (indicating)
            Cut the stock here. The barrel here.

Creasy hangs up.

INT.   AFI OPERATION CENTER - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Manzano, Rosanna, and technicians are listening to voice
analysis tapes of various kidnappers. They're
struggling. Rosanna hands the piece of paper with the
license plate number to Manzano.

                          MANZANO
             He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death
             before he can do anything.

                          ROSANNA
             He sounded strong to me.      Stronger than
             we are.

Rosanna pauses.

                          ROSANNA
             Because he's outside. Because he's not
             tied to the same system we are.

                          MANZANO
             We did voice analysis of the last five
             high profile kidnappings, including the
             little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'.
             Listen to this.

Manzano plays back a recording of the Kidnapper.

                          VOICE
             "I used to run through the streets of
             Neza because I was scared of being fucked
             with. I swore one day I would cross the
             street walking. Now I walk."

                          ROSANNA
             He's protected by La Hermanidad.

                            MANZANO
             I know this.    Your point?

                          ROSANNA
             Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is
             he could be very valuable to us.

Rosanna waits for a response.    None.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       84.


                          ROSANNA
             Then what do you have to lose?

                          MANZANO
             It's a moral issue. On one hand you're
             cleaning up the bad guys, but in another
             way we are feeding the problem that
             produces bad guys.

Finally deciding, Manzano turns, holds out his hand.      As
Rosanna hands him the paper with the partial license
written on it.,

Creasy watches and waits.    Time lapse of the building

Jorge exits the building still trying to get the last
button of his police uniform closed. He's a cop. He
struggles to get behind the wheel of the Fiat. The car
is tiny.

Someone's getting in on the passenger side.

As Jorge starts to protest, Creasy rams a Sig into his
gut. At the same time, he takes Jorge's gun from its
holster.

                            CREASY
             Drive.

             Do you know who I am?

                          CREASY
             You are Jorge Ramirez.

Creasy jams him in the gut again.

                            CREASY
             Drive.

Jorge starts the engine.    As he eases out into traffic.

EXT.   CLIFFSIDE - MEXICAN CITY - DAY

A car graveyard sitting on top of a 300 foot cliff
overlooking a real tough barrio. Gravel crunches under
the Fiat's tires as it drives to the edge of a cliff.

                            CREASY'S VOICE
             Stop here.    Turn off the ignition.

INT.   FIAT 500 - DAY

Jorge does as he's told. Suddenly the Sig comes down
hard. WHACK! As Jorge's vision explodes...

INT.   FIAT 500 - DAY

Still in the driver's seat, Jorge wakes. The first thing
he sees is that his hands are taped to the steering wheel
with his pudgy white fingers exposed. He is naked,
reminiscent of the 18 year old in the opening sequence.

                          CREASY
             Can you hear me?

Jorge nods, the pain in his head blinding.

                          CREASY
             I am going to ask questions. If you
             don't answer, fully and truthfully, you
             will suffer much more than you have to.

Creasy opens Pinta's notebook to a blank page near the
end. He clicks open a pen.

Creasy presses in the car's cigarette lighter.

Then he opens a buck knife.    Jorge winces at the sound of
the blade locking.

                          CREASY (CONT'D)
             I'm going to cut your fingers off.     One
             by one. If I have to.

The cigarette lighter pops back out.

                          CREASY
             That's to cauterize the stubs.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    86.


Holy sweet Jesus... Sweat drips down Jorge's forehead.
He tries to master his fear. Swallows dry.

                           JORGE
              Do you know who I am?

                             CREASY
              Who are you?

                           JORGE
              I am the President of La Hermanidad.

Without warning Creasy reaches up with the buck knife, a
flash of steel.

The big man howls, his left ear suddenly missing, starts
an epic struggle, practically breaking the wheel off the
steering column. He is like a bucking Rhinoceros.

He howls as Creasy sprays his face with pepper spray.

EXT.    FIAT 500 - DAY

The passenger side door opens and Creasy stumbles out.
Some of the pepper spray has gotten in his face as well.

Creasy wipes his tearing eyes. And then he turns.
Hefting the knife in his hand, he marches back toward the car.

                             JORGE'S VOICE
              No!   No!

And then a terrible SCREAM. BLOOD squirts against the
inside of the windshield. The car rocks on its shocks.
And then another terrible SCREAM.

                                                  CUT TO:

JORGE

Stares at the stump of his right forefinger, smoke rising
up off it. Creasy sticks the lighter back in its hole.

And Creasy looking at him, devoid of emotion.

                           JORGE
              Wh- wh- what do you want to know?

It takes a moment for Creasy to come back.    He picks up
the pen and notebook.

                           CREASY
              The Ramos kidnapping.   How did it work?

                         JORGE
            I don't know. We were just given
            instructions to take her.

                         CREASY
            Ordered by who?

Jorge hesitates.   As Creasy sets the pen down...

                            JORGE
            I don't know.

Creasy jerks back Jorge's middle finger, raises the
knife.

                         JORGE
                   (a mile a minute)
            I don't know! We work in parts. A    voice
            calls in a kidnapping. We deliver   the
            target to the guardians. We don't   even
            know them. They might transfer to   other
            guardians. The negotiators and the
            bosses don't even see the target.   They
            just make the deal!

                         CREASY
            Who ordered it?

                         JORGE
            The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.

                         CREASY
            Where do I find him?

                         JORGE
                   (shrugs; terrified)
            I don't know. No one knows.

CLOSE ON CREASY

Scream, as the knife comes down. Creasy tosses the finger
out the window, wipes some of Jorge's blood off his
cheek.

                         JORGE
            I don't know, I swear.

                         CREASY

             Me, too.    Tell me about the guardians.

                          JORGE
             He called me on the cell phone to set a
             time and location for the switch.

                            CREASY
             Who's he?

                          JORGE
             The one who transferred Pinta to their
             car.

FLASHBACKS: See Pinta being manhandled from the white
Fiat to the trunk of Grand Marquis. She has been bound
and taped around the mouth and eyes.

Creasy looks like he'll kill him on the spot.     Muzzles
his Sig into the palm of Jorge's right hand.

                            CREASY
             Who's he?

                          JORGE
             I don't know, but I know his face.

Creasy cocks the trigger.

                          JORGE
             I see him sometimes at the handball court
             in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.

                          CREASY
             How do I recognize him.

                          JORGE
             He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of
             his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.

Creasy closes the notebook, caps the pen.    It's over.

A gunshot echoes over the barrio. Creasy gets out of the
car, reaches back to release the emergency brake.

EXT.   VIA ARCO IRIS - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Kids playing SOCCER. One of them kicks an errant pass.
It skips down the street toward an approaching Creasy.

The kids shout for him to kick the ball back, but he
ignores them. As the kids curse him out, Creasy enters 1-
1-3...

BOOM UP alongside the building. A man steps to a third
floor window... man two who stuffed Pinta into the car.
His name is Sandri. And we're inside.

SANDRI (Italian Immigrant)

Putting his cufflinks through his shirt sleeves. Wearing
a shoulder holster. A satisfied smile as he looks back
into the room. At the bed. A 17-year-old GIRL under the
sheet.

                           GIRL
                    (nods)
             When will I see you again?

Pulling  on his suit coat, Sandri steps to the door. He
mimes a  pistol action with his forefinger and thumb. He
opens it  to find himself staring square into the eyes of
Creasy.   He rests the twin barrels of the sawed-off
shotgun  square against Sandri's chest.

                          CREASY
             Her name was Pinta.

Sandri registers the name.   Creasy swings the shotgun
down to Sandri's groin.

EXT.   PUBLIC POOL - MEXICO CITY

Creasy swimming toward the far wall. As he rolls, kicks
off, it's Pinta who emerges from the bubbles swimming
back the over way.

Pinta swims through the a maroon cloud filtering through
the water.

                                              CUT TO:

CU of Pinta's diary. Creasy opens it up. The bullet
sits in the center crease. He thumbs through the pages
stopping on different days. Pinta's V.O. Illustrating
those pages.

EXT. CHAPULTEPEC PARK - DAY

Handball court. Intense game with big money stakes. A
sea of criminal faces cheer on the gladiators from the
bleachers. It's a close match.

A 200 pound Guardian removes his T-shirt before serving.
Turns to reveal a huge tattoo across two-thirds of his
back. Creasy registers his prey.

EXT. BARRIO SUNSET

A small Russian Taurus crests a hill and descends into
Hell. A frightening looking Barrio. Burnt out cars and
dead dogs line the sidewalks. Creasy tails the Guardian
on his moped into the center of a trash dump. The focal
point being a semi-derelict church within a gated
compound. Our 'tattooed handball genius' exits the
Taurus. Reaches in back for the groceries.

INT.   GUARDIA DE SEGUIDAD - SUNSET

A knock. GUARDIAN TWO steps over, carries a pistol.     He
slides back a speakeasy slot to reveal our tattooed
Guardian.

                           GUARDIAN TWO
             Hola!

EXT.   DOOR - SUNSET

Guardian One stands at the slot. Creasy is pressed up
against the wall out of sight. He holds the shotgun
wrapped in a ragged beach towel.

As the door unlocks and opens and Guardian One steps in,
Creasy slides in right behind him.

As the butt of the shotgun makes contact with Guardian
Two's mouth. Blood spouts as his front teeth are smashed
in.

As he raises his hands to his face, the pistol he holds
discharges into the ceiling. Guardian One watches as
Creasy clubs him again in the head.

Frightened footsteps running on the other side of a
plywood wall. A female voice yelling from the other
room. Creasy gauges their whereabouts.

BOOM!    Creasy fires into the wall.    Wall explodes.

Guardian Three freezes mid stride.      It's a tough looking
woman in her 40's.

INT. GRUBBY KITCHEN ROOM - DAY

The three guardians stand facing the wall. Hands bound
with tape or cuffed. Naked (like our 18 year old) other
than their dirty skivvies.

Creasy holds up a picture of Pinta.      An I.D. picture
taken from her schoolbook.

                           CREASY
              Tell me about the girl.

All three look...and with a strange defiant arrogance.

                           GUARDIAN ONE
              Who the fuck's that?

BOOM! BOOM!    Creasy kills Guardian One.

INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING:

The two Guardians each bound in two different rooms.
Both have their eyes taped shut. Creasy interrogates
Guardian Two.

              Everything on the cellphone. We wait for
              calls. We have no number to call.

Creasy picks a cell phone up off the table, hits redial.
It's a blocked line.

pocket as he lies on the floor.

              He was screaming about the money and his
              dead nephew. He threw the little girl

The Female Guardian points. Creasy steps over.       There's
a smear of BLOOD against the wall.

                           FEMALE GUARDIAN
              She fell. She wasn't moving. They threw

And Creasy stands there a moment. Realizes she is
telling the truth. Lost. And the sound that snaps him
out of it... A GIRL CRYING. And Creasy is suddenly
moving down...

THE HALLWAY

After the sound.    He kicks open a door.       There!

In a 8' X 4' room.       A 12-year-old GIRL.    Bound and

the little girl's hand. She has the same lost look he
does. Female Guardian in the back of car.

                            CREASY
             Camila.

The girl looks up at the name.

                           CREASY
                    (into phone)
             I've got her.

EXT.   ICE CREAM STAND - BUSY MEXICAN CITY STREET - NIGHT

Creasy hands the girl an ice cream cone. He looks over
as Rosanna hurries over from across the street.

Creasy puts the little girl's hand into Rosanna's.

                          CREASY
             I need something. Do you have banking
             connections?

                          ROSANNA
                    (hesitates, then...)
             I have connections.

Creasy hands her the ATM card.

                          CREASY
             The PIN number is 4-7-4-7.    I need to
             know whose account it is.

Rosanna notices the blood on Creasy's shirt.    Near his
stomach.

                          ROSANNA
             Where do I find you?

                          CREASY
             I'll call you tomorrow.

Creasy looks at the girl and starts off, then looks back.

                          CREASY
             What do you know about the cop?
             Tazinari. The one who made the ransom
             drop with Samuel Ramos?

                          ROSANNA
             He's an old fashioned patrone with the
             worst reputation. He's high on my hit
             list.

                          CREASY
             Where does he live?

                          ROSANNA
             He lives in a Judicial Compound. He
             travels by motorcade. He has better
             protection than George Bush. Even more
             importantly he is part of La Hermanidad.
             His reach is far and wide.

                          CREASY
             Give me the address.

SAFEHOUSE WITH ROSANNA.

INT.   MANZANO'S OFFICE - AFI HQ - NIGHT

A beehive. Cops. Photos of dead kidnappers on the wall:
Jorge and Sandri. Sandri emasculated, one hand missing.
Jorge behind the wheel, fingers stubs and a missing ear.

                          ADJUTANT
             Two in one day. And they died very
             badly. Sandri and Jorge were prime
             suspects in twelve kidnappings in the
             last six months.

Manzano studies the photo of Jorge.

                         MANZANO
            Whoever did this was methodical,
            unafraid. Was Jorge's mugshot in the
            photos we showed Creasy?

                         ADJUTANT
            No, I checked. But right   after Sandri
            was shot, a girlfriend of  his was found
            naked, hysterical in the  street. She
            said it was a man fitting  Creasy's
            description who shot him.

                         MANZANO
            Mr. Creasy was, and maybe is again, a
            very lethal human being.

                         ADJUTANT
            You don't seem very surprised?

Manzano looks at his Adjutant, pleased with his
perception. But he isn't sharing.

                         MANZANO
            What's surprising these days?

An AFI agent brings over a plate of red shredded chicken.
Manzano takes a bite, moans in pleasure.

                           MANZANO
            Your sister?    Only a virgin cooks like
            this.

SURVEILLANCE ROOM

Seen through a two-way mirror.   Manzano watches as...

Rayburn sits at a steel chair, bolted to the floor.
Rayburn's eyes are closed. In meditation. Then, slowly,
his arms extend out to the sides. Manzano is curious as,
slower still, Rayburn extends both hands out in front of
him, palms up. Must be a Zen thing.

Then, both MIDDLE FINGERS are extended. With eyes still
closed, Rayburn mouths 'fuck you'. Manzano bursts a
laugh.

Rayburn opens his eyes, looks over as Manzano enters.
Still eating, he hands Rayburn a second plate of chicken.

                         MANZANO
            Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo
            sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in
            lemon and orange juice. It's a stew
            really.

                         RAYBURN
                   (sets it down)
            I already ate.

Manzano enjoys another bite, then...

                         MANZANO
            Tell me about your friend Creasy.

                         RAYBURN
            You just said it. He's my friend.
            Nothing else to say.

                         MANZANO
            I read the file. You and Creasy have
            seen quite a bit together.

                         RAYBURN
            Two tourists who never went home.

                         MANZANO
            You helped him get this job.

                         RAYBURN
            That's what friends do.

                         MANZANO
            Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you,
            others will do it as well. Their
            facilities are as good as my own, if not
            better.

                         RAYBURN
            I can take care of myself.

                         MANZANO
            You and Creasy both. A two man army
            according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon
            with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you
            were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt
            down elite Iraqi military commanders.
                   (laughs)

            The kind that gets divorced, but still
            stay friends.

                         MANZANO
            What happened to him?   What happened to
            Creasy?

Rayburn flinches at some bitter memory.

                         RAYBURN
            None of your business. Or mine for that
            matter. I got nothing more to say.

                         MANZANO
            This is my jurisdiction. I want these
            men as much as Creasy does.

                         RAYBURN
            He'll deliver more justice in a weekend,
            than ten years of your courts and
            tribunals. So stay out of his way.

                         MANZANO
            I plan to. I'll even help him if I can.
            He's going to lead me to the 'The
            Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly.
            But I'd like to understand him. Give me
            that.

                         RAYBURN
            Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to
            you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a
            number. One more dead.

                         MANZANO
            What was she to Creasy then?

                         RAYBURN
            Light. At the end of a long, dark
            tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was
            alright to live again.

                         MANZANO
            And they took that away.

                         RAYBURN
            A man can be an artist in anything.
            Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if
            his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is
            death. And he's about to paint his
            masterpiece.

The words sink in.   Manzano understands their magnitude.

             favor and let me the fuck out of here...

EXT.   MANZANO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Framed commendations fall to the carpet as Rosanna slams
up against the wall of Manzano's office. Skirt up around
her waist, Manzano moves inside of her. Between breaths:

                          MANZANO
             Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl
             that was kidnapped yesterday.

                          ROSANNA
             And left three more dead men.

She bites the heel of his palm to keep from crying out.

                          MANZANO
             When you talked to him, did he look sane?

                         ROSANNA
             No. Not by the rules of polite society
             at least.

                          MANZANO
             I think he's... magnificent.

As they both climax, pressed up hard against each
other...

                          MANZANO
                    (smiles)
             You only fuck me to get information.

He kisses her, turned on again already.

             Let's put Creasy to press. There's a

                    (as he takes card)
             I should start going for your tits first.

EXT. SWIMMING POOL - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Underwater as Pinta swims. As she spins, kicks off the
wall, it's Creasy who comes out the other side. A plume
of red blossoming off his side.

This is done over and over, faster and faster, closer and
closer. The blood becomes darker, bigger. And we push
into that blood until it's finally obscuring everything.

EXT.   NEWSSTAND - MEXICO CITY - EARLY MORNING

A row of newspapers being set out.     Creasy's face on the
front page of every one of them.

EXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING

A quaint old Mexico neighborhood. We follow a long
canvas bag being carried through the streets. Carried by
Creasy. Toward the end of the street and a ground floor
apartment. Walks past a canary yellow Coup deVille,
which has seen better days.

INT.   GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT - MORNING

An elderly couple eating lunch. The HUSBAND looks over
at a knock on the door. He stands, answers it. Creasy
slides in, eases the door shut behind him. Gun in hand.

             I'm not here to hurt you. I need to

A military operation as Tazinari is led out to his car.
Two heavy gray sedans wait. Tazinari gets in the back of

Creasy has just finished taping the old couple to two
chairs.

             If you promise to speak softly and not to
             shout, I won't have to tape your mouths.

The old man looks to his wife, then back to Creasy.
Nods.

The old man watches as Creasy opens he canvas bag, pulls
out two metal tubes that he screws together. It's a
ROCKET LAUNCHER. Next he pulls out a cone-shaped
missile. The old man is starting to look curious.

                          CREASY
             Did you know you have a dishonest
             policeman living in your neighborhood?

Creasy depresses the fins on the missile and slides it
back into the tube.

                          OLD MAN
             I know of you. You're the American. The
             bodyguard who's killing the kidnapper.

Creasy doesn't answer, steps into the center of the room.

                          OLD MAN
             In the church, they say to forgive.

                          CREASY
             Forgiveness is between them and God.
             It's my job to arrange the meeting.

Creasy looks back and forth between two shuttered windows
and in a line to the wall with a household Catholic
alter. Christ on the cross sits front and center.

                          CREASY
             Do you have an old blanket you don't care
             about? I don't want to burn that wall.

A figure rises, framed in the window.

And Pinta stands beside him.   As she puts her fingers in
her ears...

Creasy fires the rocket launcher. A gout of flame erupts
from the back. But Creasy has hung a blanket on the
wall.

Eyes widening as the first rocket streaks toward them.
The driver stands on the brakes. The car explodes, is
obliterated really, from the inside out.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Tazinari's car slams into the debris of the lead car and
slides sideways against a wall wedging it in. Real
tight.

CREASY

A 'Man On Fire' strides through the smoke and dust. A
shotgun at his side and a Molotov cocktail in his left
hand.

Without missing  a stride he unloads both barrels into the
drivers window.   A scary prospect even though it's bullet-
proof. The lit   Molotov explodes beneath the car.
Silence. Then a   dull impact explosion. 30 feet of
flames envelope  the car. The driver and Tazinari both
prisoners inside  their own car.

The driver exits releasing a full clip from his Uzi.
Creasy nails him with a single shot to the head.

Tazinari exits through the flames hands high in the air.

There sits the canary yellow Coupe deVille. Eyes and
mouth taped shut, hands and ankles bound by flex-cuffs.
Tazinari stands there.

Creasy steps up, pulls the tape off Tazinari's eyes.     He
looks about, relatively calm considering.

             You know where you are?

            went down?

Creasy tears the tape off his mouth.

                         TAZINARI
            Do you know who I am? I am the

            Hermanidad.

                           TAZINARI
            Correct!

Creasy pulls the buck knife from his pocket, flips  it
open. As Tazinari reacts, Creasy spins him round,   slits
his clothes up from ankle to neck. The cloth drops   away,
some hanging at Tazinari's wrists. Tazinari has a   sudden
loss of attitude.

side view mirrors of the Coupe deVille.

Cut back to see Tazinari, naked other than his Calvin
Klein skivvies, spread-eagled across the grill of the
car, butt forward (Reminiscent of 'the woods scene' in

Creasy rips down his Calvins. CU of Tazinari's face
winces with either pain or extreme discomfort.

Creasy puts a tape recorder on the hood and presses the
record button.

                         TAZINARI
            I don't know him. I saw the opportunity
            and got lucky.

                           CREASY
            Lucky how?

                         TAZINARI
            That he used policemen. That you killed
            them, it made it a police matter. The

            You stole the drop.

            You done it before?

Tazinari doesn't answer.   Creasy gives the Magnum a
tweak.

                          TAZINARI
            Yes.   Many times.

            O.K.   So tell me more.

                         TAZINARI
            There was no ten million dollars.

                         CREASY
            The ransom was ten.

             Two and a half. That's how much there
             was.

             Maybe your men stole from you.

                           TAZINARI
             No. Whoever took the rest took it before
             the exchange.

             Who gave the bags to Ramos?

                           TAZINARI
             His lawyer.   Jordan Kalfus.

FLASHBACK: Ramos House. Bags of cash being switched
from the Mercedes with the flat tire to the 2nd Mercedes
in the garage. See that Jordan does the switch, four
bags on the floor.

He isn't doing well. The cloud of deep red emanating
from his stomach envelopes his whole body.

INT.   DINING ROOM - EVENING

Samuel eats dinner silently. Lisa just stares into
space, nursing a vodka. Even great marriages cannot
survive the trauma of kidnapping and subsequent death.

The door opens and they expect to see Maria with the
deserts. Creasy enters and sits at the table like a
dinner guest.

                          CREASY
                    (to Samuel)
             I'm going to talk to your wife. If you
             move or say one word, I'll kill you.

He takes a Colt Officer model .45 semi-automatic pistol
out of his waistband and lays it on the table in
preparation for something, we don't know what. He turns
to Lisa.

                          CREASY
             I'm going to tell you a story. Your
             lawyer is dead. Someone didn't want him
             talking. Last week he wired $2.5 million
             into his U.S. bank account. Colonel
             Ernesto Tazinari is also dead. He
             hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5
             million. If my arithmetic is correct it
             means $5 million remains.

Creasy looks to Samuel.

                          CREASY
             Your husband magically had five million
             deposited in a U.S. bank account last
             Friday.

Lisa's eyes never leave Creasy's...trying to discern
whether this is true or not.

                          CREASY
             They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.

                             LISA
             Planned what?

                         CREASY
            An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for
            Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm
            sure he thought she'd sit there for three
            days eating pizza and watching TV. It
            didn't work out that way. Everything got
            fucked up when I killed the cops and
            Tazinari saw an opportunity.

Lisa screams.   Creasy gestures with a finger to his lips.

                         CREASY
            On the surface it was low risk and high
            return. This was the third autosequestra
            Jordan had organized for clients. The
            other two succeeded.

Samuel looks to Lisa.

                          SAMUEL
            Our lifestyle was in jeopardy. My pain
            and weakness only fueled your anger and
            determination. I wasn't sure about
            whether to go through with it or not.
            Then I woke up one day and it was done.
                   (beat)
            Jordan was supposed to take care of it.

Through all of the above, Creasy removes the special
bullet held in the seam of his wallet. The misfire.     He
empties the other cartridges from his gun.

Lisa suddenly attacks Samuel in a violent, emotional
outburst of tears, screaming, and rage. Drawing blood
from his nose and upper lip. Samuel smothers Lisa's arms
beneath his. He appears strong and decisive for the
first time.

Creasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the
magazine and chambers the round. He looks into Samuel's
eyes.

                         CREASY
            A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells
            the truth. And the truth will set you
            free.

Creasy hands Samuel the gun.

                         CREASY
            In many ways I think this bullet should
            be shared between you and Lisa.

Creasy exits the room. Samuel kisses Lisa on the
forehead and exits onto the terrace.

A GUNSHOT.

EXT.   MEXICO CITY - NIGHT

Life moves on with its brutal inevitability.    This is a
river whose course cannot be altered.

                          PINTA'S VOICE
             From the backseat I can see   Creasy's eyes
             in the mirror. He watches    and thinks.
             He never smiles. I wish I    was back in
             the front seat with him. I    wish he would
             smile.

Creasy looks up from the notebook and out at the city.
And a smile comes. But it's bitter and hopeless.

It's half grief, half not knowing where to go next, what
to do. And he's dying. He knows that too. Creasy dials
a number on a cell phone.

INT. AFI OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

Back on Rosanna. We see she's sitting in the AFI
Operations Center amongst Technicians, surveillance and
listening devices, and Manzano.

We can hear the interior of a family house, kids, a
frustrated mother, a Mexican soap playing in the B.G.,
over speakers.

                         TECHNICIAN
                   (to Manzano)
            We got the whole place wiretapped. But

                           MANZANO
            He'll show.

Manzano is carrying a 8" X 10" digital blow up of a
handsome Mexican John Gotti type in some nightclub
environment.

            Who's that?

                         MANZANO
            He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got
            into the house on the pretext of giving
            cholera shots. We had to inject the
            whole Barrio. We bugged the house and
            stole the picture of him. Manzano looks
            at Rosanna. Now's the time to really
            pressure him. Lets publish his picture
            in tomorrow's edition.

INT.   CLOSED RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The OWNER watches nervously as   Creasy approaches wearing
a wool CAP. A pale attempt at    disguising his identity.
There's a newspaper folded on   his dais, more photos of
Creasy, his dead targets, the   story of his vendetta.

Empty restaurant, chairs  on tables. An    exterior
streetlight illuminates  the darkness.    The owner leads
him down a row of empty  booths. Creasy    slows, stops as
he sees the only person  waiting for him   is Manzano. As
Manzano smiles.

            What do you want?

            The same thing as you. Except, my reach
            isn't as long as yours. My father was a
            policemen, did you know that?

                         CREASY
            I don't know shit about you.

                         MANZANO
            He was one of the original founders of
            'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it
            represented good not evil.

Manzano smiles; he likes Creasy.

                         MANZANO
            He was murdered. And now here I am.
            Trying to honor his memory. Hamstrung by
            bureaucracy and corruption. The

            criminals at the highest level where I
            would need a Presidential finding in

            It galls me to watch you. You can do as
            much in days as I can in years. Men like
            the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of

            Are you going to arrest me or talk me to
            death?

Manzano laughs again.   Genuine.   Creasy cracks him up.

                         MANZANO
            My country needs justice. Proper
            justice. Gunning men down in the street
            only feeds the violence. They need to
            be brought to trial. Dealt with
            properly.
            Then people will respect the law. When
            they see it works.

            So you are going to talk me to death.

                         MANZANO
            You walk out and deal justice. You're
            what I wish I could be.
                   (another laugh, then a beat)

            I want to arrest you for murder! I want
            to shake your hand and reload your gun!
            I want to kill my pride and give you my

                            MANZANO
               Account belongs to a woman we think is
               The Dreamer's girlfriend. Reina Rosas,
               who is 8 months pregnant.

Creasy holds his hand out.     Manzano hesitates.

                            MANZANO
               The plan is the girlfriend will lead you
               to the Boss. You'll lead me, and I'll
               arrest him. Agreed?

Creasy doesn't respond. Finally Manzano gives him the
paper, a mimeographed mugshot, and address scrawled on it.
Creasy stands. As he scoops up the pills. Creasy starts
out.

                            MANZANO
               Creasy...
                      (Creasy turns)
               I'd have liked to have known you under
               different circumstances.

                            CREASY
               Off the top of my head, I don't know what
               they could've been.

As Creasy departs...

                                                    FADE TO BLACK.

A tiered house built into the rock face that runs through
Mexico City. A scooter is parked. A man sits on it
waiting, wearing a crash helmet to hide his now well
known features. Creasy.

CREASY - VIDEO FEED

It's difficult to say where they are coming from. The
view passes from one screen to another. As Creasy's
passes, we hear the whispered crackle of radio
communications.

GROUND LEVEL

CREASY sits up as a car pulls up, and a MAN gets out.
Creasy checks the digital "8x10" even though this face is
indelibly imprinted on his brain.

It's not "The Dreamer."    Not as handsome, but there's a
resemblance.

The MAN unlocks the front door, checks the street first
and then enters.

Creasy regroups mentally and physically. Checks the
magazine in his SIG SAUER. Chambers rounds into his
shotgun. Looks up and sees a six-year-old on a bicycle
approach the front door. A ten-year-old opens the door
from inside. The six-year-old struggles to get his
bicycle through the doorway.

Creasy moves. He holds the shotgun against his leg as he
strides across the street. "Man on Fire."

The bicycle makes it in.    And the door is closing...

Creasy gets a foot in, forces his way inside.

INT.   HALLWAY - DAY

The pregnant woman, Reina Rosas, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER
as Creasy fills the space behind her. Creasy follows as
she runs.

LIVING ROOM

Creasy faces Reina, heavily pregnant. Silence. Two
other kids hide behind her. Suddenly the wall next to
Creasy explodes in a hail of bullets.

We realize Creasy caught one round in the chest. He's
down on one knee... uses the shotgun as a crutch. Reina
is screaming.

Hear a door torn open. Creasy      moves to the sound.   A
MAN has run out the back...

EXT. HOUSE - BACK COURTYARD

Creasy steps into courtyard, turns, a VW Bug coming right
at him...

Aims his weapon.

THE MAN

Ducks down... windshield shatters from the blast of
Creasy's shotgun... Bug slams into wall. The Man rolls
out... using the door as a shield.

BARRIO

The Man   flees into a labyrinth of packing-crate houses on
car-tire   foundations out into street. Running hard, too
hard for   Creasy in his condition. He is losing a lot of
blood.    He stops.

CREASY

Behind the wheel of the Volkswagon, roars out chasing.

Now through the maze of poverty... Creasy drives hard...
no sign of the Man... empty eyes of poverty looking
back... mostly women and children... They clearly see
Creasy... fully exposed... driving a car with no
windshield... He slams the car into reverse.

Someone says "Creasy" aloud... now more faces to turn...
children looking directly through his absent windshield.

One skinny kid runs ahead of Creasy. The boy points at
one cardboard house propped up against a brick and stucco
wall.

INT. VOLKSWAGON

Creasy pops the clutch... straight into a small house...
taking whole walls of cardboard... to the back brick
wall... The 'Man' is pinned violently between the car and
the wall.

INT.   LIVING ROOM - REINA ROSAS HOUSE - DAY

The Man badly broken and bleeding lies on the floor, flex-
cuffed. Reina screams at Creasy. Creasy's popping
Percodan's. The hysteria is peaking. Creasy chambers a
round and shoots man through left knee. Screams then
silence.

                            CREASY
             Reina Rosas.

                          CREASY
             How do you contact 'the Boss'?

Reina hesitates.

Creasy chambers another round and holds the gun to man's
right knee.

                          REINA

tries to speak to Creasy very logically about a very
illogical subject.

DANIEL hangs up.

Aurillio moans on the floor. Reina says the rosary. The

               Creasy.   She calls the bear 'Creasy

Time stands still for Creasy.        Words evaporate.    Liquid
film in Creasy's eyes.

CLOSE UP of Creasy's shocked face. He pulls down his

            Then don't come.

He disconnects.   He cannot waste his ebbing strength.

EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AZTECS - SUNSET

Darkness has fallen. Few people are on the street as
Creasy pulls to the south end of the bridge. He parks...
looks around... it's deserted. She's not coming. Checks
his watch, turns and walks toward the bridge. The Ramos
Mercedes drives up the bridge. Headlights off. Lisa is
driving. She exits the car.

She runs to catch Creasy.

                         LISA
            Creasy... Wait.

                         CREASY
            Stay here. If you do something stupid,
            we won't get her back.

He climbs the steps of the bridge trying to maintain his
dignity through the pain. He can see cars parked on the
other side.

OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - Creasy's POV

Creasy's dreamlike POV (Is it real or a dream) A
driver exits a shadowed car and opens the passenger door.
A SMALL FIGURE in a hooded sweat shirt and sweat pants
exits the car. Confused. Disoriented.

CREST OF THE BRIDGE

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     124.


Creasy waits. Breathing labored breaths. He sees it all.

OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE

The driver unties little hands. Removes a blindfold from
under the hood. He steps away. Offering no help.

The small figure is confused.

CREST OF THE BRIDGE

Creasy calls out:

                             CREASY
               Pinta.   Pinta.

She turns and looks. It looks remarkably like her even
under the hooded sweatshirt. She begins to run. Across
the street, up the steps toward Creasy. A screaming
train flashes beneath. Car headlights illuminate the
bridge.

Time stands still and the 'city sounds' fade out to
nothing.

She runs up the remaining stairs and sprints across the
bridge. Her hood blows off revealing her full face.
It's definitely Pinta. Camera ramps as he jumps into
Creasy's arms. This is not the little girl we
experienced in the beginning of the movie. The
experience she just endured has been life changing. All
of a sudden we have a 40 year old head on an 8 year old
body.

She wraps herself around him. He picks her up.     We
glimpse a simple tear on his cheek. They talk.     But we
do not hear the words.

She notices her mom on the far side of the bridge.
Creasy maneuvers her toward Lisa.

Before she goes to her mother we hear:

                            PINTA
               I love you, Creasy... And you love me,
               right?

Creasy nods.    The inference is that he will see her in a
few minutes.

We start to hear Linda Ronstadt painfully, quietly on the
wind singing "Blue Bayou." He continues to walk across
to the opposite side of the bridge and gets into the
kidnappers' car.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                          125.


There's a certain sort of calm of him.
He closes the door, he lays his head against the back
window. He looks out at PINTA at the other side of the
bridge, where she's screams for Creasy. "Blue Bayou"
gets LOUDER. Pinta now knows it was a lie. Creasy is
not coming back. We're shooting through the glass of the
back window. We se Mexico City reflected in the glass.
As the car pulls out, time slows, and we see Creasy lay
his head back and close his eyes as the car descends down
into a dark tunnel.

Pinta can see Creasy's face, eyes slowly closing. He can
hear her screams before being enveloped by the night. As
"Blue Bayou" continues...

EXT.    MEXICO CITY STREETS - DAY

Dark spot in the road. Suddenly Police lights, on the
roofs of four cars, flash simultaneously in front, in
blocking position. The driver turns and looks back
wanting to escape. He has a blacked out AFI armored van
right on his rear bumper. Nowhere to go.

SWAT at his door.    He's pulled and proned out onto the
road.

Manzano enters the driver's seat.       Reaching back to
Creasy. Grabs his hand.

                           MANZANO
              I'm your chauffeur now, Creasy.

Manzano does a U-turn.    Heading away.     On his portable
radio.

                          MANZANO
              All units. Commence the operation.
              Repeat. Commence.

He reaches back again.

                            MANZANO
              Creasy?   Creasy?

CLOSE UP - Two hands clasp.

Creasy's left with Manzano's right. A strong grip.         Then
no response. Manzano pulls to the curb.

Manzano reaches Creasy's wrist.       Takes his pulse.
Creasy's gone.

Beat.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     126.


Manzano kneels.   Still holding Creasy.   Unfolds Creasy's
fingers.

CLOSE UP - Pinta's medallion of St. Jude clutched in his
hand.

Manzano punches the seat again again and again.

                           MANZANO
            Goddamn you.

                   (keys mic)
            Hold at the perimeter.   Until I enter.

EXT. DANIEL'S COMPOUND

Dark, suburban Cuernavaca street. Creasy's car rounds
the corner. Security outside the compound motions to
open the garage doors. The driver of the car is
faceless. Street light reflections across the
windshield.

The car enters the gates. A collection of armed bodies
appear in the courtyard curious to see this national
hero. "Hombre en Fuego."

The car stops. Nothing. This beat seems interminable.
A hand opens the rear door: His forehead explodes. The
driver door opens barely two shots, two more bodies drop.

Panic and confusion. Everybody runs for cover. An
overhead helicopter illuminates the mayhem in the
courtyard. An armored vehicle rams through the gates.

Manzano explodes out of the driver's door in slow motion.
He is clearly on a mission. He strides through the
mayhem, Creasy's Sig Sauer in one hand, and a .45 auto in
the other.

Manzano's guide to his destination is the 'The Dreamer's'
little Jack Russell running back to his master on
instinct.

Manzano moves purposefully. His surrounding environment
is Chaplinesque in its chaos. He enters a long walkway
to a patio, following the dog. Daniel Sanchez appears at
the end of the hall. We ramp him into slow motion. The

               Ezekiel 25:17. Blessed is he  who in the
               name of charity and good will shepherds

               for he is truly his brother's keeper and
               the finder of lost children.
