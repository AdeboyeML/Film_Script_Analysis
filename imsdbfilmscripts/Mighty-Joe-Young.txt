1   EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY                                    1

    seemingly untouched.


2   EXT. PANGANI FOREST - DAY                                    2

    A warm golden light bathes the jungle. Shafts of
    sunlight filter through the forest floor. The sounds of
    WILD BIRDS break the hushed quiet of the setting. As we
    MOVE IN we FIND a large female mountain gorilla lounging,
    eating leaves in the dense undergrowth, her precocious
    baby gorilla plays nearby.


    THROUGH CAMERA LENS

    A view of the mother gorilla, a few PICTURES SNAPPED.


    BACK TO SCENE

    The photographer is RUTH YOUNG, naturalist, researcher,
    sitting in the undergrowth with her camera, notebooks,
    and sketch pad. Her precocious young daughter, JILL,
    plays nearby.

    Jill smiles, watching the baby gorilla clown. As the baby
    sees her, he suddenly scampers to a nearby tree and hides
    his face behind it. Jill does the same. She peeks out to
    catch a glimpse, just as the baby peeks out to catch her
    eye. They both scamper to different trees. Each time
    they move to a different tree, they go through this
    peek-a-boo interaction, both moving further away from
    their mothers. The mother GORILLA notices, lets out a
    CRY. Ruth looks around for Jill and signals by a
    distinctive whistle for her to come back this instant.

    Both children take a last look at each other and then
    scurry to their waiting mothers.

                             RUTH
              Jill.   What did I tell you?

              It's not good for them to interact

    head back to camp.

                                 JILL
                 No it wasn't.    It was Joe.

                               RUTH
                 Joe is just a baby, Jill.      He was
                 too big to be Joe.

    As they walk, they can see the sunset over the mountain
    trail.

                                JILL

    confidence in her voice.

    driven hard by a half dozen African men with rifles.

    Poachers wielding pangas (machetes). A glint of silver
    as a panga sweeps ACROSS FRAME, hacking at the wall of
    thistles and nettles.

    ON DOGS

    Eyes yellow. Teeth flared. The RINGING sound made by
    TIN SQUARES cut from cans, tied by rawhide around their
    necks. CLANG-CLANG-CLANG. One poacher whips his panga
    again.

    man, GARTH, pushes INTO FRAME. Carrying a heavy Weatherby
    Mark V rifle across his back. Garth yanks the primitive
    doll from the ground. Looks back as -- A figure
    approaches in the darkness.

    A glowing cigar clenched in his stained teeth, STRASSER
    checks the doll over -- primitive, grotesque; then snaps
    it in two. Tossing it away contemptuously, he shouts
    orders in the local dialect.

    a wildfire. CLANG-CLANG-CLANG. PAN UP OVER TO --

                 My notes say that Joe is only six
                 months old. Either I got
                 confused, or he's a very unusual
                 gorilla.

                 Yes, you did. And Mommy's going
                 to write it down in her book.

    She holds up a dog-eared composition book, Ruth's detailed
    log of her observations.

                 Right here. '... and my trusted

    As she sings, a man appears in the doorway. This is
    KWELI, the camp manager. He seems nervous and impatient,
    but doesn't want to disturb Ruth. Jill sees him.

     The men stare back at Strasser with equal hostility.

     Suddenly, Garth kneels and picks something from the
     ground. Rubs it between his fingers. Deposits it in
     Strasser's hand.

     The same one Ruth watched earlier. Joe clings tightly

     A nightmarish collage of images accompanied by the
     CLANGING of the dogs' COLLARS, the charge of the African
     poachers, the SCREAMS of the MOTHER and the other
     GORILLAS. Then he sees Strasser run forward, raise his
     rifle with icy precision.


     THROUGH SCOPE

     Strasser has Joe's mother dead on. Her head in the
     cross-hairs as she tries to get away. The MOTHER'S raspy
     animal SCREAM is unmistakably maternal, heart-breaking.
     It ECHOES across the mountain as she tries to reach a
     deep stretch of woods.

     On her back, Joe turns once more to look back and sees --

     He SCREAMS wildly, darts back and forth, desperately
     looking for his mother.

     THROUGH the tall grass in the b.g., he can see the
     Africans disappear up the hill hunting down the others.


     BACK TO SCENE

     And then we see Joe's anguish turn to fury. He GROWLS --
     and as the two big hunters come nearer -- Joe springs out
     at them.

     Joe is moving so fast, Strasser barely has time to react
     before the furry black shape is on top of him -- WIDEN
     as Joe attacks Strasser, knocking him back. Strasser
     shouts and drops his rifle. Tries to pull Joe off as
     they tumble down through the trees. Strasser punches
     and pulls at this ball of sinew and muscle. He reaches
     for his Match Master side arm with his right hand. PUNCH
     IN CLOSE as Joe bites down viciously through the hand.
     Strasser howls...


     ANGLE ON GARTH

     He has retrieved his rifle and is charging hard for his
     downed companion. He looks for a clear shot at Joe. PAN
     RIGHT and RACK FOCUS as Ruth Young explodes from the
     trees and flashes past Strasser, snatching Joe away. Joe
     is not quite sure what has happened, but he hangs on to
     Ruth for dear life.

     Strasser staggers forward, holding his mangled hand.
     Enraged.

     He rips Garth's gun away from him and with his bloodied

     Running but nearing exhaustion. Hearing a fusillade of
     GUNSHOTS -- Jill runs faster, panic contorting her face.

     vines.

     Jill shines her flashlight into the forest. Further up,
     someone waves a light back and forth. Like a signal.

     Jill's face lights up. She continues running. Suddenly,
     Jill is bowled over by Joe who leaps into her arms. They
     roll on the ground, Jill with the wind knocked out of her.
     They look into each other's face and both know that the
     worst is happening. They are both silent with fear.

     Strasser appears through the darkness. His right hand
     wrapped in a bloody swath. Denying the pain. Garth
     follows, gun up.

     Jill and Joe lie hiding in the undergrowth. Jill's eyes
     tell Joe not to make a sound. They barely breathe.

     They are nearly on top of Jill and Joe, and their words

     continue past. Once they're gone, Joe and Jill begin to
     breathe again. Then, Jill sees a light pop on in the

      The vehicles are circled in a clearing. Three small
      audio dishes have been positioned to triangulate the
      location of the slightest sound. An infrared video cam
      is mounted on a tripod. A geometric, field-assembled
      cage made of an impact-resistant, high-tensile steel
      alloy sits off to the side.

                  I understand completely: jungle

                  guy, he can get you a C.D. of
                  jungle sounds, cheap. Even
                  cheaper if you buy ten.

     Gregg puts his hand up to signal for quiet.

     He hears something.

     He listens intently for a moment, then the WHOOSH of a
     SPRING TRAP BLASTS his ears, followed by shouts and the
     sound of an ANIMAL SCREECHING. Gregg throws off the
     headphones, grabs a strange-looking pole called a DNA
     plug gun, and crashes with Pindi through the woods.

     Gregg runs INTO FRAME to see several of Pindi's men
     closing the cage on a lithe, young leopard.

     POV - TREES

     The top branches suddenly shake violently -- sending a
     sharp WOODEN RATTLE across the meadow. Is that a shadow
     from a passing cloud that seems to ripple through the
     foliage? Gregg steps closer. The trees bend like the
     wake of a boat -- they bend in a straight line.

     Something powerful and unseen is moving through the
     trees.

     Pindi and his men retreat back in the meadow. Gregg
     scans the forest. BRANCHES spring with a LOUD WHOOSH!

     Gregg can't help it -- his fear takes over and he
     backsteps into the meadow.

     WIDEN SHOT UP TO the trees. Catapulting DOWN THROUGH
     FRAME -- landing right in front of them is a gorilla --
     nearly 15 feet high. The GROUND TREMBLES from the force.

     A nearby Land Rover bounces two feet into the air from the
     impact.

     His canines are fully exposed. Thick, black hair on his
     crest stand erect. Deep brown eyes aglow as he gives
     another DEAFENING CALL. This is JOE. Backlit by the sun
     he seems to encompass the forest.

      stricken trackers.


      ANGLE - JOE

      moves to the cage and peers inside. The LEOPARD paces and
      HISSES. Joe straightens up bi-pedally and pounds his
      massive chest with his fist. The hollow POK-POK-POK ECHOES
      off the mountain.

      Joe raises his hand again and smashes the top off the
      cage, as if it were made of matchsticks. The leopard
      leaps out of the cage and dashes safely into the forest.
      JOE bares his teeth and ROARS at Gregg, as if to say
      "stay off my mountain." His mission accomplished, Joe
      quickly turns and starts back for tree cover.

      Silence. Everyone is open-mouthed, unable to believe
      what they have just seen...

      Then Greg snaps out of it. Bursting into action, he runs
      to the humvee, motions to Pindi.

     The caravan, looking like the cavalry in a Western, comes
     charging over the hill.

     Gregg's humvee comes crashing over a ridge in pursuit of
     Joe. Gregg yells out to the cars around him:

                                GREGG
                  Herd him towards me!   I gotta get

     straight for them. The humvee has to swerve out of the
     way to avoid colliding with Joe.

     FOLLOW JOE as he books across the meadow in the opposite
     direction, now. The modified Land Rover with the hot
     seat attached to the hood swerves around and chases Joe.
     They catch up, and the tracker climbs into the hot seat,
     readying a metal clamp attached to a chain...

     THE CHAIN

     unspools rapidly, whipping out from the front of the
     modified Land Rover. Quickly, it grows taut and now the
     Rover is being pulled by Joe. The driver slams on the
     brakes with both feet, but all that does is tilt the front
     end upwards, digging up clods of dirt as they're dragged

     a ninety degree turn...


     BACK ON GREGG

     Who is intently screwing a telescoping extension on the
     DNA plug gun. Pindi gapes at what Gregg is doing.

                                PINDI
                  I hope you are planning on

     Pindi looks forward again just in time to see...


     THE CHAIN

     Pulled taut between Joe and the modified Land Rover, has
     become a moving clothesline, and the humvee is heading
     right into its path. Pindi tries to swerve, but they
     can't avoid it. He ducks and...

     Gregg leaps out of the car, hurdling the chain, just as...

     It shears the top right off the vehicle!

     Gregg tumbles to the ground, as the humvee rolls to a stop
     nearby. Meanwhile, the --


     LAND ROVER

     is SPINNING OUT, still connected to Joe. Joe is almost
     curious about the chain. He begins to pull back as the
     modified Land Rover circles him. The modified Land Rover
     bucks -- and for a second there is a standstill. Then Joe
     yanks...

     And the chain, the winch, the tracker in the hot seat...
     in fact, the entire axle of the modified Land Rover, are
     pulled from their moorings.

     The tracker racks up against a tree, followed closely by
     his chair and winch...

     The axle tumbles to a stop...

     The LAND ROVER COLLAPSES like a stack of cards.


     JOE

     stands at the edge of the field, observing his victory.
     Then he beats his chest and ROARS.


     IN MEADOW

     Pindi and his men run to the one remaining car, the
     flatbed lorry. They all pile in and speed away across
     the field. Pindi sees something up ahead, yells at the
     driver.

                                   PINDI
                  Stop!

     The LORRY SCREECHES to a halt, right next to Gregg, who is
     stumbling towards them.

                  Hurry up, bro!     Get in!

     Pindi watches as Gregg stumbles around to the back of the
     truck. But instead of getting in, he grabs a silver case
     and pulls it off.

                                PINDI
                  Excuse me, boss, but please, I
                  would like to avoid being killed.

     Gregg flips opens the case, revealing a video camera.      He
     hoists it up, and barely able to walk, takes one last
     look at Pindi and the bruised and busted-up trackers.

     Gregg climbs over a fallen tree. Ducks under some low

     intently. Takes another step forward. Hears a TWIG
     SNAP.

     love to do to enemies. He charges Gregg and cuffs him
     onto his back. Joe is in full attack mode -- eyes wide,
     teeth exposed. He snatches Gregg by the foot.


     GREGG

     screams as he's jerked helplessly into the air. Joe
     shakes Gregg viciously -- then whips him back and forth,
     knocking him against a sapling. Gregg fights to free
     himself but he's no match for Joe's strength. He knows
     Joe is going to hurt him badly -- maybe kill him.

     Joe cocks his arm -- to crush Gregg against a wide tree
     trunk.

     She hikes through the forest effortlessly, as though it

     Jill comes out into a clearing, bordered by a large pool
     at the base of a magnificent waterfall. She pulls a
     flashlight out of her back pack and, in the same motion
     her mother used to summon her, begins waving it back and
     forth into the surrounding forest.

     Not so Jill. She waits calmly, at first, as the FOOT-
     STEPS APPROACH. Then, as the branches begin to bend and
     break, and we get our first glimpse of fur, she smiles.

     Mighty Joe Young emerges from the brush, not growling,
     not threatening, but rather looking like a puppy coming
     to greet his master.

     GORILLA bows his head so Jill can scratch behind his ear.
     He makes LOW, GUTTURAL SOUNDS that are the gorilla
     equivalent of a purr.

     Jill inspects Joe, checking him to see if he's okay.       Her
     voice is full of gentle concern and worry.

     Suddenly, she dashes into the woods -- where she's
     actually small enough to hide well. Joe passes by her,
     moving through the foliage.

     In a moment we see how much he fears actually losing her
     -- he begins to WHIMPER -- and spins around. He stands
     up to his full height, beats his chest and shakes his
     head in frustration. He can't bear the idea that she is
     gone.

     A beat, then Joe starts tearing bushes out by their roots,
     hunting for Jill. He sees one BUSH RUSTLING, goes over
     and rips it out of the ground, revealing...

     Gregg stumbles backwards, trapping himself against a tree

     faced with an enraged gorilla. Gregg averts his eyes and
     rolls into a ball, assuming the submissive position. He's
     like a pill bug, playing dead, protecting the back of his

     smash Gregg anyway... but then he hears Jill's voice.

     He gives him a playful, parting swat for good measure
     before obeying Jill and running into the forest.

     The "little swat" is powerful enough to send Gregg rolling

                   stay free here? I'm telling you
                   there's gonna be a hunt starting
                   on this mountain tomorrow. And I
                   don't expect they'll give it up
                   until one of them bags the prize.
                   You should think about it.

      Jill hates the ring of truth in Gregg's words.     She turns
      and takes off down the mountain alone.

      striking her. Alarmed, the Poacher stands in his seat

     Gregg nods, continuing packing.

                                GREGG
                  I'm gonna head up the mountain.
                  See if I can throw some of the
                  poachers off the trail.

                  Not for long. Just trying to buy
                  you a little time, that's all.
                  With more of these bastards
                  arriving every hour, I suggest you
                  get Joe as deep into the jungle as
                  you can -- as fast as you can.

     Across the street at the bar, a chorus of CACKLES rises
     from a group of drunken poachers. The mere sound of them
     makes Jill dig her fingers into her arms with anxiety.

     She looks across at the poachers -- and then back to
     Gregg, packing up. If she doesn't say this right now,
     this second, she never will. She snaps.

     hair flowing -- so reminiscent of that little girl we saw
     before -- a wild mixture of fluid grace and strength.

     Jill watches the clouds rush by the mountaintop. Joe
     stands next to her, looking out at the mountain valley
     where they've grown up together.

     Wind sweeps down from the peak. The trees bow and bend
     gracefully. To Jill, the mountain has never seemed more
     beautiful. She looks at Joe -- magnificent against the
     natural tableau of his world. She looks at him, worry on
     her face about what is about to happen to him.

                  Maybe you better check and see if
                  Joe's okay back there.

     Jill obediently whips around in her seat to check for
     Joe -- then realizes Gregg was teasing. She settles back
     down, facing front again.

     A livestock truck, same conservancy labels, travels right
     behind Gregg and Jill's vehicle. Heavy, open air slats
     obscure the truck's occupant, but we know who it is.


     JOE'S POV - LOOKING OUT

     Traffic rushes by, a buffeting rush of air -- the
     strangeness of it all frightens Joe -- and makes him
     curious. PUSH IN CLOSE ON the air slats as Joe peers out
     again.

      A mom drives her son home from little league. She
      listens to an OLDIES station. He looks out the window,
      bored. Then his eyes go wide.


      BOY'S POV

      PUSH IN CLOSE ON the trailer and Joe's two big eyes
      staring out. They lock eyes momentarily.

      The boy isn't sure if he's seeing things. Then two
      enormous fingers extend out from between the slats and
      wave at him.


      BOY

      For the boy it is a beat of pure astonishment. As if a
      daydream came real for the moment. The trailer pulls
      past leaving the boy wide-eyed, wondering.

     Gregg and Jill's car pulls onto the grounds of the
     California Animal Conservancy. A sprawling campus of
     stucco buildings and lifelike habitats, the conservancy
     is a state-of-the-art preserve.

     The car passes the main gate, where a worker in a
     conservancy uniform waves Gregg through. As the live-
     stock truck pulls in behind them, the worker picks up
     his walkie-talkie.

     Harry is too flustered by Jill to say a word. He just
     manages a weird little smile and a sound that's not
     English.

     Just then, a BANG and a loud GROWL come out of the

     His head turning sideways at the sound of her voice. A
     tense moment, as Joe glares at the assembled crowd. He
     is magnificent. Awesome. Staggering.

     Vern picks up a camera and scrambles to get into
     position -- but he's so nervous that he trips, sprawling
     on the ground and startling Joe. Joe turns and scampers
     back into the trailer.

     Vern gets back on his feet, red-faced. Jill glares at
     Harry. Gregg just chuckles at the stupidity. Harry

      Gregg is grim and quiet. He thinks what she's saying is
      true. He sets her bags down, detesting the antiseptic
      space as much as she does.

      Feeling claustrophobic, Jill dashes to the window and
      tries to open it. It's a double-paned window. The top
      doesn't open at all -- the bottom cranks open three
      inches, barely letting in air. Jill pushes on the
      window, horrified?

      It only takes a second. Gregg grabs a pillow from the
      couch and lays it against the top portion of the window.
      He gives it one swift karate chop, breaking out the glass.
      He methodically breaks out the remaining shards, dusts off
      the pillow, and carefully replaces it on the couch.

      Jill just stares at him, open-mouthed.    Gregg looks her

       The CAMERA LEAVES Jill's window and FINDS Joe, sitting in
       his man-made grassy field, looking equally lost and
       lonely. He is unsure of what to do with himself, confused
       by his surroundings.

       The CAMERA FINDS Gregg, leaning against the bar at the
       edge of the moat. His face is soft as he watches Joe.

       Joe lists his mammoth head and looks up towards the right
       corner of his habitat. Gregg follows Joe's eyeline and
       sees that Joe is looking at a TRANSFORMER. The ELECTRIC
       BUZZ reaches Gregg's ear... and he becomes aware of it in
       a new way. He hears its HUM the way Joe hears it --
       strange, menacing.

       Gregg shakes his head to himself -- why didn't the
       designers pay attention to this? He looks back at Joe,
       almost apologetically, and is startled to find that:

       Joe is looking back at him.

       It is the first time these two have had real eye contact,
       and for Gregg it is almost overwhelming. Man and beast
       read each other's faces, and it is in this moment that
       the giant ape becomes more than a phenomenon to Gregg.
       Gregg finally feels some of what Jill has been feeling.
       He connects to Joe.

       And Joe connects to Gregg. It's just a blink of the eye,
       a turn of the head -- but it's there. And they both feel
       it.

     Harry and Cecily walk with     a conservative-looking man in
     his fifties, Elliot Baker,     the Chairman of the Board of
     the conservancy. Harry is      working for brownie points,
     excitedly pointing out his     "important role" in discovering
     Joe.

                  I always had a suspicion that the
                  legend coming out of the Pangani
                  forest might have some truth to
                  it. It was just a hunch -- sort
                  of a gut feeling -- but I sent my
                  field zoologist to check it out.

     him grab the glory away from Gregg.

                  had a theory -- and Joe's blood
                  work confirms it. The gorillas in
                  the Pangani carry a recessive gene
                  that pops up every four or five
                  generations with this rare form of
                  gigantism.

     hides behind a very tiny tree.

     that he's really playing, the guards start to lower their
     guns. Then they start laughing. An embarrassed Harry
     slinks by Gregg, who can't help but chuckle as he leaves.

     Joe.

     Jill dashes away and runs over to Gregg. She is
     absolutely glowing, bouncing around with happiness.   She
     grabs both his arms, jumping up and down.

     Jill surprises Gregg by giving him a hug. Gregg looks over
     her shoulder and sees that Joe is giving him the evil eye.
     He's jealous. Gregg stares back, equally challenging.

     Jill, unaware of the competition, lets go of Gregg and
     happily runs back to Joe. Gregg and Joe continue to hold
     each other's eyes. Cecily sighs and shakes her head.

       a small group of V.I.P.s being led on a tour by Harry.

                               HARRY
                 This fellow is one of only three
                 hundred wild yaks remaining on
                 the planet. There are those who
                 would ask, why should we care if
                 this sub-species of yak survives?

       We SPOT a man blending in with the group. We recognize
       Garth. He looks quite respectable in a suit. The antsy
       V.I.P. next to Garth interrupts Harry.

                 Excuse me.   Can we see Joe?

       The other V.I.P.s echo this wish.   Harry refocuses
       himself.

                 night's benefit.

       The V.I.P.s laugh and groan. Garth takes this moment
       to slip away, unnoticed. Harry twinkles at the V.I.P.s.

      Jill smiles to herself. She turns to get back to her
      other business, and almost walks right into:

      Gregg. He's been leaning against a wall, and he's
      caught the whole thing.

                   brought 'em back for ya.

      Jill just stares for a moment, trying to decide how to
      handle Gregg's sudden reappearnce. His clothes look
      travelled in, and another month in Africa has put a
      deeper shade of brown on his face. He's got the ragged
      look of someone who's just gotten off a 16-hour flight.

      as he reaches in his pocket and pulls out one of the
      poaching dog collars. Garth looks around -- then gives
      the metal clappers one loud shake -- quickly drops them
      back into his pocket.

      Joe reacts immediately to the JANGLING sound. Imprinted
      deep in his memory. He rises up quickly and GROWLS
      furiously -- pounding his chest -- looking around for the
      danger. It's instinctive and frightening. Joe sees Garth
      and charges him. Joe's anger takes him into the
      electrified wire around the habitat. JOE ROARS at the
      shock and recoils.

      Gregg is very close to Jill. He wants to kiss her right

      she'll let Gregg kiss her.

      Jill has done her job.    Joe is calm but spent, leaning
      against a tree.

      Jill sits in his lap, softly singing the same lullaby
      we heard her mother sing to her 12 years ago.

      She caresses the palm of Joe's giant leathery paw, her
      tiny white hand almost disappearing in its black folds.

      Gregg watches, leaning against a tree not ten feet away.
      It is the most intimate moment between Jill and Joe that
      he has seen yet. The tableau invokes myth: the beauty
      in the service of the beast; the man who has come to
      free her.

      his head and GRUNTS at him, a kind of warning bark for
      Gregg to stay where he is.

                  Ladies and gentlemen, can I
                  have your attention, please?

     Strasser puts his drink down, taps Garth.

                                STRASSER
                  Let's go.

     The two of them head for the exit.


     AT PODIUM - WITH BAKER

                                BAKER
                  When was the last time you laid
                  eyes on something so unique, so
                  spectacular, that it literally
                  took your breath away? Well,
                  prepare yourselves, for tonight
                  you will have such an experience.


     WITH STRASSER AND GARTH

     Heading for the exit, they hear Baker's words and exchange
     a knowing glance -- if they have their way, tonight will
     be more of an "experience" than Baker is bargaining for.
     Garth slips his hand into his jacket, checking for the
     dog collar...

     Just as Jack and Vern start coming the other way. Jack's
     already had one glass too many, and he's reckless on his
     feet.

     Smack! Jack collides with Garth, causing Garth to drop
     the dog collar. Vern stoops to retrieve it, (picking it
     up by a rusty key that is one of the clanking objects on
     the collar).

                                 VERN
                  Sorry!   Here's your... uh... key
                  chain.

     Garth grabs it back.      Strasser nods coolly to Vern and
     Jack.

77   EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - CONTINUOUS ACTION                             77

     Joe is feeding on bamboo in the center of his habitat
     when something abruptly catches his ear. A slight
     JANGLING sound, the TIMPANI of WIND CHIMES, floating
     through the air. It GROWS LOUDER.

     Joe stands up. The hair on his neck bristles. He moves
     towards the source of the sound, at the edge of the moat.


     JOE'S POV

     Garth stands at the railing surrounding the moat,
     rattling the dog collars. It's a sound that haunts him,
     from the darkest depths of his memory. He starts to GROWL
     and then he sees something that really drives him nuts.

     Strasser steps into the light, joining Garth by the
     water's edge. He rattles the dog collar, and now...


     ZOOM IN ON JOE

     His eyes, locking with Strasser's. His pupils narrow,
     his nostrils flare, and Joe FREAKS OUT!

     He starts tearing up the ground, beating his chest, then
     he ROARS and charges straight for them, stopping at the
     water's edge.

     locking eyes with Joe. This is the first time he has seen
     Joe since the animal bit his hand off twelve years ago. A
     smile creeps across his face.

                                STRASSER
                         (to himself)
                  So you haven't forgotten me.   Good.

                          dead hand)
                  Have you forgotten this?

     Garth is still rattling the dog collar, enjoying Joe's
     display of rage.

                                GARTH
                  What do you think the big guy is
                  worth? A couple million?

                                STRASSER
                  I will get that for the paws alone.
                  After we sell him off piece by
                  piece, who knows how much we'll
                  make?

     Garth shakes the dog collar more furiously, making Joe
     rush at them again.

                                GARTH
                  Got you going now! That should
                  rattle the jewelry off the ladies.

     clank in the breeze -- he is in a truly frightening state.

                                STRASSER
                  Come, we've done our job here.

     As Strasser and Garth leave, Joe looks after them, beside
     himself with fury. Outraged, he turns this way and that
     way, finally focusing on a tall tree in his habitat.
                                                              81.

     At the podium, Baker is making his presentation to the
     tony crowd.

                             BAKER
               ... and now to introduce our
               remarkable new acquisition, I would
               like to bring up to the podium the
               director of the conservancy...

     A sudden ROAR coming from behind the curtain drowns out
     Baker's voice. The audience members jump in their seats,
     frightened. Baker is rattled, too, then regains his
     composure.

                             BAKER
               Well! I suppose there's no need
               to add to that introduction.

     The audience laughs and relaxes.

                             BAKER
               Here's Dr. Harry Ruben.

     Baker motions to Harry, who freezes with a sudden bout of
     stage fright. Cecily gives him a discreet push on the
     back and he stumbles forward.

     JOE can still be heard GROWLING and beating his chest in
     the background. Jill and Gregg look at each other with
     mounting anxiety.

     Harry reaches the mic.

               Extinct. Never to return. We

               is a tragedy...

     Another O.S. ROAR from JOE. It is spine-tingling.    Harry
     almost jumps out of his loafers.

     be really afraid -- they're just excited and twittering.

     Jill is feeling increasingly nervous. She glances around
     the room and meets eyes with Strasser. He nods at her,
     his eyes indicating that he is "worried" for Joe as well.
     Jill nods back.

     We continue to hear uncanny SOUNDS from behind the curtain.
     It's all Harry can do to stick to his speech. He keeps
     glancing nervously over his shoulder.

                                HARRY
                  But tonight, rather than focusing
                  on what we've lost, I'm going to
                  introduce you to something we've
                  found.

     There is a tremendous CRACKING sound from behind the
     curtain. The audience murmurs. Harry sweats. Jill
     grabs Gregg's hand tightly.

     CRASH! Before Harry can say "Young," a TREE comes
     CRASHING through the curtain.

     Gregg leaps forward, knocking Harry out of the way just
     as the tree crushes the podium into kindling.

     Joe comes blasting through the hole in the curtain.    He
     has joined the party.

     Joe stands on the stage, his chest heaving. There is
     total silence. The party guests are frozen with fear,
     literally speechless. A few of them laugh nervously,
     wondering if this is really just part of the show.

     But Jill knows better. She and Gregg exchange glances
     -- what the hell is going on?

     Jill rises, trying to stay calm herself, and slowly
     approaches Joe, speaking in a soothing voice. She
     wants to get his attention.

     Jill is within arm's reach of Joe -- it looks like he
     might turn his head to her, calm down, become docile...

     But that's when he spots Strasser. Joe's face registers
     towering rage as Strasser stares back, provoking Joe
     further.

     Joe takes off, knocking over a table that bangs into Jill
     and sends her flying backwards into a wall. She hits the
     wall and sinks down, stunned.

     heads through the people towards Strasser.        The party

     hoists him into the air.

      holding tranq rifles.

      Gregg lowers his gun, a pained expression on his face.

      But one tranq dart is not enough to stop Mighty Joe.    He
      rises again, ready to smash Strasser...

      A animal control officer has been posted outside the
      bunker, the conservancy's lockdown building for animals
      that get out of control. He stands next to his squad car,
      a rifle at his side.

      A holding room.    A cage criss-crossed by six-inch steel
      bars.

      Joe stares out through one narrow window. He sees a
      bar-striped slice of blue sky. He reaches up one hand
      towards the window -- he can't even fit it through the
      bars. He still looks drugged and despondent. Hunched
      over. His head almost scrapes the ceiling. His breathing
      raspy.

      On the other side of the bars, Jill and Gregg hover like
      distraught parents. Jill pets Joe's fur through the
      bars.

     They turn to see Harry, poking his head in the room. He
     still looks freaked out from the events of the night.

                                HARRY
                  Can I talk to you for a second?

     Jill nods. She takes one last look at Joe, then walks
     out of the room, leaving...

     Gregg, alone with Joe for the first time since Joe held
     him upside down in the jungle.

     Gregg leans against the cage next to Joe. They have never
     been in such close proximity before. The expressive-ness
     in Joe's eyes is uncanny -- Gregg feels almost as if he
     could understand what he's saying.

                                 GREGG

                  to do everything I can to get you
                  out.

     Gregg reaches out for Joe's paw and lays his hand in it.
     Joe gently curls his fingers around Gregg's hand.

     room that looks into the holding cell. Harry is still
     extremely rattled from the fiasco of the night before.
     He's trying to act tough but he's torn up inside, not sure
     who he's worried about more -- Joe or himself.

     lost her respect and it bugs him more than he'd like to

     He leaves the room, brushing shoulders with Gregg,
     entering. Judging from the expression on Gregg's face,
     he's overheard the whole thing.

     that's about as close as he wants to get to them. Using
     urgency as an excuse, he jumps back into the trailer
     before anyone can engage him in further conversation.

     Cecily moves off, leaving Gregg and Jill alone to say
     good-bye. They look into each other's eyes, hating to
     part, everything they have to say to each other still
     unsaid.

     Jill is crumbling. For her, it's awful to leave him, but
     he's not acting heart-broken at all. Confused, she tries
     desperately to stay light. She chatters like a nervous
     schoolgirl.

     She doesn't get the rest of her sentence out because Gregg
     is kissing her mouth. It's the kiss he's been wanting to
     give her since the day he first laid eyes on her.

     He lets go of her again, leaving her breathlessly looking
     after him. He walks to the back of the trailer.

     steps back out of the passenger's side of the trailer.

      streets. She looks over at Strasser. In the passing
      light of the street lamps, he is regaining his sinister
      sheen.

      Garth is driving the trailer very fast. They hit a
      bump, making them lurch in their seat. Jill hears JOE
      go THUD in the trailer.

                   was a worrier, too. Always
                   worrying about the gorillas. It
                   made her a lot of enemies. It led

     Strasser and Garth chuckle -- they think they're just
     sharing a private joke.

     But Jill has a troubled look in her eyes -- the foreign
     epithet has struck a chord from long ago... she struggles
     to remember...

     Then she gets it. She sees herself crouching in the
     forest with Joe over 12 years ago, overhearing Strasser's
     curses, and her blood runs cold. She glances at
     Strasser, everything dawning on her at once. The hand...
     the face... it all comes together for Jill.

     Strasser catches the look on Jill's face and knows some-
     thing is wrong. Adrenaline is pumping through her.
     Unsure of how to make her next move, Jill tries to hide
     the realization that is crashing down on her...

     She glances in the side view mirror of the truck and
     sees:

     Gregg, driving up behind them in the Conservancy vehicle.
     Jill's face reacts ever so slightly, but Strasser catches
     it. He follows her eye line, looking where she looked,
     and as he also spots Gregg, Jill knows the game is up.
     She loses it and screams:

     Jill slams her elbow into Strasser's nose. Strasser's
     face reflexively goes down in his hands. Stunned, Garth
     swerves at the wheel. Fast as lightning, Jill grabs his
     hair and slams his face into the dash.

      JOE'S POV

      Looking down at the horrified faces simply shouting at

      stumble on top of each other.

                   Police'll be here any minute.

      Strasser pulls a leather case from the truck. Then he
      reaches back in for his hunter's hat -- and sets it firmly
      on his head. We haven't seen Strasser like this since
      twelve years earlier: the hunter is back.

      The sound of SIRENS reaches their ears.       Garth is nervous
      as hell.

      FOLLOW Joe DOWN the boulevard, as he moves in a four-
      point walk through the intersection and along the
      boulevard.

      Two women coming out of a shop see Joe and scream -- that
      frightens Joe and makes him bare his fangs. Which only
      makes matters worse. He feints a charge -- and one woman
      collapses.


      JOE'S POV

      It is indeed an urban jungle -- made up of neon and
      steel.


      ANGLE

      Joe walks down the street and bumps into:


      PARKED MERCEDES

      Whose ALARM GOES OFF immediately.   Joe wheels and smashes
      the car until the sound STOPS.


      CLOSE ON JOE

      The lights and loud VOICES blend into one single tumult --
      dangerous and threatening.

      The sounds of SIRENS tell us the police are coming fast --
      a block away we see two BLACK & WHITES SCREECH INTO VIEW.

      THROUGH the crowd we see a street kid, RAY, 13, come face-
      to-face with Joe. His eyes go wide with the wonder of Joe.

                                 RAY
                   Whoa... Hey, Joe!

      It's as if he's seeing a completely different animal than
      everyone else around him. It's a look we've seen in young
      Jill's eyes.

      Ray looks down the street at the approaching cop cars and
      back at Joe. He understands the danger.

      Ray points the right way for Joe to go, away from the
      police cars. Joe watches Ray closely, as if he were
      studying the boy's face. Then he moves off in the
      direction Ray was pointing, towards:
                                                               98.

      A Mexican-American female ticket-taker hyperventilates,
      boxed in her tiny glass booth. From HER POV, Joe ducks
      down and stares at her, bringing his giant face close to
      the glass. She is speechless with fright. Joe moves on.

      Now the sounds of POLICE SIRENS can be heard APPROACHING.
      FIND Joe -- boxed in by the movie theater. Angry. He
      starts searching for a way out...

                               JILL
                Joe!   Joe!!

      But above the tumult, he can't hear her. Jill pushes her
      way towards him, when she comes face to face with...

      Strasser. Just yards away.      He flashes his sickening
      smile, raises his gun...

      ON JILL -- a look of terror crossing her face as she
      realizes she's about to die. Then, as a shadow passes
      over her, her expression of terror melts away.

      ON STRASSER -- seeing Jill's expression, his smile fades.
      Why's she so calm all of a sudden? He doesn't even need
      to turn around to know that:

      Joe is behind him. As Strasser turns slowly around, Joe
      reaches down swiftly and hoists Strasser off the ground.
      The GUN GOES OFF, barely missing Joe. JOE ROARS and
      crushes Strasser's left hand in his paw, a bone-crunching,
      slow squeeze that makes Strasser scream in agony.

      Then Joe swings Strasser around and grabs him around the
      chest with his right paw. He pulls him close to his face
      and blasts a DEAFENING ROAR into his face. Joe cocks his
      arm and heaves Strasser with mighty force into the air.

      Screaming, Strasser hurtles through space with incredible
      speed, CRASHING right through the flaming signage of the
      "Big Safari" booth, sending out a SHOWER OF SPARKS...

      ... and continues flying through the air until WHACK!      He
      hangs up on a power line.

      Strasser slips down, catching his fall with his fake hand.
      This section of the LINE is safe, but directly below it is
      a cluster of electrical junction boxes. Cracked and
      blistered by the heat of the nearby fire, they are sparking
      dangerously -- to fall on to them would mean certain
      electrocution.

      Strasser's bad hand begins to slip from the wire.
      Desperate, he reaches up with his left hand to grab on --
      only to remember that this hand has just been crushed
      by Joe, and is useless to him now.

      Strasser helplessly watches as his prosthetic comes
      unclasped from his hand and he slips the last, fatal
      fraction of an inch.

      Strasser falls onto the junction boxes, which explode in
      a shower of sparks. Strasser sizzles and dies, while above
      him, the prosthesis still swings on the wire.

      Jill stands where she is, frozen at the horrible sight
      of what has just happened. A dozen people scream and
      recoil.

      A swarm of policemen, led by Commander Gorman, watch
      Joe's violent action in stunned silence. Gorman motions
      to his men.

      He's not looking at the cops. He's focused on the Ferris

      moorings are getting looser.

                   Here.   For Joe.

      Gregg's hands and pockets are being stuffed with money as
      dozens of people begin to come forward with whatever they
      can afford. Gregg looks at Jill, overwhelmed by what's
      happening, and her face echoes his emotions...

       Busy commuters rush through turnstiles -- but stop long
       enough to throw money into a big Joe bucket manned by a
       guy wearing a gorilla suit.

       Kweli walks through the outdoor bar, collecting money for
       Joe from a half dozen villagers.

       A hand, holding a few crumpled bills, taps him on the
       back.

       Kweli turns around and comes face to face with Pindi.

      The blue sky above Africa.    CRANE DOWN to see:

      An entry gate with the words "Joe Young Wildlife Park"
      printed across the top.

      Beneath the gate: Kweli, standing with Jill and Gregg,
      is blowing a ceremonial horn, sending an ancient blessing
      into the air. As he finishes, we hear applause.

      PULL BACK to reveal 35 people -- locals, villagers,
      friends -- applauding the opening of the park.

      Voiceover begins:

                              JILL (V.O.)
                Dear Cecily: I promised to write
                you when Joe was settled and now I
                finally can. We finally dedicated
                the Joe Young Wildlife Park last
                week and it was one of the
                happiest days of my life. At last
                I have kept my promise to my
                mother.

      Under the gate, Jill jumps joyously on Gregg, and he
      whirls her around in a tight embrace.

                              JILL (V.O.)
                Joe seems so happy here. I know
                he feels that he's safe.

      Gregg looks O.S. and waves.

                              GREGG
                Hey, Joe -- come on, big guy...

      Joe comes walking INTO FRAME. Gregg smiles at Jill, very
      pleased with himself that Joe responds to him now, too.

                              JILL (V.O.)
                He and Gregg have become good
                friends. They even play together.
                And that jealous rivalry they
                had? It's all gone.

      Joe swats Gregg to the ground and takes his place next
      to Jill.

                              JILL (V.O.)
                Well... almost all gone.

      Not completely amused, Gregg picks himself up and raises
      a warning finger at Joe. Joe looks over at him, and
      purses his lips at Gregg, as if laughing at his own
      rough play.

      Joe turns and walks away up the hillside. Jill helps
      Gregg up. He puts his arm around her and kisses her
      hair. They watch Joe go.

                                 JILL (V.O.)
                   It's been a long journey getting
                   to this place, but Joe is finally
                   home. I think we all are.

      CAMERA PULLS BACK over the crowd of villagers who have
      begun singing a powerful African hymn.

      As the sound of their singing rises into the mountain
      sky, we --

      AERIAL SHOT

      TRACKING WITH Joe, who begins to run now, limbs out-
      stretched with energy and joy, claiming his freedom.

      The CAMERA RISES OFF of Joe to the verdant African
      landscape beyond. Joe's home -- protected and free.
