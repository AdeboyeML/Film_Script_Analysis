Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Nice guys finish last.

1   INT. OLD OFFICE (SANTA BARBARA, CA) - DAY (1960)          1

    The room is California Spanish, thick walls, arches, and
    light spills in from a mission window. But we don't have
    any sense of place just yet. At first there are just
    details.

    EXTREME CLOSEUP ON TYPEWRITER KEYS

    of an old Underwood upright, well-worn and ancient. A
    woman's fingertips with red nail polish are placed on the
    keys. They wiggle.

    CLOSE ON PIPE IN ASHTRAY
    Smoke curls.   A man's hand picks it up.


    CLOSE ON MAN'S HAT AND COAT
    on a coat rack.


    CLOSE ON WASTE BASKET
    Overflowing with crunched-up paper.


    MAN
    lies on a couch near the window. He stands up suddenly
    and looks out the window. AL STUMP, 40, is sharply
    dressed -- tie, dress shirt, cufflinks. He's staring at
    something.

    HIS POV - COURTYARD BELOW - BEAUTIFUL BRUNETTE

    toward Stump, then quickly turns away and disappears.

    CLOSE ON STUMP

    He sighs, and turns.
                              STUMP
              The muse has   not descended,
              Lucille.
                     (off   her silence)
              The muse has   not descended.
                     (off   her silence)
              God damn it,   Lucille, you hear me?

    ANGLE ON LUCILLE

    The woman at the typewriter, a 50-year old steno/secre-
    tary, responds calmly.
                               LUCILLE
                 The muse has not descended.

                               STUMP
                 Yes! The muse has left me
                 stranded here like a beached
                 whale -- only one phrase, one
                 word, from finishing the greatest
                 essay I've ever written! One
                 word, the right word -- Flaubert
                 called it 'le mot juste' -- I
                 ever tell you that?
    Lucille is a longsuffering saint.
                               LUCILLE
                 'Le mot juste' -- the exact right
                 word the writer needs to tell his
                 story. Yessir, you've mentioned
                 it.
                               STUMP
                 Hemingway, Faulkner, Joyce --
                 they all searched for 'le mot
                 juste' until they cried, until
                 they bled...
                              LUCILLE
                 Yessir.
                               STUMP
                 What is this essay about again?

                              LUCILLE
                 Fishing.

                               STUMP
                 I mean what is it really about?
                               LUCILLE
                 You said it was about the quote
                 unquote primal issues of survival,
                 man against nature, etcetera --
                 that's what you said.

                               STUMP
                 Ohyeah... so... we end the essay
                 with...

                 'The tarpon leaps shimmering into
                 the late cross light of the keys,

                 ... frozen in'...

    Lucille types it out.
                               LUCILLE
                 Shimmering tarpon -- very good,
                 Mr. Stump...
                        (beat)

                               STUMP
                        (patiently)
                 I don't know, Lucille, that's what
                 the Muse will tell me if she ever
                 descends.
                        (considering)
                 ... 'frozen in'...

    The PHONE RINGS -- Lucille answers it.
                               LUCILLE
                 Yes? Yes? Just a minute, I'll
                 see if he's available.
                        (covers phone)
                 It's your wife -- are you and she
                 speaking again?
    Stump's cavalier attitude stops cold.     He starts to reach
    for the phone, then stops.
                                STUMP
                 I dunno.   How does she sound?
                               LUCILLE
                 Don't ask me to interpret.

    Stump is suddenly a nervous wreck.     He hesitates.
                               STUMP
                 Tell her... tell her... I'll
                 talk... no... tell her I'm out --
                 I'll call her later...
                        (serious, dark)
                 God damn it.

                 Apparently he's out, Mrs. Stump --
                 I'll have him call you back.
    She hangs up.    The mood has shifted.

                               STUMP
                 I need a drink.
                               LUCILLE
                 What about 'le mot juste,' Mr.
                 Stump?
                               STUMP
                        (snaps)
                 Fuck 'le mot juste,' Lucille!
                 Finish the damn thing yourself.

                 whatever the hell you want it to
                 be. Did you know that James Joyce
                 let his secretary -- none other
                 than Samuel Beckett -- revise and
                 edit Molly's solliloquy in
                 Ulysses? You're my Beckett -- I
                 give you 'le mot juste!' Just
                 get the damn thing in the mail
                 so I can get paid.

    Silence.

                 Problems with the Mrs.?

    Stump reaches for a beat-up pogo stick which leans against
    the wall in his office.

                                 STUMP
                 I don't know.    I need a drink.
    He grabs his hat and coat and we begin hearing the number
    one hit song of 1960, PERCY FAITH'S schmaltzy recording of
    "A Summer Place."

    Stump pogo sticks down the sidewalk, tipping his hat to

    eccentric. He pogos across a street and towards --

4   INT. THE SPORTSMAN'S - LATE AFTERNOON                     4

    A classic city bar, a hangout for drunks, philosophers,
    and especially sportswriters and journalists.

    Our man hops off his pogo stick -- nobody even notices,
    and joins his cronies, five sportswriters full of dogmatic
    opinions on every subject known to man.

    FRANK, a sportswriter, is at the jukebox feeding quarters.
    He looks up routinely, they're all regulars here.
                            FRANK
              Hey, Stumpy...
    Stump addresses the sportswriters at the table as if they
    were a small audience in a lounge.

                            STUMP
              Awright, awright... how do you get
              five old ladies to say 'fuck?'
                            CRONIES
                     (stumped)
              Jeez, I dunno, how? Etc...
                              STUMP
              Yell 'bingo.'
    Stump laughs. The others groan. REYNALDO, 40's, black,
    speaks up. He's one of the regulars.

                            REYNALDO
              Okay, I got one --
                     (beat)
              A drunk is taking a piss in front
              of a bar, a bus drives by, real
              fast right along the curb, and
              knocks his thing off. Drunk picks
              up his thing, puts it in his
              pocket, goes into a bar, reaches
              into his pocket and puts his thing
              on the bar. 'Look't that,' he
              says, 'bus knocked my thing off.'
              Bartender says, 'that ain't your
              thing -- that's a cigar butt.'

                 Drunk reaches into his other
                 pocket and slaps another thing
                 on the bar. 'There,' he says,
                 'bus knocked my thing off.'
                 Bartender says, 'you're drunk and
                 that ain't your thing either.
                 That's another cigar butt.'
                        (beat)
                 Drunk looks down at both cigar
                 butts and back up at the
                 bartender and says, 'God damn it,
                 I mushta smoked my dick.'
    Everyone roars, even Stump. But Frank, as usual, is hyper
    serious and never quite gets into the revelry.

                               FRANK
                 Amidst this levity, gentlemen, I
                 have some real concerns. Mark my
                 words, people will look back on
                 this year and say that 1960 was
                 the year that Western Civilization
                 began its downward trajectory.
                               BILL
                 You need to get laid, Frank.
                               FRANK
                 Guys, guys, c'mon... do you really
                 think things are as good as they
                 used to be? You think Jack
                 Kennedy is qualified to be
                 President?
                               BILL
                 Kennedy may not be qualified, but
                 -- Jackie's a babe -- and that's
                 good enough for me.
                               REYNALDO
                 They're a happily married couple
                 and that oughta stand for
                 something these days...

    Every man nods in solemn agreement.

                 watch ballgames and get drunk a
                 lot. You call that writing?

                 More art was created for money
                 than for passion. Take your
                 platitudes and shove 'em, Frank.

                 Settle this right here!
    Stump raises his fists as if to fight; Frank responds.

                 Hey!
    A scuffle breaks out, a lot of posturing, feinting, but
    they're all too chicken to do anything. Nobody wants to
    fight.
    A PHONE RINGS at the bar. The bartender answers the
    phone, shouts at the obnoxious sportwriters.

                                REYNALDO
                 Stump!   For you.
    Stump goes to the phone, interrupting his own "fight."

    Stump hangs up the phone and turns. His face registers
    shock, or more precisely, bewilderment and wonder.

                 This 1905 cameo of an 18-year-old
                 youth shows a peaches-and-cream

                 The 'facts' -- and public
                 perception of those 'facts' --
                 frequently bear little
                 resemblance.
    Onscreen (B&W) -- Cobb in action -- His demon fury gives
    way to the fierce joy of his playing. He slashes a ball
    up the alley, turns first and never hesitates at second,
    and as the relay comes into third --

                               STUMP (V.O.)
                 One thing was beyond argument --
                 he was the most brilliant athlete
                 of his time... perhaps of any time.

    is something thrilling and terrifying in the image.

                  churning out the same old articles,
                  drinking at 4 in the afternoon
                  with the same old guys, the same
                  old excuses for not writing a
                  novel, the same old confused
                  marriages that we all needed
                  and were trying to get out of
                  at the same time... Cobb was a
                  god whose brilliance, however
                  difficult, could rub off on
                  me. His problems were different

15   EXT. MOUNTAIN LODGE - NIGHT                                 15

     Stump parks and approaches somewhat warily.
     The sound of BREAKING GLASS and SHOUTING voices.

     Stump hurries to the door to escape the rain and finds
     refuge under the eave. The noise is frightening from
     that close. He stands unsurely -- does he knock?
     When --

     The door is thrown open -- a black man, WILLIE, 40, with
     a suitcase stands wildly upset, screaming back into the
     house.
                            WILLIE
              Fuck you, Mr. Cobb, I have too much
              dignity to spend another moment
              with you. I hope you die before
              the sun comes up and may you rot
              in hell!
     The man whirls and is shocked to see Stump standing
     there with his own suitcase.
                              WILLIE
              Who are you?

                              STUMP
              I'm a writer.

                            WILLIE
              You mean he actually found somebody
              to take the job?

     Willie bursts out into crazed laughter, as if the world
     of Cobb was finally too absurd. Cobb and a writer? In
     this weather? In any weather? And the man walks through
     the rain, laughing, heading on foot down off the mountain
     as Stump just stares.

     Stump turns and steps into the open doorway.
                                               CUT TO:

                                                              16.

16   INT. MOUNTAIN LODGE - NIGHT                                    16
     Stump in the front door -- The place is enormous and
     barely lit. Taxidermied game hangs on the wall.
     Stump is terrified.
     A MAN is sitting in an overstuffed chair reading a news-
     paper. Dressed in a business suit and tie, he seems
     oblivious to the surrounding chaos. He also seems out of
     place.
                             STUMP
               Mr. Cobb?

     The man looks at Stump and points upstairs without
     speaking.

     More CRASHING sounds from upstairs.

                             STUMP
               Mr. Cobb?
     The silence is shattered by a SCRATCH, then VIOLIN MUSIC
     from upstairs. STATIC suggests a record is playing.


17   ANGLE ON STAIRS                                                17
     Stump climbs the stairs with caution -- Until he's just
     outside the half open door from which light spills. He
     hesitates...
                              STUMP
               Hello?   Mr. Cobb?
     A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- Ripping through the door.       Stump
     is terrified -- he gasps for air.
                             STUMP
               Thank you very much, Mr. Cobb,
               but I don't need this job that
               bad.

     Stump turns and creeps back toward the stairs, but --
     ANOTHER GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- SHATTERING a hanging LAMP.

     Stump freeses one more time.     Silence.   Then the
     voice --
                             COBB
               Yes, Mr. Stump -- you do need this
               job that bad.

                  I won't hurt you.

     Stump breathes deeply and steps into the doorway -- He
     does it as if there's no choice, accepting his fate. And
     sees:


18   POV SHOT - TY COBB                                              18
     Lying in bed in a robe. Unshaven. Bottles of booze and
     food everywhere. And bottles of pills sit on every
     surface. Two hunting dogs sit on the bed with him.
     A small record player sits next to he bed. A record
     spins, filling the room with FRITZ KREISLER VIOLIN SOLOS.
     He places the gun on      his night table, knocking pills and
     bottles to the floor      with a crash he barely notices.
     When he speaks it is      without a snarl, without threat --
     simply, even sweetly,      he says:
                                COBB
                  On the violin -- Fritz Kreisler.
                  I'm a great admirer of his. I'm
                  also a great admirer of yours.

                                 STUMP
                  Thank you.

                                COBB
                  But you are a hopeless romantic
                  and only a moderate success.

                                STUMP
                  Sir, I am the most successful
                  sportswriter in America and not
                  merely a 'moderate success.'

                                COBB
                  Of course.

     Stump retrieves some pills that Cobb is pointing towards.
     Cobb washes down a handful of pills with a bottle of
     Scotch. Momentarily revitalized, Cobb hands Stump a
     folded letter which Stump opens to read.
                                COBB
                  That's an invitation to a
                  testimonial dinner at the Baseball
                  Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New
                  York. You're taking me there --
                  when is it?

                                STUMP
                         (looking at the letter)
                  A few weeks.

                  there! Hornsby, Sisler, Ott, the
                  Waner Brothers... we used to have
                  some parties, Stump, I'll tell ya

                  Look at me closely, Al...
                         (with utmost
                          sincerity)
                  Lie after lie has been written
                  about me -- my whole life I've
                  been misunderstood.
                         (beat)
                  You're gonna tell the real story

                                STUMP
                  What's the 'real' story?
     Cobb climbs slowly out of bed.     His words are reasoned
     and not without passion.

                                COBB
                  That's why you're here.

                  See, there's two kinds of writers.

                  That could be you. Because I am
                  that subject.
     Cobb hobbles to a table in front of a window. The
     table is covered with pills, bottles, needles, and
     booze.

     Cobb grabs another bottle of booze and swigs deeply,
     liquor spilling over him. Then, suddenly, he holds up
     his hand. A calm comes over him as --
     He stares out the window into the snowy woods.       His
     rage has quickly turned into a quiet, intense,
     unsettling focus.
                               STUMP

     moves INTO VIEW.


20   CLOSE ON COBB'S FACE                                              20
     His eyes light.     A flare in his nostrils.    A twitch.     And
     utter calm.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Jameson, the man in the suit, arrives and stands in
     the back of the room. He takes notes when Cobb speaks.
                               JAMESON (MAN)
                  Sir?

     Cobb continues staring out the window at the buck.

     which swings slowly open.

     The gun shakes. Then steadies.

     Stump stands over his shoulder watching the bizarre

                  You have no vision, Stump. A

                  wrong man.
     Cobb stumbles back into bed, somewhat exhausted by the

                  Yes.
     Cobb reaches over and defiantly turns UP the MUSIC so
     that the room is overwhelmed with Kreisler's violin.
     Stump stares back at this decrepit, overpowering figure.

     Cobb gradually slips into sleep, buried in the music,
     the booze, the pills, the pain...
                                                   CUT TO:


25   EXT. MOUNTAIN LODGE - EARLY NEXT A.M.                         25
     Silence.

     The morning mist hangs thick over a snowbank in the woods.
     A rabbit scurries across the snow, some quail are flushed.

     PAN ACROSS the landscape REVEALS the lodge.    Smoke curls
     from the chimney.

                                                   CUT TO:

26   INT. LODGE - MORNING                                          26

     Stump sits hunkered over a tiny portable typewriter on
     the kitchen table. Cobb mixes a bourbon with orange
     juice to wash down some more pills, which he takes
     randomly.

     A teletype MACHINE sits on a table nearby -- Throughout
     the scene, a tape CLICKS endlessly out, piling on the
     floor. Cobb occasionally checks data on the tape.

                  'Know ye that a prince and a
                  great man has fallen this day.'
     Stump types it out, then stops.

                                STUMP
                  What the hell is that?
                                COBB
                  That's what Robert E. Lee said at
                  the burial of my grandfather who
                  was a Confederate General killed
                  at Fredricksburg.

                                STUMP
                  So I'm taking notes?

                  Hell no. That's the first

                  I ain't writing it.

                  Why not?

                                STUMP
                  It's horseshit. It's a third
                  person comment about someone who's
                  already dead. An autobiography
                  has to be in the first person --
                  plus it can't come from the other
                  side of the God damn grave.

                                COBB
                  My story can come from any damn
                  place I want.
                                STUMP
                  Not to mention you can't call
                  yourself 'a prince and great

                  What kind of a fucking writer you
                  call yourself -- all tied up in
                  rules and regulations. What's the
                  point being a writer if you can't
                  say what you want to?

                  a stenographer.

     BLAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT -- Stump types quickly, hunting
     and pecking with two fingers, reading aloud.

     Cobb checks the tape and suddenly is deep in thought
     over some information coming across. Stump types.

                  Bethlehem Steel's about to dive.

                  Coke in cans?    I don't think so.
     Cobb just stares back in disdain.      Then, suddenly --

     Cobb starts coughing terribly. He clutches his torso
     as if it were about to fall into pieces.

     Cobb grabs a bottle of Digoxin pills and flings it across
     the room in a rage. He flings bottles of pills as he
     recites his ailments.

                                COBB
                  They give me Darvon for the

     overcome with painkillers.

     Stump stares at the sleeping volcano of a man, and
     when Cobb starts snoring heavily, he rises, pulls on
     a coat, scarf, and hat, and heads out the door.

     Snow flurries greet Stump as he heads outside, and
     darkness is falling. He takes a deep breath.

                  his painkillers gracefully
                  provided.

                  My sanity would soon depend upon
                  a frequent breath of fresh air, a
                  walk in the woods -- any escape
                  from what one sportswriter had
                  called 'Cobb's brooding soul that
                  bubbled with violence.'
     Stump lights a pipe as he walks up a trail, away from the
     lodge, toward a ridge, all covered with snow. The
     flurries of snow are getting thicker now.
                                STUMP (V.O.)
                  I knew most of the Cobb stories --
                  first man elected to the Hall of

                  Babe Ruth. Statistics that haven't

                  Legends grow in time. Tough guys
                  are tougher, women more beautiful,
                  routine acts of self-preservation
                  become heroic.

     Stump continues walking down a crest of snow, through
     a stand of snow-covered pines. The light is dark,
     purple, eerie, and Stump is lost in thought, until,
     suddenly, he sees:

     A trail of blood in the snow. He follows it down a
     slope, past a tree, growing deeper, thicker. And there
     it is --

     The buck lies dead in the snow in a pool of blood.
     Stump stops in fear, then approaches, leans down
     and examines --
                               STUMP
                  My God...
     The buck's head has a hole blasted behind the ear.

     Stump rises quickly to his feet and looks around.
     The woods are silent. Snow falls from a branch. And...
     He hurries back through the woods up the ridge, momen-
     tarily lost as the snow swirls, he finally spots the
     lodge.

     Stump bursts into the lodge as the brewing storm blows
     in.
     Cobb is standing there in a hunting jacket, high laced
     boots, a hat, with a suitcase. He holds a paper bag
     wrapped in twine.
                                COBB
                  We're going to Reno.   I want a

     A blizzard -- two cars ease down an ice-covered road
     in an increasingly horrendous snowstorm.

     Stump is terrified, straining to see through the
     flurries which grow thicker by the second. He keeps
     checking his rearview mirror.

     down.

32   EXT. HIGHWAY IN BLIZZARD - DUSK                              32

     A treacherous cliff drops quickly away from the road,
     certain death protected by an inadequate guardrail.
     Into a blizzard, increasingly out of control, the cars
     slip and slide and skid down the mountain.

     Cobb leans on his HORN -- HONK, HONK, HONK.

33   INT. STUMP'S CAR - DUSK                                      33

     Stump struggles to hang on as the car fishtails on
     the edge of losing control. He keeps glancing at
     Cobb who continues screaming.
                                COBB
                  Get off the road -- ya can't

     Stump is caught between fear and rage.

     Cobb's eyes flare -- The WIND roars, the blizzard beats
     against the windshield.

                  The man drives like an old woman...

     Cobb steps on the gas -- His car pulls out into the
     oncoming lane and accelerates to pass.

35   EXT. HIGHWAY IN BLIZZARD - DUSK                              35

     Cobb's car passes Stump's car down the steep grade.
     Insane, impossible, suicidal -- not another car on the
     road, the highway closed, barely visible... and here
     comes Cobb.

     Stump stares in disbelief as he clings to the wheel.

                                                            32.

     raging storm.

     Stump's car creeps along the edge of a deep ravine that
     plunges to a raging, icy river. The car fishtails,
     straightens, and continues on, slowly groping down the
     mountain.

     His car lights reveal tire tracks in the snowdrifts on
     the highway. The tracks skid wildly, clearly out of
     control, and head straight off the road.

     Stump stops his car and gets out -- He hurries to the
     edge of the road where the bank drops away quickly.


     POV SHOT - COBB'S CAR
     lies nose down at the bottom of a snow-filled ravine,
     thirty feet away. The tail lights are still on. The
     car is totalled.

                  Cobb!
     Stump plows his way on foot down the embankment, fighting
     bad footing and snowdrifts, until --
     He arrives at the car -- Surely nobody could survive
     this. With difficulty, he makes his way to the back door
     of the huge car and wrestles it open.

     Stump sticks the top half of his body into the car.
                                  STUMP
                  Cobb?

     Cobb lies upside down, ass in the air, his face buried
     under the dash of the car. There's blood on his face.

                  it'll do. Help me outta here.
     Stump helps Cobb back out of the car.    It is an awkward,
     clumsy, difficult task.

                                STUMP
                  There's blood!

                  ya big fucking jerk.

                  I said shut up.
     Stump drags Cobb awkwardly through the snowbank back up
     to the highway. When they get to the edge of the high-
     way, Cobb stops to stare at the tire tracks leaving the
     road.
                                COBB
                  Look't that! No guard rail! I'm

     car on the highway.

                  anything without that gun and
                  frankly it doesn't impress me to
                  keep flashing it because I know
                  you're not gonna shoot me 'cause
                  you need me worse than I need you.
                  What, you're gonna kill me?

     Cobb smiles. He loves it when someone stands up to him.
     He thrives on confrontation.

                  Here ya go, Stumpy. I like a man
                  who stands up to me.
     Stump holds the gun awkwardly, not knowing what to do.

                  Now give me the keys.   I'm

44   INT. CAR IN BLIZZARD - NIGHT                                44
     Cobb at the wheel is perfectly happy and at peace. Stump,
     in the passenger's seat, braces himself for certain death.

                            COBB
              It's only another hour -- plenty
              of time to tell you my story
              before we find us some women.

                             STUMP
              Women?   Plural?

              Some for you, some for me. We'll
              have a helluva time. The

     And Cobb launches in as he accelerates down the mountain,
     every curve risking death. He seems at peace with the
     world -- in the driver's seat, literally, on the edge of

              My philosophy is simply this   --
              Life is too short to be
              diplomatic. A man's friends
              shouldn't mind what he does  or
              says, and those who are not  his
              friends, well, to hell with  'em.
     And Cobb drifts into a story of his youth. He's suddenly
     so relaxed that he pays little attention to the road.

                  I was feeling very Christian,
                  ready to live the good life --
                  my father didn't drink, smoke,
                  gamble or chase women -- and I
                  wasn't going to either --

     The other other boys leap safely into the river, well
     ahead of the oncoming train. But young Ty stays on the
     tracks.

     He pulls the WHISTLE and screams at the young boy standing
     defiantly on the track.

     Young Ty Cobb leaps to safety, flying in front of the
     engine, out over the water till he splashes, mere milli-
     seconds before he would have been crushed to death.

     Young Cobb surfaces in the river and waves his arms in
     triumph. His pals shriek with delight and embrace him at
     his courage.

     Cobb tosses some money on the pile, and climbs up the
     dugout steps, shouting.
                                                      CUT TO:


55   EXT. ON-DECK CIRCLE - DAY (B&W)                                  55
     Cobb swings the bat and shouts at the pitcher.

                                COBB
                  Hey, greaseball, check your wife
                  -- one of the players is missing!
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                            44.

55   CONTINUED:                                                   55
     The pitcher flips Cobb the finger and takes a sign, deliv-
     ering a pitch which is swung on and missed, strike three.

     Cobb heads to the plate, passing his dejected teammate
     who has just struck out.

                                COBB
                  Who the hell ever signed you?
                                  TEAMMATE
                  Go to hell.

     Cobb laughs -- He seems to feed on these exchanges, and
     he stands in at the plate, addressing the UMPIRE.

                                COBB
                  Hey, Cyclops, you're missing a
                  good game.
                                UMPIRE
                  Shut up, Cobb.
     As Cobb digs in, he reaches into his back pocket and
     drops something on home plate, in front of the CATCHER.
                                  COBB
                  Here ya go...
     The Catcher holds up a pair of women's panties.
                                COBB
                  Your old lady left 'em in my car
                  last night -- I thought you could
                  give 'em back to her.


     CLOSE ON CATCHER

     He flips his thumb, a sign for the pitcher to deck Cobb.
                                CATCHER
                  You're going down, Cobb.
                                  COBB
                  Let's go.

     The pitcher delivers a fastball right at Cobb's head --
     He hits the dirt just before the pitch arrives (and this
     is long before players wore protective headgear).

     Cobb rises, laughing defiantly.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                            45.

55   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            55
                                COBB
                         (to the pitcher)
                  That's as hard as you can throw?!
                  Shit, it that was my fastball I'd
                  wear a dress!

     Then Cobb shouts at the shortstop, a large German-American
     athlete, the great HONUS WAGNER.
                                COBB
                  Hey, Wagner! I'd shade me a
                  little up the middle if I was
                  you!
     Wagner doesn't budge, comfortable in his position, not
     drawn into Cobb's taunts. Stoic, implacable -- far from
     Cobb.
                                COBB
                         (to catcher)
                  You try to take my head off then
                  you throw a sinker away, in and
                  out, same old shit -- sinker
                  away...


     CLOSE ON COBB
     His chatter stops, his focus is intense and sudden. He
     holds the bat strangely, with a split grip, a left-
     handed batter, he dangles the bat almost parallel to the
     ground. For all his fierceness, there's a delicacy in
     the way he holds the bat. A baton, a paintbrush, a magic
     wand...


     NEW ANGLE

     Here comes the pitch -- sinker away -- and Cobb unleashes
     a swing that is at once quick and powerful. He drives the
     ball to left, the opposite way --

     Wagner lunges to his right -- But the ball skips into
     left.

     Cobb streaks to first and rounds the base viciously, daring
     to stretch it into a double but slamming on the brakes and
     returning to first when the throw rifles into second.
     Cobb shouts defiantly at the pitcher.

                                COBB
                  You God damn coward! You shoulda
                  thrown at me again! You shoulda
                  hit me in the fucking head!
                                                  (CONTINUED)

55   CONTINUED:    (3)                                               55
     Cobb looks down at Wagner who stands implacably at short-
     stop, a large, powerfully-built man.

                                COBB
                  Hey, Krauthead, I'm coming down.


     CLOSE ON WAGNER
     He just nods.


     NEW ANGLE
     The pitcher stretches, looks and delivers -- and Cobb
     breaks for second. The pitch is wide. The Catcher fires.

     Wagner takes the throw as Cobb arrives in a spikes-up
     slide.
     And Wagner swipes a brutal tag in Cobb's face -- his giant
     ham of a hand in the tiny glove clutching the ball lashes
     across Cobb's mouth. Blood gushes. The ball pops free.
     Wagner seems unbothered by the fact that Cobb is safe at
     second -- he has bloodied Cobb's face. Cobb seems unboth-
     ered by the fact that his face is a bloody mess -- he has
     stolen second. Both men seem satisfied.


     BACK IN DUGOUT
     More money is wagered.


     PITCHER
     Stretches and delivers -- Cobb takes off for third.       The
     throw is high -- he slides in safely.

     IN STANDS

     Bets are doubled. The stands are full of wagering. The
     whole ballpark is like a giant saloon -- drinking,
     smoking, wagering -- and the game is played by thugs and
     brigands.

     COBB ON THIRD

     Yells at the pitcher and Catcher.

                  I'm coming to you, greaseball!
                  Coming to kick your dago ass!


     CATCHER
     steals a glance at Cobb who takes a menacing lead off
     third. The Catcher gives a signal to the pitcher.

     PITCHER

     nods, winds up, and as he does --
     Here comes Cobb with a recklessness beyond reason. And
     as the pitch arrives in the Catcher's hands, the Catcher
     digs in to take on Cobb --
     Cobb slides spikes high, flying above the earth, his back
     leg slashing his spikes like knives. It is a slide of
     utter defiance and violence, a slide intended to harm.
     A vicious collision between Cobb and the catcher -- blood
     and dust. The ball rolls free. Safe.

     Cobb and the catcher immediately start punching and in
     seconds, a brawl breaks out, both benches clearing. As
     the police rush out to break up the brawl...
                                COBB (V.O.)
                  In those days you didn't hold
                  hands and dance with the men on
                  the other teams. They were the
                  enemy -- you fought with 'em.
                         (beat)

     Cobb enters the stadium through the dugout. The crowd
     rises to boo Cobb. The boos are overpowering.
     Cobb warms up in front of the dugout. The boos are
     deafening. The vindictive threats are ceaseless.

                  A good day to you, too, sir...
     The police escort Cobb to right field -- the roar of the
     vitriolic crowd increases.
                                COBB (V.O.)
                  Do you know what it's like to be
                  booed like that?

     Cobb in right with the cops -- the crowd on its feet,
     booing so loudly that the air is all one giant, wailing
     moan of hatred.
                                COBB (V.O.)
                  It feels wonderful! They couldn't

57   INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (B&W)                                  57

     Cobb opens a stack of mail -- a police chief and subor-
     dinate officers are with him.


     CLOSE ON MAIL
     Cut-out letters read:    "COBB - YOU'RE DEAD"

     Cobb puffs on a cigar defiantly as he reads his hate
     mail.

     Harding, Cobb and others play cards. A lot of money is

62   INT. CAR CAREENING DOWN MOUNTAINSIDE - DUSK                62
     Like an out of control bobsled -- Cobb races and Stump
     hangs on for his life.

                            COBB
              After World War Two, General
              Patton asked me for an autograph
              -- he said he patterned himself
              after me!
                     (beat)
              Are you getting this?

                            STUMP
              'Cause I'm trying to have a good
              grip on things when this car goes
              over the next cliff! I ain't
              ready to die yet!
     Cobb's tone changes suddenly -- he questions Stump with-
     out guile or anger, as if his answer is obvious.
                            COBB
              But neither am I.

     Cobb stares at Stump, waiting for an answer, and forgets
     about the road.
     Stump looks up in fear and points at the road.

                            STUMP
              Ty!

     Cobb swerves wildly back onto the road, such as it exists
     in the blizzard.
                            COBB
              I said I'm not ready to die.

                  an office across the courtyard
                  from you in Santa Barbara?
     Stump is nailed.

                  When   it comes to women I'm a total
                  shit   -- the difference is, Stumpy,
                  that   I know I'm a shit.

     Suddenly something appears ahead on the roadside. Cobb
     doesn't see it. Stump does. It looks like a figure,
     huddled, wrapped, immobile in the swirling snow. It
     can't be...

                                   STUMP

     Cobb brakes -- the car spins to a stop some distance past
     the figure standing knee-deep in snow.

                                COBB
                  Whoever it is he's gotta be pretty

     Stump trudges back to the half-frozen figure who flails
     his arms stiffly at the apparition of a car in all this.
     The figure is wrapped in blankets, his head covered. We
     cannot see who it is until we are in his face.
                                 FIGURE IN SNOW
                  Help me.   Please help me.

                  My God... it's you.     Are you okay?
     It is Willie, the black man who Cobb fired the day
     before.

                                WILLIE (FIGURE IN SNOW)
                  I can't believe you found me...

                  I told you that you'd only last

                                STUMP
                  Cobb's in the car. He's driving.

     Willie stops trudging toward the car.
                                WILLIE
                  Mr. Cobb's in the car?

                  Then I'm not getting in the car
                  with that son of a bitch. I'd
                  rather take my chances out here.
                                STUMP
                  You're coming!

     And Stump drags Willie to the car, though the man is re-
     luctant the whole way, he is in no condition to resist.

                                WILLIE
                         (muttering the whole
                          way)
                  He hates me. He hates black
                  people...

                                STUMP
                  He fucking hates everybody. Don't
                  give him the pleasure of dying out
                  here.
                                WILLIE
                  If dying out here gives him
                  pleasure then I won't die out
                  here.
     They get to the car -- Stump opens the back door to help
     the nearly-frozen man into the car. Cobb grumbles.
                                STUMP
                  Ty, it's Willie. We can give him
                  a lift to town.

                                COBB

     of the car and aims it right at Cobb's head.

                                STUMP
                  Shut the fuck up and give him a

     And Cobb jumps on the gas -- the car races off, back down
     the mountain, fishtailing as it goes.

     racing down the highway in the snow, and we go      out
     hearing Willie recount the greatest ballplayers      of all
     time -- all of them black -- as Cobb seethes, a      gun to
     his head. Stump feeds Willie, watching Cobb's       racism
     simmer.

     Into the storm the car disappears -- fishtailing down the

     The blizzard grows thicker, the flurries taking over the

     lives. Until:
     THUD -- the car slams into a bank of snow.      Suddenly,
     silence.

     The three men sit without speaking for several beats,
     slowly acknowledging that they have survived. Finally:

     Willie tips his hat and trudges to the neon glow in the
     distance. Cobb and Stump alone in the car.
     They both look out -- the car is buried, hood deep, in

73   INT. LAST CHANCE HOTEL - NIGHT                               73
     Stump helps Cobb to the registration desk in a clean, but
     very modest old hotel.
     A WOMAN, 30s, stands at the counter in the middle of some
     dispute with the clerk. She wears a long, cheap, plain-
     cloth overcoat and galoshes.
     Stump bursts in, oblivious to the conversation in
     progress.

                                STUMP
                  Two rooms, please...

     The woman turns to confront the two men.     Now we see her.
     On a fabulous platinum-blonde wig is stuck    a yellow
     slicker-type rain hat. The ear flaps are     awry, the
     platinum-blonde wig curls up around it --    the effect is
     thrilling.

                                WOMAN IN WIG
                  Stand back, you old farts. I'm
                  in the middle of something --
                         (back to clerk)
                  The heat's on the blink and
                  the mattress is lumpy -- I
                  want a discount.

                                CLERK
                  Aw, c'mon, you always want a
                  discount, Mona.

                                RAMONA (WOMAN)
                  Ra-mona... and the mattress
                  is always lumpy --

     Cobb pulls out a bottle of pills and washes a handful
     down with a deep swig from a pint bottle of whiskey.
     The Clerk looks on with alarm.
                                STUMP
                  Excuse me, I've gotta get him
                  checked in. He's very sick.

                                RAMONA
                  We're all sick in the eyes of God
                  -- but some of us still have
                  manners.

     She whirls and leaves the lobby, leaving the three men.
                                STUMP
                  Two rooms, next to each other.

74   INT. COBB'S ROOM - NIGHT                                      74
     Stump helps Cobb shoot up with insulin -- The needle
     clumsily groping for a vein in the old man's arm.

     CLOSE ON COBB

     His face looks terrible, drawn, drained.

     Cobb reaches into his pouch and pulls out a bundle of
     cash and security notes, tied neatly with a string.

                                COBB
                         (barely audible)
                  My money...
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                            60.

74   CONTINUED:                                                   74
                                STUMP
                  Your money's okay, Ty, right
                  here...
                                  COBB
                  My gun...

                                STUMP
                  Your gun's okay, too... right
                  here...

     And Stump hands Cobb his beloved pistol, which Cobb
     takes with great affection and comfort.
     Stump helps Cobb into bed, covering him with a blanket.
     The gun and the money sit on the pillow next to his
     head.
     Cobb speaks with great pain just before he passes out
     from pain, drugs, and exhaustion.
                                COBB
                  We haven't missed the testimonial
                  dinner, have we?
                                STUMP
                  No we haven't missed the dinner...
                                  COBB
                  Good, good...
     Cobb manages a small, pained smile before drifting
     off into sleep. Stump turns off the light and exits.

                                                  CUT TO:


75   INT. STUMP'S ROOM NEXT DOOR - NIGHT                          75
     Stump pours a glass of vodka, settles into a chair, and
     dials the phone. He swallows deeply of the drink, and
     waits.
                                STUMP
                         (on phone)

                  Your birthday was yesterday?!
                  No, it couldn't be!

     Stump quickly checks a calendar on the wall and realizes
     he's missed his son's birthday.

                  Omigod, what can I say? I feel

                  jeez... When I get off the road
                  we'll do something special -- a
                  late birthday, eh? Maybe you
                  can go to spring training or
                  something with me, eh? Yeah...

                          answer)
                  Okay, okay -- I feel terrible
                  about the birthday... I'll call
                  you real soon. And tell your
                  mother I'm not drinking anymore.
                  Okay... 'bye, 'bye...
     Stump hangs up the phone -- Takes a deep breath,
     and...
     He pours another drink, and sits down to his typewriter.
                               STUMP
                  Fuck it...
     Stump is hunkered over his typewriter pounding away.       His
     VOICE OVER indicates what he is writing.
                                STUMP (V.O.)
                  I was a fool for thinking Cobb's
                  brilliance might be what I needed
                  at this moment of my life... Ty
                  Cobb was the last thing I needed.
                         (beat)
                  He was not misunderstood -- he was
                  understood perfectly well. He
                  hated blacks, he hated Jews, he
                  hated Catholics -- he hated
                  everything except himself and his
                  own view of the world...
                         (beat)
                  At times it seemed like he would

                  lost in the past, paranoia, and

     Stump asleep -- full sun shines in the window.       Noon.
     A BOTTLE CRASHES against the headboard jarring Stump to
     consciousness. He looks up to see:
     Cobb reading the pages in a rage.     He tears them as he
     does.
                                COBB
                  'Pathetic, paranoid, lost in the

     bottle.

     INT. HOUSE - NIGHT (B&W)

     The woman hears noises on the balcony and leaps out
     of bed in terror.

     CLOSE ON WOMAN (B&W)
     She turns and looks toward the bed.   We don't see
     whatever she's looking at.

     The window.    It starts to open.
                             COBB (V.O.)
               My father had high standards...
               the highest. He believed in
               quality... he believed in
               education... he believed in God...
               he believed in me... he believed
               in my mother... But on that night
               he seemed like a prowler... and
               so --

82   EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT (B&W)                                    82
     A SHOTGUN BLAST takes out Cobb's father's stomach
     and he reels back onto the balcony. He rolls to his
     elbows and looks up.

                             COBB (V.O.)
               My mother killed my father...
               shot him in the belly...
                      (beat)
               And then blew his head clean
               off...

83   INT. STUMP'S ROOM AT HOTEL - DAY                               83

     Cobb stands above Stump who is still in bed.
                                COBB
                  How's that? A pretty God damn
                  good piece of psychology, eh?
                  That what you're looking for?
                  The childhood incident that
                  explans me?!

     Cobb spits on the papers of Stump's text.
                                COBB
                  Well I was a prick before it
                  happened and a bigger prick after
                  it happened so stick that up your
                  Sigmund Freud ass!

     Silence.   Stump is shaken by this story.
                                STUMP
                  Your mother killed your father?

                                COBB
                  And you ain't printing it.
                                 STUMP
                  I have to.
                                COBB
                  Not if I say so. I don't think
                  you understand something -- I have
                  final editorial approval of the
                  book.

                                  STUMP
                  No, I do.    I always have it.
                                COBB
                  Did you read your contract?

                                STUMP
                  It's my standard contract. I just
                  signed. I would never have agreed
                  to this if you had final approval.

     Cobb calmly picks up the phone and hands it to Stump.

                                COBB
                  Call your agent.
     Stump quickly dials and gets an answer.

                                STUMP
                  Hello? Charlie? Al... I'm in
                  Reno... yeah... things are fine...
                         (beat)
                  Yeah, listen... I'm just checking...
                  did we give away final editorial
                  approval on this Cobb book?
                         (long beat of
                          disbelief)
                  We did? Cobb has it? Jesus...
     Stump listens long and hard -- his face sinks.
     Cobb smiles and hangs the phone back up for Stump who
     reaches for the bottle on the nightstand and pours
     himself a morning drink of vodka.

                                COBB
                  Well, you were pretty stupid to
                  give up approval, weren't ya?
                                STUMP
                  Fuck you, Cobb?
                                COBB
                  Fuck me? Why me?
                         (suddenly charming)
                  Why you mad at me? Your agent made
                  the deal, your lawyer, your
                  publisher, you didn't even read
                  the contract because you trusted
                  them! Who the hell ever trusted
                  a lawyer or an agent?! If I was
                  Al Stump, the guy I'd be pissed
                  off at would be Al Stump!
                                STUMP
                  Listen to me, you son of a bitch --
                  if you die before the book is
                  finished, I'll write the story I
                  want.
                                COBB
                  But I ain't dying first.

                                STUMP
                  I'll write slow.

     Cobb lights a big cigar -- and sets fire to Stump's
     pages. Both men watch them go up in smoke.

                                COBB
                  Now get dressed so we can go
                  find some women...
     Stump just stares back -- exhausted and overmatched.

     Cobb and Stump at a table drinking and eating.
     A cigarette girl works the room at a nearby table.      She's
     all legs and fishnet stockings... and wig.

                  Look't that -- hundred bucks says

     The cigarette girl turns and we recognize her.

                  My God -- it's Mona... Ra-mona...
                  We met her at the hotel...
     Ramona is a vision in this outfit as she approaches them.

     Ramona delivers the cigars and collects the money.
     Stump is a bit chagrined and caught off guard by this
     Cobb.

     The spotlight flies to Cobb who kisses Ramona's hand.
     Stump has been left out of the exchange, and mumbles.

                     Sweet Georgia Brown...
     Cobb breaks into a little dance with Ramona at the table,
     much to Stump's (and Ramona's) amazement. For a moment,
     at least, there is great footwork and lightness in his
     movement -- we get a glimpse of the great athlete he once
     was.
                                LOUIS PRIMA
                  The great Ty Cobb! C'mon up

                  Of course they want me.

     without effort, a walk enhanced by drugs and booze. As
     he does, Ramona turns to Stump.

                  great ballplayers playing right
                  now -- how well do you think
                  you'd do against today's players?

                  Well, I figure against today's
                  pitchers I'd only hit about .275,
                  .280...

                                LOUIS PRIMA
                  That's amazing, Mr. Cobb,
                  considering your lifetime average
                  is nearly a hundred points higher.
                  Why do you think you'd only hit
                  .275 against today's pitchers?

                  that's why, God damn it. Give me
                  that thing.
     Cobb grabs the mike and takes over.

                                COBB
                  First of all I wanta thank you
                  for that song, 'Sweet Georgia
                  Brown... it's a great song about
                  my home state and I appreciate
                  it...
                         (beat)
                  That song has become the theme
                  song for the Harlem
                  Globetrotters...
                         (as Prima nods with
                          a smile)
                  It's too bad such a fine song had
                  to be stole by a buncha niggers
                  playing a faggot game in their
                  underwear...

     Prima and his cohorts are aghast. They cling to the hope
     that this is some put-on, some joke. They force a small,
     unnatural laugh.
     Stump winces and leaves the room, heading for the bar.
                                COBB
                  'Course the Globetrotters are
                  owned by a Jew named Saperstein
                  so whadda you expect?
     A disaster.     Prima tries gamely to seize the mike back.

                                LOUIS PRIMA
                  Thank you very much. Another
                  round of applause for the Georgia
                  Peach, Ty Cobb!

                                COBB
                  I got the mike, Dago -- gimme a
                  God damn minute. Nobody's got
                  respect for their elders any
                  more.
     Cobb turns to the crowd which, even in it's drunken state,
     is appalled and in disbelief.

                  Now let me explain to you how to
                  hit a baseball. It's a lost art.
                  Ever since that half-nigger Ruth
                  started hitting home runs, the
                  skill, the art, and the science
                  have been lost.

     Cobb grabs a clarinet from a member of Prima's band.

                  Now, say this is a bat...

     BACKSTAGE

     The CASINO MANAGERS and SECURITY FORCES are quickly
     gathering to figure out what to do.
                                CASINO MANAGER
                  Let's just haul him off --
                                SECURITY OFFICER
                  That's Ty Cobb! He'll fucking
                  kill me!
                                COBB
                  You see, the bat is like a wand,
                  a magic wand... it should be
                  caressed, held like a woman...
                  like a woman who's really in need
                  of a man...


     OFFSTAGE
     The Casino Manager winces and consults.

                                CASINO MANAGER
                  Oh God, here we go...

                                COBB
                  Hitting a baseball is really very
                  easy... you can't force it... you
                  can't overpower it... you go with
                  the pitch... you let the bat do
                  the work... it's all rhythm and
                  flow...
     And Cobb starts demonstrating hitting techniques to the
     bewildered audience and casino staff. He strikes that
     familiar, strange stance -- choked up on the bat, a split
     grip, the bat held parallel to the ground...

85   INT. CASINO BAR - NIGHT                                    85
     Stump sees Ramona at the bar, her cigarette/cigar tray on
     the bar. She's smoking and working her way through a
     tall drink. He approaches her.
                               STUMP
               Excuse me.

                             RAMONA
               You again? You could learn some
               manners from your friend.

                             STUMP
               I'll try harder.
                      (motions for
                       bartender)
               You're a beautiful woman.

                               RAMON
               It's the wig.
     Ramona pulls the wig off her head revealing a sea of
     bobby pins and hair pins tying her natural brown hair to
     her head. She sets the wig on the counter and scratches
     her natural scalp.
                             RAMONA
               The damn thing itches but it's
               good for tips. Give me a
               scratch, will ya?
     Stump scratches the back of her scalp, somewhat embar-
     rassed and somewhat aroused.
                            RAMON
               Turn you on? Hey, Harvey, another
               round. On him.

                             STUMP
               Vodka and grapefruit juice.
     Ramona slaps the wig back on her head. Slightly
     akilter. She doesn't care. Harvey delivers another
     round.
                             STUMP
               Your wig's crooked.

                             RAMONA
               Does it bother you?

                             STUMP
               No, no... I was just --

                  You wanta go to bed with me,
                  right?

     Stump is so taken aback that he doesn't know how to
     answer. Flustered, he looks around, then takes a deep
     hit on his drink. He is very unsure.
                                STUMP
                  You want money?
                                RAMONA
                  I'm not a whore! I don't screw
                  for money?! Jesus!

                                STUMP
                  I'm sorry. I didn't know.     I
                  mean I'm not good at this.
                                RAMONA
                  Just divorced, huh?

                  It's written all over ya.    Giant
                  letters right across the
                  forehead. D-I-V-O-R-C-E.     Ha!
                  Plain as day.
     Ramona lets out a loud, hearty laugh without inhibition.
                                STUMP
                  It's obvious, huh?

                                RAMONA
                  Obvious.

                  So, if ya wanta pay me to screw,

                  Then I won't.

                                RAMONA
                  All this ambiguity -- I see why
                  she's divorcing ya.
     Stump, completely befuddled, lets down completely. He
     doesn't care about getting laid or drunk or anything for
     the moment, except having someone to talk to -- the some-
     one is Ramona.

                                STUMP
                  I don't know what I'm saying or
                  doing anymore... I'm trying to
                  speak my heart.
                                RAMONA
                  Oh God...

                  I told my wife I wanted a
                  divorce. She said 'okay' -- then
                  I realized maybe I don't.
                                RAMONA
                  Then go back to her.
                                STUMP
                  No.

                                RAMONA
                  Then quit crying. You want a
                  divorce, you don't want a
                  divorce, you're asking marital
                  advice from a woman you're trying
                  to get in the sack -- Jeez
                  Louise!

                                STUMP
                  I'm not myself.

     A sigh.   Stump is lost.    He motions to the bartender.

                  This assignment has me befuddled.
                  I'm supposed to tell the world
                  that a monster is really a
                  prince. I'm supposed to lie.

                                RAMONA
                  Then it's not a lie. It's a job.
                  Quit agonizing -- take the money,
                  do what you gotta do, and get it
                  over with.
                               STUMP
                  I can't.
                               RAMONA
                  Then quit.

                  For godsakes why not?
     Stump has to think about this for a while.

                                STUMP
                  He knows greatness. I'm in the
                  presence of greatness. I want to
                  learn about greatness.
     She looks at him like he's crazy.

                                RAMONA
                  Greatness is overrated.
                                STUMP
                  Maybe you're right, maybe you're

                                RAMONA
                  So what do you want?

     Stump drinks deeply -- his heart needs alcoholic

     She grabs his vodka and takes a swig from the bottle.

                  You're so thoughtful -- the
                  others are trying to get me
                  drunk and you're trying to keep
                  me sober.  You'd be good husband

     They embrace -- and hold each other fully, doing nothing
     but holding on. Stump relaxes.

                                RAMONA
                  I'm not a whore.

                  Shh, shh... I know, I know...
     A moment of quiet, simple bliss -- when:

     The door bursts open -- the LOCK SPLINTERS with a CRASH,
     and:
     Cobb bursts into the room -- Full of rage.

                                COBB
                  You two-timing bastard! You
                  God damn Judas Iscariot! You

                  She's not 'your' girl!
     And Cobb lashes out at Stump -- Stump tries to block
     the blow, but Cobb is relentless, and Cobb hits him
     again.

     Stump falls backwards -- His head hits a corner of the
     table.
                                RAMONA
                  What're you doing?!
     And Cobb backhands Ramona across the face, knocking her
     down.

     Stump lies on the floor only half conscious. He grabs
     his head. Blood. The room swirls in front of him as --

     Cobb grabs Ramona, pulling his everpresent gun from his
     pocket as he does.
                                COBB

     Cobb jams the pistol into her jaw.

     wig falls off.
     Cobb picks it up and stares at it.

     She does -- The wig sits at a funny angle.
                                COBB
                  That's better.

                  No.
     Cobb clicks the hammer of his gun with icy calm.

                  That don't scare me 'cause if you

     Ramona removes her top -- her breasts are jammed into a
     classic 50's push-up bra.

                                COBB
                  You got big tits. I like big

                  They aren't so big. They're
                  average, actually -- but these
                  bras are great. Push 'em right up
                  there. I owe a lot to the bras
                  and wigs. A girl needs what she

     She does.    And covers her breasts with her hands.

                  Shy, huh?    Get on the bed.
     Ramona gets on the bed -- Cobb circles the bed
     continuously.

     crooked by now. She lets him. Then he falls apart, vio-

     Stump packs "his" version into a box, hiding it deep in
     his suitcase.

                                STUMP (V.O.)
                  The whole thing had become an
                  agonizing death watch, and most
                  days I couldn't believe the son of
                  a bitch wouldn't die...
     The door flies open and Cobb bursts in -- full of vim and
     vigor, a fresh set of clothes on, fire in his eyes.

                                COBB
                  Nothing like a cigarette girl and
                  thirty hours of sleep to
                  invigorate a man, Stumpy! You
                  look like shit.
                                STUMP
                  Been writing, Ty...
     Cobb goes straight for the typewriter and yanks out a
     page, grabbing the stack of typed pages as well.

                                COBB
                  Well let's see how we're doing...
     Cobb reads the pages with utter seriousness.       Stump
     watches.
                                COBB
                  Yes, God damn it, Stumpy, yes!
                  Now you're getting it! None of
                  this Sigmund Freud bullshit!
                  Baseball, Stumpy, baseball! Yes!
     Cobb rushes to Stump and embraces him, almost like a
     child. His eyes are wet with tears.
                                COBB
                  You understand! People are no
                  damn good but you're different!
                  You're okay, Stumpy, you get it!
                         (beat)
                  And I can trust you...

     Stump stares back.    And nods.
                                COBB
                  Now let's go roll us some dice,
                  Alimony, I feel a hot hand coming
                  on!

93   INT. CASINO - NIGHT                                           93
     Cobb and Stump approach the gaming tables and as they do,
     Cobb is recognized and approached for autographs. He
     signs as he walks, suddenly gracious in this moment.
                                COBB
               Y'see how it    works, Stumpy... they
               boo ya your    whole career, then
               when you're    about to kiss off,
               they put ya    on a pedestal. That's
               what being a    legend's all about.

     Arriving at a craps table, Cobb barges right in.
                             COBB
               Send the dice to the Peach, boys,
               and belly up to the bar...

     The croupier pushes the dice to Cobb who places a bet, as
     do the others.
     Cobb rolls the dice -- but he sees something.     Somebody.
                             COBB
               Stumpy, what is that?!

     Cobb's voice silences the tables.    Ramona looks up.

     Ramona seizes the moment and kisses Willie on the cheek,
     draping herself all around him as if they were close.
     The intention is strictly to get back at Cobb.
                                RAMONA

     Cobb on the table with a gun as Stump and police officers
     scramble to grab his gun hand. Customers hit the deck.

                  What is the world coming to?!
     BLAM, BLAM, BLAM -- the gun is FIRED REPEATEDLY into the
     ceiling fixtures, into the mirrors above the tables.
     Cobb is wrestled to the table by several men, including
     Stump. And it takes all of them to escort the struggling
     Cobb out of the casino into the lobby.
                                STUMP

     Stump hesitates, chaos swirls around them. Cobb is out
     of control, we hear threats of arrest -- when...

                  Ty, Ty, Ty, calm down. It's time
                  for the testimonial dinner!

     This stops Cobb cold.    He's immediately sober.

                  away, but it was the only thing
                  that got him calmed down enough to
                  get us out of town without getting
                  thrown in jail -- or getting
                  somebody killed.

                  Cobb as usual was oblivious to the
                  chaos he'd left in his wake. In
                  fact he was buoyed with new
                  enthusiasm at the prospects of

     deeply alarmed by this confession.

                  I was disturbed, to say the least,
                  that he felt we were friends --
                  but at least for the moment it
                  made things bearable.

                  gonna eat and fuck his way outta

                  -- next to you -- the greatest
                  player of all time. He hit 714

      straight to right field where The Babe is charging in
      like a rhino straight for Cobb. Somewhere near second

      Cobb charges outside -- FIRING his PISTOL into the air.
      The manager and a security guard hurry over. Followed
      quickly by Stump, who's now an expert at this.

                                 STUMP (V.O.)
                   He shot up his share of motels
                   for all the usual reasons --
                   guests were too noisy, he
                   couldn't get any sleep, it didn't
                   matter -- he was always boiling
                   over...

      stands with the tape recorder next to   an endless plain of
      flat desert or rolling farmland. The    hood is up on the
      car, steam spills from the radiator.    And Cobb is dictat-

                   Better yet, ring him up for me.
                          (beat)
                   Jack?! This is Ty Cobb. Go down
                   to your shop and open it up and
                   sell a tux to the great Mickey
                   Cochrane. And sell him a
                   cumberbund and a shirt and a bow
                   tie and some God damn cologne.
                   He smells like shit. What's the

                          (makes a note)
                   He'll be there in twenty minutes.
      Cobb thrusts the card into Cochrane's hand.

                   I don't have to have anything --

      Cobb poses in his tux -- proudly, unsurely.

                   You look like the greatest

      A crowd of locals has gathered and is cheering as the
      great old warriors of baseball get out of one limo after
      another and pass a phalanx of security guards, television
      cameras, and photogaphers. A P.A. ANNOUNCER presents
      each one.

                             P.A. ANNOUNCER
               The great left-handed pitcher
               from the New York Giants, who
               struck out five men in a row in
               the 19-- All-Star game -- Carl
               Hubbell.
      Lanky Carl Hubbell, 50's, waves to the crowd and cameras
      as he enters to applause from the locals gathered.

                             P.A. ANNOUNCER
               The great third baseman from the
               Chicago Cubs, Harold Joseph 'Pie'
               Traynor...
      Pie Traynor, 60's, struggles to the entrance using a
      cane.

                             P.A. ANNOUNCER
               Paul and Lloyd Waner, the Waner
               brothers -- Big Poison and Little
               Poison -- from the Pittsburgh
               Pirates...
      The Waner Brothers, 60's, jauntily wave and enter.
                             P.A. ANNOUNCER
               Fifty-eight home runs in a
               season -- Mr. Double-X -- the
               great Jimmy Foxx!

      The barrel-chested Jimmy Foxx, 60, gets out and waves.
                             P.A. ANNOUNCER
               And ladies and gentlemen, the
               highest lifetime batting
               average of all time, first man
               elected to the Hall of Fame,
               retired with over 90 batting
               records, the one and only Georgia
               Peach, Ty Cobb!
      Cobb gets out, followed by Stump. Cobb walks into the
      building, past the cameras, utterly erect and upright,
      stretching his full six feet one inch. The applause is

      Stump slips his hand to Cobb's lower back just as they
      arrive at the door, and the two men enter together.

                   Hornsby's got something on the
                   third floor -- maybe more what
                   you're looking for.

131   INT. THIRD FLOOR HOTEL - NIGHT                              131

      Cobb and Stump hurry along looking for Hornsby's room.
      LOUD MUSIC and LAUGHTER spills out of the room at the end
      of the hall. We see a woman enter the room.
                                  COBB
                   There it is!

                                 STUMP

                   I've never been readier!
      Cobb takes a hit on his flask and they knock at the door.
      Hornsby answers the door -- we can see a party behind
      him, full of old players, booze, cigars -- and even some
      women, though the whole thing is infinitely tamer than
      the smokers Cobb remembers.

                                  COBB
                   Rajah!

      Cobb starts pushing on the door.     Hornsby holds firm.

                   You're a bastard and you ain't
                   coming to our party.

      Hornsby signals to Cochrane who comes over to the door.

                   I can't let ya in, Ty. It's Rogers'
                   party. I'm an invited guest.
                                 COBB
                   God damn it, let me in!
      Cobb tries to break into the party but Hornsby rushes
      over and shoves the door in his face, leaving Ty and
      Stump alone.

                   Presidents of the United States of

                   and smoke their cigars and fuck

      Cobb heads down the hallway pounding on every door --
      he's ready to explode.

      Charles, the Hall director, opens the door for Cobb and
      Stump. He clearly has been summoned in the middle of the
      night.

                   For Mr. Cobb, no problem.
      Cobb is silent.     He and Stump enter.

      The director flips on a     couple lights -- the hall is
      partially lit. Charles      stays in the b.g., as -- Cobb
      leads Stump past all the     displays, various shrines and
      photos and old bats and     balls and records, until --

      A glass case full of Cobb's things -- his original
      Detroit Tiger uniform hangs there. Three of his famous
      "Black Betsy" bats, his glove, a couple balls, and his
      spikes.
      Cobb stands in front of the case just staring. Stump
      stands respectfully a few paces away. Cobb stares at his
      old uniform. Stump stares at Cobb.

      And Cobb starts crying, softly at first, then swelling
      until the muffled deep, convulsive sounds become more
      audible. He starts crying like a baby.

      Stump stands quietly nearby, afraid to move, until,
      finally:

                   crossed the plate and you're all
                   off balance and looking stupid,
                   the ball just kinda flutters
                   across home, slow and juicy and
                   hittable, and as it crosses the
                   plate, the ball looks at you and
                   smiles a nasty smile and laughs
                   its way into the catcher's mitt...

                   Cobb parted with some of his hard-
                   earned money and rented a limo in
                   order to make what he called a
                   'grand re-entrance to his beloved
                   home town of Royston...'

      Cobb marks the margin of the manuscript.

                   He loved the manuscript, as well
                   he should -- it made him out to be

                   The book, like Cobb, was almost
                   finished. But he was dying slower
                   than I was writing, and like
                   everything else, he viewed it as a
                   competition that he was not going
                   to lose.

                   About fifteen years ago.     But she

                   There! No... damn....


      BACK TO SCENE
      The limo cruises slowly through a quiet neighborhood.
                                 STUMP (O.S.)
                   Maybe she moved.
                                  COBB
                   There!   I think...

      LIMO

      stops nearby.

                   I'll see if it's her.   Wait here.
      Stump gets out of the car and heads up the walk.

      Stump knocks at the door -- the door opens -- a woman in
      her 60s appears. It is FLORENCE COBB XXXXX.
                                 STUMP
                   Good day, ma'am. I'm looking for

                   I have your brother in the car.

                   Yes.   And he'd like to see you.

      COBB'S POV FROM CAR - STUMP AND SOMEBODY

      He can't quite see who it is from his angle.


      BACK TO SCENE
                                 FLORENCE
                   I don't wish to see him.
                                 STUMP
                   It's been a long time, he said.
                   He's not well.
                                 FLORENCE
                   I have nothing to say to him, and
                   wish to hear nothing he has to say
                   to me.
                                 STUMP
                   I know there's been problems, but
                   the family is very important to
                   him.

                                 FLORENCE
                   Young man, the family he talks
                   about never existed.

                                 STUMP
                   He loved his father.
                                 FLORENCE
                   If his father, if my father, was
                   such a great man, why did Tyrus
                   turn out to be so evil?
      Stump hesitates.      He doesn't have a ready answer.

                                  STUMP
                   He's dying.   He just wants to see
                   you.

                   No.

      And she politely closes the door in Stump's face. Stump
      turns, sees that the limo is at such a distance that Cobb
      couldn't possibly have seen, or heard, her. He returns
      to the limo.

      Stump climbs back in next to Cobb. He motions to the
      driver to head off -- the limo does.

                                COBB
                   Well?
                                 STUMP
                   It wasn't your sister. The woman
                   in the house said your sister moved
                   a long time ago... she doesn't know
                   where.
                                 COBB
                   You cocksucking liar. My sister
                   doesn't want to see me and you're
                   lying.
      And Stump, at last, goes off --
                                 STUMP
                   Liar?! A cocksucking liar?! Of
                   course I'm a liar! That's what
                   I'm paid to do, isn't it?! Lie

                   Who would take care of you?

                   I listen to your bullshit, I

      The car stops. Stump climbs out, searching for room
      and for air to breathe. The skies are overcast and
      dark.

      Stump walks away from the car and from Cobb.     Some wind
      blows, and the threat of rain.
                                 STUMP

      Cobb is out of the car on his cane -- following Stump.
                                 STUMP
                   And go to hell!
      A line of lightning signals a storm in the distance.
                                 COBB
                   Oh, I'll do that, too.
                          (beat)
                   And look how convenient you've
                   made it.

      They look up -- The entrance to the Royston Cemetery.        A
      casually-maintained slope of several acres up a hill.

                                 STUMP
                   That was your sister alright, and
                   she didn't want anything to do
                   with you either!

                   I forgive her.
      Stump walks into the cemetery to escape Cobb, who follows
      nonetheless with a cool resolution. Stump laughs at
      Cobb's comment.

                   Forgiveness is crucial to human
                   maturity and religious growth.

                   I'm angry?
      Through the cemetery they keep walking, up a long hill
      full of tombstones and shrines and sprays of dead and
      dying flowers and gaudy plastic bouquets. Cobb following
      steadily along with his cane, several paces behind Stump.

      THUNDER shakes the ground.     And more lightning.
                                 COBB
                   Are you angry because I discovered
                   you were a whore? Is that it,

                   Sure ya do. You're just so used
                   to accommodating people that you
                   don't know what you want anymore.
                   I accommodate nobody.
      Stump whirls near the top of the hill to face Cobb who
      continues making his way along, slowly and surely.

                                 STUMP

                   I heard she fucks everybody -- she
                   must be everybody's friend!
      A mausoleum looms behind Stump, bigger than anything in
      the cemetery, classical, outsized, monumental, even
      elegant. One simple word is above the door, carved in
      granite: COBB.
                                 COBB
                   I'm glad we're here -- I was gonna
                   bring you here anyway sooner or
                   later --
      Stump turns to see the mausoleum, and the word COBB.
                                 STUMP
                   Which Cobb of Georgia is that?
      Several beats as the men take it all in.      Finally:

                          (with pride)
                   That is me.

      And rain suddenly falls from the skies, threatening to
      soak the two men.

      Cobb heads for the mausoleum -- Stump follows.

      Just enough room for the two men to stand. On either
      side of them are two crypts, enough for four burial
      vaults. Cobb is very calm now, and lucid. Rain falls
      heavily outside.

                   Then why are you such a bastard?

                                 COBB
                   Being a bastard is a small price
                   to pay for greatness. I, too,
                   am a great man.

                                STUMP
                   Let me go!

                   My mother didn't kill my father.

                   What're you talking about?
      Cobb's fist clinches Stump's throat, forcing him to hear.
      Outside the mausoleum, RAIN pours down now, a Southern
      spring thunderstorm unleashing torrents.

                                 COBB
                   My father told my mother he was
                   leaving town for the weekend but
                   he came back to the edge of the
                   woods where he tied up his horse...

145   EXT. MOONLIT ROAD THROUGH SOME WOODS - NIGHT (B&W)             145
      A horse shakes its head, attached to a buggy.

      A man starts through the thinning woods.

      The woman whirls -- She hears a noise.   She ducks down.
      She reaches under the bed and pulls out a shotgun.
      She lifts the shotgun up awkwardly and without
      familiarity.
                              COB (V.O.)
                I stood by my mother when she was
                tried for murder a few months later.
                I said she was noble and true and
                loved my father completely and the
                whole thing was an accident and she
                was acquitted as she should have

                   My mother's lover killed my father.

      Cobb's father raises the winow -- KABLAM! The lover
      FIRES into his stomach. Cobb's father lurches onto
      his back.

      The lover unloads the second shell -- blowing his
      head off.

      Lightning. Cobb still holds Stump by the throat.
                                 COBB
                   Well?! Is that what you want?!

                   it are dead! But it ain't going
                   in the book, either, 'cause you're
                   the only friend I got left, and
                   you're the only man I can trust.
      Cobb lets Stump go, relaxing his grip and --

      Stump rages back outside into the rain.       Cobb stays
      dry in the doorway of the mausoleum.

                   So your mother's lover blew your

      Cobb quietly takes a hit on his flask from the doorway
      of the mausoleum, watching Stump rant and rave in the
      rain.
                                 COBB
                   Public relations are overrated.

      Cobb holds out his flask for Stump.

                   You need a drink.

      Cobb motions for the limo to pull up the slope towards
      them.

                   You're too angry, Al, you just
                   gotta learn to let it out.
      Stump stands in the rain screaming at Cobb who stands
      out of the rain, calm, centered, drinking, dying.
                                 STUMP
                   I'm gonna tell the truth about you,

                   hate women, Jews, and niggers!

                   You shouldn't use the word 'nigger',
                   Stumpy, it's racist and demeaning.
                   And I don't hate women -- I'm just
                   not very good with 'em, which puts
                   me in the same boat with you and
                   every other man I know.

                   The children of America need

      And Cobb helps Stump into the limo, which pulls out of
      the cemetery still being drenched by rain.

      Both men are sitting in rocking chairs in front of a
      fireplace. Stump is in a bathrobe, his feet in a big
      pan of warm water, a bottle of booze in his hand. He
      looks a mess. Cobb is idly playing with his pistol.
      He's calm, introspective.

                   As a boy I stood in court next to
                   her because suddenly I was the man
                   of the house but as I stood there
                   steadfastly by her side and heard
                   the jury say 'not guilty' I knew
                   she'd been with another man the
                   night of the killing.
      Stump drinks deeply once again.

                                 COBB
                   A man must defend his mother at
                   all times, isn't that right, Al?
                   Or am I a fool?

                   A man must defend his mother

      And the two men sit there silently, rocking slightly,
      trying to stay warm, when there is --
      Suddenly a KNOCK at the door -- They stare at each
      other.

      Cobb puts down the gun, struggles to the door and answers
      it.

      A MAN stands in the rain, carrying a briefcase, trying
      vainly to keep dry.

                   You're being sued for divorce.

                   But my wife and I are still

                   Yeah, and what she's saying is

                   Fuck me? Well fuck her.     No,
                   fuck him.
      Stump reaches for the gun and aims it at the man.

                                 STUMP
                   You ain't serving me no papers.

      The Man is frozen with terror as Stump rises from the
      chair -- drunk and crazed, aiming the shaky gun.
                                 MAN WITH BRIEFCASE

      He's drunk, he's not experienced with guns, he's shaking.

                   You're absolutely right, Tyrus,
                   I've been accommodating people
                   my whole life and it stops right
                   here.

                   You've killed a man. I'll kill a
                   man.
      KABLAM!   KABLAM!   He misses again.

      The Man drops to his knees, begging for his life.
                                MAN WITH BRIEFCASE
                   No! Please, dear God! I have a
                   family, too!

                   Don't give me that sob-sister
                   stuff!
      Stump tries to hold the gun with two hands, approaching
      the man, to nearly point-blank range.

                                 COBB
                   Al... no... Al... Al...

      Stump looks crazed, a bathrobe falling open, his feet
      bare and wet, his hair awry from the rainstorm. He aims
      the gun at the man's head, looks at Cobb with wild glee.

                   Life is too short to be
                   diplomatic. A man's friends don't
                   care what he says or does. You're
                   my friend, Ty, right? You're my

                   No!
      Stump pulls the TRIGGER -- CLICK.     Empty.

      As the Man looks up, realizing he's alive, Stump strikes
      him across the face with the gun, drawing blood.

      The Man scrambles to his feet and races from the room,
      grabbing his briefcase, and running to the door.
                                 MAN WITH BRIEFCASE
                   You're crazy! No wonder she
                   wants to divorce you! You're
                   crazy!
      And the Man runs into the rainy night, leaving Cobb and
      Stump.
      Stump's head collapses in his hands -- Bewildered,
      exhausted. The two men sit alone for several beats
      before Stump speaks. He is completely lost.
                                 STUMP

                   and pulled the trigger. I wanted
                   to kill him.

      Stump crawls on the bed toward the pillows with the
      stupid grace of a drunk looking for a key under the mat.

      Cobb helps Stump lie down, pulling a blanket over him.
      Stump rolls over to go to sleep, Cobb tucks the blanket
      around him, and picks up the bottle from the pillow.

      Cobb takes a last hit of the bottle -- Finishing it off.
      He throws it to the ground, and looks around the room for
      another.

      COBB'S POV - STUMP'S SUITCASE

      lies open on a chair.   A nearly-full bottle of Scotch is
      visible.


      BACK TO SCENE
      He makes it to the bottle -- Steadies himself -- he's ex-
      hausted. He takes a deep swig from the Scotch. Several
      deep gulps, enough to kill a horse, but it only helps him
      steady himself.
      And he sees something in the suitcase -- He looks down
      at --

      which Stump has been filling with his secret manuscript.

      Cobb opens the box and pulls out a paper.   He reads it.
      He looks at Stump, and --
      Cobb takes the box and the bottle to the chair by the
      fireplace, where he sits down, puts on his reading
      glasses, and starts reading "the real story."

      He reads page one slowly and carefully, then starts mov-

      stationery, cocktail napkins, legal pads, all handwritten
      in secret. He keeps glancing up at the bed where Stump
      is in the deep stupor of sleep.

                   Ty!
      Stump leaps out of bed and looks around.

      Three holes of broken plaster and mirror.

                   God...


      BACK TO SCENE
      He rushes to the fireplace where only embers now glow.
      He sees something --

      STUMP'S POV

      The "real" manuscript scattered around the floor near the
      chair. Nearby, the bathroom door is open.
      Stump hurries into the bathroom and stops cold.
      Blood is on the sink and on the towels. A note is on the
      mirror. He pulls the note down and reads it.

                                 COBB (V.O.)
                   'Dear Alimony, you lying S.O.B.

      Deeply alarmed.

      shaved, dressed neatly. He enters.

      A CRASHING NOISE and shouting erupt from down the hall.
      A tray of food is thrown out into the hall.

                                 COBB (O.S.)
                   Get the hell outta here! You

                   Be careful. He's got a gun and
                   we haven't been able to get it
                   away from him.

                                 STUMP
                   I know, I know...
      Stump hurries down the hall to the source of the noise.
      A small group of doctors, orderlies and NURSES are
      gathered outside Cobb's door, afraid to enter. Also
      there are two civilians in business suits.
                                 NURSE #1

      Cobb sits in bed -- His gun and his money are next to
      him. He's giving orders, ranting and raving in a classic
      Cobb rage. A bottle hangs from a pole, feeding his arm.
      A doctor and two Nurses are present, trying to deal with
      him.

                                 COBB

                   Well don't poke around too long.

      He holds out his arm for her.    She begins drawing blood.

                   Yeah, God damn it, I thought I
                   could trust you -- I used to be

                   A Mr. Barton is here to see you.
                   He says he's the chairman of the

      Nurse #1 tapes Cobb's arm and escapes with the blood
      sample.

      A YOUNG DOCTOR enters, also warily.
                                 YOUNG DOCTOR
                   I need to take your blood

                                 YOUNG DOCTOR
                   I have to do it.

      The Young doctor wraps Cobb's arm with the device and
      begins pumping.
      Another OLDER DOCTOR enters and addresses Cobb head on.
                                 OLDER DOCTOR
                   Mr. Cobb. We cannot allow you
                   to have a gun in here.
      Cobb picks up the gun and aims it at the doctor.

                   Come and get it.

                   Y'know, Stumpy, my oldest son
                   was a doctor -- a hacksaw artist,

                          (increasing rage)
                   He died of a brain tumor when he
                   was forty -- hadn't spoke to me
                   in fifteen years 'cause I was
                   such a rotten father -- put that
                   in your God damn book!

                   And on July 17, 1961... Ty Cobb
                   died quietly in his sleep. I
                   don't believe it was quiet, nothing
                   he did was quiet, but that's what
                   the newspaper writer said who wrote
                   the lead and we all know that
                   writers never lie...

      A hearse enters the cemetery grounds followed by three

                   funeral service I'd ever seen.

      Stump stands in the distance, at the back of the cemetery,
      watching the simple, empty service.
                                 STUMP (V.O.)
                   He left all his money to his
                   family, though no members of it
                   managed to attend the funeral, and
                   with the rest he founded a hospital
                   in his own name and an educational
                   trust fund for poor Georgia
                   children.

                   Only three ballplayers attended
                   the service -- three oldtimers
                   who he'd been supporting
                   financially for many years, a
                   fact he didn't want made public.

                                 STUMP (V.O.)
                   Somebody rounded up some Little
                   Leaguers, probably so the press
                   photographers would have some
                   sob sister photos... the sort
                   Cobb hated... except the press
                   didn't bother coming.

                   I'll give him this -- the family
                   was under one roof again.


      BACK TO SCENE
      Stump turns and slips quietly out of the cemetery.
                                 STUMP (V.O.)
                   I called my publisher. The book

                   which one to turn in.

      Stump enters comfortably, happy to see his cronies at
      last. Frank and the others come over from the bar,
      quickly gathering around Stump.

                         (beat)
                  And I knew I would never write a
                  novel, unless you considered 'Cobb'
