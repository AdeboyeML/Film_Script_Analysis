	EXT. WALL STREET - EARLY MORNING

	FADE IN. THE STREET. The most famous third of a mile in the
	world. Towering landmark structures nearly blot out the
	dreary grey flannel sky. The morning rush hour crowds swarm
	through the dark, narrow streets like mice in a maze, all in
	pursuit of one thing: MONEY... CREDITS RUN.

	INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - EARLY MORNING

	We hear the ROAR of the trains pulling out of the station.
	Blurred faces, bodies, suits, hats, attache cases float into
	view pressed like sardines against the sides of a door which
	now open, releasing an outward velocity of anger and greed,
	one of them BUD FOX.

	EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - MORNING

	The bubbling mass charges up the stairs. Steam rises from a
	grating, shapes merging into the crowd. Past the HOMELESS
	VETS, the insane BAG LADY with 12 cats and 20 shopping bags
	huddled in the corner of Trinity Church...

	Bud the Fox straggling behind, in a crumpled raincoat, tie
	askew, young, very young, his bleary face buried in a Wall
	Street Journal, folded, 'subway style', as he crosses the
	street against the light.

				BUD
		Why Fox? Why didn't you buy...
		schmuck?

	A car honks, swerving past.

	INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

	Cavernous modern lobby. Bodies cramming into elevators. Bud,
	stuffing the newspaper into his coat, jams in.

	INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

	Blank faces stare ahead, each lost in private thoughts, Bud
	again mouthing the thought, "stupid schmuck", his eyes
	catching a blond executive who quickly flicks her eyes away.
	Paranoia in the elevator. We quickly cut into private lives.

				WORRIED MAN (V.O.)
		... he'll sue me, could be for 5-6
		million, and he'll get a million,
		the house, they'll impound my
		paychecks...damn, damn, why did I
		sign that contract?

				BLACK BIKE MESSENGER (V.O.)
		... gotta get Lola in the sack man,
		take her to the Garden for the
		Terrells, Jimmy give me the tickets
		for 12 bucks, I pull the midnight
		shift, I could do 60 bucks... wow,
		check those legs out...

	His eyes on the same blonde exec who looks away, self-
	conscious about her legs. The elevator stops at a floor,
	discards only one person. The doors close a little too slowly.

				BLONDE EXECUTIVE (V.O.)
		... jerk...
			(shifts her thoughts)
		call Hanratty. The decimal points
		on the code are uncalibrated.
		Hoskins. The signatures on the bank
		draft. Boyle, that
		bitch...insurance...tax form. Shit,
		talk to Kahn.
			(recalling)
		That's Hanratty, Hoskins, Bank,
		Boyle and Kahn... H2B2K - shoot,
		insurance and theatre
		tix...H2B2K,I,T -- and the cleaners!
		repeat...

	Catching the eyes of Bud Fox once again wandering to her.
	Camera moving to Bud who looks away.

				BUD (V.O.)
		...sorry, what a fox... funny, the
		most beautiful girls in the world
		are always on the street or in
		elevators, never get to talk to
		them, shy ... my looks, never had
		confidence in them ...
		overcompensating work syndrome...
		prove your worth with money...
		'cept I'm not making any money...
			(pause, the elevator
			at another floor, slow)
		... wonder what all these people
		are thinking about.

	Camera moving slowly again over the eyes. The silence of
	individual tension reigns over all.

				ANGRY MAN (V.O.)
		...Screw him! I'll destroy that
		sonufabitch... he thinks he can
		break a contract with me he's got
		something to learn.

				SECRETARY (V.O.)
		...9:15!... he'll kill me this
		time, he will really kill me... oh
		come on elevator!... why do you
		stop on every floor...

	As the elevator stops again to disgorge two people.

				BIKE MESSENGER (V.O.)
			(pissed now at the elevator)
		... come on man, time is money
		man... One floor here I could do
		eleven blocks...

				BLONDE EXECUTIVE (V.O.)
		H2B2K,I,T,CL,P,O,T2...
			(pause, she looks
			like she forgot something)


				WORRIED MAN (V.O.)
		...goddamn elevators!...people, too
		many goddamn people in this world!

	The elevator finally comes to a slow stop... They wait,
	plead, beg, screech with the eyes.

	The door at last opens. None of them acknowledging each
	other, they all stampede out the door with an audible gasp
	of release, a collective sign akin to making it to a urinal
	after a punishing wait...

	The elevator tension is over, but the killer grind continues.

	INT. JACKSON, STEINEM INVESTMENT HOUSE - DAY

	Credits continue to run. Bud moves past the functional
	reception area, past CAROLYN, a cheerful young black girl.

				CAROLYN
		How you doing Buddy?

				BUD
		Great Carolyn, doing any better
		would be a sin...

	He slips off his overcoat, flicks some lint off his Paul
	Stuart $500 suit, and enters the main trading room.

	Brokers mill by their desks, gulping coffee, scanning the
	papers, the quotrons. The digital clock by the big board
	counter clicks to 9:26 am -- four minutes until the market
	opens. You can smell the hunger.

	Bud takes a deep breath, tosses the newspaper away and
	struts into the office -- fuck it -- it's a new day.

	MOVING past DAN STEEPLES, a flush-faced old-timer, a blue
	and white Yale tie, with a carnation in his lapel.

				BUD
		Morning, Dan. What's looking good
		today?

				STEEPLES
		If I know I wouldn't be in this
		business. Get out while you're
		young, kid. I came here one day, I
		sat down, and look at me now.

	Past CHARLIE CUSHING, on the phone, a handsome chunk of man
	with rugged good looks and Ivy League mannerisms.

				BUD
		...hey Chuckie, how's the woman-
		slayer?

				CHARLIE
		...still looking for the right 18
		year old wife, how you doing, pal?

				BUD
		...if I had your looks, better.

				CHARLIE
			(used to it)
		...takes years of genetics, pal,
		and a Yale education... and the
		right tailor.

				BUD
		...not that you learned anything,
		Chunk.

	Bud reaches his trading desk, whips open his briefcase and
	pulls out a computer print-out of last night's homework.

				BUD
		I gotta feeling we're going to make
		a killing today, Marv.

				MARV (O.S.)
		Yeah, where's your machine gun.

				BUD
		Joke about it. I was up all night
		charting these stocks. You want to
		see this or what?

	His associate, MARVIN, a manicky wise-guy, swivels over his
	chair from a nearby desk. He gives the charts a quick read.

				MARV
			(scowling)
		Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got
		it all upside down.
			(confidential)
		Okay, I'm giving this to you and
		you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for
		you. Take the Knicks against the
		Bullets, and my pick of the day --
		Duke to beat the spread against
		Wake Forest.

				BUD
		Thanks, Marv, with that I might be
		able to qualify for welfare.

	LOU MANNHEIM, strolls in, a dignified looking older broker
	in his late 60's, wearing an old brown brim hat with button
	down white shirt, narrow tie, very much a picture from
	another era... a kind humor in his eyes... but obviously
	ailing in the legs and breath department.

				BUD
			(friendly)
		You got a look in your eye, Mr.
		Mannheim... You got something for
		the small fry...

				MANNHEIM
		Jesus, can't make a buck in this
		market, country's going to hell
		faster than when that sonofabitch
		Roosevelt was around... too much
		cheap money sloshing around the
		world. The biggest mistake we ever
		made was letting Nixon get off the
		gold standard. Putney Drug--you
		boys might want to have a look at it.

				MARV
		Take 5 years for that company to
		turn around.

				MANNHEIM
		...but they got a good new drug.
		Stick to the fundamentals, that's
		how IBM and Hilton were built...good
		things sometimes take time.

	The stentorian voice of OFFICE MANAGER HIERONYMUS LYNCH
	booms over the intercom.

	We see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit
	office; tall, balding with a perpetual worried look on his
	face.

				LYNCH
		Attention. Please. Office Production
		is down ten percent this week. I
		recommend that you all go through
		your clients' investments for any
		portfolio adjustments. And don't
		forget -- double commissions today
		on our 'A' or better bond funds.
			(looking in Bud and
			Marv's direction)
		Especially you rookies. Also,
		remember, the sales contest ends
		tomorrow.

	Bud and Marvin roll their eyes. The digital clock flashes
	9:30. The CREDITS close.

				BUD
		And they're off and running!

	The room rises to a subtle but new energy level with the
	clatter of the ticker, speakers, teletype machines,
	newsprinters' Dow Jones and Reuters, phones ringing off the
	hook. Brokers are shouting orders, running for tickets,
	dodging each other; it's a controlled riot.

				BROKERS
		Here's a hot lead... Have I got one
		for you.... sell ... dump it all!!
		... 500 at an eighth, an eighth!...
		July fifties. April thirties...how
		bout those Decembers? You see where
		they're going? ... Morgan is
		selling a billion one at the close.
		Yeah. That's right, they're selling
		all over the place... we're still
		long on the treasuries -- $110
		million. What about the Japs?
		...Where am I?
			(confused at all the
			phone lights)
		We gotta lot of lights here! Let's
		pick 'em up.

				BUD
			(on phone)
		Jack, take 50 Gulf, with a 3/8 top,
		forget the hundred. What about
		Delroy? I can go long at 23, let's
		go long...Conwest Air -- let me
		check it...

	He looks up at the TICKER... stock quotes whizzing by.

				BUD (O.S. CONT'D)
		Up an eighth. How many you want?
		It's on the floor.

	He writes the order up.

	A shot of CHARLIE CUSHING yawning as he half-listens to his
	customer, resting the phone on his kneecaps.

						DISSOLVE TO:

	THE CLOCK... It's 2.30 p.m. We hear the relentless clatter
	of the board ticker, and the drone of disembodied voices,
	blarihg market information out of squawk boxes.

	Bud's desk is now cluttered with order tickets, literature,
	crumpled notes, beverage cups and a half-eaten sandwich.
	He's on the phone and from the look on his face, the caller
	on the other end is breaking his balls. Marvin paces past,
	making a dramatic phone pitch.

				MARV
		Dr. Beltzer has to have his
		information this minute! It
		concerns his future!

	Bud waves Marvin away, answers his caller, trying to keep
	cool, worried how as he sees Lynch, the office manager,
	coming over.

				BUD
		Hey Howard, I thought you were a
		gentleman. Sure it's gone down a
		little bit, but you got the tip
		from your printer, I didn't... Yeah
		you did. That's what you said.
			(heated)
		I didn't tell you to buy it, why
		would I tell you to sell it?
			(screaming)
		No, I can't give it back! Give it
		back to who? You own it!
			(beat)
		No, he's out right now.

	As he looks up and winks at Lynch, standing over him.

				BUD
			(cupping the receiver)
		... That's what you told us to say.

				LYNCH
		Give me that phone.
			(takes receiver)
		Yes, sir, this is the manager. What
		seems to be the problem?

				MARV
			(into his phone)
		What?... Well, how was I to know
		you were in surgery? What am I
		Marvin the mind reader here?

	Bud whispers, tensely. Lynch listens.

				BUD
		He's lying.

				LYNCH
		Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with
		the broker and I'll get back to you.
		You're welcome.

	Lynce hangs up and glares at Bud.

				LYNCH
		If I'm closing out this account. If
		he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you
		pay for it.

				BUD
		Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!

				LYNCH
		Fox, you're making more problems
		than you are sales.

				BUD
		I don't think you're being fair,
		sir. You assigned me this guy, and
		you know he's got a history...

				LYNCH
		Somebody has to pay for that error.
		And it's not me.

	Lynch walks off. Bud does some quick calculations in his head.

				MARV
			(reappearing)
		Buddy, buddy, buddy; little
		trouble, huh, today.

				BUD
			(devastated)
		Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've
		got to cover his loss to the tune
		of about seven grand! I'm tapped
		out man, American Express got a hit
		man looking for me.

				MARV
		Hey, things could be worse. It
		could've been my money. Let me help
		you out, rookie.

	He takes out his wallet and loans Bud a hundred bucks.

				BUD
		Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to
		you.
			(fervently)
		You know what my dream is? One day
		to be on the other end of that
		phone...

				MARV
		Just put me on the institutional
		side of the room where the real
		cheesecake is. You forgetting
		something?

	Marvin points up at the clock. Bud looks up... it's 2:40.
	Bud quickly composes himself. He picks up the phone, dialing
	purposefully.

				MARV (CONT'D)
		Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize
		it's big game hunters that bag the
		elephants, not retail brokers. I
		heard this story about Gekko... he
		was on the phone 30 seconds after
		the Challenger blew up selling NASA
		stocks short.

				BUD
		Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's
		right, and you know everyday I say
		to myself, today could be the day...
		So what do you say... will you
		marry me? Then please can you get
		me through to Mr. Gekko?

				MARV
			(coaching)
		It concerns his future!

				BUD
		Of course he's busy, and so am I.
		Five minutes. That's all I'm asking.
		I know that if he could only hear
		what I have to say... it would
		change his life.

	INT. GEKKO OFFICE - DAY

	NATALIE, a classy attractive Englishwoman is on the phone
	with Bud, somewhat amused by his manner. She is the personal
	secretary to multimillionaire, Wall Street trader and
	raider, Gordon Gekko. His windows look out on a panoramic
	view of the city and East River.

				NATALIE
		Mr. Fox, I've told you before, I'm
		sure you're a good broker, but our
		traders talk to the brokers, Mr.
		Gekko only deals with investment
		bankers. Yes, I shall give him your
		message ...

	As they're speaking, another SECRETARY leads two well-heeled
	JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN past her desk. As she opens the door to
	the inner office and ushers them inside, we catch a glimpse
	of a figure, pacing back and forth, talking animatedly on
	the phone by the huge corner window. HE IS GORDON GEKKO. We
	hear a deafening ROAR as we:

						DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MCGREGOR'S BAR AND GRILL - NEAR LAGUARDIA AIRPORT -
	TWILIGHT

	In the background, a 747 ascends into the night sky,
	climbing over the roof tops of weathered brick tract houses.
	Bud, coat collar pulled up against the wind, crosses the
	street, entering a neighborhood bar. We see an old maroon
	Honda behind him.

	INT. MCGREGOR'S - TWILIGHT

	Dimly-lit, noisy, blue-collar airline bar. Machinists and
	mechanics still in their overalls at the bar, drinking,
	watching ESPN FIGHT NIGHT, on TV. Bud searches the crowd. A
	group of middle-aged men wave him over, BLUESTAR AIRLINES
	insignias on the pockets... CHARLIE DENT, a rugged, chain-
	smoking ex-Marine Sergeant, and DOMINICK AMATO, a big strong
	Italian greet Buddy as he comes over.

				CHARLIE
		Buddy boy, how ya doing?

				BUD
		Great Charlie, any better it'd be a
		sin.

				AMATO
			(slapping Bud)
		I hear all you guys on Wall Street
		are millionaires, when you gonna
		make us rich?

				BUD
		Gotta open an account to win the
		lottery, Dominick. Give me 15,000,
		you'll have a condo in Florida next
		Christmas.

				CARL
		... sure and we'll own the airline.
		If he makes anybody rich, let him
		make himself rich, so's he can pay
		off his school loans.

	As he signs an unemployment insurance form for one of his men.

				BUD
		... nice to see you in such a good
		mood Dad, what'd Mom do, give you
		fish for dinner? ... You're smoking
		too much, how many times do you
		gotta go to the hospital to ...

	Carl, inhaling his cigarette, grimaces formidably,
	terminating the subject.

				CARL
		...leave me alone willya. Only
		thing makes me feel good anymore.
		Spaghetti. She makes lousy
		spaghetti...

				BUD
		It's called pasta now Dad,
		spaghetti's out of date.

	Bud sitting down next to him, pats him around the shoulder.
	Dad, a sarcastic and gruff edge to him, makes a faint smile.
	He has a genuine affection and pride in his somewhat
	glamorous son.

				CARL
		... so am I. Whaddaya want, a beer?
			(to waitress)
		Hey Billie, bring another for the
		kid, he looks good, doesn't he?

	Dominick and Charlie go off. A pause. Father and son sizing
	each other up with a look.

				CARL
		... looks like you grown another
		inch... but you don't look so hot,
		getting bags under your eyes,
		starting to look old like me.

				BUD
		Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk
		D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.

				CARL
		Speak English will ya.

				BUD
		D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was
		when the options he bought took a
		bath. He reneged on me.

				CARL
			(nods, satisfied)
		I told you not to go into that
		racket. You could've been a doctor
		or a lawyer,

				BUD
		Coulda been a contender.

				CARL (CONT.)
		you coulda stayed at Bluestar and
		been a supervisor in instead of
		going customer relations by now,
		'stead of going off and bein' a
		salesman.

				BUD
			(an old story between them)
		Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How
		many times I gotta tell you I'm an
		account executive, and pretty soon
		I'm going to the investment banking
		side of the firm.

				CARL
		You get on the phone and ask
		strangers for their money, right?
		You're a salesman.
	 
			BUD
			(ticked)
		Dad, it takes time. You gotta build
		a customer list. I'm doing it. I
		could make more money in one year
		as a broker than five years at the
		airline.

				CARL
		I don't get it, you get a
		scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000
		the first year, and 50 last year,
		where the hell is it?

				BUD
		50 K don't get you to first base in
		the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I
		pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of
		15,000, I got school loans, car
		loans, food, park my car costs me 3
		bills a month, I need good suits,
		that's $500 a pop, shoes...

				CARL
		So come home and live rent free,
		'stead of that cockroach palace you
		live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the
		world is off its rocker. I made
		$37,000 last year and you...

				BUD
		It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage
		and you rent the top room--I gotta
		live in Manhattan to be a player,
		Dad. There's no nobility in poverty
		anymore, y'know. One day you're
		going to be proud of me, you'll
		see...
			(hurting)

				CARL
			(sees it)
		It's yourself you've got to be
		proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya
		need?

				BUD
			(beat)
		Can you spare three hundred? Pay
		you back next month, promise.

	Dad reaches into his pocket, looks at his cash. It hurts.
	 
			CARL
		...Got a 100 on me, you...

				BUD
			(embarrassed)
		Not in here Dad... please. Later.

	Dad shrugs, puts it away.

				CARL
		... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200
		there. Your brother never...
			(cuts off when he
			sees Buddy's face)
		...well, I always said money is
		something you need in case you
		don't die tomorrow...

				BUD
			(changes subject)
		How's Mom?

	Another man comes over with a bandage around his head and a
	compensation form for Carl to sign. ("Hey, chief").

				CARL
			(with affection)
		...same, pain in the ass, god bless
		her, talks too much... gonna take
		her to Florida next month... west
		coast, near Tampa, like to get out
		for good, but can't afford it.

				BUD
		...Work okay?

				CARL
			(lights another
			cigarette, grimaces)
		...this drug testing is driving my
		guys nuts. I got flagged for my
		blood pressure pills. The only good
		news is, we just met with the
		comptroller over some union
		stuff...'member that crash last
		summer? and the investigation?
		Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was
		a manufacturing flaw in the door
		latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em
		it wasn't maintenance, it was those
		goddamn greedy manufacturers out in
		Cincinnati. And I was right.

	He gives the signed form back to the injured man. (Carl:
	"Okay, Frank")

				BUD
		That's great Dad.

				CARL
		Damn right, it gets us out from
		under suspension. We'll get those
		new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston
		and the equipment we need. We're
		gonna compete with the big boys now.

				BUD
			(boasts)
		Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all
		I can advise is hold on to that
		stock Dad...

	They drink. Bud reflects a moment.

				BUD
		You sure about this FAA announcement?

				CARL
		About what?

				BUD
		The FAA announcement.

				CARL
		Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that
		mischievous look in your eyes. You
		used to smile just like that when
		you were a baby sleeping, just like
		that.

	Bud's mind racing elsewhere.

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

	A cramped studio facing an air shaft with bars on the window.
	Moving across to the sound of the radio alarm going off and
	the glib tones of a rock D.J. announcing the Met's latest
	streak ... The walls are papered with stock analyses and
	graphs, print out pages strewn across the floor. No other
	semblance of a personal life except clothes haphazardly
	tossed, Barron's and Fortune magazines. A GIRL's back is all
	we see, sleeping naked on the bed.

	Close on Bud's IBM computer -- his appointment calendar. Bud
	focusing on an underlined notation: G.G.'s BIRTHDAY.

	Bud stares at the clock: 4 a.m. He picks up a prospectus for
	a chemical company, starts reading.

	EXT. GEKKO BUILDING - MORNING

	Bud, crossing lower Broadway, enters a magnificent towering
	glass structure.

	INT. GORDON GEKKO PENTHOUSE OFFICES - MORNING

	NATALIE, Gekko's British secretary, is completing shorthand
	notes as the intercom buzzes. A logo for "GEKKO & CO. is
	behind her.

				RECEPTION
			(off)
		... I have a delivery here for Mr.
		Gekko. It's a personal item and the
		gentleman says you have to sign for
		it.

				NATALIE
			(frowning)
		...all right, send him in...

	INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

	Bud, somewhat nervous, is led down an impressive hallway
	hung with expensive modern art... past a huge Calder mobile
	and a pool of some 15 traders on phones, quotron terminals
	and keyboards... into Natalie's outer office.

				BUD
		Hello, Natalie, you recognize the
		voice? I'll give you a hint, you're
		thinking seriously about marrying
		me...

				NATALIE
			(recognizing the voice)
		What are you doing here?

				BUD
		...And you're even lovelier than I
		pictured. I brought a birthday
		present for Mr. Gekko.

				NATALIE
		First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't
		just come barging in here. And what
		makes you think it's his birthday?

	Bud takes out an old crumpled Fortune magazine cover of
	Gordon Gekko, entitled "Gekko the Great!"

				BUD
		It's in the bible, see. You better
		go buy him a present. Please,
		Natalie. Let me give him the gift;
		Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his
		favorite and hard to get.

				NATALIE
			(sighs)
		Stay here, I'll see what I can do.

	She takes the gift and enters Gekko's office. Bud paces
	nervously. Natalie re-appears, stern, but a note of
	compromise in her voice.

				NATALIE
		Wait outside.

	INT. GEKKO OFFICES - OUTSIDE RECEPTION AREA - DAY

	Bud on the courtesy phone, hangs up, looks nervously at his
	watch. Almost 12. He's lost some two hours of business.
	Natalie suddenly comes out, without a smile.

				NATALIE
		Five minutes...

	Bud brightens, pumping himself in the mirror, muttering.

				BUD
			(to Natalie)
		Well... life all comes down to a
		few moments, and this is one of 'em...

	He follows Natalie.

	INT. GORDON GEKKO'S OFFICE (BUD'S POV) - DAY

	Furnishings in hypermodern gray and black lacquer, Modern
	Art ranging from black field paintings by Ad Reinhardt to
	the smashed dishes of Julian Schnabel. Nautilus equipment,
	hi-tech gadgets are in evidence, including a splendid Howard
	Miller World Time Clock, and a world map...

	Three of Gekko's people, young MBA's dressed for success,
	are scattered about the room, on phones, calculators, coming
	in and out.

	GORDON GEKKO aka Gekko the Great as the media calls him,
	dressed in a custom English suit, paces on the phone with
	the restlessness of a caged tiger, a 50-foot extension cord
	attached to his blinking 130 line silver-plated telephone.
	On his ears is a headset.

	He is carrying on overlapping conversations with a myriad of
	bankers, partners and lawyers; pausing to issue commands to
	his aides while keeping his eye on the stock prides spitting
	across a bank of quotron monitors, carrying everything from
	New York Exchanges to London, commodities, gold, and
	currency values. A second Secretary and sometimes Natalie
	exit and enter with various messages written on a piece of
	paper, indicating a waiting party on the phone. Gekko often
	shakes his head "no".

				GEKKO
			(on phone)
		... what the hell is going on? I
		just saw 200,000 shares move, are
		we part of it, we better be, pal,
		or I'm gonna eat your lunch for
		you... get on 1.
			(switches lines)
		Sorry, love it at forty. It's an
		insult at fifty. Their analysts
		don't know preferred stock from
		livestock...
			(a beat, mischievous smile)
		wait for it to head south, then
		we'll raise the sperm count on the
		deal... right. Get back to me....
			(to Alex, an aide
			listening an the
			other line)
		This is the kid that's called me 59
		days in a row. Wants to be a player
			(to Bud)
		There oughta be a picture of you in
		the dictionary under persistence.
			(back to phone)
		Look, Jerry, I'm looking for
		negative control, no more than 30
		to 35%, just enouqh to block
		anybody else's merger plans and
		find out from the inside if the
		books are cooked. If it looks as
		good as on paper, we're in the kill
		zone. We lock and load pal...get on 3.

	ALEX DE BETANCOURT, a tall handsome Frenchman, jots a note
	and follows Gordon over to line 3. Gekko's dark intent eyes
	fixing briefly on Bud who stands waiting in the corner. He
	motions him to sit.

				GEKKO
			(new line)
		Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?...
		No, not interested.
			(eyes an Quotron, to
			Ollie, a trader)
		Ollie, start calling a the
		institutions, start with Marx at
		Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me
		that California retirement money,
		baby! And we're on our way!

				OLLIE
		You got it, G.G.

	OLLIE, a gigantic 200 pound man wearing pink suspenders,
	rises and walks to another phone, past Bud...

				GEKKO
			(back on line with
			Billy, listening)
		... check the arbs for MacDonald's.
		Yeah, I'm having a Mac attack.
		20,000 shares. For about 30 minutes.
		Lunch? Are you joking -- lunch is
		for wimps. Get back to me...
			(to Alex)
		4.

	Bud's eyes on the framed "tombstones" from the Wall Street
	Journal commemorating Gekko's successful deals; they hang
	like scalps from the walls. Gekko's eyes drifting to Bud, a
	friendly easy smile for a flick of an instant, he has
	genuine charm in his manner and though ultrafast verbally,
	projects calm and confidence at the center. A man who
	obviously loves what he does, to some small degree is
	flashing his stuff for the outsider.

				GEKKO
			(line 4)
		Look Harold, they're vulnerable,
		alright, but we don't want 'em to
		think they're under accumulation.
		Go slow. Call Geneva and the
		Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint
		towards it but we wait...

				ALEX
		What about tipping off Yurovich?

				GEKKO
			(grimaces)
		If I ever need surgery, get me the
		heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's
		never been used...Happy Holideals
		Harold...

	Hangs up, eyes to Bud. His headset comes off.

				BUD
			(nervous)
		How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.

				GEKKO
		So you say. Nice to meet you; hope
		you're intelligent. Like these,
		how'd you get these?
			(indicating cigars)


				BUD
			(tries a smile, awkward)
		...got a connection at the airport.

	Gekko notes the answer, wrapping the cuff of a state-of-the-
	art, automatic blood pressure monitor around his arm and
	starts pumping it up. His aides continue on the phones.

				GEKKO
		So what s on your mind kimosabe?
		Why am I listening to you? Got to
		monitor my blood pressure, so
		whatever you do, don't upset me.

				BUD
		Oh no, no...

				GEKKO
			(demonstrating it)
		Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor
		computes your systolic and
		diastolic pressure. Has an LCD
		readout, and it's cost effective --
		less than one visit to the doctor.

				BUD
		I just want to let you know Mr.
		Gekko I read all about you at NYU
		Business, and I think you're an
		incredible genius and I've always
		dreamed of only one thing -- to do
		business with a man like you...

				GEKKO
			(smiles, impatient
			with the speech)
		So what firm you with, pal?

				BUD
		Jackson, Steinem...

				GEKKO
			(nods)
		...going places, good junk bond
		department, you got the financing
		on that Syndicam deal.

				BUD
		...Yeah, and we're working on some
		other interesting stuff.

				GEKKO
			(fishing)
		...A cosmetics company by any
		chance? What are you, the 12th man
		on the deal team? The last to know?

				BUD
			(smiles)
		Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.

				GEKKO
		So whatta you got for me, sport?
		Why are you here?

	Bud opens his attache case and rifles out a handful of
	briefs. Gekko noting the blood pressure reading and taking
	the cuff off his arm. Ollie, the big trader, ambles back in,
	says something to the third aide, a young intelligent-
	looking woman SUSAN TURNER.

				BUD
		Chart break-out on this one
		here...uh Whitewood-Young
		Industries...low P.E. Explosive
		earnings. 30% discount from book.
		Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders.
		Strong management.

				GEKKO
		It's a dog, what else you got,
		sport, besides connections at the
		airport?

				NATALIE
		Mr. Stevenson in San Fransisco.

	Gekko takes the call, cutting Bud off.

				GEKKO
		He respond to the offer? What? What
		the hell's Cromwell doing giving
		lecture tours when his company's
		losing 60 million a quarter? I
		guess he's giving lectures on how
		to lose money...if this guy opened
		a funeral parlor, no one would die,
		this turkey's totally brain
		dead...Well Christmas is over and
		business is business.
			(simultaneous to Ollie)
		Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch.
		Ollie I want every orifice in his
		body flowing red.

				OLLIE
			(laughs, on the phone)
		He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.

	Gekko hanging up and buzzing an aide. Throws out an aside to
	Bud.

				GEKKO
		...doesn't look like it but the
		best trader on the street...
			(to Susan)
		Sue get the LBO analysis on Teldar
		Paper and bring it here...what else?

	Bud shifting, uncomfortable as Gekko finally swivels his
	attention back to him.

				BUD
			(coming right back)
		Tarafly...Analysts don't like it. I
		do. The breakup value is twice the
		market price. The deal finances
		itself. Sell off two divisions,
		keep...

	Aiex, knowing the stock, sneers, shares a look with Gekko
	who looks up at Bud with the first sign of interest.

				GEKKO
			(laughs)
		Not bad for a quant, but a dog with
		different fleas.
			(checks his hi-tech watch)
		Come on, tell me something I don't
		know. It's my birthday, pal,
		surprise me...

	As he opens a birthday card and feeds it into the SHREDDER
	that sits next to his desk over the waste basket. The sound
	it makes is soft and menacing. Buddy knows its fourth down
	and long, Gekko's attention is shifting to the quotron. In
	frustration, Bud blurts it out.

				BUD
			(standing)
		Bluestar Airlines.

	The camera moves on him now, sudden, more intense, in a
	sense trapping him.

				GEKKO
		...rings a bell somewhere. So what?

				BUD
		A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300
		pilots, flies northeast, Canada,
		some Florida and Caribbean routes...
		great slots in major cities...

				GEKKO
		...don't like airlines, lousy
		unions...

				BUD
		There was a crash last year. They
		just got a favorable ruling on a
		lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't
		know.

	Gekko looks up, remotely interested.

				GEKKO
		How do you know?

				BUD
			(hesitates, concerned)
		I know...the decision'll clear the
		way for new planes and route
		contracts. There's only a small
		float out there, so you should grab
		it. Good for a five point pop.

	Ollie comes back in, as excited as he ever will get under
	his rolls of flesh, his voice deadpan.

				OLLIE
		... just got 250,000 shares at 18
		1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull
		twice that at 18 1/2 outta the
		California pensions. We got close
		to half a million shares in the bag.

				GEKKO
		Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away
		Ollie.

				OLLIE
		And, I'm pretty sure we got the
		Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming
		in with us and I'm working on the
		Silverberg boys in Canada.

				GEKKO
		Rip their throats out and put them
		in your garbage compactor.
			(to Bud)
		Interesting. You got a card?

	Buddy thrusts a card into his hands. Gekko glances at it.

				BUD
		My home number's on the back...

				GEKKO
			(smiles, looks at card)
		Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas
		a day. I choose one.

	Bud stuffs his notes back into the briefcase, hoping for a
	word of encouragement in the awkward silence.

				BUD
		Well, hope to hear from you, sir.

	He turns and heads out the door, still shaken by the
	revelation he has made passing Susan who hurries in with a
	dossier.

	Gekko glances at it. As Bud leaves, he overhears:

				GEKKO
			(off)
		OK gang, looks like we're going
		over 5% in Teldar, start the
		lawyers on a tender offer and 13D,
		we keep going after everything in
		sight but don't pay over $22.
		They're gonna fight, they got Myers
		and Thromberg doing their legal,
		they make Nazis look like nice guys...

	INT. OUTSIDE GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud walks glumly past Natalie, certain that he's blown it.
	She's busy on the phone.

				BUD
		...thanks Natalie.

				NATALIE
			(buzzing inside, preoccupied)
		...have a nice day Mr. Stone.
			(wrong name, doesn't
			notice, to Gekko on phone)
		... Mr. Gekko, the conference call
		is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr.
		Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in
		Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms.
		Rosco in London. They're all on.

	The phone call goes behind closed doors. Bud walks out,
	dejected.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud comes in, distracted, punches into his quatron. Teldar
	Paper comes up.

				MARV
			(comes over)
		...well, see him?

				BUD
			(mind on the computer)
		Yeah, but he didn't see me.

				MARV
		Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook
		Gekko the Great's hand and you
		still got all your fingers. He's
		not the only elephant in the jungle.

	INSERT: TELDAR PAPER. The quotron. Bud's eyes. Thinking to buy.

				MARV
			(looks)
		... got something from him? Teldar
		Paper?

	Bud wipes it off the screen, his mind made up, dismissing
	the temptation to buy.

				BUD
		...a dog with fleas.

	Lynch, the manager, stalks past with some telexes.

				LYNCH
		Where you been the last 3 hours,
		Fox? I wouldn't be sitting around
		chin wagging if I were you...
		plenty of names in that phone book
		to cold call...

	Marvin gives Lynch the Italian salute, behind his back.
	Grudgingly, Buddy flips open the massive New York phone book.

				MARV
		...got tickets for the Knicks
		tonight. Go out and cruise some
		bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?

				BUD
			(shakes his head)
		...gotta read my reports.

				MARV
		Forget charts! We're not fund
		managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn
		'em. I'm offering you the Knicks
		and chicks. God save you before you
		turn into poor Steeples over there.

	Their eyes briefly on DAN STEEPLES, red faced, desperately
	trying to make a sale on the telephone, hangs up defeated.

				BUD
		...preferably Lou Mannheim...

	Their eyes briefly on LOU MANNHEIM, in his private office,
	sitting there slumped, thinking, smoking as he watches the
	quotron.

				MARV
		Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his
		equity when his firm went belly up
		in the recession of 71. you wanna
		be coming in here in your late
		sixties still pitching? ...
		Whatever happened to that cute
		analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ...
		Cindy? Susan?

				BUD
		Cindy. Having sex with her is like
		reading the Wall Street Journal
		'cept the Journal don't talk back.
		'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining
		romance, nobody trusts anybody
		anymore, gotta get a blood test in
		the toilet before you leave a bar
		together, somebody oughtta invent
		an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make
		a fortune. I gotta get to work...
		Z's today.
			(hitting the phone
			with the directory)

	The pool SECRETARY, GINA, calls out.

				GINA
		Call for you Buddy.

				BUD
			(taking it)
		Bud Fox.

	Bud rears up in his seat. A change. Marvin notices.

	INT. GORDON GEKKO OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS - DAY

	Gekko talks into his speaker phone, gazing out the window.

				GEKKO
		Alright Bud Fox... buy me twenty
		thousand shares of Bluestar. No
		more than 15 1/8, 3/8 tops, and
		don't screw it up sport.

	INT. BUD'S CUBICLE - DAY

	The camera tracks around and in on him climactically as the
	Music Theme rises to ensnare him... We end close on Bud.
	Dumbstruck.

				BUD
		Yes, sir. Thank you. You won't
		regret it.

	He hangs up, stunned still, rises from his chair, unbuttons
	his collar and feverishly starts writing the ticket.

				MARV
		Got a little action there, eh buddy?

				BUD
		Marv,
			(turns triumphant)
		...I just bagged the elephant!

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

	The upper West Side. The young, the rich and the restless
	parade along the avenue, jamming the neighborhood restaurants
	and bars. Bud glides along, feeling a part of the crowd now,
	past a dreadlocked DERELICT swigging Thunderbird and
	shouting obscenities, shaking a wooden African spear.

	INT. RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT

	Inside a glitzy neighborhood singles bar in which Bud stops,
	everybody seems to be young and drinking margueritas. Bud
	orders a beer, surveying the room like a veteran, overhearing
	the conversation of a YOUNG TRADER to two other broker types.

				YOUNG TRADER
		...you know Marty Wyndham? He
		netted $650,000 out of that
		merger...26 years old, the guy's
		Rambo. Got himself a Porsche Turbo
		Cabriolet about 75 thou, got a
		house in Westhampton, penthouse on
		Second Avenue, gets up at 2:30 in
		the morning, he's in the office at
		4...guy never sleeps...Rambo genes...

	He blathers on as Bud surveys the room, noticing an ELEGANT
	BLONDE with a striking aloof beauty, very much the debutante
	dream Grace Kelly type, so refined that you wonder what she
	could possibly be doing out at night in public alone.

	Bud summons his courage, catches his breath, makes his way
	over... She sees him approach, obviously doesn't wish to
	talk, eyes darting elsewhere like a nervous deer.

				BUD
			(awkward)
		Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm
		celebrating tonight.

				BLONDE
			(disdainful)
		Please, no thanks...
			(looking away)

				BUD
		Look, I know you get approached a
		lot by dubious men, but I'm
		different, I never talk to
		strangers, all my life I've been
		waiting for the right person to
		walk across the room...
		you're that person, you don't know
		it but I do and if you walk away
		now I'll never see you again or you
		me. You'll grow old.

				BLONDE
		Oh really.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		I'll grow old. We'll both die. And
		we'll never have known each other.
		That's sad. At least one drink for
		a dreamer...What's your favorite
		drink?

	She looks at him, not quite sure. Is he serious or glib?

				BLONDE
			(uncommitted)
		Grand Marnier.

				BUD
		Sounds like a french word, what is it?

				BLONDE
		It's a romantic and tragic drink.

				BUD
		Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with
		a twist of fate. You know like us
		meeting. Don't go away...

	Maybe, just maybe she's his! His eyes show it as he hurries
	back to the bar to order. As he gets the bartender's
	attention, he turns and sees that she is joined by a MAN who
	looks as if he stepped out of the pages of GQ. Together they
	walk away. Stung, Bud watches as the woman of his dreams
	disappears out the door.

				BARTENDER
		What do you want?

				BUD
		...I just lost it.

	EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT (RAIN)

	Bud and a DATE he's obviously just picked up, are struggling
	to be seen in a mass of people trying to get in the hottest
	new club in Manhattan. Bud easing forward along the ropes to
	a large BOUNCER who roughly pushes one of the bridge-and-
	tunnel kids back across the rope.

	Joe discreetly shows him $50 but they guy says: "No room!,"
	humiliating him in front of his date. The bouncer shoving
	Bud aside as Gordon Gekko and KATE, his wife, and ENTOURAGE
	(ALEX, others) are shown through the ropes into the door.
	Bud says something to Gordon but it gets lost in the confusion.

	EXT. 79TH STREET & BROADWAY - EARLY DAY

	People pouring into the subway on the way to work. Bud
	rifles through the Financial Times he's just bought at the
	newsstand and finds the article he was looking for: BLUESTAR
	EXONERATED IN 1984 CRASH. He thrusts his fist in the air,
	victoriously...bounds down the subway stairs.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud's on the quotron and the phone; the word's spread around
	the office, he's landed Gekko and brokers drop by his desk
	to get the lowdown.

				BUD
			(on the phone)
		What's it at now? Still moving. Great!

				STEEPLES
		The man of the day. Pour some water
		on him to cool him off...one of
		these days I want to know how you
		got Gekko's account.

				BUD
			(indicating Dan's
			Yale tie)
		My magic tie, Dan.

				STEEPLES
		I'll trade you.

	Lou Mannheim and a Chinese LADY BROKER intersect.

				CHINESE LADY
		Gordo the Great, way to go.

				MANNHEIM
			(pleased)
		Good little company. I remember
		when we got the money for Bluestar
		to build those first planes, back
		in the fifties.

				CHINESE LADY
			(to Bud)
		I hear you're buying Teldar.

	Bud smiles back at her mischievously.

				BUD
		Sleep with me and the secrets of
		the West are yours.

				MANNHEIM
		Now that's a crap company, sure
		you'll make money on the takeover
		rumor, but what's being created.
		Nothing. No substance behind it.

				BUD
			(succinct)
		Old values. Buy.

	She hears him. As they go, Marvin swivels madly over in his
	chair.

				MARV
		Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why
		didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.

				BUD
		Hey Marv, he demanded
		confidentiality...

				MARV
		Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar
		Airlines yesterday. Today they just
		happen to get good news and the
		stock goes bat shit. You must have
		ESP. A real Nostradamus.
			(Bud ignoring him,
			picking up the phone)
		Jesus Christ, what are friends for?

				BUD
		All right, I owe you one Marv.

				MARV
		That's right, next time a little
		birdie talks to you, talk to me too
		E.F. Hutton.

				GINA
			(pool secretary)
		Buddy, phone...Gordon Gekko!

	Everybody in the adjacent area turns and looks at Buddy like
	in an E.F. Hutton commercial.

				BUD
			(on phone)
		Hi Natalie...lunch at 21?
			(looks at watch)
		I'm out the door...

	As he springs up to leave, Lynch the manager happens to be
	strolling by. He nods pleasantly at Buddy.

				LYNCH
		Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't
		you join me and the partners for
		lunch tomorrow in the dining room?

				BUD
		I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.

	INT. 21 CLUB - DAY

	Dark mahagony wood, plush banquettes, a long oak bar. Bud
	enters the main dining room in a relatively outre suit that
	hangs on him embarrassingly as other businessmen in well-cut
	suits move around him and a Maitre d' sniffs, then leads him
	to where Gekko is parked, finishing up his lunch. A half
	finished plate is removed to make way for Bud.

				GEKKO
		Hi sport.

				BUD
			(still nervous)
		Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.

	He's seated.

				GEKKO
		Try the steak tartare. It's off the
		menu but Louis'll make it for you...

				MAITRE D'
		Of course sir. And to drink?

	He looks at Gekko's bottled water.

				BUD
		Uh...just a Evian, thank you...

	The Maitre d' leaves. Gekko proudly pulls a tiny 3" by 6"
	color television out of his pocket with a 2" diagonal
	screen, flips it on to the Dow Jones avarages.

				GEKKO
		See this? Can you believe it? Two
		inch screen...

				BUD
		...I can't even see it...

				GEKKO
		...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old,
		electronics freak, got a liquid
		crystal display 'stead of an
		electronic beam. We're going into a
		new age pal. So how's business today.

				BUD
		Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth
		when I left the office. It might
		spin up to 25 by the bell...

				GEKKO
			(a tiny smile)
		Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for
		yourself? Bet you were on the phone
		two minutes after you got out of my
		office.

				BUD
			(flushes)
		No sir, that would've been illegal...

				GEKKO
			(doesn't believe him)
		Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna
		blow a whistle. Here, is this
		legal?...you wanna put it in my
		account?

	As he fishes a check out and drops it on Bud's plate.

	Greeting TWO BANKERS who stop at the table as Bud picks up
	the check, glances at it. His hand starts to tremble.

	The check is for $500,000.

				GEKKO
			(to bus boy, the
			bankers excited)
		Can we have the check over here for
		christ's sake.

				BUS BOY
			(rushing off)
		Yes sir!

				GEKKO
		Cover the Bluestar buy and put a
		couple hundred thou in one of those
		bow-wow stocks you mentioned. Pick
		the dog with the least fleas. Use a
		stop loss so your downside is
		50,000, and buy yourself a decent
		suit. You can't come in here
		looking like that.
			(Bud flushes, embarassed)
		Go to Morty Sills, Tell 'em I sent
		you.

				BUD
			(his genuine look)
		Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the
		chance. You won't regret this,
		you're with a winner.

				GEKKO
			(paying the check
			with cash)
		...put the rest of it in a money
		market account for now. I want to
		see what you know before I invest
		it...and save the cheap salesman
		talk, it's obvious.

				BUD
			(stung)
		Excuse me sir.

	Gekko rising to leave, the Maitre d' hovering around.

				GEKKO
		You heard me...I don't like losses
		sport. Nothing ruins my day more
		than losses... You do good, you get
		perks, all kinds of perks. Stay
		home tonight. Louis, take care of
		'im. Enjoy the lunch.

	Confused, Bud watches Gekko walk out of the room, pumping
	extended hands left and right. He holds the cashiers check
	up to his eyes, entranced by it, like a kid with his first
	dollar...as the raw steak tartare with an egg on top is put
	in front of him.

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Bud is at his computer when the door bell rings. He's not
	expecting a visitor. When he opens the door he is knocked
	for a loop.

	A smashing looking LADY in a fitted Chanel suit, ropes of
	chains, short tight skirt, beautiful long legs, is standing
	there. Taking in the apartment, she hides her distaste.

				LISA
		Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of
		Gordon's.

				BUD
			(in a daze)
		Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure.
		Would you, uh, like to come in?

				LISA
		Didn't he tell you?
			(sighs)
		That's so like Gordon. Get dressed,
		we're going out.

				BUD
		We are?

	EXT. BUD'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	A stretch limo is parked in front, neighborhood WINOS
	inspecting it. The CHAUFFEUR opens the back door, as Lisa
	steps inside, Buddy in tow. The winos clap, howling at her.

	INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

	Bud in the back seat next to Lisa, gazes out the black
	tinted window as they drive away, then turns to her as she
	gives him a bottle of Champagne to open.

				BUD
		So, where are we going?

				LISA
		Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the
		River Cafe...or maybe we can just
		drive around for a while.
			(provocatively)
		Work up an appetite.

	She crosses her legs. Bud's eyes moving south. He pops the
	cork. Lisa does a little blow, offers him.

				LISA
		Want some?
			(he shorts)
		Gordon tells me you're a very
		talented broker. What do you like?

				BUD
			(feeling the rush)
		Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...

				LISA
		I got this guy who should know
		tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I
		been burned on tips. What do you
		think Bud?

				BUD
		Let's see, it closed at uh, 41
		1/8...
			(his voice cracking)
		Up a quarter...very attractive...
		about average yield...

	She unzips his fly.

				BUD
		Rising profits...strong balance
		sheets, good earnings per share.

				LISA
			(removing her blouse)
		So you're hot on this stock?

				BUD
			(nods, moaning)
		It's ready to take off. I'd jump
		all over it if I were you.

	As she pulls up her skirt and climbs on top of Buddy.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - MORNING

	Buddy, in an obviously new Mort Sills suit, struts past
	Carolyn at the reception desk, in high spirits.

				CAROLYN
			(smiles)
		Morning Buddy, you look happy.

				BUD
		Any better and I'd be guilty.

				CAROLYN
			(picking up the flow)
		You were never that innocent sugarpie.

				BUD
			(coyly)
		...how do you know? You wish...

						WIPE TO:

	Bud on the phone, gazing at the ticker, concern in his eyes.
	CLICKING of the tape ticker comes up over the music. He
	looks at Marv.

						WIPE TO:

	Later. Research reports piling up. Bud's secretary trying to
	get his attention. Bud's concern growing, as the green
	fluorescent numbers spit across the board. CLICKER growing
	louder. Pan to Marvin, hands cupped in prayer. To Dan
	Steeples who closes his eyes and shakes his head.

						WIPE TO:

	Close. Bud watching the tape -- dizzying, hypnotic blur of
	numbers. The roar of the clicker, drowning out the music...a
	runaway freight train.

						WIPE TO:

	Bud's hands clamped over his eyes. The numbers stop. Noise
	recedes. He opens his eyes, looks down at his desk, stacked
	with reports and phone messages, as the pool secretary,
	GINA, calls out. Marvin glumly coasts over in his chair.

				MARV
		Boy, we sure went down the toilet
		on that ugly bitch. If we were
		Japs, we'd have to stay with our
		aircraft.

				GINA
			(calls out)
		Mr. Gekko's office is after you. Be
		at the Wyatt Club courts at six...

	Bud looks worried, at Marvin.

	INT. WYATT CLUB SQUASH COURTS - DAY

	Games in progress on the four courts, heavy hitting sounds.
	Crossing to Gekko and Bud going at it. Bud is obviously the
	worse for wear.

				GEKKO
			(amused)
		...come on sport, you gotta try
		harder, I need some exercise for
		chrissake...

				BUD
			(out of breath)
		Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go
		on.

				GEKKO
		...finish out the game, Bud, push
		yourself...

	Meant paternally or sadistically, it's hard to tell. Gekko
	hits the ball, a big fat shot. Bud returns, Gekka moves him
	around the court, as if punishing him, the kid exhausted but
	the ball's never quite out of reach -- till Bud finally
	can't take it anymore and at the end of his breath, smashes
	into the wall and collapses. Gekko laughs. Bud lying there
	like a sad dog as Gekka hauls him up.

				GEKKO
		The public is out there throwing
		darts at a board, sport. I don't
		throw darts at a board. I only bet
		sure things. Read Sun Tzu's "The
		Art of War." 'every battle is won
		before it is ever fought.' Think
		about it.

	He exits the squash court.

	INT. WYATT CLUB STEAM ROOM - DAY

	Gekko and Bud sit alone, wreathed in steam.

				BUD
			(sweating)
		Nice club, Mr. Gekko...

				GEKKO
		Yeah... not bad for a City College
		boy. Bought my way into this club
		and now every one of these ivy
		league schmucks is sucking my
		kneecaps...I just got on the Board
		of the Zoological Society, cost me
		a million; that's the thing with
		WASPS -- they like animals but they
		can't stand people!

				BUD
			(easing into it)
		Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little
		loss today. We got stopped out on
		Tarafly...
			(Gekko waits)
		...about 50 thousand.

	Gekko's expression is frightening but cool.

				GEKKO
		I guess your father's not a union
		representative on that company.

				BUD
			(laughs, shocked)
		What? How do you know about my father?

				GEKKO
		The most valuable commodity I know
		of is information. Wouldn't you
		agree on that?

				BUD
			(exhaling deeply)
		Yes...

	INT. WYATT CLUB LOCKER ROOM - DAY

	Buddy is slumped on a bench after taking a shower, drinking
	a Coke. Gekko towelling himself down, getting dressed...naked
	man constantly stopping by to greet him. Hi Fred, hi Barry,
	how's the wife...still living in Larchmont? Yeah, still
	commuting... y'ever do anything with that Aetna Gas
	deal...nah...fishing for information, for a possible drink
	or meeting but Gekko stonewalls them all...

				GEKKO
		You're not as smart as I thought
		you were, Buddy boy, Listen hard --
		don't count on Graham and Dodd to
		make you a fortune, everybody in
		the market knows the theory, ever
		wonder why fund managers can't beat
		the S&P 500? 'Cause they're
		sheep -- and the sheep get
		slaughtered. I been in the business
		since '69. Most of these high paid
		MBAs from Harvard never make it.
		You need a system, discipline, good
		people, no deal junkies, no
		toreadores, the deal flow burns
		most people out by 35.
		Give me PSHs -- poor, smart and
		hungry. And no feelings. You don't
		win 'em all, you don't love 'em
		all, you keep on fighting, and if
		you need a friend, get a dog, it's
		trench warfare out there sport...
			(eyeing the surroundings)
		and in here too. I got twenty other
		brokers out there, analyzing Charts.
		I don't need another one. Talk to
		you sometime...

	He turns to go, Bud panicking. Is this the kissoff?

				BUD
			(with all his conviction)
		I'm not just another broker Mr.
		Gekko. If you give me another
		chance, I'll prove it to you. I'll
		go the extra yard for you. One more
		chance. Please...

	Gekko looks back, a beat, walks over to Bud, thrusts his
	towel hard at his stomach.

				GEKKO
		You want one more chance? Then stop
		sending me information and start
		getting me some. Get dressed, I'll
		show you my charts.

	INT. GEKKO LIMOUSINE - PARK AVENUE - DAY/TWILIGHT

	Cruising up Park Avenue. A panel slides open next to the bar
	with a portable computer on it. A television is turned on to
	the evening news, a low hum of voices. Gekko punches into
	the keyboard of the computer. A name appears an the screen...
	LAWRENCE WILDMAN with curriculum vitae following; address,
	phones, businesses...

				GEKKO
		Know the name?

				BUD
		'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the
		first raiders.

				GEKKO
			(amused, cold hatred)
		Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits
		he thinks he was born with a better
		pot to piss in... bribed an old
		secretary of mine to open bar mouth
		and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right
		out from under me. Wildman the
		white knight.

				BUD
			(excited)
		I remember that deal. You were
		involved?

	Gekko shuts off the computer and slides it back into the
	housing, his eyes taking in the low-volume news.

				GEKKO
		Revenge is a dish best served
		cold... well, it's payback time,
		sport.
			(looking out suddenly)
		... see that building? I bought
		into it ten years ago. It was my
		first real estate deal. I sold it a
		couple of years later and made an
		$800,000 dollar profit. It was
		better than sex. At that time I
		thought that was all tne money in
		the world...
			(drinks)
		Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a
		mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me
		half the picture, then he got fired...

				BUD
		I don't understand.

				GEKKO
		Wildman's in town. He just became
		an American citizen. Something
		big's about to go down. I want to
		know where he goes and who he sees.
		I want you, sport, to give me the
		missing half of the picture...

				BUD
		Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...
			(shaken)
		It's not what I do. I could lose my
		license. If the SEC found out, I
		could go to jail. It's inside
		information, isn't it?

				GEKKO
			(scratches his head wryly)
		Inside information. Oh you mean
		like when a father tells his son
		about a court ruling on an airline?
		Or someone overhears me saying I'm
		gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the
		chairman of the board of XYZ
		suddenly knows it's time to blow
		out XYZ. You mean that?
			(a piercing look)
		I'm afraid sport, unless you got a
		father on the board of directors of
		another company, you and I are
		gonna have a hard time doing any
		business...

	Bud downs the rest of his drink, upset by the darkening mood.
	There's something very powerful and frighteninq about Gekko.

				BUD
		What about hard work?

				GEKKO
		What about it? You work hard. I'll
		bet you stayed up all night
		analyzing that dog you bought. And
		where'd it get you?... my father
		worked hard too like an elephant
		pushing electrical supplies. And he
		dropped dead at 49 with a heart
		attack and a tax bill and the bank
		pissed on his grave and took the
		house; my mom ended up working in a
		dish factory... Wake up pal, if
		you're not inside you're outside.
		And I'm not talking a $200,000 a
		year working Wall Street stiff
		flying first class and being
		"comfortable", I'm talking rich
		pal, rich enough to fly in your own
		jet, rich enough not to waste time,
		50-100 million, a player Bud -- or
		nothing. You had what it takes to
		let through my door. Next question:
		You got what it takes to stay...??

	The car stopping in traffic. Horns honking.

				GEKKO
			(pointing)
		Look out there...

	THEIR POV -- a STREET CORNER. A richly dressed EXECUTIVE
	stands at the curb next to the BUM with a shopping cart
	filled with garbage.

				GEKKO (O.S.)
		You really think the difference
		'tween this guy and that guy is
		luck? Mohammed, pull over.

	The car pulls over. Gekko checks his watch, pulls out the
	telephone.

				GEKKO
		...when it comes to money, sport,
		everybody's of the same religion.
		Or should be... Hope you don't mind
		if I let you off here, I'm late for
		a meeting. Good bye, nice knowing you.

	EXT. PARK AVENUE - TWLIGHT

	The CHAUFFEUR lets Bud out the door... Bud looks back at Gekko.

				BUD
		All right, Mr. Gekko...you got me.

	His eyes telling us he is weighed down by chains of guilt.

	Gekko smiles, gazes at the twilight skyline, a sudden look
	of contentment.

				GEKKO
		Yeah, it's a beautiful night. I
		love this hot stinkin' city.
			(pointing up Park Avenue)
		... nothing else like it in the
		world. Seven million people living
		on each other's heads, kids born,
		millionaires dying, people praying,
		junkies, whores, wills, lawyers,
		deals, parties, sex... guys like
		you sport -- dreaming about the big
		score. You know the best thing
		about New York is everything you
		can do here. And the worst thing is
		everything you can't do here...

	He shuts the door. Bud watches as the limo drives off.

	EXT. FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY

	Bud, in a suit, waits next to a motorcycle across from one
	of the most desirable addresses in New York.

	The Doorman rushes to open the door under the canopy as a
	tall strong man in his fifties emerges with a LAWYER TYPE
	and a FEMALE EXECUTIVE. The man is SIR LAWRENCE WILDMAN and
	his manner and gait convey the impression of an authoritative
	presence with little patience as the chauffeur opens the
	door and he slides into the back seat of the limo.

	Buddy, astride Marv's Kawasaki 500, hits the streets after
	him. The music through the following Montage should suggest
	a chase brio.

	EXT. WALL STREET BUILIDING - DAY

	Bud shooting past the Trinity Church structure... Wildman
	gets out of his limo with his people, strides into the lobby.

	Bud quickly parks his bike on the sidewalk and rushes in
	after them... not a second too late.

	INT. LOBBY - WALL STREET BUILDING - DAY

	Bud just manages squeeze in the elevator with Wildman and
	crew -- and -- a couple of other early birds -- as the doors
	close.

	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

	Bud eyeing Wildman, looks away as Wildman looks back at him,
	an edge of defiance to him, why are you staring at me? Not
	the world's most likeable personality.

	INT. KAHN, SEIDELMAN - OUTER OFFICE - DAY

	The doors open and Wildman and Co. step out into the
	reception area of Kahn, Seidelman... The doors close and
	Buddy continues upward.

	EXT. WALL STREET BUILDING - LATER MORNING

	The street now jammed with people hurrying to work. Buddy
	paces the curb, reacting when Wildman walks out, saying
	goodbye to the female executive and getting in the limo with
	his lawyer... Buddy follows.

	INT. LE CIRQUE RESTAURANT - PARK AVENUE - DAY

	Formal French haute cuisine. Power lunches in progress. As
	Wildman is seated with several well-dressed BANKERS at a
	good table, Bud tries to wrangle a table (next to Mr.
	Wildman on top of everything from a stiff looking Maitre d'
	who shakes his head, barely concealing his attitude towards
	Buddy's youth and general demeanor.

	EXT. LE CIRQUE - DAY

	Buddy waits outside, bored, as Wildman steps out, shakes
	hands with the bankers... Bud making an entry into his
	notebook like any good spy.

	EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL QUEENS - DAY

	Music rising to triumphant proportions. AERIAL SHOT of Limo
	emerging from the tunnel and onto the Long Island Expressway.
	CAMERA MOVES IN, picking up Buddy on the Kawasaki, darting
	through lanes, staying several car lengths behind.

	EXT. LAGUARDIA AIRPORT - DAY

	The Limo winds its way along the perimeter road, past
	commercial airliners. It takes the turnoff for Butler
	Aviation. Buddy exits the ramp shortly after them.

	EXT. BUTLER AVIATION AIRFIELD - DAY

	A corporate saberliner jet, its engines running, idles at
	the end of the taxiway. The limo pulls up along the tarmac
	next to it and Wildman steps out, walking past a MECHANIC to
	the stairs of the plane. A STEWARDESS waits for him.

	EXT. RAMP - DAY

	Bud watches, wondering what to do as the plane taxies down
	the runway. He spots the flight mechanic and the answer
	comes to him. He starts running towards the mechanic.

	EXT. APRON - DAY

	Bud races up to the mechanic.

				BUD
		Oh shit, don't tell me Mr. Wildman
		was on board that plane?
			(the mechanic nods)
		My boss is gonna kill me. I was
		supposed to give him this.
			(holding his notebook)
		You know where that plane is going?

				MECHANIC
			(walking off)
		Erie, Pennsylvania...

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - AIRLINES TERMINAL - DAY

				BUD
			(into phone, proudly)
		...after spending the morning at
		Kahn, Seidelman -- on the 14th
		floor, the junk bond department --
		where Shane Mora works -- he had
		lunch at La Cirque with a group of
		well-dressed heavyset bean-
		counters...
			(Gekko voice back:
			"the adjectives are
			redundant, sport")
		...he later stopped off at Morgan.
		I'd say from all the palm-pressing
		and sweet smiling going on that
		Larry got some nice fat financing...
		G.G.

	INT. GEKKO LIMOUSINE - HEADING DOWN PARK AVENUE - DAY

	Alex and Susan are with him. Gekko playing the computer,
	eyes lighting up on the phone.

				GEKKO
		...bright but not bright enough,
		Sherlock, roll the dice and play a
		little monopoly... what box would
		Sir Lawrence land on in Erie,
		Pennsylvania?

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

	Bud slapping his face, realizing.

				BUD
		Jesus Christ, he's buying Anacott
		Steel!

	INT. GEKKO LIMO - DAY

	Gordon already has the closing figures punched up on his
	quotron. Calls his shot.

				GEKKO
		When the market opens tomorrow, buy
		five thousand March fifty calls.
		You hear me? Start buying ten
		thousand share blocks and take it
		up to fifty dollars. When it
		reaches fifty, you can let out a
		little taste to your friends.
		Then call this number -- 555-7617:
		tell the man "blue horseshoe loves
		Anacott Steel..." You scored, Buddy!
		Be in touch.
			(hangs up)


	He hangs up, looks at Alex and Susan.

				GEKKO
		Start buying Anacott Steel all over
		the board.

	INT. BLUESTAR MAINTENANCE HANGAR - SAME DAY

	A large company banner hangs from the rafters: "Bluestar -
	The Vision Goes On." Buddy's father, Carl, Charley Dent and
	Dominick Amato are changing the generator on a 727. A welder
	is repairing a wing seam. Buddy shouting to his Dad over the
	noise.

				BUD
		Hey Dad!... Hi ya Charlie...
		Dominick...

	They wave back, Carl climbing down a maintenance stand...
	lights up a cigarette.

				CARL
		What brings you out here...

				BUD
		Client. Got a private jet over at
		Butler Aviation... Dad, you always
		gotta light up when you see me,
		it's the...

				CARL
			(don't bother me look)
		Don't start, alright.

				BUD
		Alright. Why so pissed?

				CARL
		Goddamn fare wars are murdering us.
		Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I
		could do. What is it... money?

	Bud takes out his wallet, smiles, peels out 10 $100 bills.

				BUD
		Yeah, it is. In fact I'm doing
		great. New client. Whole new league.
		It's starting to happen Dad. The
		Big Leagues! You know what I'm saying.

	He sticks the cash in his hand.

				CARL
			(doesn't)
		Sure...lots of guys at the track
		talk like that... but how do you
		know you'll have any dough next
		month...
			(looking at the money)
		What's this? I gave you two hundred.

				BUD
		Dividend. I figure I owe you about
		five thousand in nickels and dimes...

				CARL
			(tries to give it back)
		...don't be crazy. Put it to your
		school loans.

				BUD
		Don't worry about the loans. I'm
		doing good Dad and it's gonna stay
		that way now... least buy yourself
		a new suit.

				CARL
		What do I need a fancy suit for. I
		don't hobnob with the jet set. I
		just fix their planes.

	Buddy forces the money into his hand.

				BUD
		...then buy yourself a decent
		bowling jacket so when you take Mom
		out you don't look like the Roto
		Rooter man. Come on, for godsakes,
		that's what money's for. Enjoy
		yourself...

	Touched, his father shakes his head and smiles. He takes it.

				CARL
		Problem with money is you never
		have enough or you got too much --
		and when you got it you're never
		happy 'cause somebody's always
		trying to take it away from you.
		Money's one giant pain in the ass
		y'ask me... thanks.

				BUD
			(admiration)
		... Dad, you should've been a CEO.
		How about dinner?

				CARL
		Whatever night you like.

				BUD
			(remembering)
		Wait... next week's booked. Let me
		check with my girl and get back to
		you on Monday.

				CARL
			(laughs at his new lifestyle)
		Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll
		still be here.

				BUD
		...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking,
		you hear?

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud silent, an intent look on his face, gazing up at the
	digital clock... as it flicks to 9:30... post time.

	Tickers, squawk boxes and shouting erupt.

	Bud calls in his order: "10,000 AN STL 46... and let me know
	how the options are opening."

	Music skips along in a revolving madcap fashion.

	INT. FLOOR OF AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

	A CLERK hands the buy order to the FLOOR MANAGER. He starts
	writing a ticket as we pull back:

	INT. AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

	Company floor traders are jammed into a narrow booth,
	frantically takinq orders over phones and telex machines.

	The FLOOR MANAGER gives the ticket to a RUNNER, a young man
	wearing worn sneakers, who dashes off. We follow him across
	the scruffy Exchange Floor, as he weaves through a crush of
	traders crammed around horseshoe-shaped kiosks, cathode-ray
	tubes slung above them, displaying the latest prices in
	bright, green letters and numbers. Intermittent shrieks and
	howls, calls to buy and sell, issue from the far reaches of
	the labyrinthian room.

	As in the final leg of a relay race, the RUNNER hands the
	ticket off to a COMPANY TRADER, who is buying and selling at
	the post where Anacott Steel is traded. The TRADER checks
	the ticket and turns to the SPECIALIST, executing the order.

	The camera moves up as the Anacott Steel (AN STL) quote
	flashes across the broad tape -- as the price ticks up from
	46 to 46 1/4.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud paces nervously at his desk, looking at his quotron. AN
	STL appears on the screen, now up to 47. Bud puts in another
	order.

	INT. STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR - DAY

	The SAME RUNNER races over, handing Bud's next TICKET to the
	COMPANY TRADER.

	Tilt up to the broad tape.

	As ANACOTT STEEL, AN STL, rises to 48 1/8.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	On Bud, eating a sandwich, eyes glued to the ticker. AN STL
	has climbed to 48 3/4. Marv stalks by, shouting on the phone.
	Bud looks away from the ticker, pretending to read a report.
	When Marv disappears, Bud hastily calls in at 49.

	INT. STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR - DAY

	On the tired RUNNER dodging through the crowd, and over to
	the TRADER handing him a new ticket.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Close on the OFFICE TICKER -- as Anacott Steel hits 50.

	Buddy jumps up from his chair, and animatedly crosses to
	Marv who is on the phone, cold calling.

				MARV
		Tell Mr. Ehrlich I've got important
		financial news! It concerns his
		future.

	Bud presses down on the phone button, cutting him off.

				MARV
		What the hell...

				BUD
		Anacott Steel. Buy it.

	Marv looks at Joe and sees a look on his face that he's
	never seen before.

				MARV
			(nervous)
		Anacott Steel -- right.

	Bud leaves, Marv re-dials.

				MARV
		Dr. Beltzer, you're gonna love this!

	Lou Mannheim hangs up the phone, a troubled look. Bud leans
	into his office.

				BUD
		Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.
			(whispering)
		Anacott Steel.

				MANNHEIM
			(scoffs)
		No such thing Bud - 'cept death and
		taxes. Not a good company anymore,
		no fundamentals. What's going on
		Bud? Do you know something?
			(Bud uncomfortable,
			Lou reads it)
		Remember there're no short cuts
		son, quick buck artists come and go
		with every bull market but the
		steady players make it through the
		bear markets.
			(Bud anxious to go)
		You're part of something here, Bud.
		The money you make for people
		creates science and research jobs.
		Don't sell that out.

				BUD
		You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you
		gotta get to the big time first,
		then you can be a pillar and do
		good things.

				MANNHEIM
		Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.

				BUD
		It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust
		me -- buy.

	Charlie Cushing's on the phone.

	EXT. GEKKO BEACH HOUSE - BRIDGEHAMPTON - TWILIGHT

				GEKKO (V.O.)
		Sweeten the offer, throw 2 bucks

		And 5 year contracts for themselves.

	INT. GEKKO LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Immense slanted ceilings, a vast clean modern space filled
	with dozens of contemporary art objects, junk sculptures,
	floor to ceiling windows radiating light, that look out on a

				GEKKO (CONT'D)

	During this, RUDY, Gordon's 3 year-old son, drives in in the

	Gekko hangs up, checks out a Reuters quotron positioned nearby.

				GEKKO
		Rudy Kazootee, how's my cutie!

	The kid jumps out of the car and scoots into his father's lap.

		No, not now Rudy. Daddy's making
		money to buy you toys. Daddy work.

				RUDY
		Daddy work bad boy!

	Gordon absently tossles Rudy's hair, his eyes glued to the
	TV. The kid senses it, jumps back off his lap and into the car.

				BUSINESS ANALYST
		...the big story tonight is Anacott
		Steel which closed at 51 1/8.  Up 5
		1/8 from yesterday's close on heavy
		trading...

	Kate, Gordon's beautiful, raven-haired wife, homemaker and
	antiquer, enters with the bovine-eyed AU PAIR GIRL from
	France... just at Rudy drives his car into a wall where it
	stalls, engines grinding.

				KATE
		I think somebody's playing hooky
		from the bathtub. Rudy, say good
		night DAddy...

				GEKKO
			(can't hear, to Kate)
		Shut that off, willya!

	Kate, upset with the noise, tries to pull her son nicely out
	of the car.

	The Korean HOUSEBOY coming in.

				HOUSEBOY
		Calls for you, sir, a reporter from
		Time magazine on two, says it's
		important... and a Mr. Fox on three.
	 
			GEKKO
			(annoyed)
		I come to the country and it's
		worse than the city! I'm not home...
			(changes mind, pushes in)
		Yeah?

				BUD
			(off)
		Mr. Gekko, I've been trying to
		reach you. We got the options. We
		got a good execution on them!

	Meanwhile, the kid has no intention of going anywhere and
	plants his feet and emits the loudest shrieking this side of
	the fat lady in the opera.

				GEKKO
		Nicole! Take him will you...

	Handing the bawling, writhing mass of anger to Nicole as if
	it were laundry she doesn't want to touch... Nicole takes
	him screaming out of the room... Gordon trying to concentrate
	on the TV.

						INTERCUT TO:

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Papers and charts are strewn around, trailing down to a box
	of take-out pizza and empty beer bottles. Bud has stayed late.

				BUD
			(almost apologetic,
			speeding on the high
			of the buy...)
		I got all I could get which was
		750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50
		calls. Average price of $47 a share
		And $4 per contract for the call. I
		just wish I could've got more.

				GEKKO
		Don't expect to get it all, sport,
		you'll burn out. First rule of
		business is never get emotional
		about stock, clouds the judgment.
		Where do we stand?
	 
			BUSINESS ANALYST
		In response to an inquiry from the
		New York Stock Exchange, management
		issued a terse no comment. Wildman
		would not return phone calls.
		Analysts believe the company is
		worth $75 per share in a transaction.

				KATE
		John and Carmen are here and the
		Livingstons are on their way...

				GEKKO
			(nods, listening to phone)
		I'll be right there, fix them a drink.

				BUD
			(shifting the figures)
		...we have 37.2 million invested.
		At this point, we're up 3.1 million
		and some change. If it goes to 75
		bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.

				GEKKO
			(smiles)
		You're walking between the
		raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry
		is choking on his royal chamber pot
		by now.

				BUD
		My firm needs your signature on
		these option agreements tonight,
		sir, otherwise we could take a real
		bath tomorrow.

				GEKKO
			(sighs)
		...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.
			(Bud waits, "Sir")
		...Awright. Come out, get the
		directions from Natalie and hurry up.

	EXT. GEKKO'S BEACH HOUSE - BRIDGEHAMPTON - NIGHT

	Bud's P.O.V. as he pulls up to an austere, ultra-
	sophisticated monolith of glass and wood dominating a
	stretch of dune overlooking the Atlantic's angry surf.
	Several Jags, state of the art Jeeps and a Rolls are drawn
	up outside.

	Bud, getting out of his faded Honda, goes up the stairs to
	the door. He rings several times.

	A BLACK BUTLER opens it and looks at Buddy somewhat warily.
	Laughter and voices are heard from inside.

				BUTLER
			(pretentiously: high
			English accent)
		Can I help you?

				BUD
		Bud Fox. Got some papers for Mr.
		Gekko to sign.

				BUTLER
		Wait a moment please.

	Without thinking he closes the door in Joe's face. He stands
	there, harrassed peering around through a window on the lawn.
	A small gathering of friends in progress around a glowing
	fireplace. The butler waves him in from the door.

	INT. GEKKO ALCOVE - NIGHT

	Bud enters, as Gekko approaches.  He seems annoyed to be
	disturbed at his country home.

				BUD
			(apologetic)
		Sorry, Mr. Gekko.

				GEKKO
			(takes the papers)
		Allright. Wait here...

	About to go when his wife, Kate Gekko, comes over. A pretty
	dark-haired woman.

				KATE
		Problems?

				GEKKO
		No... Bud Fox, my wife, Kate...

	They exchange pleasantries.

				KATE
		You came from the city?
			(with a look to Gordon)
		Long drive, have a drink.

	Gekko doesn't seem to like the idea, but...

				GEKKO
		Yeah, why not, Bud boy...
	 
Kate's walking back inside to her guests, as Bud sidles over
	to Gekko.

				BUD
		...if you'd rather not, Mr. Gekko,
		I can leave...

	INT. GEKKO LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	They cross to the main living room.

				GEKKO
		...It's okay Buddy, you know Alex...
		Candice Rogers.
			(Alex and his date
			shake hands, faintly aloof)
		...This is Stone Livingston... and
		his wife Muffie.
			(a young stuffy
			banker in weekend
			corduroys looks at
			Bud as if he
			obviously doesn't belong)
		...Darien Taylor, Sam Ruspoli,
		Carmen Winters, Dick Brady... All
		old friends.

	Bud looking wide-eyed at the beautiful "Calvados" BLONDE
	he's been dreaming of for weeks... she's with Mr. GQ and
	doesn't recognize Bud, nods back, they all nod back,
	naturally suspicious of the young outsider... Rudy's TOY
	ROBOT wheels  around the floor with a drink on its tray,
	talking computer talk...

				STONE LIVINGSTON
			(charmed by it)
		...good idea Gordon, good help is
		hard to find these days but can he
		whip up a dry vodka martini...

				GEKKO
		...well he doesn't talk back or
		steal the silver and Dick's gonna
		get me an exemption on him, aren't
		you...
			(Dick Brady is
			obviously an accountant)


	Bud plucks a glass of wine from the robot's tray and plunks
	himself down on a sofa, overhearing the conversation between
	Muffie Livingston and Candice Rogers.

				MUFFIE
		...there I am in St. Kitt's in my
		new Kamali leopard skin V-cut
		bikini which is going to turn back
		the clock on our marriage five
		years, you know what I mean, and I
		can't even fit into it, my skin's
		all pink and inflamed, and I look
		like a walking social disease all
		because this Ukranian bitch botched
		the wax on my bikini line.

				CANDICE
			(revolted)
		Oh my god, how ghastly, you should
		sue her...

	The Korean houseboy has come over to Gekko.

				HOUSEBOY
		Call for you sir. Sir Larry
		Wildman, he says it's important...

	Bud tightens, so does the whole room hearing the name of the
	moment. Gekko smiles at Buddy.

				GEKKO
			(to houseboy)
		Make Mr. Livingston a martini would
		you Nyung, and this gentleman...
			(to Bud)
		Stick around, this could be fun...

	He goes to the alcove to take the call.

				MUFFIE
		So, I had to sit around the beach
		wearing a moo-moo for 10 days, my
		whole vacation ruined.
			(noticing as Bud
			laughs, chokes on the
			wine, spilling some
			on the couch)
		You just spilled your wine.

	Bud noticing the stain, starts wiping it.

				CANDICE
		You're just making it worse.

	INT. GEKKO ALCOVE - NIGHT (RAIN)

				GEKKO
			(on phone)
		Larry, what a surprise...
			(beat)
		Can it wait till tomorrow. I got
		some people over.
			(dryly)
		...if you feel that way Larry, come
		over.

	INT. GEKKO LIVINGROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

	The blonde, DARIEN TAYLOR, is examining a modern sculpture
	as Buddy comes over with two Calvados.

				BUD
		Hello again, I been holding these
		drinks for us for the last three
		weeks.

				DARIEN
			(uncomprehending)
		Excuse me.

				BUD
		Grand Marnier. A romantic and
		tragic drink.

				DARIEN
		Oh yes, I remember you.

				BUD
		Destiny took us apart, but I knew
		it would bring us back together.

				DARIEN
		Aha. Poet or philosopher?

				BUD
		Stock broker. As in: never have so
		few done so little for so much. So
		what do you see in this?

	Bud indicates the painting in front of them -- a buffalo
	skull in the desert by Georgia O'Keefe.

				DARIEN
		I'd give anything to have this in
		my house, even for a week.

				BUD
		...few thousand dollars down the
		drain if you ask me.

				DARIEN
		Oh really?
			(looks at him quizically)
		Well, I guess you can kiss that
		career as an art appraiser goodbye,
		because we paid over four hundred
		thousand for it at the contemporary
		picture sale last June.

				BUD
			(chokes)
		You could have a great beach house
		for that.

				DARIEN
		Sure you could, in Wildwood, New
		Jersey. If you sold this,
			(indicates a Rothko
			hanging near the O'Keefe)
		you could have a pretty nice
		penthouse on Fifth. But you
		wouldn't have much left over for
		decoration.

				BUD
		Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough
		businessman, but somebody's really
		taking him to the cleaners here.

				DARIEN
		Not really. I'd say that Gordon is
		one of the most astute collectors
		around. He has a great eye and he
		only buys the best. Like this rug
		for instance, a silk Tabriz, the
		finest of its kind. The day after
		he bought it in London, a dealer
		representing the Saudi Royal Family
		offered him twice what he paid. It
		absolutely makes the room. See how
		this little bit of celadon in the
		border is picked up in the cushions
		oh the sofa... although...
			(she's really warming
			up to her subject now)
		I don't know if I would have used
		that tea dipped linen for the
		upholstery - too dingy.
		And it's a sacrilege having that
		Pre-Columbian pot in the center of
		the coffee table. Some dope might
		use it as an ashtray.

				BUD
		I gather you're a decorator.

				DARIEN
		You got it, a great spender of
		other people's money.

				BUD
		Well, if you're that good, you
		could probably do wonders at my place.

				DARIEN
		Where is it?

				BUD
		Upper West Side.

				DARIEN
			(losing interest fast)
		Oh really. Home of the exposed
		brick wall and the
			(shudders)
		houseplant.

				BUD
		Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving
		to the East Side soon. I've got a
		couple of deals brewing with Gordon.
			(shifts uncomfortably
			with his pretension)
		but that's just conversation...
		what about real things? Like dinner.
		The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo
		Domingo.

	Bud waits, staring suddenly and deeply into her eyes.

				DARIEN
		What if I have a previous engagement?

				BUD
		Break it.

				DARIEN
		I guess this must be destiny
		alright. My first yuppie apartment
		and...
			(pats him on the
			cheek flirtatiously)
		my first yuppie.

				BUD
			(gives her a steely glare)
		You may call me a yuppie... It's
		Mister Yuppie to you.

	They both laugh.

				BUD
			(gets serious)
		So. See you Friday.

				DARIEN
		You really do believe in destiny?

				BUD
		Only if I want something bad enough.

	Her date, Mr. GQ, SAMMY RUSPOLI intersects with Kate. A
	cultivated European air.

				SAM
		...there you go again, Darien,
		talking with strange men.

				KATE
		That's our Darien: elusive,
		reclusive, exclusive.
			(to Sam)
		You know Bud right? He works for
		Gordon...
			(Sam nodding, makes
			conversation, big smile)
		Sam's in banking. You staying for
		dinner Bud?

				BUD
			(hesitant, eyes Darien)
		No, I'm afraid I've got to get some
		work...

	Kate noticing the doorbell ringing.

				KATE
		...excuse me.

	Sam muttering something in Darien's ear of an intimate
	nature. She glides away with him.

				DARIEN
			(to Bud)
		Call me next week, I'll give you an
		estimate...

	An ironic promise in her eyes... Bud ecstatic inside...
	looks over, goes to the foyer...

	INT. GEKKO ALCOVE - NIGHT (RAIN)

	SIR LARRY WILDMAN walks in, his country gentleman clothing
	somewhat softening his imposing figure but not the cultured
	rapacious eagle's face. With him a lawyer.

				KATE
			(strained)
		Larry, how have you been? Get you a
		drink?

				WILDMAN
			(slightly impatient)
		Oh fine. Travelling actually.
		Nothing thank you. Is...

				KATE
		Gordon?... He's right here.

	As Gordon intersects, casually tasting a spot of the dinner.

				GEKKO
		Larry! Excuse me "sir" Larry, great
		to see you again, you're looking
		good.
			(handshakes)


				WILDMAN
		Gordon...
			(sniffing the guests
			and furnishings in
			the room as if they
			were stale air)


				BUD
			(leaving, to Gordon)
		I guess I'll head back...
	 
			GEKKO
			(spontaneously)
		Stick around... Larry, one of my
		"gang" -- Bud Fox.

	Pleasantries. Bud nervously shakes hands, sensing Wildman
	might recognize him from being tailed in the elevator. There
	indeed is a moment but Wildman's attention blurs as...

				GEKKO
		Shall we go upstairs?

	INT. GEKKO DEN - NIGHT (RAIN)

	Gordon enters a den lined with old books hunting prints;  he
	proudly picks up something from his gun collection.

				GEKKO
		Rarest pistol in the world, Larry,
		a .45 Luger. Only six were ever
		manufactured.

				WILDMAN
		Congratulations but rarer still is
		your interest in Anacott Steel.

				GEKKO
		The same interest as yours Larry.
		Money. I thought it'd be a good
		investment for my kid...

				WILDMAN
		No. This time I'm in for the long
		term. This is not a liquidation,
		Gordon. I'm going to turn it around.
		You're getting a free ride on my
		tail, mate, and with the dollars
		you're costing me to buy back the
		stock, I could modernize the plant.
		I'm not the only one who pays here
		Gordon. We're talking about lives
		and jobs; three and four generations
		of steel workers...

	A strong hint of the cockney working class east and London
	boy whiffing through his speech and manner. The "mate" is
	tough and to the point but not insulting...

				GEKKO
			(has to smile)
		You must be wearing a mask you're
		laughing so hard behind it Larry.
		Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct
		me if I'm wrong, but when you took
		CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000
		workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000,
		that airline...

				WILDMAN
			(cold, deliberate)
		I could break you, mate, in two
		pieces over my knees, you know it,
		I know it, I could buy you six
		times ever, I could dump the stock
		just to burn your ass but I happen
		to want the company and I want your
		block of shares. I'm announcing a
		tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and
		I'm expecting your commitment.

	Bud watching this drama unfold. Gekko is about to blow,
	controls it.

				GEKKO
		Showdowns bore me Larry, neither
		side wins. You can have the
		company, in fact it's gonna be fun
		watching you and your giant ego try
		to make a horserace out of it...
			(turns to Bud)
		What do you think is a fair price
		for our stock Bud?

	Bud in the spotlight. The eyes all shift to him -- his
	moment. After an initial panic, he's cool as a cucumber --
	and ruthless as his mentor.

				BUD
		The break up value is higher. It's
		worth 80.

				GEKKO
		But we don't want to be greedy now,
		so let's let him have it at $72.

	His eyes to Wildman who looks at him, cold, icy mean.

				WILDMAN
		You're a two bit pirate and a
		green-mailer, Gekko, nothing more...
		not only would you sell your mother
		to make a deal, you'd send her COD...

	Bud looking sharply as Gekko's eyes flare with hot white anger.

				GEKKO
		My mail's the same color as yours
		Larry. Or it was till the Queen
		started calling you "sir". Now
		excuse me before I lose my temper...

	He rises and exits.

				WILDMAN
		$71...

	Gekko stops at the door, a beat.

				GEKKO
		Considering you brought my mother
		into it, $71.50.

				WILDMAN
		Done. You'll hear from my lawyers.
		8 a.m. Good night.

	He walks out with the silent lawyer. Past Gekko who watches.
	"Ta Ta".

				GEKKO
			(to Bud)
		He's right. I had to sell. The key
		to the game is your capital
		reserves. You don't have enough,
		you can't pee in the tall weeds
		with the big dogs.

				BUD
			(mimicking Gordon now)
		"All warfare is based on
		deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your
		enemy is superior, evade him, if
		angry, irritate him, if equally
		matched, fight... if not, split and
		reevaluate.

				GEKKO
		You're learning, sport...

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

	Exhausted from the drive back, Bud takes off his sweater and
	tie and collapses onto the bed, closing his eyes. The phone
	rings. With a start he wakes and answers it.

				BUD
		Yeah?...

						INTERCUT TO:

	EXT. GEKKO'S BEACH HOUSE - DAWN

	The sky is still dark, the first rays of light coming up
	over the ocean. Gekko, a lonely figure in a windbreaker,
	restlessly prowls the edge of the beach, waves crashing
	around him. He's been up all night and has an exhausted,
	driven look as he whispers over the wind into the cellular
	phone...

				GEKKO
		Money never sleeps pal. When I came
		in in '69, they traded six hours a
		day, now the clock don't stop,
		London's deregulated, the Orient is
		hungrier than us. Just let the
		money circle the world, sport,
		buying and selling, and if you're
		smart it comes back paying. I just
		made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold.
		It's been wired to you -- play with
		it. You done good, but you gotta
		keep doing good. I showed you how
		the game works, now school's out.

				BUD
			(protests)
		Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.

				GEKKO
		You don't understand. I want to be
		surprised...astonish me, sport, new
		info, don't care where or how you
		get it, just get it... My wife
		tells me you put a move on Darien.
		Here's some inside info for you.
		That Euroflash GQ guy she's going
		with's got big bucks but he's
		putting her feet to sleep. Exit
		visas are imminent. So don't lose
		your place in line.
			(gazing at the surf)
		Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this.
		The lights coming up over the water.
		I've never seen a painting that
		captures the beauty of the ocean at
		this moment.
			(suddenly fatigued)
		...an old Russian proverb - "a
		fisherman always sees another
		fisherman from afar." I like you
		sport, I ever tell you that...
		Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.

				BUD
			(off)
		...Gordon.

				GEKKO
		Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud
		Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough
		you can afford a girl like Darien.
		Remember, power is the best
		aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up
		call. Go to work.

	He lets the phone drop to his side, staring glazed-eyed at
	the ocean.

	INT. ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

	A SECRETARY leads Bud into the plush, private office of a
	cocky young lawyer, ROGER BARNES, about tho same age as Bud,
	his his feet up on the desk, sleepily waving to Buddy to
	park his ass... The pictures an his walls and desk indicate
	a rich family.

				ROGER
		Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has
		it really been a year. You're not
		hitting me up for NYU are you?

				BUD
		Well we're thinking of putting up a
		statue of you in the subway. I hear
		you're moving up in the world. An
		associate already. Not bad. How's
		Margie?

				ROGER
		Can't complain. Got a house in
		Oyster Bay. Market treating you
		good? Still seeing that sexy French
		gal?

				BUD
		Nah, she asked the wrong question.

				ROGER
		What was that?

				BUD
		"What are you thinking?"...that was
		it. The hours are hell, but the
		money's starting to tumble in. I
		know this guy who's got an iron-
		clad way to make money, I can't
		lose and I can't get hurt.

				ROGER
			(interested)
		So, does "this guy" have a tip for
		an honest lawyer?

				BUD
		Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's
		still not over.

				ROGER
		Okay.

				BUD
		What about you, I hear you guys are
		handling the Fairchild Foods merger
		and it may not be going through.
		Any surprises I haven't read about
		in the Wall Street Journal?

				ROGER
			(casually)
		Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to
		got me disbarred now would you?

				BUD
			(equally casual,
			looks at the walls)
		Who's listening? It's just one
		college buddy talking to another.

				ROGER
			(sarcastic)
		Yeah, right...

				BUD
		Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it
		but you don't know, you don't know.

				ROGER
		...and if I did, what's in it for moi?

	He obviously has thought about it before. Bud smiles back,
	nonchalant.

				BUD
		More money than you ever dreamed,
		Roger. And the thing is no one gets
		hurt...how bout a beer?

				ROGER
			(some doubt)
		Too much to do...but I'll walk you
		out.

	INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - EVENING

	They walk out past the CLEANING CREWS coming in for the
	evening, drones of the vacuum cleaners...

	Bud looks - his POV... A CLEANING WOMAN as she pulls the
	vacuum cleaner into one of the senior partners offices, the
	desk crammed with proposals, Bud is lost in thought.

				ROGER
			(teasing)
		...Get inside my uncle's door
		Buddy, all the secrets of the world
		are yours... the life blood of
		companies, but you gotta go to law
		school first...

	EXT. BARNES' OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

	Bud comes out of the building and starts walking away. As he
	passes the freight entrance, Bud abruptly notices a van
	marked MARSALA MAINTENENCE COMPANY. He looks back, thinks
	for a moment: a look in his eyes.

	EXT. LONG ISLAND CITY - LIGHT INDUSTRIAL PARK - DAY

	Bud walks past a row of small warehouses and enters one.

	INT. MARSALA MAINTENANCE OFFICE AND GARAGE SERVICE - DAY

	He steps into a shabby reception area. A chain-smoking OLD
	LADY looks up from the switch-board.

				BUD
		I need to speak to the owner about
		some business.

	INT. BACK OFFICE - DAY

	The owner, a GREEK with bushy mustache and hardened face,
	sits at his desk eating lunch, eyeing Bud suspiciously.

				BUD
			(handing him a card)
		Mr. Panos, I've charted the growth
		of new office space in the city,
		and I think you're in the right
		business at the right time.

				PANOS
		Thank you for telling me what I
		already know.

				BUD
		I'm impressed with your work and I
		could use a tax break. This is a
		growing business. Are you interested
		in some working capital and a partner?

	Panos puts down his sandwich, measuring Bud.

				PANOS
		What makes you think I need a
		partner?!

	Bud smiles, ready with his spiel.

	An elevator opens. A body steps out. A set of keys. Boom up
	past a clipboard and pen to a shirt pocket with MARSALA
	MAINTENANCE written on it, up to Bud dressed in janitorial
	clothing.

	We move with him to the CREW SUPERVISOR who introduces THREE
	CLEANING WOMEN who nervously absorb Bud, worried for their
	jobs.

	Bud strolls from office to office, looking official,
	overseeing his crew, making notations on a checklist.

	Bud slips into the Senior Partners' office, thumbs through a
	calendar on the desk. Sees the list of people, moves to the
	computer, punches the client's name in. The code number
	comes up.

	Bud nods to a SECURITY GUARD down the hall and enters the
	file room where he looks at the Cleaning Lady and points to
	his watch. As she exits, he scrambles nervously through the
	files -- finds the code number -- then anxiously flips the
	pages to the critical tender offer document -- with the
	target name -- INVESTMENT IN RORKER ELECTRONICS CORP. It's
	stamped "DRAFT" across the page. His face lights up. The
	secret to the kingdom. He puts it back, exits.

						WIPE TO:

	INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Gekko on the phone, smiling.

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

	Bud, obviously exhausted from his day and night roles, is
	telling him something on the phone.

	INT. SECOND LAW FIRM - NIGHT

	Bud furtively xeroxes a document on a small hand-carried
	copy machine in his pocket or photographs it if it is too
	large.

	INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

	Bud and Alex, Gekko's assistant, having lunch. Alex gives
	him the briefcase he's carrying. Pan from Alex to Bud back
	to discover Darien in the next scene.

	INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

	Bud dines with Darien, small talk, intimate looks.

	INT. THIRD LAW FIRM - NIGHT

	Bud is in an office, eyes panning the shelves.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Can I help you?

	Bud's head jerks around. A young female PARALEGAL is burning
	the midnight oil. She looks at him from behind a stack of
	briefs.

				BUD
			(backing off)
		Uh. Wrong office. Sorry...

	EXT. BRIDGEHAMPTON BEACH - DAY

	Gekko, Kate, Bud, Darien and A FIFTH PERSON roar over the
	dunes, each in their own dune buggy, laughing and hollering
	at one another...

	Buddy driving right up precariously close on Darien, who
	screams... Buddy flips over his vehicle... comes up
	laughing... we sense he is getting wilder now...

	EXT. HORSE FARM - BRIDGEHAMPTON - DAY

	Darien rides expertly. A beautiful, immaculately-groomed
	stallion is being shown to Gekko by the trainer.

	Bud is sipping wine as he looks on with Kate.

				GEKKO
			(proudly)
		Got him at an auction in Kentucky.

				BUD
		How much?

				GEKKO
			(fondling the head)
		Close to two million.
			(Bud whistles)
		But this sucker can go all the way
		to Devon and the nationals.

	Darien rides in, smiling to Bud.

				BUD
		Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew.
		What about the Triple Crown?

				DARIEN
		He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a
		jumper.

				BUD
		How would I know? I once bet a
		horse. He went out at ten to one
		and came in at quarter to five.

	He laughs, a little sloppy.

	EXT. OCEAN - DAY

	Darien swims in the ocean, long looping athletic strokes.

	EXT. POOL AND PATIO - GEKKO'S BRIDGEHAMPTON HOUSE - DAY

	They're finishing lunch by the pool framed by a lush flower
	garden where Kate and son Rudy play. HAROLD SALT, Gekko's
	chief lawyer, thick glasses, smart eyes and bags of worry
	that could only come from watching other people's money,
	looks very city-like in his clothing, examining his
	paperwork before passing it to Bud, who is the picture of
	relaxation.

				HAROLD
		...You understand Mr. Gekko is
		constantly barraged with nuisance
		litigation and IRS audits.

				BUD
			(nods)
		Of course.

				HAROLD
		...So it's in both our interests to
		put a safe distance between you and
		us...
			(passing a document
			with a 2nd pen)
		...this gives you limited power of
		attorney for Mr. Gekko's account.
		Every trade you make is at your
		discretion. Every ticket you buy
		must be marked "power of attorney."
		That means you call the shots and
		Mr. Gekko has no official knowledge
		of what stocks you're buying. Sign
		here and here...

	Buddy looks, then up to Gekko, who smiles, casual.

				GEKKO
		...just the beginning, sport, just
		the begining...

	Bud smiles, signs.

				HAROLD
			(a worrier)
		...you understand if any problems
		arise, you're out there on your own.
		The trail stops with you...

				BUD
		All's fair in love and war.

				GEKKO
		The art of which is deception.
		Spread the buy orders through
		different accounts and you won't
		get burned...

				BUD
		I think I got some friends that
		won't mind making some easy money...

	As Kate drifts over with Rudy and the French au pair GIRL,
	NICOLE.

				GEKKO
		Rudy, viens ici, dit bonjour a
		Monsieur Bud.

	Rudy either says "No!" or "Bonjour Monsieur Bud!' depending
	on the mood of the kid. Gordon sweeping him up and playing
	with him. The kid squeals with glee.

				GEKKO
			(proudly)
		Already speaks a little French, kid
		got the highest score on his IQ test.

				KATE
			(to Darien)
		...it's so tough to get into a good
		nursery school now. They even visit
		your home to make sure your
		paintings and furnishings are
		acceptable.

				BUD
		What's it cost these days?

				KATE
		$5,000 just for the tuition... plus
		the books and supplies...
			(with a look to Gordon)
		...some parents even have bodyguards.
		It's not a bad idea...
			(picking up Rudy)
		...now that's it for you with the
		grown-ups young man.

	As Rudy smashes the strawberries around his face and resists
	going. "No! No!" Kate exasperated gives the child to Nicole.

				KATE
		Nicole, take him for a nap, please.

				NICOLE
		He doesn't nap anymore, Madame.
		It's been...

				KATE
			(stung)
		Then play with him till he gets
		tired. We're going out tonight but
		we like to see him at, let's see,
		six; give him a bath and put that
		cute little black suit on him...
			(to Bud and Gordon)
		Black clothes are the newest
		things, so chic and milk stains,
		carrot juice stains just don't show
		up. Kids -- boy, can they take it
		out of you!

	Nicole's "Oui, Madame" is lost in the wrestling match she
	goes through to drag him out screaming. Kate walking off.
	Harold gives Buddy another piece of paper...

				HAROLD
		This is a contact at one of our
		banks. On settlement day you'll
		open an account there for Mr. Gekko
		under the name of Geneva, Roth
		Holding Corp. Then you'll wire
		transfer the money to this account
		in the Cayman Islands...

				GEKKO
			(rising, finished
			with lunch)
		Think about incorporating yourself
		there, Bud, Harold will take care
		of it for you.
			(with a look to Harold)
		... at a reasonable fee. You're
		gonna make a lot of money now Bud...
		stakes are gonna go up, no mistakes...

				BUD
		...piece of cake, Gordon...

	EXT. BEACHFRONT - DAY

	The camera glides off some FISHERMEN hauling their catch off
	their beached boat to Darien who comes tromping out of the
	surf, water glistening off her lean athletic body. Bud
	stands before her, cool seductive eyes, holding out a towel.
	She steps up to him and smiles inscrutably. Takes the towel
	from him, drying herself, instead.

				DARIEN
			(gazing at the beach)
		If I could have anything... this
		would almost do.

				BUD
		Yeah, almost...

	Looks at her, stifles his thought.

				DARIEN
			(teasing)
		So, how did your conference go with
		Gordon?

				BUD
		The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We
		reached an agreement and decided to
		divide up the world between us.

				DARIEN
			(laughs)
		You have modest wants. I like that
		in a man.

				BUD
		And what do you want?

				DARIEN
		...a Turner, a perfect canary
		diaiaond... a Lear jet... world
		peace... the best of everything...

				BUD
		Well, why stop at that?

				DARIEN
		I don't.

				BUD
			(has to smile)
		You're not trouble by any chance.
		Are you?

	She looks at him, tosses the towel over her shoulder and
	starts back toward the house. Buddy watches her go.

	INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

	The annual Teldar Paper stockholders' meeting is in session:
	400 stockholders are there -- many middle aged and older,
	one bag lady. Cromwell sits on an elevated platform at the
	front of the room surrounded by an army of bulky EXECUTIVES,
	none of them weighing less than 200 pounds, ACCOUNTANTS and
	LAWYERS. Gekko in contrast seems like Robin Hood seated with
	Alex, Harold, Bud and the other stockholders. Cromwell is
	delivering his prepared attack on Gekko in a highly
	sarcastic, gruff manner.

				CROMWELL
		...Your company, ladies and
		gentlemen, is under siege from
		Gordon Gekko.
		Teldar Paper is now leveraged to
		the hilt, like some piss poor South
		American country...instead of using
		our cash to build plants, build our
		business, all this man really wants
		is to get paid to withdraw his
		tender offer and that will cost us
		approximately another $200 million
		in greenmail which will be passed
		on to the consumer...

	Gekko seething, jumps up.

				GEKKO
		Where do you get off speaking about
		me like that, making remarks to the
		press, I resent these remarks, I
		demand the right to speak.

				CROMWELL
		Sit down, sir, you're out of order,
		haven't you done enough damage to
		Teldar as it is?...have you no
		sense of decency?
			(to shareholders)
		How can your management...

	Gekko is urged to sit down by his people but we hear various
	catcalls, "Let the man speak!" "Sit down, Gekko!"

				CROMWELL (CONT'D)
		...concentrate on long term growth
		when we're busy fighting the get-
		rich-quick, short term profit, slot
		machine mentality of Wall Street
		when we should be fighting Japan!
		The original fundamental reason for
		Wall Street was to capitalize
		American business, underwrite new
		business, build companies, build
		America. The "deal" has now
		succeeded goods and services as
		America's gross national product
		and in the process, we are
		undermining our foundation. This
		cancer is called "greed". Greed and
		speculation have replaced long-term
		investment. Corporations are being
		taken apart like erector sets,
		without any consideration of the
		public good. I strongly recommend
		you to see through Mr. Gekko's
		shameless intention here to
		strip this company and severely
		penalize the stockholders. I
		strongly recommend you to reject
		his tender by voting for
		management's restructuring of the
		stock.

						CUT TO:

	Gekko is now at floor level with a microphone. He's calmer,
	makes his pitch to the stockholders, looking up at the
	management.

				GEKKO
		...I appreciate the chance you're
		giving me, Mr. Cromwell, as the
		single largest stockholder in
		Teldar, to speak.
			(gets some laughter
			and applause, loosens)
		On the way here today I saw a
		bumper sticker. It said, "Life is a
		bitch... then you die".
			(gets another laugh)
		...well ladies and gentlemen, we're
		not here to indulge in fantasies,
		but in political and economic
		reality. America has become a
		second rate power. Our trade
		deficit and fiscal deficit are at
		nightmare proportions. In the days
		of the 'free market' when our
		country was a top industrial power,
		there was accountability to the
		shareholders. The Carnegies, the
		Mellons, the man who built this
		industrial empire, made sure of it
		because it was their money at stake.
		Today management has no stake in
		the company. Altogether these guys
		sitting up there own a total of
		less than 3% and where does Mr.
		Cromwell put his million dollar
		salary? Certainly not in Teldar
		stock, he owns less than 1%.
		You own Teldar Paper, the
		stockholders, and you are being
		royally screwed over by these
		bureaucrats with their steak
		lunches, golf and hunting trips,
		corporate jets, and golden
		parachutes! Teldar Paper has 33
		different vice presidents each
		earning over $200,000 a year. I
		spent two months analyzing what
		these guys did and I still can't
		figure it out.
			(a big laugh)


	Cromwell is pissed.

				CROMWELL
		This is an outrage Gekko! You're
		full of shit!

				GEKKO
		One thing I do know is this paper
		company lost $110 million last
		year, and I'd bet half of that is
		in the paperwork going back and
		forth between all the vice
		presidents...
			(increased laughter,
			he's getting them)
		The new law of evolution in
		corporate America seems to be
		'survival of the unfittest'. Well
		in my book, you either do it right
		or you get eliminated. Teldar Paper
		is doomed to fail. Its
		diversification into casualty
		insurance has not worked. Its crown
		jewels are its trees, the rest is
		dross. Through wars, depressions,
		inflations and deterioration of
		paper money, trees have always kept
		their value, but Teldar is chopping
		them all down. Forests are
		perishable, forest rights are as
		important as human rights to this
		planet, and all the illusory
		Maginot lines, scorched earth
		tactics, proxy fights, poison
		pills, etc. that Mr.
		Cromwell is going to come up with
		to prevent people like me from
		buying Teldar Paper are doomed to
		fail because the bottom line,
		ladies and gentlemen, as you very
		well know, is the only way to stay
		strong is to create value, that's
		why you buy stock, to have it go up.
		If there's any other reason, I've
		never hear it.
			(laughter)
		That's all I'm saying...it's you
		people who own this company, not
		them, they work for you and they've
		done a lousy job of it. Get rid of
		them fast, before you all get sick
		and die. I may be an opportunist,
		but if these clowns did a better
		job, I'd be out of work. In the
		last seven deals I've been in,
		there were 2.3 million stockholders
		that actually made a pretax profit
		of $12 billion. When I bought the
		Ixtlan Corporation it was in the
		exact same position Teldar is
		today -- I turned three of its
		companies private and I sold four
		others -- and each of these
		companies, liberated from the
		suffering conglomerate has
		prospered. I am not a destroyer of
		companies, I am a liberator of them.
		The point is, ladies and gentlemen,
		greed is good. Greed works, greed
		is right. Greed clarifies, cuts
		through, and captures the essence
		of the evolutionary spirit. Greed
		in all its forms, greed for life,
		money, love, knowledge, has marked
		the upward surge of mankind -- and
		greed, mark my words -- will save
		not only Teldar Paper but that
		other malfunctioning corporation
		called the USA...Thank you.

	Much applause as he sits. Now a standing ovation; shouts of
	approval. Cromwell knows he has lost the day, tries to
	continue the meeting by calling for "order".

	Bud watches, impressed.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	BROKERS mill at their desks quietly. Bud enters, notices
	immediately the uneasy silence. His eyes go to Lynch's
	office... across the windows, he's talking to a very somber
	Dan Steeples.

				BUD
		What's going on?

				MARV
			(looking in the same direction)
		Lynch is giving him the boot...
		He's not pulling his quota.

	Bud's soft "no" matched by that second, tighter look. His
	POV -- closer on the glass... Dan Steeples pleading for his
	job... we know the things he's saying, we've heard them
	before... just one more chance, Mr. Lynch... Lynch shaking
	his head...

				MARV
			(reminding him)
		...we're all just one trade away
		from humility, Buddy...

	Dan Steeples steps out of the office, obviously close to
	tears but trying to maintain face... Buddy's eyes dart away,
	not wanting to deal with it. Dan Steeples walks by his as
	Lynch, on the loudspeaker, starts his morning announcements.

				LYNCH
		New research report on GM and a
		conference call on defense stocks
		at my office at 11. No RSVP
		required, just be there. And on an
		inspiring note I'm pleased to
		announce the new office record for
		a single month's gross commission
		goes to Bud Fox. Who more than
		doubled the old mark. Way to go Bud.
		Super job! Come on up here.

	As Dan Rickey passes him during this, Bud catches a glimpse
	of the older man's eyes. Dan tries to look brave. Heads
	turning to Bud with awe and envy...

				MARV
		Congrats buddy buddy, you just made
		my life twice as hard around here...

	Bud moving toward Lynch, past Lou Mannheim.

				MANNHEIM
		You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it
		while it lasts -- 'cause it never
		does.

				BUD
			(cocky)
		...just kickin' ass and taking
		names, Mr. Mannheim.

	Bud passes Charlie Cushing, yawning on the phone as usual.

				CHARLIE
		So whaddaya say pal, wanna play
		some doubles at Piping? Meet the
		membership? I got a little blonde
		named Mandy, about nineteen, avec
		cafe au lait boobs... she's mine
		but she's got a cousin who has
		great muffins.

				BUD
		...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping
		Rock any day.

	Chuck laughs, Bud's "in" now. Lynch indicates for Bud to
	follow him into an outer glass-enclosed office.

				LYNCH
		Come in, Bud...

	INT. BUD'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

	Neatly furnished, with a window overlooking Wall Street, and
	attractive CHINESE SECRETARY filing papers into a cabinet.

				LYNCH
			(points)
		Congratulations. This is yours
		now... your own file cabinets... a
		window ... your private secretary,
		Janet,
			(under his breath)
		significantly more attractive.

				JANET
		Nice to meet you, Mr. Fox.

	She smiles at Bud, who heaves a sigh of relief, noticing his
	name plate on the desk.

				BUD
			(thrilled)
		Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr.
		Lynch.

				LYNCH
		No, thank you. I knew the minute I
		laid eyes on you, you had what it
		takes Bud. Just keep it going.

	He winks and leaves. Charlie Cushing comes in, Marv sticks
	his head in the doorway, a grudging smile.

				MARV
		So, its Mister Fox now.

	INT. CONDOMINIUM APARTMENT - UPPER EAST SIDE - DAY

	A splendid four-room thirtieth floor aerie overlooking
	Central Park. SYLVIE DRIMMER, anchored down with jewelry and
	a large fur purse, shows Bud around.

				SYLVIE
		...everybody tells ya they hate the
		Upper East Side and they wanna live
		on the West Side but honey when it
		comes to resale time, believe me
		the East Side's the one that always
		moves. What do you get on the West
		Side?
			(contemptuously)
		Madonna and Sean?... between Sly
		and Billy and Christie, I've shown
		every apartment on the Upper East
		Side. Everybody lives here... Mick,
		Gloria and Barbara Wa-Wa. Even
		Klaus von Bulow buys his fresh
		fruit from the Korean on Madison.
		It's so expensive and it's just
		like the ones on Eighth Avenue but
		it's an attitude is all, you pay
		for attitude
			(pointing to a walk-
			in closet)
		...two walk-in closets...upstairs
		on the roof you lot a health
		club...massage, sauna, jacuzzi,
		sunlights, best schools in the
		city, cute boy like you gotta think
		of a ladyfriend when you're
		finished wolfing around --
			('course I'm taken)
		...oak strip floor...my husband can
		get you a 10% mortgage...I'd do it
		myself if we weren't into four
		other deals already...so?...
			(beat)
		I got a four o'clock and a
		five...one of them's an all-cash
		type, Monique something or
		other...I guarantee you this place
		is history tomorrow...

	Bud looks around. The city at his feet. Lost in thought.
	Sylvie has to call him out of it: "honey? -- The meter's
	running. Anybody home?"

				BUD
		All right. Offer 950...

	Sylvie tries to play it cool, her expression conveying a
	somewhat stunned look at the speed and certainty of the
	response.

				SYLVIE
		...I think you gotta deal, honey...
		you sure you don't wanna see
		somethin' I got on Sutton Place.
		It's a million and a half but...

				BUD
		Nah...this is it..home...

	Looking it over, proud.

	INTERIOR DECORATING MONTAGE

	The music is geared to speed, money, triumph and just plain
	material fun.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY/NIGHT

	In its first stage, Darien supervising. It's expanse of
	white walls devoid of mouldings, a blank plaster canvas. The
	city views are great, the apartment identical to hundreds of
	other cookie cutter condos. Several young artists are
	working on a neo-classical mural on the long side of the
	living room. They are colorfully dressed, listening to a
	TALKING HEADS tape while they work. A carpenter who looks
	like a member of Duran Duran is installing a pair of old
	columns from Urban Archaeology on either side of the
	entrance to the living room while another fits a brass sink
	into an antique sideboard which has been turned into a bar.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY/NIGHT

	INTERIOR DECORATING MONTAGE - SECOND STAGE

	Living room furniture arrives. A fantail shrimp chaise from
	Art Furniture's "Sushi Collection" arrives, along with an
	enormous sofa encased in an ecru linen slipcover made
	deliberately baggy and tied on with rows of self bows on
	each end, several faux Etruscan pots wired up as lamps, a
	poured concrete coffee table that looks like it came from
	Pompeii, and a hand-painted floor cloth instead of a rug for
	the bleached floor with the stencilled border... Darien
	sitting in a fantastical adirondack chair made from gnarled
	branches, amused by Bud's reactions to the furniture.

	THIRD STAGE. The kitchen has the latest compact computer
	dishwasher and compact microwave, garbage compactor, and
	sinks with infrared controls... A brief food montage gives
	us a sense of the modernist approach to food and its
	preparation:

	1) Darien hones the knives on the electric knife sharpener as

	2) Bud uses a stainless steel Cape Cod oyster opener to work
	on two dozen oysters...

	3) at the same time working on the automatic vinaigrette
	mixer, the phone ringing to the tune of Mozart's "Jupiter"...

				BUD
			(picking it up)
		Yes...no...at 37 1/2. Convert the
		bonds right...and check the price
		in Tokyo at 8:00 LA time. Thanks...

	4) As he starts his pasta sauce flame an his O'Reilly fat-
	free grill with a flexible neck fire starter...

	5) A freshly heated roll pops out of a hanging space-saving
	toaster, as Darien works the electric pasta maker while
	melting the frozen ice cream cartons in the microwave.

	6) Bud manages to sneak a kiss an her lips humming the bars
	from Verdi's "Rigoletto" as he works the piece de la
	resistance--the automatic sushi maker...

	7) Dinner is finally served on a demolished dinner table.
	Red wine, pasta, sushi...it looks perfect, lit by
	candlelight, the view of the city below.

				DARIEN
		...isn't it perfect!

				BUD
		...too perfect...let's not even eat.
		Let's just watch it and think about
		it.
			(pause)

	FOURTH STAGE - INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

	Bud goes over a stack of bills with something approaching
	concern as the gothic oak refectory table which seats 20 is
	carried in, followed by a Jean Michel Basquiat featuring a
	skull on a rough board. Darien instructs the movers to place
	an important pair of satinwood Art Deco armchairs upholstered
	in buttery suede (last Saturday's auction purchase for
	$20,000) at either end of the titanic sofa. No vestige is
	left of the cookie cutter space we first saw. Walls have
	been removed, mouldings and architectural found objects
	added, imitation rare woods, marbles and frescos have been
	created from nothing by the magic hands of the tromp l'oeil
	crew. The point is, decorating can transform.

	INT. CONDO - NIGHT

	The look of the place is evocative of ancient times, yet
	sumptuous. Darien and Bud sink into the bales of down in the
	sofa and are dwarfed. She rests her head on a hand stencilled
	velvet Venetian throw pillow, looking like a Pre-Raphaelite
	madonna. A terracotta pot with a spray of white phaleonopsis
	graces the coffee table. As the sun sets over the canyons of
	highrises, Bud walks around his new home totally in awe.
	This apartment, perfect in its restrained taste with all the
	"correct" flowers and objects, has nothing to do with him.
	Perhaps he can understand the state-of-the-art kitchen, the
	computerized telephone, stereo and light system, but he
	needs a set of instructions just to be able to switch on
	David Letterman.

	This apartment is Darien's fantasy, and Bud is merely the
	incidental client who paid for it. Most importantly to her,
	it is ready to be photographed by House and Garden.

				BUD
			(dubiously looking at
			a rough plaster wall
			of fading fresco)
		You know, the elevator man couldn't
		believe I paid $300,000 to have my
		walls looking like this, he's got
		them for free in Brooklyn.

				DARIEN
		I'll bet he's got an opinion on the
		stock market too. This apartment is
		already ahead of its time. I call
		it the "demolished" look. They've
		already heard about it at House and
		Garden and they're coming next week
		to photograph it before it gets...
		lived in. Is that alright? I'd love
		to have it in my portfolio.

				BUD
		Sure... But your fee... considering
		you're way over budget, should be
		negotiable.

	As he nuzzles her neck, she feels threatened, stops.

				DARIEN
		Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm
		not going to take a cut. I worked
		hard and you can't decorate a room
		in New York for less than $100,000.
		Curtains alone...

				BUD
		I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're
		still young, Darien. So what's
		money anyway when everybody's
		making it, it's all relative. After
		all, this is not the house in
		Connecticut, this is just a crash
		pad good for a couple of
		years...before we slip our two
		lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie
		into the Lycee Francaise.

				DARIEN
		You got it all charted out don't
		you, like a stock projection.
	 
			BUD
		That's right -- one with high
		yield, rich assets and no downside...

	As the kiss grows, his hands move into her nether regions.
	She looks at him, sober.

				DARIEN
		Do you think you're ready?

				BUD
		It's not me I'm worried about...You
		know Darien, the only reason we
		haven't slept together is because
		we both know we will -- and not
		knowing when was the only surprise
		left. You owe me, I want you, what
		else is there...but you, me, the
		world.
			(he folds back her
			palms in his)
		...right here...make love to
		me...now...
			(more kissing)
		Stop me if I'm going too far.

				DARIEN
		I'll let you know.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Bud making love to Darien. Camara closing on them.

	Her face -- from his point of view. Her smile.

	His face -- looking down. Covered with sweat and passion.

				BUD
		Is this real? Is this really real?

	EXT. BUD'S CONDO - TERRACE - NIGHT

	Bud walks out alone in his blue bathrobe on his parapet
	overlooking Central Park. The wind stirs his hair. The East
	and West sides of the park wrap the city in a diamond
	necklace of brilliant light.

	Bud stares down at the world. He has it all now. The money.
	The girl. The magic palace apartment. What more is there?
	Something...because Bud suddenly throws a wrenching
	dislocated look into himself that makes us wonder as he
	brushes his hand across his face and mutters to himself.

				BUD
		Who am I?

	There is no ready answer. As he finally turns and goes back
	inside and closes the door.

	INT. BUD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Darien lies curled in the bed, eyes open, looking at him.

				DARIEN
		Come to bed, Bud...

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - TWILIGHT

	Cocktail hour in the background, yuppies trying to score for
	the weekend. Bud on the phone, strained look transforming to
	a bright, upbeat personality as the phone is answered.

				BUD
		Dixon! It's your lucky day! That's
		right. I want to give you some
		stock and you don't have to put up
		a penny...

						INTERCUT:

	EXT. CABIN - ASPEN COLORADO - DAY

	A small cabin in the mountains.

	INT. CABIN - ASPEN COLORADO - DAY

	Whole earth furnishings. DIXON, a long-haired ski bum
	dropout listens skeptically.

				DIXON
		Sure, and I'm never gonna die
		either, is this one of your chain
		letter schemes or do I gotta buy a
		door to door cosmetic franchise in
		Northern Arkansas?

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - TWILIGHT

				BUD
		No, no Dixon, my client wants to
		buy a large, large block of stock
		and needs to spread it around. I'll
		park some money in your account and
		if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm
		telling you, this is the easiest
		money you ever made...

	INT. ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - DAY

	Roger listens on the phone.

				BUD
			(off)
		...and you don't have to put up a
		dime, Roger.

				ROGER
			(tentatively)
		All right, Bud... let's do it.

	A look on his face. As if he knows he's making a fatal mistake.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

				BUD
			(on the phone)
		...it's easy Jack! On settlement
		day, you endorse a check to Blue
		Horseshoe Trading Company. Then I
		send you your cut.

	Marv waves across the glass partition and knocks. But Bud
	waves him off, closing the blinds.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		...that's the bottom line. And
		nobody gets hurt.

	Marv now walks it, exasperated.

				MARV
		...things are so bad, even the
		liars are complaining. And you're
		making money. So what gives? What's
		the bottom line?

	As he tries to peak at Bud's quotron screen, but Bud flicks
	it off, pissed.

				BUD
		Hey, I'm tired of playing nurse to
		you all the time, alright. Do your
		own home work!

	Marvin abruptly walks out, "asshole!". Bud books the order
	for Morning Star Corp -- MSC -- 50,000 June options.

	INT. AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - LATER THAT DAY

	The COMPANY FLOOR MANAGER gets Bud's order, hands a ticket
	to a RUNNER who dashes off across the exchange floor, and
	over to a TRADER who starts to execute the order.

	CLOSE on the broad tape. As Bud's large buy order flickers
	across it -- MSC -- 50,000 June options.

	INT. AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - S.E.C. OPTIONS WATCH OFFICE -
	DAY

	A CLERK sits before a computer routinely tracking all of the
	exchange floor trading. He runs a check on a transaction.

	Computer Screen -- The same numbers and letters are seen
	that just flickered across the broad tape... Bud's buy.

	The clerk swivels his chair to a second computer and punches
	up data. A MAN appears behind him, leaning over his
	shoulder, and wears an ID BADGE. The clerk vacates his seat
	to the man with the badge, who now takes over.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - NIGHT

	Bud is in silk boxers on the phone, number crunching on the
	computer, foot pounding to a music beat on the stereo, while
	his telex spews out overnight currency data.

	Darien in the background lies in bed in panties reading Vogue.

				BUD
			(into the phone)
		Buy me 20 June Euro Dollar CDs.
		Twenty March gold and sell 10
		September Deutsch marks. That's
		right...

	He hangs up, back to the computer a growing look of
	excitement and revelation in his eyes.

	On the computer screen we see a break up Of Bluestar
	Airlines -- its assets and liabilities.

	Bud hits the command key, printing it out. He's exuberant.

				BUD
		Bud, I hate to tell you this but
		you're a genius!
			(to Darien)
		Darien...lightning has struck! The
		lightbulb has been invented.
		Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are
		watching...

				DARIEN
			(grumpy)
		...are you going to trade all night
		again? You got to go to work in a
		couple of hours.

				BUD
		You think I'm gonna broker the rest
		of my life... I'm going to be a
		giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in
		the Italian 15th century sense of
		the word -- a mover, shaker.

	Bud dances over to the bed turning the stereo down on his way.

				BUD
		I love you, baby. Did I tell you
		that sometime in the last 24 hours?

				DARIEN
		Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the
		sixty hour work week? You're
		turning into a yuppie Frankenstein,
		you love money so much.

	Bud grabs a bottle of Ferrier off the night table and drinks.

				BUD
		Sure, why not, money's the sex of
		the 80's. I never had it like you
		when I was growing up, baby, it
		wasn't the upper east side.

				DARIEN
		You're so naive Bud, you don't even
		know. Your dad took care of you. I
		might've been rich when I was a
		kid...but my father lost all his
		money...in the seventies, in the
		stock market, at the track. He was
		a lousy gambler...

				BUD
			(teasing)
		...that changes all my plans, I
		thought you were loaded...

				DARIEN
			(laughs woefully)
		So did I, till I hit 19 and found I
		had all the royal habits and no
		throne. Mom got by but I had to go
		to work just like you.
		Only the skills I had were shopping
		and making friends. So...that's why
		I do what I do, what makes you
		tick, Buddy?

				BUD
		Fear. The fear of being poor I
		guess, just like you, Darien... But
		that's all gonna change sweetheart.
		I'm catching the express...
			(making love to her)
		... and you're going along for the
		ride.

	INT. GEKKO'S PRIVATE PLANE (GULFSTREAM - 4) - DAY

	A salon interior. Gekko on a couch reading, with eyeglasses,
	a stack of financial reports. Alex is on the phone, Susan,
	and others accompanying the caravan on a business trip. Bud
	is excited.

				BUD
		...Bluestar's an unpolished gem,
		Gordon, right out of the garbage. A
		half assed management being
		decimated by a price war they can't
		win. But the gates at LaGuardia
		alone can bail us out, it's worth
		25 bucks a share if it's worth a
		dime! They're ripe to fall.

	Gekko, the poker player, hasn't seen enough cards.

				GEKKO
		Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry
		Wildman going off a cliff in my new
		Maserati. Men as smart as myself
		have got their asses handed to them
		on a sling with the airlines, fuel
		could go up, unions are killers...

				BUD
		Yeah aren't you forgetting
		something Gordon: rule one, capital
		reserves. This company has $75
		million cash in an overfunded
		pension. That buys us a lot of
		credibility...
			(Gordon looks up, interested)
		...and the beauty is you already
		own close to two percent of this
		sucker...

				ALEX
			(interrupting, on the phone)
		Gordon, the insurance people are
		balking on the logging trucks...

				GEKKO
		Tell those spineless toads we'll
		self-insure if they don't write
		it... You fire 33 vice presidents
		and nothing changes...
			(back to Bud)
		You eating twinkies today, Bud, or
		are you schtupping some stewardess...

				BUD
			(deadly serious)
		Gordon what I want--and I never
		asked you for anything--is to be
		your co-pilot on this. I want to
		take this airline, turn it around,
		and make it work. It's gonna make
		us a fortune!

				GEKKO
			(to Susan)
		I'm talking to a stockbroker who
		wants to run an airline. It's gonna
		take me two years and 2000
		headaches to turn Teldar Paper
		around, what do I need this dink
		airline for? I'm up to my ass in
		more nuts than a fruitcake.

				BUD
		Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I
		know my way around, I have friends
		there...inside.

				GEKKO
			(getting the drift)
		What does that mean?

				BUD
			(playing out his ace)
		The three unions. It's 43% of
		Bluestar's operating budget, the
		hourly cost of a flight crew is
		$850 an hour, that's the real
		hidden value G.G., if you can
		negotiate that out, get a crew down
		to $350-400 an hour a run, this
		airline is gonna be the hottest
		thing since Texas Air...

				GEKKO
		What makes you think you can?

				BUD
		I can talk to these people Gordon,
		they trust me...and my father can
		be a big help in getting cuts.

				GEKKO
			(pause)
		Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on
		the box. I want him to look at it.
		And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick,
		Jensen...
			(smiles wickedly,
			back to Bud)
		So sport, the falcon has heard the
		falconer...tell me more...

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Bud, in high gear, all smiles, expensive Armani suit, opens
	the door. His father stands before him, looking like a man
	on his way to the dentist.

				BUD
		Dad, well come on in. Everybody's
		here. We couldn't start the show
		without you.

	Wide-eyed, Carl follows Bud through the foyer, taking in the
	furnishings, paintings, antiques.

				CARL
			(under his breath)
		Well I'll be a lousy Republican.

				DARIEN
			(overhears him)
		I decorate for Democrats too, lots
		of them.
			(she extends her hand
			and gives him a warm smile)
		I'm Darien Taylor.

				CARL
			(sardonically)
		I know. You're one of the art works
		that go with the apartment.
			(softens a little)
		Pretty creative. Doesn't look
		anything like the place my son
		bought a few months age.

				DARIEN
		Listen, I hope you'll come here
		often, and under less formal
		circumstances.

	Halfway won over Carl enters the living room where Darien
	has set up a table with miniature gourmet pizza, etc. The
	atmosphere is strained, the camps separated. Gekko stands by
	the bar, conferring with his lawyer, Harold Salt. Darien
	walks over to the couch with drinks for the Ixtax Union
	Reps: DUNCAN WILMORE, ALPA Leader, a rugged silver-haired
	uniformed pilot; TONI CARPENTER, AFA Rep, hard looking,
	40ish flight attendant.

				BUD
		Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore,
		pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter,
		flight attendants...

				CARL
		I met them before you were born.

	They exchange nods.

				BUD
		And I'd like to introduce you to Mr.
		Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.

				GEKKO
		A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.

	Carl stares at Gekko, sizing him up.

				GEKKO
		I'd be proud to have a son like Bud.
		He's got a great future ahead of him.

	Carl looks to his fellow union representatives, then to Gekko.

				CARL
			(gesturing at Salt)
		I thought this was an informal
		meeting. What's he doing here?

				GEKKO
			(dismissing him)
		Harold, you don't mind strolling
		around the block a couple hundred
		times, do you?

				HAROLD
			(looks at his watch)
		Of course...

	Salt gathers his jacket to leave, as Gekko and Carl eye one
	another, tentatively.

				DARIEN
		...please help yourselves to some
		food...

						CUT TO:

	The food is half consumed. Gekko addresses the union leaders.

				GEKKO
		Look, I have no illusions about
		winning a popularity contest with
		any of you. I was roasted the other
		night, and a friend of mine asked--
		why are we honoring this man--have
		we run out of human beings?

	His joke breaks the ice; they laugh, except for Carl.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
		It's not always the most popular
		guy who gets the job done. You got
		losses of 20 to 30 million dollars,
		dividends cut to zero, you're
		getting squeezed to death by the
		majors. Present management may not
		be the worst scum of the earth, but
		they're the ones who've put you on
		a kamikaze course, and pretty soon
		everybody's going to be scrambling
		for the parachutes. Only there
		aren't enough to go around.
		Management has them. You don't. If
		they throw Bluestar into Chapter
		11--which I think they will--then
		they can use bankruptcy laws to
		break your unions and your
		contracts and throw you guys off
		the property.

	We hear a loud crunching sound as Bud's father bites into a
	roll, glaring at Gekko.

				WILMORE
			(pilot)
		With all due respect, Mr. Gekko,
		what's to prevent you from doing
		the same thing?

				GEKKO
		Cause I have a way around all this,
		a way we can all make money and
		make this airline profitable again.
		What do you say we cut to the chase.
		I'm asking for a modest twenty
		percent across-the-board wage cut.

	Carl drops his fork on the plate. Gekko goes on.

				GEKKO
		And seven more hours a month.

	Toni Carpenter and Duncan Wilmore exchange questionable looks.

				CARPENTER
		What kind of time frame are we
		talking about here?

				GEKKO
		Give me a year. If we're still
		losing money, the reductions stand.
		If however, we move into the black,
		I return part of the givebacks,
		salaries go back to present levels,
		and...
			(a beat)
		we institute an employee profit
		sharing program with stock. You'll
		own part of the airline.

	Carpenter and Wilmore react with surprise, it's obvious they
	weren't expecting the profit sharing part. Bud smiles at
	Darien and looks to his father, who examines a sushi roll
	before putting it back.

				WILMORE
		Are you prepared to put that in
		writing?

				GEKKO
		I'll have a letter of agreement
		drawn up within two days.

				CARPENTER
		What's your marketing strategy? How
		do you plan to return us to
		profitability?

				GEKKO
		Why don't I give Bud an opportunity
		to answer that.

	Darien and Carl turn to Bud, who puts down his wine glass.
	 
			BUD
		Thank you Mr. Gekko. First of all I
		want you to know my door will
		always be open to you cause I know
		from my Dad it's you guys that keep
		Bluestar flying. One -- Modernize.
		Our computer software is weak, we
		update it, we squeeze every dollar
		out of each seat and mile flown.
		You don't sell a seat to a guy for
		$89 when he's willing to pay $389.
		Effective inventory management
		through computerization will
		increase our load factor by 5 to
		20%, that translates to
		approximately 50 to 200 million
		dollars in revenues; the point is,
		we can beat the majors at a price
		war. Two -- Advertising -- more,
		more, and aggressive, attack the
		majors. Three -- expand our hubs to
		Atlanta, North Carolina and Dallas,
		reorganize all our feeder schedules,
		think Big -- guys, we're going
		after the majors!

	The men are visibly shaken by Bud's determination.

				GEKKO
			(looking for reactions)
		Cards are on the table. What do you
		think?

				WILMORE
			(restrained, hopeful)
		If you mean what you say, I think
		we're in the ball park. I'll take
		it to my people.

				CARPENTER
			(approvingly)
		You've sketched some broad strokes.
		I'd like to see the fine print. But
		so far so good.

	Gekko looks to Carl Fox who, putting down knife and fork,
	breaks his silence.

				CARL
		I guess if a man lives long enough,
		he gets to see everything. And I
		mean everything. What else do you
		have in your bag of tricks, Mr. Gekko?

	Bud tenses, looking at his father. Gekko ignores the
	innuendo and replies softly.

				GEKKO
		Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving
		much more. If you have any
		suggestions I'll be glad to listen.

				CARL
		There came into Egypt a Pharoah who
		did not know.

				GEKKO
			(smiling)
		I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?

				CARL
			(smiling)
		No, it's a prophecy. The rich have
		been doing it to the poor since the
		beginning of time. The only
		difference between the Pyramids and
		the Empire State Building is that
		the Egyptians didn't have unions.
			(looking at Wilmore
			and Carpenter)
		I know what this guy is about--
		greed--he's in and out for the buck
		and he don't take prisoners. He
		don't give a damn about Northstar
		or us ...

				BUD
		Now, wait a minute, Dad...

				GEKKO
			(shrugs, keeping his composure)
		Sure. What's worth doing is worth
		doing for money. It's a bad bargain
		where nobody gains. And if this
		deal goes through, we all gain.

	Carl throws down his napkin, rises from the chair, looks at
	the others.

				CARL
			(looks at Bud)
		'Course my son did work three
		summers as a baggage handler and
		freight loader. With those
		qualifications, why should I doubt
		his ability to run an airline?

	There is frozen silence at the table.

				GEKKO
		Fine, if you don't want us, stay
		with the scum in present
		management--dedicated to running
		you and Bluestar into the ground.

				CARL
		...that "scum" built this company
		up from one plane in thirty years,
		they made something out of nothing,
		and if that's a scum I'll take one
		over a rat any day...

	Carl turns and leaves. Bud glances at Gekko, reading his
	piercing look. He hurries after his father.

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Bud catches up to Carl, waiting for the elevator, hammering
	him.

				BUD
			(seething)
		Congratulations. You did a great
		job of embarrassing me in there--
		not to mention yourself! Save the
		"workers of the world unite" speech
		for next time Dad, I heard it too
		much growing up. You're gonna get
		axed Dad, no two ways about it, you
		and the whole airline are going
		down the tubes, you hear me, just
		like Braniff, you don't have a
		chance in hell, and if it isn't
		Gekko it's gonna be some other killer.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Carl steps into the elevator, Bud follows.

				CARL
		He's got your prick in his back
		pocket, son, and you're standing
		naked in the display window of
		Macy's. He's using you. Only you're
		too blind to see it.

				BUD
		No, what I see is a jealous old
		machinist who can't stand that his
		son's become more successful than
		himself.

				CARL
		What you see, son, is a man who
		never measured success by the size
		of a man's wallet.

				BUD
		That's because you never had the
		guts to go out into the world and
		stake your claim.

				CARL
			(lamentably)
		Boy, if that's what you think, I
		must've really screwed up my job as
		a father.

	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

	Bud and Carl exit the elevator and head across the luxury
	lobby.

				CARL (CONT'D)
		...as far as being axed, I'm still
		here and as long as I am, I have a
		responsibility not just to me but
		to the union members I represent...

				BUD
			(pleading now)
		Your responsibility, Dad, is to
		present the facts, not your
		opinions, to the men... you're
		gonna destroy their lives, Dad!
		Don't do it to 'em. Give it a
		chance. Let the membership decide
		for themselves, Dad. Please.

				CARL
		I'll be damned that when my men
		come to me tomorrow morning,
		wanting to know what's going on,
		I'm going to lie to them!

				BUD
		Your men! All my life "your men"
		have been able to count on you? Why
		is it that you've never been there
		for me?

	They head through the doors, out onto the street.

	EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

	Bud following Carl.

				BUD
		And what if you're wrong? What if
		one day, the sun didn't rise in the
		East and birds didn't fly South in
		winter and for once in your life
		your compass was off? Huh?

	He grabs Carl by the arm, stopping him.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		Would you be willing to wreck your
		men's future? My future? Please...
		Dad. Think. Be practical, for a
		change. I'm asking you, I'm fucking
		begging you...

	Bud lets go of Carl's arm. Carl looks at his son, seeing the
	desperation. Sadness and confusion take hold of him.

				CARL
		I don't sleep with no whore and I
		don't wake up with no whore. That's
		how I live with myself, Buddy. I
		don't know how you do.
			(a beat)
		I hope I'm wrong, I'll let them
		decide for themselves, that much I
		promise you.

	He walks away. Bud watches him go, knows he has won.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud, increasingly frazzled and determined, dark circles
	under his eyes paces with the phone...

				JANET
			(his secretary)
		Mr. Dixon Brandt on 3...

				BUD
			(wearily switching over)
		What's up Dixon?
			(stopping, focusing)
		Calm down! What are you talking about?

						INTERCUT TO:

	INT. DIXON'S CABIN - ASPEN COLORADO - DAY

	Dixon, the rich man's son and ski bum, is yelling on the
	other end of the line.

				DIXON
		...this guy who said he was from
		the Security Exchange Commission,
		whatever the hell that is, calls
		and wants to ask me about that
		stock I bought...

				BUD
			(nervous)
		What'd you tell him?

				DIXON
		I told him I was in the bathroom
		and I'd call him right back. What
		the hell was I supposed to say
		Buddy, you got me into...

				BUD
		Look Dixon, calm down! It's not
		illegal to buy stock or to be right.
		And it's not all that unusual to be
		spot checked on a big buy. Tell him
		you did your homework and you
		thought the stock was a sound
		investment.

				DIXON
		What if he asks where I got the money?

				BUD
		Tell 'em your father gave it to you.

				DIXON
		What if they call him?

				BUD
		They won't. That's not their
		jurisdiction.

				DIXON
		You sure?

				BUD
		Yes! Read the Constitution, it's
		all in there. And remember--you
		don't know anything, nothing.

				DIXON
		I don't know anything!

				BUD
		Good. Then call him back. And call
		me back. Don't worry.

	He hangs up, a worried expression, Marv entering to break
	his concentration.

				MARV
		Hey you hear the news. I just got a
		job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat
		'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.

				BUD
			(icy)
		Didn't I tell you to knock before
		you came in here?

				MARV
		Hey the door was open.

				BUD
		Then get out and close it behind you.

				MARV
			(pause)
		You know what you need, buddy
		buddy--an optorectomy. That's when
		they cut the nerve that runs from
		your brain to your rectum--to
		change that shitty attitude of yours.

				BUD
		Get the hell out!

	Marv slams the door on his way...

	EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DOWNTOWN NEW YORK - DAY

	Long shot of the towering stone structure. A tall angular
	figure crosses through the glass doors with a bulky folder
	under his arm...

	INT. LOBBY - DAY

	The man flashes his ID to a SECURITY GUARD who buzzes him
	through the gate... He walks towards us and we see he is the
	familiar tall, baby-faced INVESTIGATOR from the S.E.C.
	Options Watch Office... he gets in an elevator.

	INT. S.E.C. INVESTIGATION OFFICES - DAY

	He walks into the office of a CHIEF INVESTIGATOR. A balding
	sharp-featured man in a drab suit with bags of hard work
	under his eyes looks up as the young investigator places the
	large file in front of him.

	INT. ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - DAY

	Bud enters, preoccupied. Barnes is nervous.

				BUD
		So what's the problem?

				ROGER
			(whispers)
		...got a strange call from the SEC.
		They asked to see my records...
		Bud, this is a heavy...

				BUD
			(shrugs)
		....Relax Roget
			(French pronunciation)
		You're 82M in the account numbers
		and I'm the Invisible Man...
		they're always looking for red
		flags, Gekko's always getting
		checked by them, they never come up
		with anything... we're invulnerable
		on this...

				ROGER
		Alright... I just wanna slow down
		Bud... no more calls for awhile, no
		lunches... we suspend our business,
		alright...

				BUD
		Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's
		cool.

	A young lawyer pops his head in the room.

				LAWYER
		Rog, come on, bring the cost report.
		They started.
			(exits)


				ROGER
			(standing, to Bud)
		Gekko asked us into the Bluestar
		deal. We're reviewing the
		timetables, wanna come?

				BUD
			(surprised)
		He never told me...

				ROGER
		You're just the President of the
		company, what do you know? ... Come
		on.

	As they walk out.

	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

	Smoky, coffee cups and food. THREE LAWYERS, TWO INVESTMENT
	BANKERS, THREE COMMERCIAL BANKERS, sleeves rolled up, ties
	askew. A blackboard with Bluestar's assets diagrammed. A
	combat mood in the room. Bud walking in, feels vaguely
	worried, something is not quite right.

				ROGER
		You guys know the new chief of
		Bluestar... Bud Fox.

	They nod vaguely respectful but Bud's obviously a figure
	head to them, takes a seat off to the side. The bull-like
	INVESTMENT BANKER, Vietnam vet, in shirt and suspenders, is
	on the attack against the stuffier Commercial Bankers.

				INVESTMENT BANKER
		Look guys, what's the problem,
		let's for the kill...Gekko's got
		12% and climbing plus the unions
		are in his pocket for now,
		everybody on the street knows the
		stock's in play
			(overlapping voice:
			up 2 1/4 since the open)
		by next week the street's gonna own
		Bluestar and management won't be
		able to do anything but poison
		their own pill. Why are you guys
		dicking around? Is the bank
		financing in place or are we gonna
		have more and more meetings? Our
		firm's gonna guarantee 25% of the
		total debt structure in long-term
		junk bonds, now you guys either
		sign this piece of paper right now
		or we're gonna pull and head for
		another bank for the 75...

				COMMERCIAL BANKER
			(older man, appeasing)
		...look, we have 30 banks ready to
		participate in a 4 year revolving
		credit line but we have to have
		your assurance to pay back most of
		the loan in the first 6 months, and
		the only way...

				INVESTMENT BANKER
			(intermittently interrupting)
		... 30 banks, isn't that
		wonderful...you got it, no problem.

				COMMERCIAL BANKER
			(insistent)
		...and the only way we can see this
		happening is liquidating the
		hangars and the planes. Can you
		people guarantee that?

	Bud freezes where he sits...it all comes crashing down in a
	milli-second on that word "liquidate" -- shock now spreading
	on Bud's face...

				INVESTMENT BANKER
		Guaranteed! No sweat...we already
		got the Bleezburg brothers lined up
		to build condos where the hangars
		are, we can lay off the planes with
		Mexicana, who are dumb enough to
		buy 'em and Texas Air is drooling
		at my kneecaps to get the slots and
		the routes. What's the problem?
		it's done..

				ROGER
			(passing a paper to
			the commercial banker)
		This is the pricetag on the 737s,
		the gates, the hangars, the routes,
		we got it all nailed right down to
		the typewriters...

	Bud sits there numbly, a sickening feeling taking hold of
	him as the camera and music track and trap him tighter and
	tighter. The lawyers' voices distorting in the background.

				INVESTMENT BANKER
		...'course the beauty of it is the
		overfunded pension fund. Gekko gets
		the 75 million in there. Fifty
		million buys him the minimum
		annuities for 6,000 employees and
		he walks away with the rest. All
		in, he'll net 60 to 70 million. Not
		bad for a month's work.
			(to Bud)
		Your man did his homework, Fox,
		you're gonna have the shortest
		executive career since the Pope who
		got poisoned...now he'll really
		start believing he's "Gekko the
		Great."

	INT. RECEPTION AREA - GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud walks intently past the receptionist and down the long
	white marble hall.

	INT. NATALIE'S DESK - DAY

	Natalie is on the phone. Bud marches past her desk.

				NATALIE
		Yes, he wants to change that
		appointment to...
			(cupping the receiver)
		Bud--you can't go in there. He's in
		a meeting!

	He ignores her and throws open Gekko's door.

	INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Gekko is talking with the LAWYERS and BANKERS from the
	Bluestar deal, as Bud barges in.

				GEKKO
			(looks up)
		I didn't know we had a meeting
		schedule for this morning.

				BUD
		I'm sorry, this can't wait.

	Gekko stares at him with piercing eyes.

				GEKKO
		Will you gentlemen excuse us for a
		few minutes?

	The lawyers and bankers get up and discreetly leave the room.
	Gekko waits for them to go, turns back to Bud.

				GEKKO
		What the hell do you want?

				BUD
		I found out about the garage sale
		down at Bluestar. Why?

	Gekko is taken by surprise.

				GEKKO
		Last night I read Rudy the story of
		Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot.
		Know what happened: he stuck his
		nose in that honey pot once too
		often and got stung.

				BUD
		Maybe you ought to read him
		Pinocchio. You told me you were
		going to turn Bluestar around. Not
		upside down. You used me.

				GEKKO
		You're walking around blind without
		a cane, sport. A fool and his money
		are lucky to get together in the
		first place.

				BUD
		Why do you need to wreck this company?

				GEKKO
		Because it's wreckable. I took
		another look and I changed my mind.

				BUD
		If these people lose their jobs,
		nowhere to go. My father worked at
		Bluestar for twenty-four years. I
		gave 'em my word.

				GEKKO
			(hard)
		It's all about bucks, kid, the rest
		is conversation...
			(loosening)
		Bud, you're still going to be
		president. And when the time comes,
		you'll parachute out a rich man.
		With the money you're going to
		make, your father won't have to
		work another day in his life.

				BUD
		Tell me, Gordon--when does it all
		end? How many yachts can you
		waterski behind? How much is enough?

				GEKKO
		Buddy, it's not a question of
		enough. It's a zero sum game, sport.
		Somebody wins and somebody loses.
		Money itself isn't lost or made,
		it's simply transferred from one
		perception to another. Like magic.
		That painting cost $60,000 10 years
		ago. I could sell it today for
		$600,000. The illusion has become
		real. And the more real it becomes,
		the more desperately they want it.
		Capitalism at its finest.

				BUD
			(again)
		How much is enough Gordon?

				GEKKO
		The richest one percent of this
		country owns half the country's
		wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One
		third of that comes from hard work,
		two thirds of it comes from
		inheritance, interest on interest
		accumulation to widows and idiot
		sons and what I do -- stock and
		real estate speculation. It's
		bullshit. Ninety percent of the
		American people have little or no
		net worth. I create nothing; I own.
		We make the rules, Buddy, the news,
		war, peace, famine, upheaval; the
		cost of a paper clip.
			(picking one up)
		We pull the rabbit out of the hat
		while everybody else sits around
		their whole life wondering how we
		did it...
			(crosses to Bud)
		...you're not naive enough to think
		we're living in a democracy are
		you, Buddy? It's the free market.
		You're one of us now...take
		advantage of it. You got the killer
		instinct, kid, stick with me. I got
		things to teach you...

				BUD
		Obviously...

	As he puts his arm around Bud, leading him to the door.

				GEKKO
		Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna
		discuss this with you at the right
		time. Look, why don't you calm down
		and come to the apartment for
		dinner tonight. Bring Darien...

				BUD
			(at the door,
			confused, drained)
		...I can't make it tonight.

				GEKKO
		Are you with me Buddy?

	At the door, a look of unmistakable power...and danger.

				GEKKO
		I want you with me.
			(waits)


				BUD
		I'm with you Gordon...

	He walks out the door, the misery he is in washing his brow.

				GEKKO
			(to Natalie)
		...be another minute, Natalie.

	As he crosses back to the coffee table and punches up a
	phone number.

				GEKKO
		This is Gordon Gekko. Now...
			(a beat, with
			controlled rage)
		I want zip-locked mouths on
		Bluestar, or I'm gonna personally
		come down there and rip out your
		fucking throats!

	EXT. GEKKO OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

	Bud walks out, heading up the street, absent amid the
	scurrying mid-day hordes tearing up the street for the loot
	inside.

	EXT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

	Darien approaches, carrying groceries, enters the building.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

	Bud is slumped on the couch, a spent bottle of tequila in
	front of him. Outside the twilight is quickening into night,
	shadows, scurrying across the unlit room.... for the first
	time we see him sucking on a cigarette.

	Darien opens the door and freezes, surveying the living room.
	A broken vase on the carpet, a curtain ripped off a window,
	a painting upended, a chair overturned, selected but not
	frenzied damage...

				DARIEN
		Bud?...What's going on?

	She puts down the grocery bags, frightened.

				BUD
		I've been played like a grand-
		piano--by the master, Gekko the
		Great...and today was the big crash.
		Liquidation sale. He's gonna carve
		Bluestar into little pieces and
		sell it all off...

	Darien registering this, is picking up pieces of the broken
	vase.

				DARIEN
		I'm sorry. I was afraid something
		like this could happen.

				BUD
		Talk about being bent over the sink
		of life and being dry humped. I
		handed it to him on a silver
		platter. I told my father and those
		people...

				DARIEN
		Buddy, it's not your fault, and
		it's not your decision.

				BUD
			(evenly)
		I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.

	She stops, lights a cigarette, growing concern.

				DARIEN
		Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you.
		You've worked hard to get where you
		are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar
		someone else will; and who's to say
		they won't do the same thing.

				BUD
		At least I wouldn't be pulling the
		trigger.

	She sighs...comes over, tries to shake some sense into him!

				DARIEN
		Are you mad! Why are you doing this!
		We're so close, the town is going
		to be ours. Don't throw away your
		future Bud!

				BUD
		I can stay with the brokerage firm.
		And you're doing fine. We can
		survive without Gordon Gekko.

				DARIEN
			(pointed)
		I'm not looking to just survive.
		I've been doing that all my life.

				BUD
			(getting the drift)
		What the hell's that supposed to mean?

	Darien moves out from his approximate circle, wrestling with
	what she wants to say...until she turns and says it.

				DARIEN
		That if you make an enemy of Gordon
		Gekko, I won't be there to stand by
		you.

	Bud is stunned...and hurt.

				BUD
		You really mean that?
			(lashing out)
		What'd he promise you? To take you
		public? I guess without Gordon's
		money and seal of approval, I'm not
		such a hot investment anymore.
		You're just the best money can buy,
		Darien...

				DARIEN
		You're not exactly pure Bud, you
		went after Gekko with the same
		vengeance you went after me. Look
		in the mirror before...

				BUD
			(glaring at her)
		I'm looking...and I sure don't like
		what I see.

	She collects her things and walks to the door.

				DARIEN
		Fair enough...but it's not that
		simple, Bud. When I was down and
		had nothing, it was Gordon who
		helped me. He got me all my
		clients -- you among them...
			(snaps her fingers)
		and he can take it away like that.
			(a beat)
		You may find out one day -- that
		when you've had money and lost it,
		it's worse than never having had it
		at all.

	Bud steps across to her in a rage.

				BUD
		That's bullshit! Step out that
		door, I'm changing the locks.

	She opens the door saddened.

				DARIEN
		You may not believe this Bud but I
		really do care for you. I think we
		could've made a good team...but
		that's how it goes...

				BUD
		Get the hell out!

	She does. Bud stares at the closed door, mute, numb, totally
	devastated.... the loss is not just Darien, it is total...
	He looks at his face in the reflection of a wall mirror...

	INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - DAY

	Waiting for the elevator. Darien also looks at herself a
	beat in the hall mirror. She's crying. Then she steels
	herself and enters the elevator.

	INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

	The same realtor, SYLVIe DRIMMER, who sold him the place, is
	back. The phone is ringing, unanswered...

				SYLVIE
		...well, the market's dead, hon,
		even the rich are bitching,
		nothing's moving except termites
		and cockroaches, and with my
		commission being what it is...

				BUD
			(cutting her off)
		Save the rap, just sell it -- fast!

	He's in his socks, unshaven, smoking, he looks like he's
	been on a bender for the weekend. The phone stops ringing.
	He turns and walks into the bedroom, slamming the door
	behind him.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud walks in, a different, more serious look in his eye,
	purposeful. Past CAROLYN and JANET at the outer desk. They
	stop what they're doing and look up at him surprised.

				CAROLYN
		Bud! Where you been the last two days?

				BUD
			(ignoring the tone in
			her voice)
		...Janet get my father on the phone
		and the two other union reps,
		urgent...

	He notices her face, something's wrong.

				JANET
		Your mom just called, Mr. Fox. Your
		father... he...

				BUD
			(sensing it)
		What! What happened?!

				CAROLYN
		He had a heart attack, hon, but
		he's okay, he's at the hospital...

				BUD
			(runs out)
		Oh Christ!
	 
INT. BUD'S BMW - DAY

	Bud weaving fast through traffic.

	INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

	Bud races past the nurses' desks and down the hallway.

	EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	Bud's MOTHER is outside with Dominick Amato and another
	neighbor just visiting, bringing candies.

				BUD
			(lighting a cigarette)
		Mom! How is he?

				MOM
			(shaken)
		...he was complaining about chest
		pains at work. Next thing I know he
		collapsed... Oh Buddy, talk to him,
		he's so stubborn.

				AMATO
			(to Bud)
		...don't worry, he's got another 20
		years in him. He's a tough ol' nut,
		your Dad...

	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	The blinds are drawn. His Dad lies there, tubes down his
	nose, hooked up to an IV unit and monitors. Bud comes over.
	Carl, glassy-eyed, significantly frailer, nods to him. It's
	obvious that more damage was done than Bud expected. Mom
	comes into the room with him, stands there.

				BUD
		Hiya Dad...
			(sits, smiles)
		What was it? Mom talked too much or
		was it her spaghetti? I mean
		pasta...
			(Mom bringing a
			handkerchief to her eyes)
		I told you never to lift a 747 by
		yourself...

	Carl, smiles weakly, on pain killers. Bud pulls out a
	cigarette. He fumbles with it before putting it away, trying
	to keep a gruff tone between them.

				BUD
		...you even got me smoking
		now...second one Dad, you're
		pushing your luck, I guess you know
		that...I guess you gotta pull
		through this one Dad...for mom, for
		me...I guess I never told you
		but...I love you Dad, I love you
		more than I ever.
			(begins to weep)
		...I didn't mean those things I
		said to you...you're a hero all the
		way Dad, you're a rock...the best.

	The words seem to come flowing out of Bud as Carl's eyes
	fill with tears.

				BUD
		...and you were right about Gekko.
		He's one son of a bitch...through
		and through.

	Carl stares at him, beginning to understand.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		He's gonna break up Bluestar.

	Carl reacts violently in his eyes but Bud soothes him...in
	dead earnest, trying to be deliberate and clear in his meaning.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		...but I gotta plan Dad, it can
		work, I can save the airline, I
		know you got no reason to believe
		me but I want you to trust me...I
		need to talk to the unions...Can I
		speak for you?

	Carl's eyes.

				BUD (CONT'D)
		Your words, not mine...

				CARL
			(weakly)
		You speak for me, son.

	INT. AUCTION ROOM - DAY

	Gekko and Darien are seated together in the back row. Darien
	looks serious and distracted in spite of all the excitement
	going on around her. It is the big spring Impressionist sale
	and all the major players, or their representatives are here.
	Gekko is bidding.

				GEKKO
		Look over there sunshine. I'm up
		against Richard Feigen.

	He is on a roll, electric. As the price mounts and surpasses
	the two million dollar mark, Gekko rises and walks down the
	side aisle to the front, never taking his eyes away from the
	auctioneer. He stands agressively, arms akimbo, in a nose to
	nose confrontation.

				AUCTIONEER
		Once, twice, three times. Sold to
		Mr. Gordon Gekko.

	EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF AUCTION HOUSE - DAY

	They walk the sunny streets, a jubilant Gekko, savoring his
	triumph, grabs Darien's arm.

				GEKKO
		What do you say we go get a suite
		at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne?
		Celebrate, just like the old times
		Sunshine.

				DARIEN
			(indignantly)
		Those days are over, Gordon. They
		were over a long time ago.

				GEKKO
			(condescendingly but
			paying little
			attention to the rebuff)
		Can't blame me for trying. You look
		as beautiful as that painting I
		just bought.

	He pats her on the back in a preprietary fashion.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
			(mockingly)
		So what's the problem Sunshine? You
		look like Black Thursday. Bad case
		of puppy love?

				DARIEN
			(indignant)
		It's not puppy love, Gordon.
		Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.

				GEKKO
			(off handed)
		Sorry to hear that. I thought the
		kid had staying power.

				DARIEN
		It's over you, Gordon.

				GEKKO
			(cooly)
		You told him about us?

				DARIEN
		No, are you crazy? And I don't want
		him ever to know. Do you
		understand?...

	She moves closed and takes Gordon's hand.

				DARIEN (CONT'D)
		I want to ask you a big favor,
		Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.

				GEKKO
			(stroking her face)
		Now tell me, why would I want to do
		that?

				DARIEN
		Because I don't want to see him hurt.

				GEKKO
		Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had
		a little talk. We came to an
		understanding.
			(takes her hand paternally)
		I want you to go back to him.
		Soothe him. Help keep his head
		straight. Okay?

				DARIEN
		I can't...and I won't.

				GEKKO
		Come on, we both like Buddy. But
		this bleeding heart puppy love act
		is over the top... It doesn't fit.

				DARIEN
		Maybe it does. Don't patronize me
		Gordon.

				GEKKO
		You and I are the same, Darien.
		We're smart enough not to buy into
		the oldest myth running: love... A
		fiction created by people who got
		nothing to keep them from jumping
		out of windows.

				DARIEN
		You're really twisted, Gordon.
		You're incapable of giving to
		anybody because deep down inside
		you there's a poverty that every
		last dollar in the world won't fill.

				GEKKO
		Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared
		little girl all wrapped in a pretty
		grown-up package. Does this mean
		you're ready to cut the umbilical
		cord and step out into the world on
		your own? Because, Darien, if
		you're through with me, you're
		through with everything I'm a part of.

	Darien's eyes cloud over...the look of a scared child being
	banished by her father. Then...

				DARIEN
		I know...but maybe, just maybe
		Gordon, I'm good enough so I don't
		need you anymore.

	She walks away.

	INT. MCGREGOR'S BAR - QUEENS - DAY

	Bud is seated at a corner table with the BLUESTAR UNION
	REPS: Duncan Wilmore, ALPA LEADER and Toni Carpenter, AFA
	rep; also jointed by machinists, Dominick Amato and Charley
	Dent, sitting in for his father's union.

				BUD
		...the stock's at 19 1/4 and it's
		going up. Gekko figures by breaking
		up Bluestar, it's worth at least
		$30 a share. That means he'll buy
		up to 23 or 24 and still think he's
		making money.

				WILMORE
		How do you know that the stock is
		going to go up?

				BUD
			(pointedly)
		You really don't want to know any
		more than that, Mr. Wilmore. Let's
		just say I have some friends.

				WILMORE
			(getting his drift)
		Okay. What happens then?

				BUD
		When the stock hits 23, you guys go
		to Gekko and lower the boom. Once
		he learns he has no union
		concession, he's going to head for
		the hills. He'll sell everything
		he's got.

				CARPENTER
		Yeah. But who's going to buy then
		and what's to prevent another shark
		from coming along and devouring us?

	INT. WILDMAN BUILDING - FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY

	Bud, Duncan Wilmore, Toni Carpenter, Dominick and Charley,
	an unlikely looking group in the plushness of the apartment
	lobby.

				BUD
		We have an appointment to see Mr.
		Wildman.

	INT. WILDMAN APARTMENT - DAY

	Lofty windows overlooking the Park, an impeccably-decorated
	apartment with coffee and rolls laid out, a young AIDE
	quietly moving around. Bud and the others are on sofas
	around the imposing figure of Wildman in a chair across.

				BUD
		Sir Lawrence, what would you say to
		owning Bluestar Airlines with union
		concessions--at $18 a share...and
		in the process hanging Gordon Gekko
		out in the wind to twist.... ?

	Sir Lawrence leans back in his chair, equably...

				WILDMAN
		I might be very interested, but why?
		Why you mate -- how'd you get mixed
		up with Gekko? He doesn't know the
		difference between raiding and
		insider trading. I do. The SEC does.
		I hope you do...

				BUD
		Let's just say Mr. Gekko and I have
		a conflict of interest. I want to
		see this airline work...
			(pointing to the
			documents in front of Wildman)
		...the figures here show it can.

				WILDMAN
			(to the others)
		... and you're prepared to take
		these large salary cuts.

				WILMORE
		...we are. But we want a contract
		agreement -- iron-clad -- that if
		you buy it, you can't break it up.

				WILDMAN
			(hands behind his head)
		I'm still listening...

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud hurries in, past Marv on the phone with an irate customer.

				MARV
		Well, if that's how you feel--the
		hell with you too. And strong
		letter to follow.

	He slams the phone down.

				BUD
		You don't have to agree with me,
		Marv; but I think I've been a bit
		of a schmuck lately.
			(beat, waits)


				MARV
			(off the cuff)
		I agree. Go thou and sin no more.

				BUD
		I want to make it up to you.
		Bluestar, put all your clients in it.

				MARV
			(animated, grabs the phone)
		Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back.
		Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do
		work wonders.

	Bud intersecting Lou Mannheim smoking a cigarette and having
	a hard time walking.

				BUD
		Bluestar, Mr. Mannheim. Put all
		your clients in it.

	Davls looks gravely at Bud.

				MANNHEIM
		I don't know where you get your

	Immediately goes back to the other line.

	INT. NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

	A RUNNER dashes up to the BLUESTAR AIRLINES post, where a
	heated crowd is gathered, amidst heavy trading. He elbows

	holds up the buy order, screaming, making frantic hand
	signals, in search of a seller. Faces in the crowd look up
	at the broad tape.

	All the BROKERS have jumped into the action, avidly watching

				MARV
		The stock's going to Pluto!

				BUD
		Start unloading.

				MARV
		Sell?

		What the hell do they want?

				WILMORE (O.S.)
		I'd be happy to tell you.

	As Duncan, Toni Carpenter, Dominick Amato, Charley Dent and
	SEVERAL other assorted UNION MEMBERS march into the room.
	Gekko is taken by surprise, but stays calm.

				WILMORE
		We know what you're up to, Gekko,
		and let me tell you this from here,
			(hits his heart)
		you suck eggs, mister, over my dead
		body you ain't gonna break up
		Bluestar.

				GEKKO
		You guys must know something nobody
		else knows. If those are my plans,
		it's the first I've heard of it.

				CARPENTER
		Would you care to put that in writing?

				GEKKO
		I'd like to remind you we already
		have an agreement, which I expect
		you to honor.

				WILMORE
		Well in that case, I hope you have
		your pilot's license.

				AMATO
		Don't worry, Gekko, we wouldn't let
		the engines fall out of the plane.

				CARPENTER
			(regretfully)
		But the reservations systems can
		get awfully screwed up, if we're
		not paying attention.
	 
			CHARLEY DENT
		And a lot of baggage headed to St.
		Petersburg could easily find its
		way to Pittsburgh.

				GEKKO
		Listen, you clowns, there's
		somebody else out there trying to
		buy your airline, if you want to be
		Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla
		the Hun be my guest!

				WILMORE
		We'll take our chances.
			(tips his hat)
		Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.

	They file out of the room. The phone lines have lit up like
	a Christmas tree. Alex answers a call.

				ALEX
			(to Gekko)
		Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What
		do you want him to do?

				GEKKO
			(fractional pause, mad)
		Sell it all.
			(then, evenly)
		What the hell, so I'll only make
		ten million.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud switches lines from Gekko to Larry Wildman.

				BUD
		Gekko's on the ropes--he's trying
		to sell, but there's not many
		takers, the stock's plummeting.

	EXT. WILDMAN'S YACHT - DAY

	Wildman is off the Long Island Sound waters in his boat
	lighting a cigar. Two beautiful women and an aide are with him.

				WILDMAN
		Well then... guess I'll have to
		carry him a few rounds before he
		drops.

	Switches lines, checking his quotron...

				WILDMAN
		Bluestar. Don't make a big deal.
		Buy it lightly on the way down.
			(emphatically)
		When it hits 18--buy it all.

	INT. NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR - DAY

	Wildman's broker takes the order with a curt "got it" and
	dashes out of the cubicle over to the Bluestar post where a
	chaotic crowd is gathered, traders frantically screaming to
	sell Bluestar shares. He looks at the Big Board--sees an XTR
	drop to 17. When he raises his hand to buy, he is mobbed.

						DISSOLVE TO:

	The Big Board...a series of snappy dissolves accompanied by
	lively music shows the stock price falling to 16 1/2 ...

	INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

	Alex, Ollie, Susan on the phones.

				OLLIE
		The arbs are getting killed.
		Where'd the buyers go!

				ALEX
			(worried)
		We're being devoured, Gordon.

	Harold Salt, walking on egg shells, looks to Gekko, who sits
	with the phone receiver crooked to his neck.

				HAROLD
		There's got to be a way out of
		this, Gordon.

				GEKKO
			(livid, losing it)
		Yeah, Harold, why don't you dial
		911.
			(into the receiver)
		Fox, where the hell are you? I'm
		losing millions.
			(a beat)
		Look, you got me into this airline,
		and you damn well better get me out.
		Because if you don't the only job
		you're going to get on the Street
		is sweeping it! You hear me, Fox--

						INTERCUT TO:
	 
INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	Bud scribbling an order ticket, replies on the other end.

				BUD
			(hard)
		You once told me don't get
		emotional about stock. Gordon,
		don't. The bid is 17 and going down.
		As your broker, I advise you to
		take it.

	Bud moves the phone away from his ear, at Gekko's cursing,
	and signs the ticket.

				BUD
			(urgent)
		Gordon, it's two minutes to close.
		What do you want to do?! Decide.

				GEKKO
			(a long beat)
		Dump it.

	Bud hangs up and rushes off with the ticket.

	INT. GEKKO'S DEN - NEW YORK APARTMENT - TWILIGHT

	The 35" television is on to:

				NEWSCASTER
		The big Wall Street story tonight
		is the  roller coaster ride of
		Bluestar Airlines. Fueled by
		takeover rumors, the stock soared
		to an all-time high of 24 1/8. Then
		when contradictory rumors later
		surfaced that the takeover was
		unfounded, buyers went running for
		cover, and the stock plummeted on
		gigantic volume to as low as 16 1/2
		before closing at 17.

	Camera discovers Gekko sitting, grimly watching the report.
	Rudy seen riding his toy car in background.

				NEWSCASTER
		...but then tonight, amidst all the
		scuttlebutt, another rumble shook
			(a beat)
		According to many sources, raider
		Sir Lawrence Wildman has stepped in
		and bought a substantial block of
		Bluestar and is going to announce a
		deal tomorrow at 18 that includes
		the support of the unions.

	Camera now tracks in close on Gekko as he absorbs the
	unexpected blow. O.S. Rudy yelling and squealing. Gekko
	leans back, putting the pieces together, his eyes narrowing
	into burning slits. He smashes the glass cocktail table with
	a massive paperweight as Kate hears it, shocked.

	EXT. WALL STREET - MORNING

	People rushing to work. Bud crosses the street, his face
	buried in The Financial Times. Insert: "SIR LAWRENCE WILDMAN
	MOUNTS BLUESTAR BUY WITH UNION SUPPORT".

	Satisfied, Bud folds the paper and heads into his office
	building.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	He walks past Carolyn the receptionist who is strangely mute...

				BUD
		Smile, Carolyn, there's justice in
		the world...

	INT. MAIN OFFICE - DAY

	He passes the CHINESE STOCKLADY. She sees him and manages to
	look away. Marvin exchanges a look with him but can't bring
	himself to talk. Bud wonders...the whole office seems
	silent, the other BROKERS stealing glances.

	...as he passes Lou Mannheim with Charlie Cushing, who
	ignores Bud...

				BUD
		How's it going Mr. Mannheim? Got
		out of Bluestar in time I hope?

	Mannheim stops, winds up. Bud impatient but polite.

				MANNHEIM
			(with gruff affection)
		Bud I like you, just remember
		something. Man looks in the abyss,
		there's nothing staring back at him.
		At that time a man finds his
		character--and that is what keeps
		him out of the abyss...
			(a beat, looks deeply)


				BUD
		I think I understand what you mean
		Mr. Mannheim.

	But not really. As, on this increasingly strange morning, he
	moves on past Janet who wants to tell his something but he
	cuts her off.

				BUD
		Get my father will you Janet?

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	As Bud walks in, the camera glides to reveal the young SEC
	INVESTIGATOR, who has been tracking Buddy, going through his
	files. A SECOND MAN, PATTERSON, is standing behind the desk
	using the phone as a bored-looking 3RD MAN and POLICEMAN
	stand off to the side with Hieronymus Lynch, who gives Bud a
	withering glance.

				PATTERSON
			(into phone)
		He just came in. I'll talk to you
		later.

	On Bud--a struck-dumb look passing to resignation, as if for
	a long time now, he has been expecting this.

				BUD
		I guess you're not here to open an
		IRA.

				PATTERSON
		Mr Fox, I'm Henry Patterson from
		the Postal Inspection Service...
		this is Evan Morrissey with The
		Securities and Exchange
		Investigation Office.
			(presents his ID and
			indicates MAN 3)
		... Mr. Ebanhopper from the US
		Attorney's Office.

				MORRISSEY
		Mr. Fox, you're under arrest for
		conspiracy to commit securities
		fraud and for violating the Insider
		Trader's Sanction Act.

	The handcuffs come out.

	EXT. SHEEPSMEADOW - CENTRAL PARK - TWILIGHT

	Long shot. Activity is winding down, a few sunbathers
	collecting their blankets. A solitary figure stands on a
	hill silhouetted by the sunset. A second figure appears on a
	footpath and starts climbing the hill towards the other man.

	Gekko waits, expressionless... Bud approaches him. They
	stand facing each other.

				GEKKO
		Hello Bud.

				BUD
		Gordon.

				GEKKO
		You sandbagged me on Bluestar.
			(smiles)
		I guess you think you taught the
		teacher a lesson, that you can make
		the tail wag the dog, huh?

	Bud looks away. Gekko's smile fades.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
		Well let me cue you in: the ice is
		melting under your feet sport...

	Without warning, he grabs Buddy roughly by the lapels and
	lets out his inner rage with a series of smacks and slaps
	across his face.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
		You think you could've gotten this
		far this fast with anybody else?
		You think you could be out there
		dicking somebody like Darien? No,
		you'd be cold calling dentists and
		widows to buy twenty shares of some
		dog stock! I took you in! A nobody!
		I opened doors for you!...I showed
		you how the system works!...

	Gekko slapping him harder and harder, Buddy staggering with
	the blows, saying nothing, not defending himself.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
		...the value of information! How
		you get it! Anacott Steel, Brant
		Resources, Transuniversal, Fulham
		Oil. And this is how you pay back,
		you cockroach! I gave you Darien, I
		gave you your manhood. I gave you
		everything.

	He backhands Bud across the face. Bud lies on the ground,
	spent, as is Gordon breathing hard. Bud gets to his knees,
	blood streaming from his nose, his suit muddied. Passersby
	look on, wondering.

	Gekko seems to relent, the rage going into hurt, remorse. He
	hands Bud a handkerchief. Bud staunches the flow of blood
	from his nose.

				GEKKO (CONT'D)
			(softly, innocently)
		You could've been one of the great
		ones Bud...I look at you and see
		myself...Why?

	Bud looks at Gordon, torn by mixed emotions: the bonds they
	share and the betrayal wrought.

				BUD
			(shakes his head, thoughtfully)
		I don't know. My Dad once told me,
		"money is something you need in
		case you don't die tomortow." I
		guess I realized I'm just Bud Fox.
		And as much as I wanted to be
		Gordon Gekko--I'll always be Bud Fox.

	He looks at Gordon, as if wanting to say more, but doesn't.

	In long shot, Gordon stands alone as Bud walks away.

	EXT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN RESTAURANT - EVENING

	The DOORMAN looks askance. Bud, mud-splattered suit and
	bloody nose, walks straight past him thru the door.

	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Several well-heeled DINERS look up from their haute cuisine,
	at the sight of Bud making his way toward the men's room.

	INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Tight on Bud, staring at his reflection in the mirror, as he
	unbuttons his shirt, revealing adhesive tape swathed across
	his chest. Camera paces back as he winces when...

	MORRISSEY and AGOSTINI, the two investigators, rip the tape
	off his chest, retrieving a small tape recorder. Morrissey
	of the S.E.C. rewinds the cassette. We hear Gekko's voice
	being played back on the tape, the mention of their deals.

				MORRISSEY
		You did the right thing, Bud.

	Bud looks searchingly in the mirror. Faint CLICKING NOISE
	comes up over the shot.

	INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

	CLICKING of the Broad Tape grows LOUDER. Shots of Lou
	Mannheim, Lynch, Marv; silently looking up at the green
	fluorescent print-out.

	THE TAPE--THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TODAY ANNOUNCED
	CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST CORPORATE RAIDER GORDON GEKKO AND
	STOCK BROKER BUD FOX, FOR CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT SECURITIES
	FRAUD, TAX EVASION, VIOLATIONS OF SECURITY ACTS, AND MAIL
	FRAUD...

						DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CARL FOX'S HOUSE - QUEENS - DAY

	Carl, dressed in a suit and tie, sits at the dining table,
	finished breakfast plates in front of him, refilling his
	coffee cup. Mom clearing off the table, anxious...

	As Bud walks in, wearing a suit and tie. He looks tired,
	beaten, the eyes lifeless, in a dark mood.

				MOM
			(disapproving)
		...don't wear that tie Buddy, it...

	She cuts off on Bud's look.

				CARL
		Another cup of coffee?

				BUD
		No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.

				CARL
			(checks his watch)
		I guess it's time to hit the road.

				BUD
		Yeah, don't want to be late for my
		own funeral.

	INT. CARL FOX'S SEDAN - LOWER MANHATTAN - DAY

	Driving towards the Federal Courtrooms in Lower Manhattan.
	Busy traffic all around.

				CARL
			(supportively)
		...you told the truth, you gave the
		money back. All things considered--
		in this cockamamie world--you're
		shooting par...

				MOM
		...you helped save the airline and
		the people at the airline are gonna
		remember you for it.

				CARL
		...if I was you, I'd think about
		that Bluestar job Wildman's offered
		you...

				BUD
		Dad, I'm going to jail and you know
		it.

				CARL
			(shaking his head, sober)
		Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe
		so. It's gonna be rough on you but
		maybe in some screwed up way,
		that's the best thing that can
		happen to you...stop trading for
		the quick buck and go produce
		something with your life, create,
		don't live off the buying and
		selling of others...

				MOM
		...you can do it, Bud, once you set
		your mind to something, I believe
		you can do anything in the world...

	Bud stares ahead, registering it.

				CARL
			(nods, then)
		...got any friends gonna be there?

	As he pulls the car into the curb. The Federal Building, in
	approaching POV, looms large before them.

				BUD
			(looks around, ironic)
		Like who? Who really wants to know
		a convicted felon...I don't even
		like myself.

	Carl knows something Bud doesn't...

	Darien is standing there waiting as they approach the main
	entrance... Bud seeing her, suddenly stunned. His POV--
	easing along the curb.

				CARL
		So, why don't you get out here and
		go in with your friend, I'll park
		the car. Try to be cool, okay?

	A last look with his father.

	EXT. CURBSIDE - FEDERAL BUILDING - LOWER MANHATTAN - DAY

	Bud getting out...crossing to Darien. A pause.

				DARIEN
			(nervous)
		Hi.

				BUD
		Why?

				DARIEN
		I figure a guy who's made some
		mistakes should be able to
		understand a girl who's made some
		of her own...

	Bud looking at her, moves closer, longing and hope and
	happiness have returned to his dull eyes... and forgiveness,
	the greatest of all.

	They embrace. Bud will never know about her past, nor need
	he. The camera leaving them on a slanting, circular crane,
	lifting past the Federal Building to a panorama of Wall
	Street in all its icy magisterial splendor...and thus ends
	our tale.

				  THE END
