               FADE IN: INT. ANTEROOM CLOSE SHOT SWITCHBOARD

               Two telephone operators sit at switchboard busy plugging in 
               and out answering calls.

                                     1ST OPERATOR
                         This is the Morning Post... The City 
                         Room? Just a moment, I'll connect 
                         you.
                              (plugs in call)

                                     2ND OPERATOR
                         Morning Post... Sports Department? 
                         Just a moment --
                              (plugs in call)

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to disclose the rest of the anteroom. To 
               Camera left are the elevators -- at back wall directly behind 
               switchboard are chairs and a table for visitors. Next to 
               switchboard are stairs leading downward to the next floor. A 
               waist-high iron grill with a gate in it separates the 
               switchboard from the anteroom, a similar grill separating it 
               again from the city room which stretches on beyond 
               switchboard. At a table in the switchboard enclosure sits an 
               office boy, about fifteen, doing a crossword puzzle. The big 
               clock on the back wall shows that it is nearly one o'clock.

               CLOSE SHOT OFFICE BOY

               as he bends over paper. We catch a glimpse of the squares of 
               a crossword puzzle.

               MED. SHOT

               as a reporter comes out of the City Room, clanging gate to 
               behind him. The office boy looks up.

                                     OFFICE BOY
                         What's a seven-letter word for --?

                                     REPORTER
                         Don't ask me! If I knew any seven-
                         letter words, I'd be something better 
                         than a reporter!

               He catches a glimpse of the far elevator going down.

                                     REPORTER
                         Hey! Down! Down!

               MED. SHOT ELEVATORS

               as reporter runs in to the closed elevator door and pounds 
               on it. It comes back, the door opens, and he gets in. The 
               door closes, as elevator goes down. The near elevator comes 
               up and discharges Hildy Johnson and Bruce Baldwin. Bruce 
               carries an umbrella and wears a raincoat.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT TABLE

               office boy looking over his puzzle as Hildy and Bruce come 
               into the scene.

                                     HILDY
                              (with a smile)
                         Hello, Skinny. Remember me?

                                     OFFICE BOY
                              (looks up; then a 
                              glowing smile)
                         Hildy Johnson!

               CLOSE SHOT SWITCHBOARD

               Hildy approaches the switchboard.

                                     HILDY
                              (to operator)
                         Hello, Maisie.

               The first operator looks up.

                                     MAISIE
                         Hello -- Hildy! You coming back?

                                     HILDY
                         No, just visiting. Tell me, is the 
                         lord of the universe in today?

                                     MAISIE
                         He is -- and in a very bad humor. I 
                         think somebody stole one of his crown 
                         jewels. Shall I announce you?

                                     HILDY
                         No, never mind -- I'll blow my own 
                         trumpet.

               THREE SHOT BRUCE, HILDY AND OPERATOR

               Hildy turns to Bruce.

                                     HILDY
                         I won't be more than ten minutes, I 
                         promise you.

                                     BRUCE
                         Even ten minutes is a long time to 
                         be away from you.

               We hear a giggle off scene.

               CLOSE SHOT OFFICE BOY

               He looks towards Bruce and Hildy and giggles.

               TWO SHOT BRUCE AND HILDY

                                     HILDY
                         What did you say, Bruce?

               Bruce, embarrassed, looks at the office boy, then looks back 
               at Hildy as they turn toward second gate leading into City 
               Room.

                                     BRUCE
                         I said -- uh -- I said even ten 
                         minutes -- is a long time -- to be 
                         away from you.

                                     HILDY
                         Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard 
                         it, but I just wanted to hear it 
                         again. I can stand being spoiled a 
                         little. The gentleman I'm going to 
                         have a chat with did very little 
                         spoiling.

                                     BRUCE
                              (grimly)
                         I'd like to spoil him just once. 
                         Sure you don't want me to go in with 
                         you?

                                     HILDY
                         My job, Bruce. I started it -- and 
                         I'll finish it.

                                     BRUCE
                         I suppose you're right -- but if it 
                         gets rough, remember I'm here.

                                     HILDY
                         I'll come a-running, pardner.

               She starts to push open the iron-grilled gate leading into 
               the City Room. Bruce quickly springs forward and opens it 
               for her. Hildy smiles.

                                     HILDY
                         Thanks, Bruce.

               She kisses his cheek and walks through. He looks after her. 
               The office boy whistles. Bruce pays no attention, but stares 
               after Hildy.

               MEDIUM SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN LENGTH OF CITY ROOM

               Hildy starts to walk through City Room.

               TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY

               as she walks the length of the City Room. It's a long walk, 
               because it's a room that takes up practically the whole floor. 
               The scene is a busy one. But, gradually, as Hildy starts 
               down, one after another recognize her. There are cries of: 
               "Hildy!" "Hello, Hildy", etc., from the men as Hildy goes 
               straight down the aisle. She never stops but waves her own 
               greetings: "Jim!" "Hi, good-looking!" "Laura" "Hullo, Pop" 
               "Nan!" "Eddie!" "Hello, Mac" "Pete!" "Frank" "Oscar!", and 
               gets responses from each of them. One man is bent over his 
               desk reading his copy -- he is standing up. Hildy slaps him 
               as she goes by. He turns around: "Say, who did that?" As he 
               sees Hildy: "Hello, Hildy!" Hildy: "Hi, Jake." She passes a 
               middle-aged woman, almost an Edna May Oliver type, seated at 
               a desk pounding out copy and smoking a cigarette. As Hildy 
               comes up to her she slaps the woman on the back.

                                     HILDY
                         Hello, Beatrice. How's "Advice to 
                         the Lovelorn"?

                                     BEATRICE
                              (looking up)
                         Hildy! I'll be a monkey's uncle! 
                         What are you doing here?

                                     HILDY
                         Point of information -- what does a 
                         girl say on meeting her divorced 
                         husband? OR:
                              (What does a girl do, 
                              etc.)

                                     BEATRICE
                              (illustrating)
                         My advice is duck and cross with 
                         your right.

               Hildy moves on. CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HER to the end of the 
               room where she pauses before the frosted glass partition 
               which separates Walter Burns' office from the rest of the 
               City Room.

               INT. BURNS' OFFICE LONG SHOT

               as she opens the door. Burns is shaving with an electric 
               razor and Louie is holding the mirror up in front of him.

               shaving, Louie holding the mirror.

                         A little more round the chin, Boss.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               There is a sound of the door closing and Burns, without 
               looking up, says:

                                     BURNS
                         What do you want?

                                     HILDY
                         Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's 
                         no way to talk to your wife -- even 
                         if she's no longer your wife.

                                     BURNS
                              (grinning)
                         Hello, Hildy!

                                     HILDY
                         Hello, Walter.
                              (to Louie)
                         Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine 
                         king?

                                     LOUIE
                         Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm 
                         retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- 
                         a newspaper man.

                                     HILDY
                         Editorials?

                                     BURNS
                         Get going, Louie. I got company.

               The door flies open and Duffy comes busting in.

                                     DUFFY
                         Walter!

                                     BURNS
                         I'm busy, Duffy.

                                     DUFFY
                         Well, you're not too busy to know 
                         that the Governor hasn't signed that 
                         reprieve!

                                     BURNS
                         What?

                                     DUFFY
                         And that means Earl Williams dies 
                         tomorrow morning and makes a sucker 
                         out of us!

                                     BURNS
                         You're crazy. Where's Mac?

                                     DUFFY
                         He's on my phone. He just called me.

                                     BURNS
                         They can't do that to me!

               He grabs the phone on his desk:

                                     BURNS
                         Give me that call on Duffy's wire! 
                         Hello -- Mac? Burns. Where's the 
                         Governor? -- What do you mean, you 
                         can't locate him?
                              (apparently pleading 
                              to the one man in 
                              the world who can 
                              help him)
                         Mac, you know what this means. We're 
                         the only paper in town defending 
                         Earl Williams and if he hangs tomorrow 
                         we're washed up! Find the Governor 
                         and when you find him tell him we 
                         want that reprieve!... Tell him I 
                         elected him and I can have him 
                         impeached! Sure, you can do it, Mac -- 
                         I know you can. I always said you 
                         were the greatest reporter in the 
                         country and now you can prove it. 
                         Get going! Attaboy!

                         First I gotta tell him what news to 
                         get! Gotta tell him how to get it -- 
                         then I gotta write it for him 
                         afterward! Now if you were a decent 
                         City Editor --

                         Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in 
                         name only. You do all the hiring 
                         around here.

                                     BURNS
                         Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. 
                         Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a 
                         civil tongue in your head.

                         I don't like to interfere with 
                         business, but would you boys pardon 
                         us while we have a little heart-to-
                         heart talk?

                         Well -- But I gotta --

               They look at Burns.

                                     BURNS
                         Scram, you guys.

               They start to go.

                                     HILDY
                         You won't miss anything. You'll 
                         probably be able to hear him just as 
                         well outside as here.

               They go.

                                     HILDY
                         Mind if I sit down?

               Hildy sits.

               going out of the door. They cast an interested look back and 
               linger a second. Over scene comes Burns' voice.

                                     BURNS' VOICE
                         I said scram!

               They close the door hurriedly.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY

                                     HILDY
                         May I have a cigarette, please?

               Burns reaches into his pocket, extracts a cigarette and tosses 
               it on the desk. Hildy reaches for it.

                                     HILDY
                         Thanks. A match?

               Burns delves into pockets again, comes up with matchbox, 
               tosses it to Hildy, who catches it deftly, and strikes the 
               match.

                                     BURNS
                         How long is it?

               Hildy finishes lighting her cigarette, takes a puff, and 
               fans out the match.

                                     HILDY
                         How long is what?

                                     BURNS
                         You know what. How long since we've 
                         seen each other?

                                     HILDY
                         Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- 
                         then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, 
                         I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.

                         Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing 
                         me in your dreams?

                              (casually)
                         No -- Mama doesn't dream about you 
                         any more, Walter. You wouldn't know 
                         the old girl now.

                                     BURNS
                              (with conviction)
                         Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any 
                         time --

               He grows lyrical and, rising from his seat, is about to start 
               toward her, as he continues:

               He sits.

                                     HILDY
                              (half-pityingly)
                         You're repeating yourself! That's 
                         the speech you made the night you 
                         proposed.

                                     BURNS
                              (growling)
                         I notice you still remember it.

                                     HILDY
                         I'll always remember it. If I hadn't 
                         remembered it, I wouldn't have 
                         divorced you.

                                     BURNS
                         You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you 
                         hadn't done it.

                                     HILDY
                         Done what?

                                     BURNS
                         Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow 
                         lose faith in himself. It almost 
                         gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.

                                     HILDY
                         Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's 
                         what divorces are for.

                                     BURNS
                         Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned 
                         idea that divorces are something 
                         that last forever -- till 'death us 
                         do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't 
                         mean anything today. It's only a few 
                         words mumbled over you by a judge. 
                         We've got something between us nothing 
                         can change.

                                     HILDY
                         I suppose that's true in a way. I am 
                         fond of you, Walter. I often wish 
                         you weren't such a stinker.

                                     BURNS
                         Now, that's a nice thing to say.

                                     HILDY
                         Well, why did you promise me you 
                         wouldn't fight the divorce and then 
                         try and gum up the whole works?

                                     BURNS
                         Well, I meant to let you go -- but, 
                         you know, you never miss the water 
                         till the well runs dry.

                         to write:

                         my dimple. Walter.! It held things 
                         up twenty minutes while the Judge 
                         ran out to watch it.

                         still got the dimple -- and in the 
                         same place -- I just acted like any 
                         husband who doesn't want to see his 
                         home broken up.

                         What home?

                                     WALTER
                         What home? Don't you remember the 
                         home I promised you?

                                     HILDY
                         Oh, yes -- we were to have it right 
                         after our honeymoon -- honeymoon!

                                     BURNS
                         Was it my fault? Did I know that 
                         coal mine was going to have another 
                         cave-in? I meant to be with you on 
                         our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I 
                         did.

                                     HILDY
                         All I know is that instead of two 
                         weeks in Atlantic City with my 
                         bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a 
                         coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age 
                         sixty-three -- getting food and air 
                         out of a tube! You don't deny that. 
                         Do you?

                                     BURNS
                         Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat 
                         the whole country on that story.

                                     HILDY
                         Well, suppose we did? That isn't 
                         what I got married for. What's the 
                         good of -- Look, Walter, I came up 
                         here to tell you that you'll have to 
                         stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- 
                         sending twenty telegrams -- all the 
                         rest of it, because I'm --

                         Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you 
                         what. You come back to work on the 
                         paper and if we find we can't get 
                         along in a friendly way, we'll get 
                         married again.

                         I haven't any hard feelings.

                         Walter, you're wonderful in a 
                         loathesome sort of way. Now, would 
                         you mind keeping quiet long enough 
                         for me to tell you what I came up 
                         here for?

                         Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch 
                         and you can tell me everything.

                         No, I can't.

                         not my husband and you're not my

                                     HILDY
                         That's the first time you've been 
                         right today. That's what I --

                              (still interrupting)
                         You've had a better offer, eh?

                                     HILDY
                         You bet I've got a better offer.

                                     BURNS
                         Well, go on and take it. Work for 
                         somebody else! That's the gratitude 
                         I get for --

                         I know, Walter, but I --

                              (ignoring her)
                         What were you when you came here 
                         five years ago? A little college 
                         girl from a School of Journalism! I 
                         took a little doll-faced mugg --

                                     HILDY
                         You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't 
                         been doll-faced!

                                     BURNS
                         Why should I? I thought it would be 
                         a novelty to have a face around here 
                         a man could look at without 
                         shuddering.

                                     HILDY
                         Listen, Walter --

                                     BURNS
                              (going right on)
                         I made a great reporter out of you, 
                         Hildy, but you won't be half as good 
                         on any other paper, and you know it. 
                         You need me and I need you -- and 
                         the paper needs both of us.

                                     HILDY
                         Well, the paper'll have to learn to 
                         do without me. And so will you. It 
                         just didn't work out, Walter.

                         It would have worked if you'd been 
                         satisfied with just being editor and 
                         reporter. But no! You had to marry 
                         me and spoil everything.

                                     HILDY
                              (indignantly)
                         I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I 
                         proposed to you!

                                     BURNS
                         Well, you practically did! Making 
                         goo-goo eyes at me for two years 
                         till I broke down. And I still claim 
                         I was tight the night I proposed. If 
                         you'd been a gentleman you'd have 
                         forgotten all about it. But not you!

               She grabs something and chucks it at him. He ducks. The phone 
               rings.

                              (to Hildy)
                         You're losing your eye. You used to 
                         be able to pitch better than that.
                              (he reaches for phone)
                         Hello... Yeah... What? Sweeney? Well, 
                         what can I do for you?

                         What's the matter with you? Are you 
                         drunk? This is Duffy, not Sweeney!

               Burns into phone:

                         Sweeney! You can't do that to me! 
                         Not today, of all days! Jumping 
                         Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, 
                         I suppose so... All right. If you 
                         have to, you have to.
                              (he hangs up)
                         How do you like that? Everything 
                         happens to me -- with 365 days in 
                         the year -- this has to be the day.

                                     HILDY
                         What's the matter?

                         Not yet. Might just as well be. The 
                         only man on the paper who can write -- 
                         and his wife picks this morning to

                         Well, after all, he didn't do it on

                         I don't care whether he did or not. 
                         He's supposed to be covering the 
                         Earl Williams case and there he is -- 
                         waiting at the hospital! Is there no 
                         sense of honor left in this country?

                         There's nobody else on the paper who 
                         can write! This'll break me, unless --

                         It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- 
                         just the way we used to be.

                                     HILDY
                         That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- 
                         any place -- anywhere!"

                         Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger 
                         than anything that's happened to us. 
                         Don't do it for me! Do it for the 
                         paper.

                         Oh! In that case, the raise is off 
                         and you go back to your old salary 
                         and like it. Trying to blackjack --

                         I tried to tell you right away but

                         Get married all you want to, Hildy, 
                         but you can't quit the newspaper

                         It's a good, honest business, isn't 
                         it?

               ANOTHER ANGLE

                                     BURNS
                         Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I 
                         can't picture you with a guy who 
                         sells policies.

                                     HILDY
                         Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets 
                         the office when he's with me. He 
                         doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- 
                         he treats me like a woman.

                                     BURNS
                         He does, does he? How did I treat 
                         you -- like a water buffalo?

                                     HILDY
                         I don't know about water buffaloes, 
                         but I know about him. He's kind and 
                         sweet and considerate. He wants a 
                         home -- and children.

                                     BURNS
                         Say, sounds more like a guy I ought 
                         to marry. What's his name?

                                     HILDY
                         Well, I'll give you a hint. By 
                         tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. 
                         Bruce Baldwin.

                                     BURNS
                         Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as 
                         that?

                                     HILDY
                         The quicker the better. Well -- I 
                         finally got out what I came in to 
                         tell you.
                              (she extends her hand)
                         So long, Walter, and better luck 
                         next time.

                                     BURNS
                              (taking her hand)
                         I wish you everything I couldn't 
                         give you, Hildy.

                                     HILDY
                         Thanks...

                                     BURNS
                         Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. 
                         I'm pretty particular about whom my 
                         wife marries.

                                     HILDY
                              (laughing)
                         Well, he's waiting in the anteroom 
                         for me now.

                                     BURNS
                         Say, could I meet him?

                                     HILDY
                         Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do 
                         any good.

                                     BURNS
                         You're not afraid, are you?

                                     HILDY
                         Afraid? I should say not!

                                     BURNS
                         All right then, come on and let's 
                         see this paragon.
                              (gets hat)
                         Is he as good as you say?

                                     HILDY
                         Better.

               MED. SHOT OFFICE

               Burns has his hat. They start toward the door.

                                     BURNS
                         Then what does he want with you?

                                     HILDY
                              (laughing)
                         Now you got me.

                                     BURNS
                         Nothing personal. I was just asking.

               At the door, Burns walks ahead, opens door and walks out.

               INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BURNS' OFFICE MED. CLOSE SHOT BURNS

                                     BURNS
                         After all --

               He stops as he realizes she's not there. The door opens. 
               Hildy comes out.

                                     HILDY
                         You wouldn't believe this, Walter, 
                         but Bruce holds the door open for 
                         me.

                                     BURNS
                              (incredulous)
                         No kidding?

               INT. CITY ROOM FULL SHOT

               Reporters conversing. They stop as Hildy and Burns enter 
               scene.

               TRUCKING SHOT

               as Hildy follows Burns through the City Room. This time, in 
               contrast to Hildy's original walk through the room, the groups 
               are silent as they watch the two.

                                     HILDY
                              (trying to keep pace)
                         And he takes his hat off when he's 
                         with a lady.

                                     BURNS
                              (over his shoulder)
                         What for?

                                     HILDY
                              (shouting)
                         And when he walks with a lady, he 
                         waits for her!

                                     BURNS
                              (stops)
                         Oh, I'm sorry.

               Burns, at this point, has reached the switchboard. He says, 
               under his breath, to Maisie:

                                     BURNS
                              (under his breath)
                         Have Duffy call me in the restaurant 
                         in twenty minutes.

               Hildy, a little out of breath, catches up with him. At the 
               iron gate that opens into anteroom Hildy jumps ahead, opens 
               the gate and holds it for Burns.

                                     HILDY
                         Allow me.

                                     BURNS
                              (walking right through)
                         Thanks.

               Hildy follows him out.

               INT. ANTEROOM MED. SHOT

               as Hildy follows Burns in. Bruce is sitting on the bench. On 
               the end of a bench sits an old, grizzled Western Union "boy". 
               Ignoring Bruce, Burns strides over to the "boy", seizes his 
               hand, shakes it and says:

                                     BURNS
                         I can see right away my wife picked 
                         out the right husband for herself.

               CLOSE SHOT BRUCE

               Hildy behind him. Bruce registers amazement at this.

               CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND MESSENGER

               The messenger is more amazed than Bruce as Burns keeps pumping 
               his hand vigorously.

                                     MESSENGER
                         There must be some mistake. I'm 
                         already married.

                                     BURNS
                              (you never saw a more 
                              surprised man)
                         Already married!
                              (turning to Hildy 
                              o.s.)
                         Hildy, why didn't you tell me?

               CLOSEUP HILDY

               She shakes her head at Burns' antics, but can't help smiling 
               nevertheless.

               MEDIUM SHOT BURNS AND MESSENGER

                                     BURNS
                              (again seizing 
                              messenger's hand)
                         Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin!

                                     MESSENGER
                         But my name --

                                     BRUCE
                              (as he enters scene)
                         Mr. Burns!

               Burns turns slightly but doesn't release messenger's hand.

                                     BURNS
                         Yeah? You'll have to excuse me -- 
                         I'm busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin here. 
                         Just leave your card with the boy.

               CLOSE SHOT BRUCE AND BURNS

               Bruce takes hold of Burns' coat and shakes it to get his 
               attention. Burns turns on him:

                                     BURNS
                         I'm very sorry, but I'm busy! Look --
                              (he points o.s.)
                         -- there's the boy. Take your card 
                         and leave it with him.

               He turns away again. Bruce, determinedly, takes hold of his 
               sleeve and pulls at it.

                                     BRUCE
                         Mr. Burns --

                                     BURNS
                              (wheeling around)
                         I've just told you I was busy with 
                         Mr. Bruce Baldwin!

                                     BRUCE
                         I'm Bruce Baldwin!

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Burns, still pumping the dazed messenger's hand, stops at 
               this, drops hand, and turns to Bruce:

                                     BURNS
                         You're Bruce Baldwin?

                                     BRUCE
                         Yes!

                                     BURNS
                              (accusing to messenger)
                         Then who are you?

                                     MESSENGER
                              (falteringly)
                         My name's Pete Davis.

                                     BURNS
                         Pete Davis! Well, Mr. Davis, this is 
                         no concern of yours and after this 
                         I'll thank you to keep out of my 
                         affairs!

               The messenger isn't quite sure what he's done but he slinks 
               back to his seat as Burns turns to Bruce.

               CLOSEUP HILDY

               She is beginning to get sore, but reluctantly again she is 
               compelled to smile at Walter's behavior.

                              hand but grabs the 
                              umbrella and begins 
                              shaking the handle 
                              up and down)
                         This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and 
                         I'm sorry about the mistake.

                                     BRUCE
                              (he tries to shift 
                              the umbrella, calling 
                              Burns' attention to 
                              it, and offers his 
                              hand instead)

                                     BURNS
                         Oh, I thought there was something 
                         funny... You see, Bruce, you don't 
                         mind if I call you Bruce, do you? 
                         After all, we're practically related --

                              (completely unnerved 
                              by this time, and 
                              you can't quite blame 
                              him)
                         Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at 
                         all.

                         You see, my wife -- I mean, your 
                         wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had 
                         led me to expect that she was marrying 
                         a much older man.

                                     BRUCE
                              (this is the final 
                              crusher)
                         Oh.

                                     BURNS
                         But I see, she didn't mean old in 
                         years. You always carry an umbrella, 
                         Bruce?

                                     BRUCE
                         Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy 
                         this morning.

                                     BURNS
                         That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I 
                         hope? A man ought to be prepared for 
                         any emergency.

               Burns looks down. Bruce, in unconscious responses, helplessly 
               lifts his foot up and we see the rubber.

                                     BURNS
                         Attaboy!
                              (taking Bruce's arm 
                              and leading him toward 
                              elevator)
                         Come on, Bruce.

                                     BRUCE
                              (going along, but 
                              worried)
                         Where are we going?

                                     BURNS
                         Where are we going? I'm going to buy 
                         you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell 
                         you?

                                     BRUCE
                              (a helpless look back 
                              at Hildy)
                         No -- she didn't.

                                     BURNS
                         Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.
                              (as the elevator is 
                              about to pass, he 
                              calls)
                         Down!
                              (practically shoving 
                              Bruce in)
                         After you, Bruce!
                              (as Bruce disappears 
                              inside he turns toward 
                              Hildy)
                         Come on, Hildy, my treat!

               CLOSE SHOT BURNS NEAR OPEN ELEVATOR

               We don't see the passengers. Hildy comes into scene.

                                     HILDY
                         I suppose I can't call this off 
                         without creating a scene -- but 
                         remember, it's your last fling.

                                     BURNS
                              (hurt)
                         How do you like that? Here I am being 
                         nice to you and your sweet-heart and 
                         that's the thanks I get!

               He jumps into the elevator -- in a second he hops out.

                                     BURNS
                              (very sweetly -- he 
                              almost sings it)
                         Oh -- after you, Hildy!

               With a look of disgust Hildy gets in. Burns follows and the 
               door slams on them.

               CLOSEUP OFFICE BOY

               He looks after departed elevator and whistles. Then he grins 
               all over.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. RESTAURANT CLOSEUP - A BEAMING WAITER

               HE GRINS ALL OVER AND SAYS:

                                     WAITER
                         Don't tell me it's you, Hildy!

               CAMERA PULLS BACK and discloses our three at a restaurant 
               table. Nothing swanky -- a place like Jack Blake's in New 
               York, say.

                                     HILDY
                              (beaming at waiter)
                         Nobody else.

               She extends her hand. The waiter takes it; they shake.

                                     HILDY
                         How's everything, Gus?

                                     GUS
                         I can't complain.

                                     BURNS
                              (studying menu)
                         Well, I can. I'm hungry. Roast beef 
                         sandwich -- rare. And some coffee.

                                     GUS
                         Shall I put a little rum in the 
                         coffee? It's a nasty day.

                                     BURNS
                         Good idea. How about you, Hildy?

                                     HILDY
                              (discarding menu)
                         Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. 
                         And coffee.

                                     GUS
                         Little rum in yours, too?

                                     HILDY
                         I guess so.

               Bruce looks at her. She hurriedly changes her mind.

                                     HILDY
                         No -- just coffee, Gus.

                                     GUS
                              (crestfallen)
                         Just coffee.
                              (to Bruce)
                         And you, sir?

                                     BRUCE
                              (putting menu down)
                         Oh, I'll take the same, I guess. And 
                         a glass of milk.

                                     GUS
                              (incredulous)
                         Milk?

                                     BRUCE
                              (thinks he hasn't 
                              heard)
                         Yes.

                                     GUS
                              (shaking his head as 
                              he writes it down)
                         Milk.

                                     BURNS
                         And don't put any rum in it, Gus.

               CLOSEUP - GUS

               Gus gives him a look and goes.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TRIO AT TABLE

               Burns surveys the others quizzically.

                                     BURNS
                              (a sigh)
                         Well, so you're getting married 
                         tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?

                                     BRUCE
                         Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're 
                         taking the four o'clock train to 
                         Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.

                                     BURNS
                              (it's the Puritan in 
                              him)
                         Taking the train today -- and being 
                         married tomorrow?

               He whistles.

                                     BRUCE
                              (rising to the bait)
                         Oh, it isn't like that.

                                     HILDY
                              (reassuring Mrs. Grundy)
                         It will be perfectly all right, 
                         Walter. Mother is coming with us on 
                         the train.

                                     BURNS
                         Mother? But your mother --

                                     BRUCE
                         No. My mother.

                                     BURNS
                              (he gets it and 
                              underlines it)
                         Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, 
                         that relieves my mind.

                                     HILDY
                              (to Bruce)
                         Isn't it sweet of Walter -- still 
                         wanting to protect me?

               She gives Burns that too-sweet look.

                                     BURNS
                              (apparently taking 
                              this at face value)
                         I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, 
                         but you can always count on me.

               TWO SHOT - FEATURING BRUCE AND HILDY

                                     BRUCE
                              (a little cookily)
                         I don't think she'll need you very 
                         much -- I aim to do most of the 
                         protecting myself.

               He pats Hildy's arm -- she smiles at him.

               THREE SHOT - HILDY, BRUCE AND BURNS

                                     BURNS
                         Well, I'll tell you one thing, old 
                         man, she never looked at me the way 
                         she's looking at you.

                                     HILDY
                         I might have, Walter, but you were 
                         never there.

                                     BURNS
                         Anyway, I'm glad you two are going 
                         to be happy and have all the things 
                         I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy 
                         is about the best reporter in the 
                         country -- and that goes regardless 
                         of sex. But all she really ever wanted 
                         was a home.

                                     BRUCE
                         Well, I'll try to give her one.

                                     BURNS
                         I know you will, Bruce. Are you going 
                         to live with your mother?

                                     BRUCE
                         Just for the first year.

                                     BURNS
                              (sighing)
                         That'll be nice. A home with mother. 
                         A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. 
                         Ow!

               That "ow" is sotto voce, but it's the direct result of a 
               kick under the table from Hildy.

                                     BRUCE
                         Mighty nice little town, Albany. 
                         They've got the State Capitol there, 
                         you know.

                                     BURNS
                         Yes, I know...
                              (he chuckles)
                         Hildy, will you ever forget the night 
                         you brought the Governor back to 
                         your hotel room and found me taking 
                         a bath? She didn't even know I was 
                         in town...

               His laugh stops cold and he clutches for his shin again. 
               Hildy just looks. Providentially, the waiter enters the scene.

                                     GUS
                         Well, here we are.

               He begins serving them.

                                     BURNS
                              (trying to pick up 
                              again after a second)
                         How's business, Bruce?

                                     BRUCE
                         Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance 
                         town. Most people there take it out 
                         pretty early in life.

                                     BURNS
                         I don't blame them.

               Gus, who has just managed to come between Hildy and Burns, 
               lets out a startled "ouch".

                                     HILDY
                         Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must 
                         have slipped.

                                     GUS
                              (a pained expression 
                              belies his words)
                         That's all right.

                                     BURNS
                         I sometimes wish I'd taken out 
                         insurance -- but, of course, now it 
                         doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it 
                         would have been the smart thing to 
                         do.

                                     BRUCE
                         Well, I honestly feel that way. I 
                         figure I'm in one line of business 
                         that really helps people. Of course, 
                         we don't help you much when you're 
                         alive -- but afterward -- that's 
                         what counts.

                                     BURNS
                         I see what you mean.

               They fall to.

               CLOSE SHOT - HILDY

               She sips her coffee and acts surprised.

                                     HILDY
                         Gus, this --

               CLOSEUP - GUS

                                     GUS
                              (winking)
                         Good coffee, isn't it?

               CLOSEUP - HILDY

               She smiles and winks back, and takes another sip.

               GROUP SHOT AT TABLE

               Gus starts to go.

                                     BRUCE
                         You've forgotten my milk.

                                     GUS
                         Oh. The milk. Yes.

               He leaves scene, shaking his head. Burns sips his coffee. He 
               likes it. He lifts his cup to Hildy.

                                     BURNS
                         Here's luck to the bride and 
                         bridegroom.

                                     HILDY
                              (lifts cup)
                         Thank you.

                                     BRUCE
                              (looking for something 
                              to respond with -- 
                              apologetically)
                         He hasn't brought my milk yet.

               A bus boy comes into scene and stops before Burns.

                                     BUS BOY
                         They want you on the phone, Mr. Burns.

                                     BURNS
                         They would!

               Boy goes, Burns rises, starts off, comes back for his cup of 
               coffee, which he then takes off with him.

               TWO SHOT - BRUCE AND HILDY

                                     BRUCE
                              (looking after him)
                         You know, Hildy, he's not a bad 
                         fellow.

                                     HILDY
                              (looking at him 
                              maternally)
                         You're so nice, Bruce, you think 
                         everybody else is.

                                     BRUCE
                         Oh, he's not the man for you. I can 
                         see that. But I sort of like him. 
                         Got a lot of charm.

                                     HILDY
                         He comes by it naturally. His 
                         grandfather was a snake.

                                     BRUCE
                              (shaking his head)
                         If anybody had told me I'd be sitting 
                         at lunch with him -- but he swept me 
                         right off my feet.

                                     HILDY
                         That's what he did to me. Swept me 
                         right off my feet -- and left me 
                         lying on the floor.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH FULL SHOT

               Burns is listening, has coffee on ledge and sips it now and 
               then.

                                     BURNS
                         Get this -- get Sweeney off that 
                         yarn and out of town on a two weeks' 
                         vacation -- and right away... All 
                         right, Duffy, keep your shirt on. 
                         Hildy's coming back... No. She doesn't 
                         know it yet. But she'll be there. I 
                         promise you, Duffy. And tell Louie 
                         to stick around.

               He hangs up, smiles, and finishes the coffee. Then he girds 
               himself for being crushed. He gradually begins to look sunk. 
               He pulls out a small mirror to study his expression till he 
               finally gets what he wants. He holds that expression as he 
               comes out of the booth.

               INT. RESTAURANT MED. SHOT AT TABLE

               Gus is entering the scene.

                                     GUS
                         Your milk, sir.

               He serves Bruce.

                                     GUS
                         And I brought you another cup of 
                         coffee, Hildy.

               Gus serves her and puts still another cup in front of Burns' 
               chair.

                                     HILDY
                         Thanks, Gus.

               She takes a sip and almost chokes.

                                     BRUCE
                         Too hot?

                                     HILDY
                              (gasping for breath)
                         No. It's strong.
                              (quickly)
                         But I like it that way.

               Gus goes, smiling.

                                     BRUCE
                              (looking off)
                         Say, what's happened to Burns? He 
                         looks sunk, doesn't he?

                                     HILDY
                              (beaming)
                         He certainly -- hic -- does!

               Burns comes into scene, looking like a 1929 banker just before 
               jumping off a roof, and sits down.

                                     BRUCE
                         Anything the matter?

                                     BURNS
                         Just Sweeney again. One of my best 
                         reporters.

                                     HILDY
                         What now?

                                     BURNS
                         His wife had twins and he went out 
                         to celebrate and got as drunk as a 
                         lord. They can't even find him.
                              (he sips his coffee)
                         I tell you, drink is the ruin of 
                         this nation.

                                     HILDY
                              (sipping hers)
                         You said it.

                                     BURNS
                         So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl 
                         Williams gets hanged tomorrow.

                                     BRUCE
                         Just what is the lowdown on Williams?

                                     BURNS
                         It's simple. A poor little dope who 
                         lost his job went berserk and shot a 
                         cop who was coming after him to quiet 
                         him down.

                                     HILDY
                         If he's nuts, why doesn't the State 
                         just put him away?

                                     BURNS
                         Because it happened to be a colored 
                         policeman.

                                     HILDY
                              (for Bruce's benefit)
                         The colored vote happens to be very 
                         important to the Mayor of this town.

                                     BURNS
                         Especially with an election coming 
                         up in a few days.

                                     BRUCE
                         Are you sure Williams is not all 
                         there?

                                     BURNS
                         All you've got to do is talk to him. 
                         But the Mayor would hang his own 
                         grandmother to be re-elected.

                                     BRUCE
                         But couldn't you show the man wasn't 
                         responsible?

               CLOSEUP - BURNS

                                     BURNS
                              (there's a sly 
                              expression on his 
                              face)
                         How?

                                     HILDY'S VOICE
                         You could run an interview that would 
                         prove it. Remember the interview I 
                         wrote with Jimmy Wellman? That saved 
                         his life.

                                     BURNS
                              (slapping hands 
                              together)
                         Yes, you could do it, Hildy. You 
                         could save that poor devil's life. 
                         You could -- but --
                              (the enthusiasm dies 
                              away)
                         -- you're going away. I forgot.

               THREE SHOT

                                     BRUCE
                         How long would the interview take?

                                     BURNS
                         Oh -- an hour for the interview. 
                         Another hour to write it.

                                     BRUCE
                         We could take the six o'clock train, 
                         Hildy. If it would save a man's life.

                                     HILDY
                         No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This 
                         is a trick to get your sympathy. No, 
                         Walter, I've been waiting for 
                         something like this -- but I wasn't 
                         sure when you'd spring it. If you 
                         want to save Earl Williams' life, 
                         you can interview him yourself. You're 
                         still a good reporter. Bruce and I 
                         will be on that four o'clock train -- 
                         and thanks just the same.

                                     BURNS
                         I'm an editor. I know what ought to 
                         be written, but I can't write it the 
                         way you could. It needs a woman's 
                         heart --

                                     HILDY
                         Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!

                                     BURNS
                              (to Bruce)
                         You see what I had to put up with? 
                         She never trusted me! You argue with 
                         her -- otherwise you're going on a 
                         honeymoon with blood on your hands!

               Bruce gulps.

                                     BURNS
                         How can you have any happiness after 
                         that? All through the years you'll 
                         remember that a man went to the 
                         gallows because you were too selfish 
                         to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl 
                         Williams' face will come between you 
                         on the train tonight -- and at the 
                         preacher's tomorrow -- and all the 
                         rest of your lives!

                                     HILDY
                              (breaking into applause)
                         What a performance! Bravo! Don't let 
                         him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an 
                         act!

                                     BURNS
                         What do you mean, only an act? Haven't 
                         you got any feeling?

                                     HILDY
                         Well, it's either an act on your 
                         part or a miracle on Sweeney's.

                                     BURNS
                         What do you mean?

                                     HILDY
                         I happen to know Sweeney was married 
                         only three months ago. If he's got 
                         twins this morning, I claim it was 
                         done with mirrors.

                                     BURNS
                              (laughs, throws up 
                              his hands)
                         All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But 
                         I'll make you and Bruce a business 
                         proposition.

                                     HILDY
                         We're not interested.

                                     BURNS
                              (to Bruce)
                         Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young 
                         man. You let Hildy do this story for 
                         me and you can write out a $100,000.00 
                         insurance policy for me. What do you 
                         say?

                                     BRUCE
                         I don't use my wife for business 
                         purposes, Mr. Burns!

                                     HILDY
                         Wait a minute, Bruce. What's 
                         commission on a $100,000.00 policy?

                                     BRUCE
                         Well, at his age, twenty payment 
                         life, a little over a thousand 
                         dollars.

                                     HILDY
                         And what's the matter with a thousand 
                         dollars?

                                     BRUCE
                         But --

                                     HILDY
                         According to the budget, we laid out 
                         that's more than our food bill for a 
                         whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't 
                         want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm 
                         perfectly willing to use him. How 
                         long will it take to get him examined?

                                     BRUCE
                         I could get a company doctor in twenty 
                         minutes.

                                     BURNS
                         Now you're talking!

                                     HILDY
                              (turning on Burns)
                         You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose 
                         you examine Mr. Burns in his office. 
                         I'll get my bag and go over to the 
                         Press Room in the Criminal Courts 
                         Building. You phone me as soon as 
                         Mr. Burns has given you his check. 
                         Then I'll go get the interview and 
                         you phone Mother that we're taking 
                         the six o'clock train.
                              (back to Burns)
                         And no tricks, Walter!

                                     BURNS
                         What tricks would I pull?

                                     HILDY
                         Oh, nothing! Of course, you might 
                         cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! 
                         What would be his first payment on 
                         that policy?

                                     BRUCE
                         About twenty-five hundred dollars.

                                     HILDY
                         Better make that a certified check, 
                         Walter.

                                     BURNS
                              (indignantly)
                         What do you think I am -- a crook?

                                     HILDY
                         Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! 
                         No certified check -- no story -- 
                         Get me?

                                     BURNS
                         All right. The check will be 
                         certified. Want my fingerprints?

                                     HILDY
                              (rising)
                         No thanks, I've still got those. 
                         Well, I'll step into some working 
                         clothes and hop over to the Press 
                         Room for the background on this yarn. 
                         It'll be kind of fun to see the boys 
                         again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must 
                         be certified.

                                     BRUCE
                         All right, dear.

                                     HILDY
                         Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got 
                         that money?

                                     BRUCE
                              (feeling his pocket)
                         The five hundred? Sure.

                                     HILDY
                         On second thought, would you let me 
                         have it? I'll get the tickets.

                                     BRUCE
                         But --

                                     HILDY
                         Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm 
                         doing. He'd get you in a crap game --

                                     BRUCE
                         But I don't gamble, Hilda!

                                     HILDY
                         I know a lot of men who didn't do 
                         anything till they met Walter Burns. 
                         Please, dear.

                                     BRUCE
                              (reluctantly)
                         All right.
                              (he pulls out his 
                              wallet)
                         One -- two -- three -- four -- five. 
                         Five hundred. Be careful, honey.

                                     HILDY
                         I'll be careful, darling. You be, 
                         please.

               She kisses him, kisses her hand and pats it to Burns' cheek.

                                     HILDY
                         So long, husbands.

               She goes.

               TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY

               leaving. She weaves just a bit.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO MEN

               They look after her.

                                     BRUCE
                              (smiling a little)
                         I never knew Hildy to be so determined 
                         before.

                                     BURNS
                         You haven't seen anything yet.

               Bruce turns to look at Burns -- they look at each other.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN: INT. PRESS ROOM - CRIMINAL COURTS BLDG - DAY CLOSE 
               SHOT AT TELEPHONE

               It is ringing. A hand comes in to take the phone. CAMERA 
               DRAWS BACK A LITTLE to show Endicott taking the phone. He 
               has an eye shade over his eyes and five cards in his other 
               hand.

                                     ENDICOTT
                              (into phone)
                         Criminal Courts Press Room... This 
                         is Endicott... No, nothing new on 
                         the Williams case yet boss. Well, 
                         you bet I'm here plugging away every 
                         minute.
                              (hangs up and studies 
                              his cards)
                         Up a dime.

               CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to reveal the other players as they speak. 
               Playing are reporters Murphy, Endicott, Wilson, Schwartz and 
               McCue.

                                     MURPHY
                              (dropping his cards)
                         By me.

                                     WILSON
                              (also dropping)
                         Droparoo.

               Schwartz knocks on table and drops cards.

                                     MCCUE
                              (reluctantly)
                         I'll call.

                                     ENDICOTT
                         Three sixes. Is that any good?

                                     HILDY'S VOICE
                         It sure looks good from here.

               The boys all look up toward sound of Hildy's voice.

               CLOSE SHOT HILDY JOHNSON

               framed in the doorway. She is carrying a bag and has changed 
               her costume to a tailored travelling suit. She grins and 
               comes into the room.

               MED. SHOT REPORTERS

               They are all talking at once as Hildy comes into the scene. 
               There are ad libs of "Hildy!" "Where'd you come from?" "Holy 
               Mackeral, Hildy Johnson!", etc. Hildy raises her hand for 
               silence.

                                     HILDY
                         One at a time, boys.

               She enters to a desk, places her bag on top of the desk, 
               takes her hat off and hangs it on a clothes tree in the 
               corner, comes back to desk and opens the travelling bag. All 
               through the above action she is talking rapidly.

                                     HILDY
                         No, I'm not back for good. I'm just 
                         covering the Earl Williams story for 
                         Mr. Sweeney who had a sudden attack 
                         of something but will be all right 
                         by tomorrow. No, I haven't made up 
                         with Walter Burns -- far from it! As 
                         a matter of fact, I'm leaving tonight 
                         for Albany and I'll be married 
                         tomorrow morning. The lucky man is 
                         Mr. Bruce Baldwin, a gentleman in 
                         the insurance business -- and when I 
                         say gentleman, I mean gentleman! Are 
                         there any other questions?

               Hildy takes notebook and pencil out of bag, looks at the 
               stockings she is wearing, sees she has a run and takes a 
               fresh pair out of the bag. She sits down and begins to put 
               on the new stockings.

                                     ENDICOTT
                              (grinning)
                         Well, that about covers everything.

                                     HILDY
                         Good. Now I want to ask you fellows 
                         a couple of questions. Did Earl 
                         Williams know what he was doing when 
                         he fired that gun?

                                     MURPHY
                         If you ask us, no. If you ask the 
                         state alienists, the answer is yes.

                                     MCCUE
                         It's a simple story. Earl Williams 
                         works for the E.J. McClosky 
                         Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper 
                         for fourteen years. He starts in at 
                         twenty dollars a week and gradually 
                         works his way up to twenty-two fifty. 
                         A year ago the McClosky Company goes 
                         out of business and Williams loses 
                         his job.
                              (waving his hand toward 
                              Wilson)
                         Take it away, Fred Wilson!

                                     WILSON
                         Well -- Williams goes a little balmy 
                         and begins making speeches on a plan 
                         he's got to save the world. Only he 
                         makes his speeches, usually, on a 
                         very busy street and neglects to get 
                         a license for it. Well, the cops let 
                         him alone as much as they can because 
                         he's harmless and they're kinda sorry 
                         for him. But one day he decides to 
                         hold a meeting right in the middle 
                         of a Veteran's Parade and the cops 
                         chase him. He gets scared and goes 
                         into hiding.
                              (gesturing toward 
                              Schwartz)
                         Come in, Dave Schwartz.

                         His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out 
                         with a statement that Earl Williams 
                         is a dangerous character in the employ 
                         of two or three foreign governments 
                         and the police are going to get him 
                         dead or alive. Somebody sends out a 
                         tip that this guy is hiding in Molly 
                         Malloy's joint. And this colored 
                         policeman, Daniels, goes over to 
                         pick Williams up. Williams has read 
                         the papers, thinks the cop is going 
                         to kill him and shoots first. That 
                         is all.

                                     HILDY
                         Thanks, boys. That's all I want to 
                         know.

               Hildy gets up, rolls the pair of stockings she has just 
               discarded into a ball, crosses to Bensinger's desk and puts 
               the stockings in a drawer.

                                     ENDICOTT
                         Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's 
                         desk.

                                     HILDY
                         I know, I just want to give him a 
                         thrill.

               Hildy crosses back to desk and sits down.

                                     HILDY
                         All right, boys, now that everything 
                         is settled, deal me in.

               Hildy glances toward clock on wall. The hands show 2:45 PM.

               INSERT: CLOCK - Hands pointing to 2:45 PM.

               She picks up phone nearest her on desk and starts to dial, 
               picking up cards dealt her with one hand.

                              then, into phone)
                         Hello, Walter. How's the old double-

               Telephone at his ear.

                                     BURNS
                         Hello, my fine-feathered friend. 
                         Thought I might be hearing from you. 
                         What have you got to report?

               CAMERA PULLS BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT and we see that Burns is 
               stripped to the waist. A doctor is applying a stethoscope to 
               his chest. We HOLD the picture a second: Burns listening 
               intently on the phone and the doctor listening intently to 
               his chest.

                                     BURNS
                              (into phone)
                         Going all right, eh?

                              (nodding)
                         Fine.

               Doctor suddenly realizes what he's said and looks up.

                                     BURNS
                              (putting hand over 
                              mouthpiece of phone)
                         Doctor, will you please keep quiet a 
                         minute? How do you expect me to get 
                         any work done?

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Bruce, who has some papers in 
               front of him at the desk. Bruce grins.

                                     DOCTOR
                         How do you expect me to get anywhere 
                         if you're going to keep on that phone? 
                         If you'll just give me two minutes 
                         more --

                              (into phone)
                         Well, they haven't finished with me 
                         yet but I'm hoping to get my shirt 
                         back. Oh, no. I'm in the pink of 
                         condition. They found two new dimples.

                         Burns, but remember, no checkee -- 
                         no story. Well, as soon as they decide 
                         whether you live or not will you 
                         have that new man of mine call me

                         That must be the tenth alienist 
                         they've had on Williams. Even if he 
                         wasn't crazy before, he would be 
                         after ten of those babies got through

                         country?

                         Don't you remember? He's the guy 
                         went to Washington to interview the 
                         Brain Trust, and gave out a statement 
                         that they were all sane. It created 
                         a sensation!

               He continues playing his cards:

                              (into phone)
                         This is Murphy. More slop on the 
                         hanging.

                         A double guard's been thrown around 
                         the jail, municipal buildings, 
                         railroad terminals, and elevated 
                         stations to prepare for the expected 
                         general uprising of radicals at the 
                         hour of execution.

                         Ready? The Sheriff's just put two 
                         hundred more relatives on the payroll 
                         to protect the city against the Red 
                         Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a 
                         couple of minutes.
                              (consults his hand)

                         The Sheriff has just received four 
                         more letters threatening his life, 
                         but he says nothing can interfere 
                         with his duty.

                         And to prove to the voters that the 
                         Red Menace is on the level, the 
                         Sheriff has written himself four 
                         more letters, threatening his life. 
                         I know he wrote 'em on account of 
                         the misspellings.

                         Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows 
                         up the Sheriff will still be crying 
                         'Wolf!'

                         What have you got, Hildy?

                         'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... 
                         Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's 
                         knee.

                         That's why I keep losing. My grandma 
                         was a modest woman -- nobody ever 
                         saw her knees, not even my grandpop.

               INT. WALTER BURNS' OFFICE MED. SHOT

               The doctor has gone. Burns is adjusting his shirt. Bruce is 
               sitting at the desk.

                                     BRUCE
                         I don't know. This makes me feel 
                         funny.

               TWO SHOT

                                     BURNS
                         Why shouldn't I make Hildy my 
                         beneficiary? I've got nobody else to 
                         leave it to.

                                     BRUCE
                         I feel I ought to take care of her.

                                     BURNS
                         Well, you'll take care of her. After 
                         all, if that doctor's right, I'm 
                         going to live for a long time yet. 
                         Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. 
                         I was a very bad husband: Hildy could 
                         have got a lot of alimony if she'd 
                         wanted to, but she wouldn't take 
                         any. She had it coming to her, but 
                         she was too independent.

                                     BRUCE
                         Well, I'm independent, too.

                                     BURNS
                         Figure it this way: I ought to be 
                         good for twenty-five years. By that 
                         time, you'll probably have made enough 
                         so that the money won't mean anything. 
                         But suppose you haven't made good -- 
                         don't you think Hildy's entitled to 
                         a quiet old age without any worries?

                                     BRUCE
                         Well, of course, if you put it that 
                         way.

                                     BURNS
                              (everything he has on 
                              the ball)
                         And remember this, Bruce! I love 
                         her, too.

                                     BRUCE
                         I'm beginning to realize that.

                                     BURNS
                         And the beauty of it is she'll never 
                         have to know 'till I've passed on. 
                         Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- 
                         after I'm gone.

                                     BRUCE
                              (a lump in his throat)
                         Gee, you almost make me feel like a 
                         heel -- coming between you.

                                     BURNS
                         No, Bruce, you didn't come between 
                         us. It was all over for her before 
                         you came on the scene. For me -- 
                         it'll never be over.

               He turns away, wipes his eyes, and sneaks a glance to see 
               how that goes over. It goes over big -- Bruce hurriedly wipes 
               a tear away.

               as Duffy comes into the room. He advances toward the desk.

                         I drew out my wife's savings, and if 
                         this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined 
                         man!

                         Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it 
                         back by five.
                              (louder)
                         Thanks, Duffy. Stick around.

                              rises)

               He walks over to Bruce.

                                     BURNS
                         Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified

                              (also rising)
                         Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel 
                         ashamed to think she hadn't trusted 
                         you.

               CLOSEUP DUFFY

               He reacts to this sweetly solemn thought.

               BURNS AND BRUCE

               CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as Burns walks Bruce toward door, his 
               arm around him.

                                     BRUCE
                         Well, she'll know some day.

                                     BURNS
                         That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.

               He releases Bruce, runs back and gets umbrella and brings it 
               to him.

                                     BURNS
                         Don't want to forget this, you know. 
                         Might start to rain again.

                                     BRUCE
                         Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away 
                         to get that story.

               They are at the door. Burns opens the door for Bruce.

               SHOT FEATURING LOUIS

               Louis is sitting at a desk, apparently engrossed in a 
               newspaper. He is all alert, however. Bruce and Burns come 
               into the scene talking.

                                     BURNS
                         Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting 
                         a good man.

                                     BRUCE
                              (embarrassed)
                         Thanks a lot.

               They pass Louis. He looks up.

               BRUCE AND BURNS

               Bruce, still embarrassed, looks down. Burns turns and signals 
               to Louis.

                         Well, I got to get back. You can 
                         find your way out, can't you?

                                     BRUCE
                         Oh, sure.
                              (he extends his hand)
                         Well, thanks for everything.

                                     BURNS
                         Don't thank me. I should thank you. 
                         So long.

                                     BRUCE
                         So long.

               He turns and goes. Burns watches him.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               Bruce is going out, his back toward Camera. Burns watches. 
               Louis comes between Burns and Bruce and follows Bruce out as 
               we see Bruce going toward outer door.

                         Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.

                                     MCCUE
                         For you, Hildy.

               Hildy goes toward phone.

                         Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. 
                         Have you got it? Is it certified?

                         Certified and everything. Got it 
                         right here in my wallet... What? No, 
                         he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.

               INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT HILDY AT PHONE

               McCue is hovering near.

                                     MCCUE
                         Certified, eh? Who is it -- your 
                         milkman?

                                     HILDY
                              (in phone)
                         But, Bruce, don't keep it in your 
                         wallet!... Well, you see --
                              (she is thinking 
                              rapidly)
                         -- there's an old newspaper 
                         superstition that the first big check 
                         you get you -- you put in the lining 
                         of your hat. That brings you good 
                         luck for ten years.

                                     MCCUE
                         Say, I've been a reporter twenty 
                         years and never heard any hooey like 
                         that. Where'd you get it?

                                     HILDY
                              (to McCue)
                         I made it up just now, and who's 
                         asking you?
                              (into phone)
                         I know it's silly, honey, but do it 
                         for me, won't you?... Yes, right 
                         now.

                                     BRUCE
                         All right. Wait a minute.

               He takes check out of wallet, folds it into lining of hat.

                                     BRUCE
                         All right. I've done it. Now, are 
                         you satisfied?

               INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT HILDY AT PHONE

                                     HILDY
                         Fine. And here's a kiss for you.

               She blows a kiss into the phone. Immediately we hear kiss 
               sounds all over. She looks up and glares. Then back to phone:

                                     HILDY
                         Now, darling, you go back to the 
                         hotel and pack and you and Mother 
                         pick me up here about half-past five. 
                         Goodbye, dear.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH CLOSE SHOT BRUCE

               He blows a kiss into the phone and hangs up.

               EXT. OUTSIDE RESTAURANT LOUIS

               Studying a paper, reads it for a moment. Bruce comes out of 
               restaurant and starts out. After a second, Louis follows 
               him.

               INT. ENTRANCE TO A CELL BLOCK OF COUNTY JAIL MED. SHOT

               Warden Cooley sits at a desk near the grilled doorway that 
               leads to the cells. He is studying a Racing Form. Hildy's 
               hand reaches into the shot and flicks the newspaper. He looks 
               up. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Hildy.

                                     COOLEY
                         Hello, Hildy! What are you doing 
                         around here?

                                     HILDY
                         I want to interview Earl Williams, 
                         Warden. How about a little service?

                                     COOLEY
                         No more interviews. Besides, a 
                         doctor's coming over.

               Hildy reaches down out of camera range -- comes up with bill.

                                     HILDY
                         Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?

                                     COOLEY
                              (looks at bill eagerly)
                         I think it is.

                                     HILDY
                              (handing it over)
                         I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.

               Cooley pockets the twenty and reaches for his key ring.

               EXT. STREET SCENE

               There is a milling mob around a center of activity that the 
               Camera can't find.

               SHOT OF COP

               as he sees this and strolls determinedly toward it.

               THE CROWD

               The cop comes in and breaks ranks. He pushes his way toward 
               center and looks down.

               CLOSE SHOT BRUCE

               lying down, held by Louis.

               MED. SHOT

                                     COP
                         What's going on?

                                     LOUIS
                         This guy stole my watch.

                                     COP
                              (lugging them both to 
                              feet)
                         Have you got his watch?

                                     BRUCE
                         He's crazy. I haven't any watch.

                                     LOUIS
                         I saw him. He put it in his back 
                         pocket.

                                     BRUCE
                         I haven't got --

                                     COP
                         Wait a minute.

               The cop reaches into Bruce's back pocket. Watch comes out.

                                     COP
                              (to Louis)
                         Is this yours?

                                     LOUIS
                         Yeah! That's it!

                                     COP
                         What about it?

                                     BRUCE
                         I never saw it before.

               Cop grabs Bruce. Louis grabs his other arm.

                                     COP
                         Come on!

               He whistles.

                                     COP
                              (to mob)
                         Beat it!

               CLOSE SHOT THREE

               as they go through crowd. The look on poor Bruce's face, 
               muddy anyhow, is something. Suddenly, Bruce cries:

                                     BRUCE
                         My hat!

                                     COP
                         Get his hat, somebody.

               CLOSEUP BRUCE'S HAT

               lying top up, in a puddle. Hand reaches in and picks it up.

               CLOSE SHOT THREE

               as hat is passed to cop, who jams it down on Bruce's head. 
               Another takem from Bruce.

               INT. COUNTY JAIL MED. CLOSE SHOT

               at the door of Earl Williams' cell. Hildy sits on a stool at 
               the door, pencil and copy paper in hand. Earl Williams sits 
               at the edge of his cot, facing Hildy. There is a bouquet of 
               roses in a water pitcher by the cot. Our first impression of 
               Williams is that he's a rational, well-poised citizen. It is 
               only under Hildy's questioning that he gradually reveals 
               himself.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         I couldn't plead insanity, because 
                         you see I'm just as sane as anybody 
                         else.

                                     HILDY
                              (puzzled and worried)
                         You didn't mean to kill that 
                         policeman?

                                     WILLIAMS
                         Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- 
                         it's against everything I've ever 
                         stood for. They know it was an 
                         accident. They're not hanging me for 
                         that -- they're hanging me for my 
                         beliefs.

                                     HILDY
                         What are your beliefs, Earl?

                                     WILLIAMS
                         They're very simple. I believe in 
                         the Golden Rule. I'm not the first 
                         man to die for preaching it. But if 
                         they would only listen to it -- we 
                         could have a fine, decent world 
                         instead of this mass of hate that 
                         makes man do such cruel things.

                                     HILDY
                         How would you go about applying the 
                         Golden Rule, Earl?

                                     WILLIAMS
                         I'd do away with the profit system 
                         and have production for use only. 
                         There's enough food and clothing and 
                         shelter for everybody if we'd use 
                         some sense.

                                     HILDY
                              (writing)
                         "Production for use only." Well, 
                         maybe that's the answer.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         It's the only answer. Everything has 
                         a use and if we let it be used for 
                         its purpose, we could solve all our 
                         problems. Food was meant to be eaten, 
                         not stored away in restaurants while 
                         poor people starved; clothing was 
                         meant to be worn, not piled up in 
                         stores while people went naked. 
                         Doesn't that make sense?

               CLOSEUP HILDY

                                     HILDY
                              (thoughtfully)
                         Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.

                                     WILLIAM'S VOICE
                         Just use things for what they were 
                         meant, that's all.

                                     HILDY
                         Sure.
                              (she studies him a 
                              moment)
                         What's the purpose of a gun, Earl?

               CLOSEUP WILLIAMS

                                     WILLIAMS
                         A gun?
                              (he thinks -- then a 
                              revealing smile breaks 
                              out)
                         Why -- to shoot, of course.

               MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT

                                     HILDY
                         Is that how you came to shoot the 
                         policeman?

                                     WILLIAMS
                         Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun 
                         in my hand before and I didn't know 
                         what to do with it. Well, when I get 
                         stuck, I know that there's an answer 
                         for everything in production for 
                         use. So it came to me in a flash: 
                         what's a gun for? To shoot! So I 
                         shot. Simple isn't it?

                                     HILDY
                              (writing)
                         Very simple, Earl.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         There's nothing crazy about that, is 
                         there?

                                     HILDY
                         No, Earl, not at all.
                              (she indicates the 
                              flowers)

                         Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Sheriff Hartman has come into the scene. Hildy turns toward 
               him.

                                     HILDY
                         Same way you did.
                              (pointing)
                         Through that gate.

                                     HARTMAN
                         I gave strict orders that nobody was 
                         to interview Williams without my 
                         permission.

                                     HILDY
                         All right, then, I'll just run the 
                         story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid 
                         to let reporters interview his 
                         prisoner. Of course, with election 
                         coming, that might do you a lot of 
                         harm, but just as you say.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid 
                         of anything. What were you going to 
                         write about Williams?

                                     HILDY
                         Oh, nothing much. Just that the state 
                         had proved he was sane -- and he 
                         admits it himself. If you don't want 
                         me to run it --

                                     HARTMAN
                              (beaming)
                         Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go 
                         ahead, run it. And you can say I 
                         treated him well, too.
                              (turning toward 
                              Williams)
                         'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?

                                     WILLIAMS
                         Fine, thanks, Sheriff.

                                     HARTMAN
                         That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got 
                         another alienist to see you. He ought 
                         to be here any minute. Don't go to 
                         sleep, will you?

                                     WILLIAMS
                         I won't.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (to Hildy)
                         Hildy, how'd you like a couple of 
                         tickets for the hanging?

                                     HILDY
                              (in a low voice so 
                              Williams won't 
                              overhear)
                         No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town 
                         tonight.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (just as loud as ever)
                         You ought to stay over. You always 
                         wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.

                                     HILDY
                         That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. 
                         I've got to get started on my 
                         interview. See you later.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         Don't forget about production for 
                         use.

                         from a paper any longer than that. 
                         Did you see her eyes light up when 
                         she came in here? Like an old fire

                         Well, if she's gonna write fiction, 
                         there's nothing like being a reporter.

                         I'll give ten to five that marriage 
                         won't last six months. Hildy's a 
                         newspaper man. She's got headlines 
                         in her veins -- the way we all have 
                         or we'd be out of these lousy jobs.

                         wandering around in the rain without 
                         his hat and coat on, like a sick 
                         dog, the day before the shooting. I 
                         went up to him like any human being 
                         would and I asked him what was the 
                         matter, and he told me about being 
                         fired after working at the same place 
                         for fourteen years, and I brought 
                         him up to my room because it was 
                         warm there.

                         But you'll have to hurry up -- he 
                         left a call for seven A.M.

                                     MOLLIE
                              (through her teeth)
                         It's a wonder a bolt of lightning 
                         don't come down and strike you all 
                         dead!

               From o.s. comes sound of the gallows. Mollie gasps.

                              (begins to sob)

                              (hysterically)
                         A poor little fellow that never meant 
                         nobody no harm! Sitting there alone 
                         this minute with the Angel of Death 
                         beside him, and you cracking jokes!

               CLOSEUP HILDY

               typing away furiously, regardless of this. She ends a page. 
               The sound of Mollie sobbing comes over the scene. Hildy 
               inserts a fresh page.

                                     MURPHY'S VOICE
                         If you don't shut up, we'll give you 
                         something to cry about!

               Hildy looks o.s. and rises determinedly.

               She is still sobbing. Hildy comes into scene and puts her 
               arm around Mollie.

                                     HILDY
                              (gently)
                         Come on, Mollie. This is no place 
                         for you.
                              (she leads Mollie 
                              toward door)

                                     MOLLIE
                         They're not human!

                                     HILDY
                         They're newspaper men, Mollie. They 
                         can't help themselves. The Lord made 
                         them that way.

                                     MOLLIE

                         It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!

               Hildy and Mollie exit. There is a pause. The boys look at 
               each other uncomfortably. The phone rings. Wilson goes to 
               answer.

                         Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll 
                         hang on a minute, she ought to be

                         Wants Hildy -- and sounds very 
                         excited.

               Hildy comes back. Looks at them and stares contemptuously.

                              (indignantly)
                         Once and for all, I'm not going to 
                         hang anybody except at the legal 
                         hour... What? Don't threaten me, 
                         Bensinger! I'm not afraid of any 
                         newspapers. Yeah?... Oh, shut up!
                              (he hangs up; an 
                              afterthought -- he 
                              calls up operator)
                         And, operator, I told you not to

                         I don't want to be disturbed again 
                         till I tell you!
                              (he hangs up -- turns

               CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A MED. GROUP SHOT, showing Williams, 
               Sheriff Hartman and Dr. Egelhoffer. They are the only 
               occupants of room. Williams is seated facing a large standing 
               searchlight.

                                     EGELHOFFER
                         The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the 
                         scum of modern civilization.

                                     HARTMAN
                         You said it!

                                     EGELHOFFER
                         They're always after me for 
                         interviews.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Me, too.

                                     EGELHOFFER
                              (fencing)
                         Of course, I sort of promised them I 
                         would give out a statement when I 
                         got through here. You don't mind?

                                     HARTMAN
                              (not liking it)
                         Well, I don't know if that's ethical. 
                         You see, all statements are supposed 
                         to come from me.

                                     EGELHOFFER
                              (he'll bargain)
                         We'll have to satisfy them. What 
                         would you say to giving them a joint 
                         interview? I could give them some of 
                         the psychological aspects of the 
                         case and you could give them the 
                         legal aspects.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (he buys)
                         A joint interview, eh? That might be 
                         all right. We could have our pictures 
                         taken together, Doctor.

                                     EGELHOFFER
                         Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a 
                         very good picture, though.

                                     HARTMAN
                         It doesn't matter. The publicity's 
                         the main thing.

                                     EGELHOFFER
                         Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.

                         Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were 
                         here. No, Mr. Williams, we still 
                         have some questions for you. Sheriff, 
                         will you kindly extinguish the lights?

               The Sheriff puts out the lights and the Doctor switches on 
               the searchlight, which shines in Williams' face.

                                     EGELHOFFER
                         You know you are to be executed, Mr. 
                         Williams. Who do you feel is 
                         responsible for that?

                         The system. But I'm not afraid to 
                         die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I 
                         believe.

                                     EGELHOFFER
                         I see. You realize, however, that

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to show us Bruce in police cell. Hildy 
               outside. A police lieutenant with her in b.g.

                                     HILDY
                         I know you didn't, Bruce.

               She whirls on lieutenant.

                                     HILDY
                              (to lieutenant)
                         Let him out of here, Lieutenant.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (conciliatingly)
                         But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of 
                         stealing a watch. And they found the 
                         watch on him.

                                     HILDY
                         And who accused him? Diamond Louis! 
                         One of the worst crooks in town! Why 
                         don't you arrest Louis instead of 
                         innocent people that he frames?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Now, Hildy --

                                     HILDY
                         Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let 
                         him out?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         I can't.

                                     HILDY
                         All right. You can't. But tomorrow 
                         the Post will run the story of that 
                         roulette game on 43rd Street that 
                         your brother-in-law runs. And we'll 
                         print that you get five hundred a 
                         month for forgetting about it!

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't 
                         let him out.

                                     HILDY
                         You can let him out on bail, can't 
                         you?

                                     HILDY
                         You'll take fifty and like it!

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (wavers)
                         Well, all right. But I'm liable to 
                         get into a jam.

               He starts to open cell door.

                                     HILDY
                         You'll get into a worse one if you 
                         don't.

               INT. TAXI (PROCESS SHOT)

               Hildy is combing Bruce's hair. He begins to look presentable. 
               He fumbles in his breast pocket.

                                     HILDY
                         What's the matter?

                                     BRUCE
                         I lost my wallet.

                                     HILDY
                              (stops)
                         The check, Bruce!

               Bruce picks up his hat and gets check out of lining.

                                     BRUCE
                         That's right here. Gee, it was lucky 
                         your telling me about that old 
                         newspaper superstition.

                                     HILDY
                              (taking check and 
                              putting it away)
                         Yes, wasn't it?

                                     BRUCE
                         I can't imagine who did it. I can't 
                         think of any enemies I have.

                                     HILDY
                              (looking at him fondly)
                         I'm sure you haven't any.

                                     BRUCE
                         For a minute, I thought maybe Walter 
                         Burns was at the back of it. But 
                         then I realized he couldn't have 
                         been.

                                     HILDY
                         Oh, no. How could you ever think of 
                         such a thing?

                                     BRUCE
                         Oh, I realized right away. He's really 
                         a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found 
                         that out.

                                     HILDY
                         Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're 
                         taking that next train -- and when I 
                         say next train, this time I mean it!

                                     BRUCE
                         Did you finish the interview?

                                     HILDY
                              (to driver)
                         The Criminal Courts Building.

               The driver nods.

                                     HILDY
                              (to Bruce)
                         No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right 
                         with Walter.

                                     BRUCE
                         But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that 
                         insurance business -- and you promised --

                                     HILDY
                         Well, the story's practically 
                         finished. I'll just go upstairs and 
                         send it over with a messenger.

               The cab stops. Hildy gets out and Bruce starts to follow. 
               Hildy turns and pushes him back in the cab.

               EXT. STREET MED. SHOT HILDY

               at door of cab. Bruce in cab.

                                     HILDY
                         No, you stay here. I'm not taking 
                         any more chances. I'll be down in 
                         three minutes -- and don't you dare 
                         move!

               Hildy turns and starts for stairs of Criminal Courts Building.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT AT HILDY'S DESK

               Schwartz is reading Hildy's interview to the other boys, who 
               are grouped around. Bensinger is at his desk, a book open, 
               but listening.

                                     SCHWARTZ
                              (reading)
                         "But the State has a production for 
                         use plan, too. It has a gallows and 
                         at seven A.M., unless a miracle 
                         occurs, that gallows will be used to 
                         separate the soul of Earl Williams 
                         from his body. And out of Molly 
                         Malloy's life will go the one kindly 
                         soul she ever knew --"
                              (he stops)
                         That's as far as Hildy got. But, I 
                         ask you, can that girl write an 
                         interview?

                                     BENSINGER
                         I don't think it's very ethical 
                         reading other people's stuff.

                                     ENDICOTT
                         Don't give us that ethics stuff. 
                         You'll be the only one who'll swipe 
                         any of it.

                                     SCHWARTZ
                         I still say anybody that writes like 
                         that ain't going to give it up 
                         permanently to sew sox for a guy in 
                         the insurance business. Now I give 
                         that marriage three months and I'm 
                         laying three to one. Any takers?

                                     HILDY'S VOICE
                         I'll take that bet.

               They turn. Hildy comes into the scene.

                                     HILDY
                              (going to her phone)
                         It's getting so a girl can't step 
                         out of the room without being 
                         discussed by a bunch of old ladies.

                         Well, Hildy, we were only saying 
                         that a swell reporter like you 
                         wouldn't give this up so easily.

                              (to Schwartz)
                         Oh, I can give it up all right. 
                         Without a single quiver. I'm going 
                         to live like a human being -- not 
                         like you rats.

                         Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I 
                         didn't mean "dear." That was just 
                         habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, 
                         Walter. I've got some news for you... 
                         Yes, I got the interview, but I've 
                         got some news that's more important.

               The others are listening, suspecting a scoop.

                         Better get a pencil out and write it 
                         down. All ready?

                         Get this, you double-crossing 
                         chimpanzee, there ain't gonna be any 
                         interview and there ain't gonna be 
                         any story... Huh? That certified 
                         check of yours is leaving with me in 
                         twenty minutes. And if I ever see 
                         you again, it's going to be just too 
                         bad... Eh?... Oh, you don't know 
                         what I'm angry about, do you? If you 
                         come over I'll be very glad to tell 
                         you the story of Louie's watch. I 
                         dare you to come over, you -- you --

                         wrote... Yes, I know we made a

               She reaches into the drawer of desk and gets some stuff which 
               she puts into bag.

                                     HILDY
                         I'm going to be a woman, not a 
                         newsgetting machine. I'm going to 
                         have babies and nurse them and love 
                         them and give 'em cod liver oil and 
                         worry about their new teeth -- and 
                         the minute I catch one of them even 
                         looking at a newspaper, I'm going to 
                         brain him! Where's my hat?

               Someone points to her hat. She rises and goes toward it. Her 
               bag is still open. Her phone rings. Schwartz answers it.

                                     SCHWARTZ
                              (subdued tones)
                         Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still 
                         here.

                                     HILDY
                              (stopping midway to 
                              her hat)
                         I'll take it.
                              (she comes over to 
                              phone)
                         What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't 
                         you understand English? -- Why, your 
                         language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- 
                         positively shocking! I don't mind 
                         because I was married to you and 
                         know what to expect, but suppose 
                         Central is listening in... Oh, did 
                         you hear that, Central? We ought to 
                         report him, don't you think?... Oh, 
                         fooey on you!

               She pulls the phone out of the wall, walks toward window and 
               tosses it out of the window. She waits for the crash, turns 
               back and says:

                                     HILDY
                         Now where was that hat? Oh, yes.

               She starts toward it.

               INT. SHERIFF HARTMAN'S OFFICE MED. SHOT

                                     WILLIAMS
                         I hope you're pretty nearly through 
                         with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little 
                         fatigued.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Yeah, you don't want to tire him 
                         out, Doctor.

                                     EGELHOFFER
                         Just one thing more. I'd like to 
                         reenact the crime, Mr. Williams. May 
                         I have your gun, please, Sheriff?

               Hartman starts to take gun out, hesitates.

                                     HARTMAN
                         I don't know --

                                     EGELHOFFER
                              (insistently)
                         Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't 
                         strike in the same place twice. 
                         Nothing's going to happen.

               Hartman hands him the gun.

                                     EGELHOFFER
                         Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie 
                         Malloy, in whose room you were. You 
                         will be Earl Williams. And I will be 
                         the policeman. Follow me, Mr. 
                         Williams?

                                     WILLIAMS
                         Yes, sir.

               Egelhoffer hands the gun to Williams and then backs up a few 
               paces.

                                     EGELHOFFER
                         So -- now I say to you: 'Earl 
                         Williams, you are under arrest!' and 
                         you point your gun at me.

                                     WILLIAMS
                              (hesitantly)
                         Well, it wasn't exactly that way --

                                     EGELHOFFER
                              (insistently)
                         Point the gun at me!

               Williams does so.

                                     EGELHOFFER
                         Then what did you do?

               Williams hesitates for a moment and then pulls the trigger. 
               Hartman promptly dives under the desk as Egelhoffer topples 
               over.

                                     WILLIAMS
                              (pathetically)
                         Now can I go, please?

               There is a loud banging on the door and a voice calling:

                                     VOICE
                         Hey, Sheriff! Open up! What happened?

               Williams, alarmed by voice, turns and starts toward window.

               INT. PRESS ROOM MED. GROUP SHOT

               Hildy is now wearing her hat and gloves. She picks up her 
               bag and starts for the door.

                                     ENDICOTT

                         for you.

                         Goodbye, Hildy.

               Hildy has crossed to doorway, the CAMERA TRUCKING WITH HER. 
               She turns and faces the room to make a last bravura speech.

                                     HILDY
                         Well, goodbye, you wage-slaves. When 
                         you're crawling up fire escapes, 
                         getting kicked out of front doors, 
                         and eating Christmas dinners in one-
                         armed joints, don't forget your pal, 
                         Hildy Johnson! And, remember, my 
                         husband sells insurance!

               She turns and starts on a bit of verse:

                                     HILDY
                         "It takes a heap o' livin' to make a 
                         house a home."

               She is interrupted by a terrific fusillade of shots in the 
               courtyard. A roar of excited voices comes up. For a tense 
               second, everyone is motionless. There is another volley of 
               shots. Wilson, Endicott and Murphy jump for the window.

               Searchlights hit the windows, sweeping from direction of the 
               jail. Hildy stands paralyzed, her bundle in her hand. There 
               is another rifle volley. Two windowpanes crash into the room. 
               Some plaster falls. Gongs sound above the siren. The boys 
               are jumping for their telephones. Another windowpane goes.

               of reporters at their various phones follows: "Gimme the 
               desk!" "Flash!" "Earl Williams just escaped!" "Don't know 
               yet -- call you back.", etc., are shouted into the phones by 
               Schwartz, Wilson, McCue, Endicott, Bensinger and Murphy. 
               After each man communicates with his paper, he dashes for 
               the door.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The last of the reporters is gone.

               CLOSE SHOT - HILDY

               Her bag, almost unnoticed, falls to the floor. CAMERA TRUCKS 
               WITH HER as she moves back into the room, absently grabbing 
               and trailing a chair.

                         Ahhh --

               She lets go of the chair and takes one of the telephones.

                         quick! Hildy Johnson calling.

               Very calmly she sits on the long table, her back against the 
               wall and waits.

               CLOSEUP - HILDY

                                     HILDY

               She hangs up.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               There is another volley outside. Hildy sails her hat and 
               starts peeling off her gloves as she jumps for the door.

               EXT. COURTYARD - DAY MEDIUM SHOT - AT THE GATE

               There are the reporters joining armed guards who are leaping 
               into squad cars ready for the chase. Cooley is beside the 
               gate. As the reporters and guards pile into the cars, the 
               gate opens and out they go.

               MEDIUM SHOT AT DOOR LEADING FROM BUILDING TO COURTYARD

               Hildy comes on a run from this door, hesitates a moment, 
               then sees something o.s. and runs for it.

               MED. SHOT - SQUAD CAR

               as it comes careening across courtyard toward gate. Hildy 
               tears into scene, jumps for and makes the running-board, and 
               hangs there as the car swerves up to the gate.

               MED. SHOT - AT GATE

               Hildy notices Cooley as the car, gathering speed, goes by 
               him. She leaps from the running-board and lands clump on 
               Cooley.

               CLOSE SHOT - HILDY AND COOLEY

               Cooley has been knocked to the ground by the impact of Hildy's 
               leap. She is sitting on him.

                                     HILDY
                         Cooley, I want to talk to you.

                         Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has 
                         escaped --

               He struggles.

                                     HILDY
                         There's money in it, Cooley.

                                     COOLEY
                         I can't Hildy. It means my job! It

                         Four hundred and fifty dollars --

               She fingers the bills.

                         How much?

                                     HILDY
                         Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is 
                         it a deal?

                                     COOLEY
                         It's a deal. Let me up.

               Cooley gets up and dusts himself off.

                                     COOLEY

                         get that gun?

               Cooley looks around quickly.

                         Come on, and I'll tell you.

               He jerks his head, indicating to Hildy to follow him.

                         No -- nobody knows where he got the 
                         gun, but I think Mollie Malloy 
                         smuggled it in to him. He ran up the 
                         fire-escape, and went back in the 
                         infirmary window. Then he got out 
                         through the skylight. He must have 
                         slid down the rain-pipe to the street.

               turning as he enters. As he turns back to someone in corridor:

               The Sheriff spins around -- another enemy. At this moment 
               Hildy enters the room and crosses casually to her telephone 
               where she stands waiting.

                         married the Sheriff's niece. You 
                         remember, the very homely dame. Call

                         the eighth floor of the Commerce 
                         Building, was shot in the left leg 
                         by one of Sheriff Hartman's deputies.

               Hartman groans. There is a sound of machine-gun firing in 
               the courtyard.

                                     HILDY
                         There goes another scrub lady.

                         I'll go right after it.

                         From all I can get the Sheriff let 
                         him out so's he could vote for him.

                                     HARTMAN
                         I'm very disappointed in you, Hildy 
                         Johnson.

               He turns and exits.

               As Hildy shrugs, there is another flurry of machine-gun fire. 
               Murphy leaves precipitately. Hildy, alone at last, picks up 
               the phone.

                         I thought so, too.

               Hildy takes a look at the clock, rises and begins to pace up 
               and down, pounding her hands together.

                         eight-sixty-one and a half South 
                         State Street, colored, gave birth to 
                         a pickaninny in a patrol wagon with 
                         Sheriff Hartman's special Rifle Squad 
                         acting as nurses. Well -- Phoebe was 
                         walking along the street when all of 
                         a sudden she began -- that's right. 
                         So the police coaxed her into the 
                         patrol wagon and they started a race 
                         with the stork. When the pickaninny 
                         was born the Rifle Squad examined 
                         him carefully to see if it was Earl 
                         Williams who they knew was hiding 
                         somewhere.

                         in-law, he's worked for the city 
                         fifteen years.

               They come to the door of the Sheriff's office. Hartman opens 
               door and the Mayor enters, Hartman following.

               INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE MED. CLOSE SHOT

               Hartman closes door and turns to Mayor, who faces him 
               portentously.

                                     MAYOR
                         Pete, you're through!

                                     HARTMAN
                              (stunned)
                         What do you mean -- through?

                                     MAYOR
                         I mean I'm scratching your name off 
                         the ticket Tuesday and running 
                         Czernecki in your place. It's nothing 
                         personal. And, Pete -- it's the only 
                         way out. It's a sacrifice we all 
                         ought to be glad to make.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (David to Jonathan)
                         Fred!

                                     MAYOR
                         Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my 
                         Sentimental side.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Fred, I don't know what to say. A 
                         thing like this almost destroys a 
                         man's faith in human nature.

                                     MAYOR
                         I wish you wouldn't talk like that, 
                         Pete.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Our families, Fred. I've always looked 
                         on Bessie as my own sister.

                                     MAYOR
                              (wavering and desperate)
                         If there was any way out...

               As a phone rings:

                                     HARTMAN
                         There is a way out. I've got Williams 
                         surrounded, haven't I? What more do 
                         you want?
                              (into phone)
                         Hello... Yes... Hello!
                              (wildly)
                         Four hundred suppers! Nothing doing! 
                         This is a man-hunt -- not a 
                         banquet!... The twelve dollars 
                         includes everything!!

               He hangs up.

                                     HARTMAN
                         That gives you an idea of what I'm 
                         up against!

                                     MAYOR
                              (hotly)
                         We're up against a lot more than 
                         that with that nutty slogan you 
                         invented: 'Reform the Reds With a 
                         Rope'.

               Sheriff winces.

                                     MAYOR
                         Williams ain't a Red, and you know 
                         it!

                                     HARTMAN
                         Well, there's a lot of Communistic 
                         sympathizers around --

                                     MAYOR
                         I know it! But they've got nothing 
                         to do with this case! Do you realize 
                         there are two hundred thousand votes 
                         at stake and unless we hang Earl 
                         Williams we're going to lose 'em?

                                     HARTMAN
                         But we're going to hang him, Fred. 
                         He can't get away.

               A knock on the door.

                                     MAYOR
                         What do you mean he can't get away?! 
                         He got away, didn't he?

               Knocking louder.

                                     MAYOR
                         Who's out there?

                                     VOICE OUTSIDE (PINKUS)
                         Is Sheriff Hartman in there?

               Sheriff starts for door.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (relieved)
                         Ah! For me!

               MED. SHOT TAKING IN DOOR

               Sheriff opens the door. A small, very colorless and 
               ineffectual man named Pinkus is there.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (as he opens door, 
                              disclosing Pinkus)
                         I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?

                                     PINKUS
                              (coming in)
                         You're certainly a hard fellow to 
                         find, Sheriff.

                                     MAYOR
                              (annoyed)
                         What do you want?

                                     PINKUS
                              (taking a document 
                              from his pocket and 
                              proffering it to 
                              Sheriff)
                         I'm a messenger at the State House. 
                         This is from the Governor.

                                     MAYOR
                         What's from the Governor?

                                     PINKUS
                         The reprieve for Earl Williams.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (stunned)
                         For who?

                                     PINKUS
                              (amiably)
                         Earl Williams. The reprieve.

                                     MAYOR
                         W-wait a minute.

               Getting his bearings.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (bursting forth)
                         The Governor gave me his word of 
                         honor he wouldn't interfere. Two 
                         days ago!

                                     MAYOR
                         And you fell for it, Pete. It 
                         frightens me what I'd like to do to 
                         you.
                              (to Pinkus)
                         Who else knows about this?

               The Sheriff, with shaking hands, opens and begins to read 
               the thing.

                                     PINKUS
                         They were all standing around when 
                         he wrote it. It was after they got 
                         back from fishing.

                                     MAYOR
                              (to Sheriff)
                         Get the Governor on the phone!

                                     PINKUS
                              (helpfully)
                         You can't get him on the phone. He's 
                         out duckshooting now.

                                     MAYOR
                         Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you 
                         like that. A guy does nothing more 
                         strenuous for forty years than play 
                         pinochle -- he gets elected Governor 
                         and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!

                                     HARTMAN
                              (thrusting the document 
                              at the Mayor)
                         Read it! Insane, he says.
                              (shaking a finger in 
                              Pinkus' face)
                         He knows very well that Williams 
                         ain't insane!

                                     PINKUS
                         Yeah. But I --

                                     MAYOR
                              (interrupting)
                         Pure politics!

                                     HARTMAN
                         An attempt to ruin us!

               The phone rings. Hartman starts for it.

                                     MAYOR
                              (reading)

                                     HARTMAN
                         We got to think fast before those 
                         lying reporters get hold of this. 
                         What'll we tell 'em?

                                     MAYOR
                         Tell 'em the party is through in 
                         this State on account of you.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Ah, Fred --
                              (into phone)
                         Hello... this is Hartman --

                                     MAYOR
                              (apoplectic)
                         And you can tell 'em as an 
                         afterthought that I want your 
                         resignation now!

                                     HARTMAN
                              (from the phone)
                         Sssh. Wait, Fred.
                              (excitedly, into phone)
                         What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!

                                     MAYOR
                         What is it?

                                     HARTMAN
                         They got him!
                              (back to phone)
                         Wait a minute -- hold the wire.
                              (to the Mayor)
                         They got Earl Williams surrounded -- 
                         the Riot Squad has -- in his house.

                                     MAYOR
                         Tell 'em to hold the wire.

                                     HARTMAN
                         I did.
                              (into phone)
                         Hold the wire.

                                     MAYOR
                         Cover up that transmitter!

               Sheriff does so. Mayor faces Cooney.

                                     MAYOR
                         Now, listen! You never arrived here 
                         with this -- reprieve. Get it?

                                     PINKUS
                              (blinking)
                         Yes, I did, just now. Don't you 
                         remember?

                                     MAYOR
                         How much do you make a week?

                                     PINKUS
                         Huh?

                                     MAYOR
                              (impatiently)
                         How much do you make a week? What's 
                         your salary?

                                     PINKUS
                              (reluctantly)
                         Forty dollars.

                              (into phone)
                         No -- don't out me off.

                         How would you like to have a job for 
                         three hundred and fifty dollars a 
                         month. That's almost a hundred dollars 
                         a week!

                                     PINKUS
                         Who? Me?

                                     MAYOR
                              (exasperated)
                         Who do you think!

               Pinkus is a little startled; the Mayor hastens to adopt a 
               milder manner.

                                     MAYOR
                         Now, listen. There's a fine opening 
                         for a fellow like you in the City 
                         Sealer's office.

                                     PINKUS
                         The what?

                                     MAYOR
                         The City Sealer's office!

                                     PINKUS
                         You mean here in the city?

                                     MAYOR
                              (foaming)
                         Yes, yes!

                                     HARTMAN
                              (at phone)
                         Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm 
                         in conference.

                                     PINKUS
                              (a very deliberate 
                              intellect)
                         No, I couldn't do that.

                                     MAYOR
                         Why not?

                                     PINKUS
                         I couldn't work in the city. You 
                         see, I've got my family in the 
                         country.

                                     MAYOR
                              (desperate)
                         But you could bring 'em in here! 
                         We'll pay all your expenses.

                                     PINKUS
                              (with vast thought)
                         No, I don't think so.

                                     MAYOR
                         For heaven's sake, why not?

                                     PINKUS
                         I got two kids going to school there, 
                         and if I changed them from one town 
                         to another, they'd lose a grade.

                                     MAYOR
                         No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain 
                         one! And I guarantee that they'll 
                         graduate with highest honors!

                                     PINKUS
                              (lured)
                         Yeah?

                                     HARTMAN
                              (into phone)
                         Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? 
                         Hurry up, Fred!

                                     MAYOR
                         Now what do you say?

                                     PINKUS
                         This puts me in a peculiar hole.

                                     MAYOR
                         No, it doesn't.
                              (hands him the reprieve)
                         Now, remember: you never delivered 
                         this.
                              (rushing him to the 
                              door)
                         You got caught in the traffic, or 
                         something.
                              (opening door)
                         Now, get out of here and don't let 
                         anybody see you.

                                     PINKUS
                         But how do I know...?

                                     MAYOR
                         Come in and see me in my office 
                         tomorrow. What's your name?

                                     PINKUS
                         Pinkus.

                                     MAYOR
                              (taking out his wallet)
                         All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've 
                         got to do is lay low and keep your 
                         mouth shut. Here!
                              (he hands him a card)
                         Go to this address. It's a nice, 
                         homey little place, and they'll take 
                         care of you for the night. Just tell 
                         'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty 
                         dollars on account.

               He pushes money into Pinkus's hand and pushes him through 
               the door. Pinkus goes.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (into phone, 
                              desperately)
                         Will you wait, Olsen? I'll tell you 
                         in a minute!

               The door opens again and Pinkus comes back in.

                                     PINKUS
                         You forgot to tell me what a City 
                         Sealer has to do.

                                     MAYOR
                              (turning hastily toward 
                              Pinkus)
                         I'll explain it tomorrow!

                                     PINKUS
                         Is it hard?

                                     MAYOR
                         No! It's easy -- it's very easy!

                                     HARTMAN
                              (pleadingly, into 
                              phone)
                         Just one second --

                                     PINKUS
                         That's good, because my health ain't 
                         what it used to be.

                                     MAYOR
                              (pushing him out the 
                              door)
                         We'll fix that, too.
                              (he closes the door 
                              after him)

                                     HARTMAN
                              (into phone -- one 
                              more plea)
                         Just -- one -- second!

               He turns to the Mayor with a gesture of appeal. The Mayor 
               closes the door and turns to Hartman.

                                     MAYOR
                              (huskily)
                         All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.

                                     HARTMAN
                         What?

                                     MAYOR
                         Shoot to kill, I said.

                                     HARTMAN
                         I don't know, Fred. There's that 
                         reprieve if they ever find out.

                                     MAYOR
                         Nobody reprieved that policeman he 
                         murdered. Now, do as I tell you.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (into phone)
                         Hello, Olsen... Listen...
                              (his voice is weak)
                         Shoot to kill... That's the orders 
                         pass the word along... No! We dont 
                         want him! And listen, Olsen, five-
                         hundred bucks for the guy that does 
                         the job... Yes, I'll be right out 
                         there.
                              (hangs up)
                         Well, I hope that's the right thing 
                         to do.

                                     MAYOR
                         Now take that guilty look off your 
                         face, Pete -- and stop trembling 
                         like a horse.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (mopping his brow)
                         If we didn't have election Tuesday 
                         I'd have this on my conscience.

               INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT

               Louie comes from the direction of the stairs and crosses 
               toward door to Press Room. He pauses a moment, puts his hand 
               in his pocket, pulls out some bills, counts them and opens 
               the door.

               INT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT

               Hildy is still pacing, pounding her hands together and 
               glancing every so often at the clock on the wall. Suddenly 
               she crosses to her phone, picks up transmitter --

                                     HILDY
                              (into phone)
                         Will you try --

                                     LOUIE'S VOICE
                         Hildy.

                                     HILDY
                              (wheeling towards 
                              door)
                         Louie!

               She drops the phone and hurries towards him.

                                     HILDY
                         Have you got my dough?

                                     LOUIS
                         Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with 
                         it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?

                                     HILDY
                         Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut 
                         your throat if you try any tricks!

                                     LOUIS
                         All right, all right. You can't blame 
                         a guy for tryin', can you?

                                     HILDY
                         Come on with that money!

                                     LOUIS
                         First you got to sign a receipt.
                              (he pulls out a receipt)

                                     HILDY
                         Where's the money?

                                     LOUIS
                         Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right 
                         here.
                              (he picks out money 
                              and counts)
                         One hundred -- two hundred -- three 
                         hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. 
                         Now sign.

                                     HILDY
                              (grabs money and signs)
                         Here!

                                     LOUIS
                         Thanks. So long, Hildy!

                                     HILDY
                              (grabbing him)
                         So long, nothing! Where's Bruce 
                         Baldwin's wallet?

                                     LOUIS
                         Huh?

                                     HILDY
                         None of that innocent stuff, you 
                         double-crossing hyena! You stuck 
                         Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon 
                         on a phony charge that he swiped 
                         your watch, and you frisked his 
                         wallet! Now, give me that wallet or 
                         I'll stick you in jail and it won't 
                         be on any phony charge either! It'll 
                         be for life!

                                     LOUIS
                         Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't 
                         know what you're talking about -- 
                         but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?

               He takes Bruce's wallet out.

                                     HILDY
                              (grabbing it)
                         You know it is!

                                     LOUIS
                         I didn't frisk him. He must have 
                         dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't 
                         know whose it was.

                                     HILDY
                         No -- and you don't know that your 
                         cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin 
                         arrested again -- do you?

                                     LOUIS
                              (surprised)
                         What -- already? Why, the dame left 
                         only a minute before I did!

               He suddenly realizes what he's said and sprints for the door. 
               Hildy chucks something at him. It just misses as he ducks 
               out of the door.

               MED. SHOT ANOTHER ANGLE

               Hildy casts a savage look after the departed Louie, takes 
               another look at the clock and grabs a phone and starts to 
               dial.

                                     HILDY
                              (into phone)
                         27th Precinct Station House?

               Hildy stops short, arrested by a sound from the open window. 
               She turns and sees Earl Williams, looking more inoffensive 
               and exhausted than ever, indeed on the verge of collapse. He 
               carries a large revolver. The search-lights that have been 
               playing in the courtyard strike into the windows again.

                                     WILLIAMS
                              (pointing gun at her)
                         Drop that phone --

               Hildy drops the phone back on the hook.

                                     WILLIAMS
                              (supporting himself 
                              by holding on to 
                              edge of desk)
                         You're not going to phone anybody 
                         where I am.

                                     HILDY
                              (bracing herself)
                         Put down that gun, Earl.

               He advances steadily toward Hildy, the gun aimed at her.

                                     HILDY
                         You're not going to shoot me, Earl. 
                         I'm your friend, remember? I've got 
                         to write that story about your 
                         "Production for Use".

                                     WILLIAMS
                         Yes -- that's right. Production for 
                         use.

               Hildy starts walking toward him, slowly.

                                     HILDY
                         Earl, you don't want to hurt your 
                         friends, do you?

                                     WILLIAMS
                         Don't move!

               Hildy stops.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         Maybe you're my friend and maybe 
                         you're not -- but don't come any 
                         nearer. You can't trust anybody in 
                         this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I 
                         could shoot you from here.

                                     HILDY
                         Sure you could, Earl -- but you 
                         wouldn't want to do that, would you? 
                         You wouldn't want to kill anybody.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         No, no, you're right. I don't want 
                         to kill anybody. All I want to do is 
                         be let alone.

               Hildy sneaks another step forward.

                                     HILDY
                         Earl, there's just one thing I ought 
                         to clear up for the interview.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         What's that? Only -- you're getting 
                         too near. I don't trust anybody.

                                     HILDY
                         I don't blame you, Earl.
                              (another step forward)
                         If I were in your place I wouldn't 
                         trust anybody, either.

                                     WILLIAMS
                              (suddenly)
                         Keep away!

               He points the gun at Hildy, pulls the trigger and we hear a 
               faint "click!"

                                     WILLIAMS
                              (weakly)
                         I guess I used all the shells.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT

               He drops the gun and clutches at the edge of the desk for 
               support. Hildy lurches forward and she grabs the other side 
               of the desk for support. And at this moment she looks more 
               tired than he does. She looks at Earl and breathes heavily.

                                     HILDY
                         Earl, you must never do that again.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go 
                         through another day like this.

                                     HILDY
                              (more her old self 
                              now)
                         Well, maybe you think I could!

               CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she retrieves the gun and jams it in 
               her purse, jumps to the windows, pulls down the shades.

                                     EARL'S VOICE
                         I'm not afraid to die. I was tellin' 
                         the fella that when he handed me the 
                         gun.

               Hildy crosses swiftly to the door, locks it and puts out the 
               lights, so that they are visible only faintly in the light 
               from the areaway.

                                     HILDY
                         Don't talk too loud.

                                     WILLIAMS
                              (babbling on as she 
                              moves about)
                         Wakin' me up in the middle of the 
                         night -- talkin' to me about things 
                         they don't understand. Callin' me a 
                         Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's 
                         got nothin' to do with bombs. It's 
                         the philosophy that guarantees every 
                         man freedom. You see that, don't 
                         you?

                                     HILDY
                         Sure I do, Earl.

               Hildy is looking around for a hiding place for him.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         I wish they'd take me back and hang 
                         me. I done my best.

               He abruptly crumples and falls to the floor. Hildy stands 
               for a second, desperate. Then she picks him up and half 
               carries, half drags him over toward a chair and places him 
               in it. Then she makes a quick dash for her phone.

                                     HILDY
                              (into phone)
                         Hello... Gimme Walter Burns -- quick!

               Another phone there rings. Hildy answers it, propping the 
               receiver of her own phone between ear and shoulder.

               CLOSEUP HILDY AT PHONE

                                     HILDY
                              (into second phone)
                         Hello -- hel -- Oh, hello, Bruce... 
                         Oh, Bruce, please -- I know I said 
                         I'd be down in fifteen minutes, but 
                         something terrific's happened! Hang 
                         on, Bruce --
                              (into first phone)
                         Walter?... Hildy. Come over here -- 
                         right away!... Wait!
                              (into second phone)
                         Bruce, just a second, Bruce -- I'll 
                         explain everything.
                              (into first phone)
                         Walter! Get this: I've got Earl 
                         Williams... Yes! Here in the Press 
                         Room... Honest! On the level. Hurry -- 
                         I need you.

               She hangs up and turns into second phone.

                                     HILDY
                         Bruce, this is the biggest thing 
                         that ever happened...
                              (lowers voice)
                         I just captured Earl Williams -- you 
                         know -- the murderer --

               There is a knocking on the door, but she doesn't hear it.

                                     HILDY
                         Bruce, I'll be down -- Well, Bruce, 
                         the minute I turn him over to the 
                         paper I'll be right down. Bruce, 
                         don't you -- Bruce, I can't now -- I 
                         can't, don't you realize?

               There is a click from the phone. He has hung up. Hildy 
               dejectedly hangs up the phone. There is the sound of knocking 
               on the door. She springs up.

               MED. SHOT

               taking in door. Hildy glares apprehensively, then crosses to 
               it.

                                     HILDY
                              (cautiously)
                         Who's there?

                                     MOLLIE'S VOICE
                         It's me, Mollie Malloy! Let me in.

               Hildy carefully unlocks the door. Mollie bounds in like a 
               wildcat and seizes her.

                                     MOLLIE
                         Where are they gone? You know where 
                         they are?

                                     HILDY
                         Wait a minute, Mollie.

               She manages to relock the door, then turns, leaning against 
               it, facing Mollie.

               CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND MOLLIE

                                     MOLLIE
                         They got him surrounded some place -- 
                         gonna shoot him like a dog!

                                     HILDY
                         Mollie, they haven't got him. You 
                         gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to 
                         do something!

                                     MOLLIE
                         What do you mean?

               There is a sound -- a groan -- as Williams starts to come 
               to.

                                     MOLLIE
                              (spinning around)
                         What's that?

                                     HILDY
                         Quiet, Mollie!

                                     MOLLIE
                         There's somethin' funny going on 
                         around here.

               MED. SHOT

               Mollie crosses to wall and switches on the lights. She sees 
               Williams, sobs and rushes over to him.

               CLOSEUP EARL AND MOLLIE

               Mollie gets down on her knees and begins ministering to Earl. 
               He opens his eyes.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         Hello, Mollie.

               Mollie begins to sob.

               WIDER ANGLE SHOT

               Hildy comes over and says:

                         Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing

                         How'd you get here, Earl?

                         Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to 
                         shoot him. You believe me, don't 
                         you, Mollie?

                              (coming up)
                         Of course I believe you.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         I forgot to thank you for those roses. 
                         They were beautiful.

                                     MOLLIE
                         That's all right, Mr. Williams...
                              (to Hildy)
                         You're a woman. You got to help us. 
                         You got to get him out of here, some 
                         place where I can take care of him.

                                     HILDY
                         Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. 
                         I'm trying to think of something 
                         before those reporters get back.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         Let 'em take me. It's better that 
                         way.

                         No -- I'll never let 'em!

               The door is tried outside.

                                     MOLLIE
                         They'll get him! They'll get him!

                         Mollie, I got it!

               MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DESK

               Hildy jumps in to the desk and opens it, turning to cry in a 
               tense whisper to Earl:

                                     HILDY
                         Can you get in this desk?

               Wilson is there too, now, and he and Endicott are pounding 
               on the door.

               INT. PRESS ROOM HILDY, MOLLIE AND EARL

               Mollie and Earl are with Hildy in front of desk now. They 
               are speaking in whispers.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         What good'll it do?

                         They'll find me anyhow.

               There is further and louder pounding on the door. Earl gets 
               in the desk. Hildy and Mollie pull the roll-top down over 
               him.

                                     HILDY

                         Mollie, drop down here! You've 
                         fainted!

                         What's the idea?

                                     HILDY
                         Never mind! Just play dead.

               Hildy rapidly unbuttons Mollie's waist and throws it back. 
               The kicking at the door continues.

               MED. SHOT

               Hildy rushes over to windows and pulls up the shades. Mollie 
               is lying quietly on the floor with her eyes closed. Hildy 
               rushes over to water cooler and gets a paper cup full of 
               water. She throws the water in Mollie's face.

                                     MOLLIE

                         Shut up, you!

               Hildy crosses swiftly to the door.

               INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR

               The door opens in Endicott's face and there is Miss Johnson, 
               quite cool.

                         Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got 
                         calls to make, you know.

                         Run down and get some smelling salts, 
                         will you?

                         Smelling salts! What's going on here?

               They catch sight of Mollie, stretched out on the floor.

                              enter room)
                         Came up here -- had hysterics and 
                         passed out. I've been trying to get 
                         her to come to.

               Mollie is shaking her head.

                         She looks as though she's going to 
                         come to.

                         It's easy for you to talk. You're 
                         retired. We're still working.

                                     MCCUE
                         Okay.
                              (into phone)
                         Forget it.
                              (he hangs up)

                                     HILDY
                         What's the matter with you boys? 
                         Afraid it might rain? If you want to 
                         go, I'll cover this end.

                                     MURPHY
                         Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound 
                         pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are 
                         you trying to scoop us or something?

                                     ENDICOTT
                         Something smells around here. If you 
                         ask me Mollie gave her the story on 
                         how Williams got that gun.
                              (turning on Mollie)
                         Did you smuggle that gun into 
                         Williams, Mollie?

                                     MOLLIE
                         I didn't do nothin'.

                                     MCCUE
                              (crossing to Mollie)
                         Come clean, Mollie.

               Wilson, Endicott and Murphy follow McCue toward Hildy.

                                     ENDICOTT
                         Better let us in on it, Mollie.

                                     HILDY
                         Aw, why don't you let her alone? 
                         She's ill!

                                     MURPHY
                         Oh, you two are pals now -- I think 
                         you're right, Endicott. Mollie did 
                         give her some kind of story.

                                     ENDICOTT
                         I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We 
                         better hold onto 'em both.

               At this point Mrs. Baldwin appears in the doorway. Hildy 
               gasps and starts for her.

               MED. SHOT AT DOOR

               Mrs. Baldwin is in a very righteous mood.

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                         Well?

               CLOSE SHOT HILDY

               as she comes in to her.

                                     HILDY
                         Mother!

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                         Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and-
                         mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him 
                         looked up -- making us miss two trains -- 
                         and supposed to be married tomorrow!

                                     HILDY
                         Mother, I can explain everything. 
                         I'll go with you in five minutes and --

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                         You don't have to go with me at all! 
                         Just give me my son's money and you 
                         can stay here forever as far as I'm 
                         concerned. Stay with that murderer 
                         you caught!

               CLOSE SHOT REPORTERS

               as they get this. Reactions as they glance at one another.

                                     MRS. BALDWIN'S VOICE
                              (continuing)
                         Which one of these men is it? They 
                         all look like murderers to me!

                                     MURPHY
                         Where does she get that stuff?

                                     SCHWARTZ
                         Shall we tell her what she looks 
                         like?

                                     ENDICOTT
                         Wait a minute! What murderer did you 
                         catch, Hildy?

               MED. SHOT GROUP

               The reporters are looking intently at Hildy and Mrs. Baldwin.

                                     HILDY
                         I don't know what she's talking about. 
                         I never said any such thing.

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                         I'm quoting my son, and he has never 
                         lied to me.

               The reporters move toward Hildy and Mrs. Baldwin speaking 
               simultaneously.

                                     REPORTERS
                         I knew something stunk around here -- 
                         Who says she caught him --? What do 
                         you mean she caught a murderer --? 
                         etc.

                                     HILDY
                              (desperately)
                         But I never said anything like that!

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                         Yes, you did!

               CLOSEUP MOLLIE

                                     MOLLIE
                         She never told her that!

               MED. CLOSE SHOT GROUP

                                     HILDY
                         I said I was trying to catch one.
                              (to Mrs. Baldwin)
                         You got it balled up, Mother.

               CLOSE SHOT

               taking in Mollie, with Murphy coming into scene to her.

                                     MURPHY
                         What do you know about it? How do 
                         you know she didn't?

               He grabs her cruelly by an arm.

                                     MOLLIE
                         Let go!

               Endicott comes into scene.

                                     ENDICOTT
                         Hold on to her, Jimmy -- she's in 
                         with Hildy on this.

               CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND MRS. BALDWIN

               Hildy tense with anxiety, her eyes on Mollie, off. Murphy 
               comes viciously into scene to her and jerks Hildy by an arm.

                                     MURPHY
                         Who you holding out on? Come clean, 
                         or we'll make you wish you had --

               MED. SHOT

               as the rest of the reporters surround Hildy menacingly.

                                     ENDICOTT
                              (to Hildy)
                         Hildy, are you gonna cross us for 
                         Walter Burns after the way you told 
                         him off?

                                     WILSON
                         Give in, Hildy -- you can't get away 
                         with it.

               CLOSEUP MOLLIE

               AS SHE CRIES WILDLY:

                                     MOLLIE
                         Wait! You stool-pigeons! She don't 
                         know where Williams is. I'm the one 
                         that knows.

               SHOT OF REPORTERS

               as they turn on Mollie.

                                     ENDICOTT
                         What do you mean, you know?

               They start for Mollie.

               MED. SHOT

               Mollie begins backing slowly around the table, away from 
               them, toward the window.

                                     MOLLIE
                         Go find out, you heels! You don't 
                         think I'm gonna tell!

               CLOSEUP HILDY

               who has remained riveted at desk.

                                     HILDY
                         Let her alone! She's goofy!

               MOLLIE AND REPORTERS

               Hemmed in by the massed reporters, she makes a sudden lunge 
               for the door.

                                     REPORTERS
                         Look out! Close that door! etc., 
                         etc.

               They split, some of them heading her off at door, others 
               from opposite side of table, so that she runs back between 
               window and table.

                                     MCCUE
                         You ain't gettin' out o' here!

                                     ENDICOTT
                         Now, where is he?

                                     WILSON
                         Where you hidin' him?

                                     MOLLIE
                         I ain't gonna squeal! I ain't goin' 
                         to!

                                     MURPHY
                              (leaning across table)
                         Come on, you! Before we slap you 
                         down.

                                     ENDICOTT
                         Do you want us to call the cops and 
                         have them give you the boots?

                                     MURPHY
                         Where is he, before we beat it out 
                         of you?

                                     MOLLIE
                              (backing)
                         Don't you come near me, you kidney 
                         foot!

               Murphy continues to advance on her. The reporters start for 
               her from the other side. Mollie snatches up a chair and swings 
               it at the advancing circle of men.

                                     MOLLIE
                              (wild and blubbering)
                         Let me alone or I'll knock your heads 
                         off!

                                     ENDICOTT
                         Put down that chair!

                         Get around -- get on the side of 
                         her.

                                     MOLLIE
                              (still backing)
                         No, you don't!
                              (a scream)
                         Keep away!

                         Grab her!

               With a last, wild look at her encircling foes.

                                     MOLLIE
                         You'll never get it out of me!
                              (hurls chair at them)
                         I'll never tell! Never!

               She makes a desperate leap for the open window and disappears 
               out. Her scream of terror is heard as she drops. THEN RUSH 
               FORWARD TO:

               CLOSE SHOT AT WINDOW

               as the reporters rush in and look out, an assortment of awed 
               and astonished exclamations rising from them.

               CLOSE SHOT MRS. BALDWIN

               She turns away from the window and hides her face in her 
               hands.

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                         Take me out of here! Take me --

                         Oh-h --

               She collapses to a chair.

                              (turning)
                         Come on, fellas.

               They start in a rush for the door.

               MED. SHOT AT DOOR AND DESK

               as the reporters rush out, and Hildy crosses, dazed to the 
               window.

                                     HILDY
                         Gee! The poor kid... the poor kid.

               Reaching the window, she looks out.

               EXT. PAVEMENT SHOOTING DOWN FROM HILDY'S ANGLE

               The form of Mollie on the pavement below moves slightly in 
               the moonlight, as guards rush into scene to her.

               INT. PRESS ROOM SHOOTING INTO ROOM FROM WINDOW

               Hildy turns, shaken, back into the room from the window and 
               sees advancing to her across the room Walter Burns. Diamond 
               Louie has entered with the Boss and stands leaning by the 
               door. Mrs. Baldwin's face is still hidden by her hands. Hildy 
               starts for Burns.

                                     HILDY
                         Walter! D-did you see --
                              (gesturing back to 
                              window)
                         -- that?

                         Yes. Where is he?

                              (comes in to him)
                         She jumped out of the window.

                                     BURNS
                         I know. Where is he, I said.

               CLOSE SHOT MRS. BALDWIN

               looking up at them, off.

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                         What are you doing?

                         I won't shut up! That girl killed 
                         herself. Oh-h, you're doing something 
                         wrong. What's in that desk?

               CLOSE AT DESK - TAKING IN LOUIE AT THE DOOR

               Burns slams closed the desk and steps to Louie.

                         Mike's and lock her up. See that she 
                         doesn't take to anyone on the way.

               CLOSE SHOT GROUP

               as Louie comes in to Mrs. Baldwin.

                                     HILDY
                         Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do 
                         that!

                                     LOUIE
                              (extending his hand 
                              as if to shake hands 
                              with Mrs. Baldwin)
                         My name is Louis Peluso.

               Unluckily for her she responds, only to find herself jerked 
               to her feet and spun around so that one of Louie's arms is 
               about her waist and the other hand over her mouth. Louie 
               starts her to door.

               TRUCKING SHOT

               with them -- Hildy catching up.

                                     HILDY
                         Now, let go of her, Louie. Listen, 
                         Walter, this'll get me in a terrible 
                         jam with my fiancée and I don't stand 
                         so well with him now. Don't worry, 
                         Mother, this is only temporary.

               At the door, Louie gets Mrs. Baldwin out and disappears with 
               her. Hildy starts after them, when Burns' arm comes into 
               scene, catching her.

               CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY

                         Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce 
                         out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you 
                         have to do this to me?

                                     BURNS
                              (scornfully)
                         Get Bruce out of jail! How can you 
                         worry about a man who's resting 
                         comfortably in a quiet police station 
                         while this is going on? Hildy, this 
                         is war! You can't desert now!

                                     HILDY
                         Oh, get off that trapeze!
                              (indicating desk, off)
                         There's your story! Smear it all 
                         over the front page -- Earl Williams 
                         caught by the Morning Post! And take 
                         all the credit -- I covered your 
                         story for you and I got myself in a 
                         fine mess doing it -- and now I'm 
                         getting out! I know I told you that 
                         twice before today -- but this time 
                         I mean it!

                                     BURNS
                         You drooling idiot! What do you mean, 
                         you're getting out! There are three 
                         hundred and sixty-five days in the 
                         year one can get married -- but how 
                         many times have you got a murderer 
                         locked up in a desk? -- Once in a 
                         lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole 
                         city by the seat of the pants!

                              (interrupting)
                         You know! You've got the brain of a 
                         pancake! That wasn't just a story 
                         you covered -- it was a revolution! 
                         Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in 
                         journalism since Livingstone 
                         discovered Stanley for the New York 
                         Herald!

                              (slightly bewildered)
                         Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley 
                         who discovered Livingstone?

                                     BURNS
                         Don't get technical at a time like 
                         this! Do you realize what you've 
                         done? You've taken a city that's 
                         been graft-ridden for forty years 
                         under the same old gang and with 
                         this yarn you're kicking 'em out and 
                         giving us a chance to have the same 
                         kind of government that New York's 
                         having under La Guardia! We'll make 
                         such monkeys out of these ward-heelers 
                         next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for 
                         them -- not even their wives!

                         I'd like to think.

                         Well, think it then, because it's 
                         true! We'll crucify that mob. We're 
                         going to keep Williams under cover 
                         till morning so the Post can break 
                         the story exclusive. Then we'll let 
                         the Governor in on the capture -- 
                         share the glory with him.

                         You've kicked over the whole City 
                         Hall like an apple-cart. You've got 
                         the Mayor and Hartman backed against 
                         a wall. You've put one administration 
                         out and another in. This isn't a 
                         newspaper story -- it's a career! 
                         And you stand there belly-aching 
                         about whether you catch an eight 
                         o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! 
                         Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all 
                         you are.

                                     HILDY
                         Let me get at that typewriter and 
                         I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg 
                         can write!

                         Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming 
                         streets after you -- Hildy Johnson 
                         Street! There'll be statues of you 
                         in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be 
                         after you -- the movies!

                         By tomorrow morning I'll betcha 
                         there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can 
                         see the billboards now. Light up 
                         with Hildy Johnson!

                         Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave 
                         Williams here. One of the other 
                         fellows'll --

                         That one -- how you gonna take him? 
                         They'll see him.

                         Not if he's inside the desk. We'll 
                         carry the desk over.

                         You can't take that desk out. It's 
                         crawling with cops outside.

                                     BURNS

                         and start pounding out a load, will 
                         you? Snap into it!

                         Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey --

               CLOSE SHOT HILDY

               Having opened the drawers of Bensinger's desk, she is tossing 
               play manuscripts, syringes, patent medicines and old socks 
               into the air, in a frantic search for paper.

                                     HILDY
                              (calling to Burns)
                         How about the time he had his house 
                         painted by the Fire Department?

                         Give him the works.
                              (into phone)
                         Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the 
                         biggest story in the world. Earl 
                         Williams caught by the Morning Post -- 
                         exclusive!

               TWO SHOT HILDY AND BURNS

               Hildy has unearthed a package of Bensinger's private 
               stationary. She rises with it.

                                     BURNS
                              (to Hildy)
                         Fine!
                              (into phone)
                         Now, listen, Duffy -- I want you to 
                         tear out the whole front page... 
                         That's what I said -- the whole front 
                         page! Never mind the European war! 
                         We've got something a whole lot bigger 
                         than that. Hildy Johnson's writing 
                         the lead and I'll phone it over to 
                         you as soon as she's finished.
                              (he starts to hang 
                              up, then thinks of 
                              something else)
                         Oh, Duffy! Get hold of Butch O'Connor 
                         and tell him I want him to come up 
                         here with half a dozen other wrestlers -- 
                         right away! Tell him we'll run his 
                         picture on the sport page for two 
                         weeks straight. What? I've got a 
                         desk I want moved. Never mind what 
                         desk!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. STREET NIGHT MED. LONG SHOT

               as the taxi darts through traffic, narrowly avoiding cars, 
               trucks, etc., it comes almost head-on to an oncoming car.

               INT. TAXICAB - NIGHT - PROCESS CLOSE SHOT

               Louie, worried, ducks unconsciously. Mrs. Baldwin faints 
               across his lap.

               EXT. STREET MED. LONG SHOT

               The taxi swerves just in time to duck the oncoming car. As 
               it starts forward again a truck comes toward the cab, head 
               on.

               INT. TAXICAB - PROCESS CLOSE SHOT

               Diamond Louie pushes Mrs. Baldwin into an upright position, 
               takes a look through the windshield, sees the truck and gives 
               a big "takem" and faints across Mrs. Baldwin.

               EXT. STREET MED. SHOT

               The truck and taxicab crash and the screen blacks out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT CLOSE SHOT HILDY

               at typewriter, smoke rising from her cigarette. As the CAMERA 
               ANGLE WIDENS we see a fairly disheveled Hildy typing away 
               furiously.

                                     BURNS' VOICE
                              (Into phone)
                         "The Blackest cesspool in American 
                         city life!" Hold on Duffy, I'll see 
                         if she's got any more.

               Burns comes into the scene, tears a page out of Hildy's 
               typewriter. She inserts another one without noticing.

               MED. SHOT

               Burns goes back to the phone as Hildy continues to type 
               furiously.

                                     BURNS
                              (into phone)
                         Duffy -- Duffy!
                              (clicking the phone 
                              furiously)
                         Operator! Operator! Get me Duffy 
                         back. Somebody cut us off!

               ANOTHER ANGLE FAVORING DOOR

               as Bruce Baldwin enters.

                                     BRUCE
                         Hildy!

                                     BURNS
                         What the devil do you want? Listen, 
                         Bruce, you can't come in here now! 
                         We're busy!
                              (suddenly, into phone)
                         Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! 
                         What? What Chinese earthquake? The 
                         deuce with it... what's that?

               CLOSE SHOT HILDY

               typing away madly. Bruce comes into the scene.

                                     BRUCE
                         Hildy!

                                     HILDY
                              (looking up, very 
                              casually)
                         Hello, Bruce...

               She resumes her typing, then suddenly realizes the situation 
               and jumps up.

                                     HILDY
                         BRUCE!! How'd you get out?

                                     BRUCE
                              (the hands-off attitude)
                         Not through any help of yours, Hildy.

                                     HILDY
                         Bruce, I know, but I was in the 
                         biggest jam --

                                     BURNS' VOICE
                         Hildy!

               MED. SHOT

               As Hildy turns toward his voice, Burns, still with the phone 
               in his hand, keeps talking to her.

                                     BURNS
                         For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're 
                         waiting for the rest of that story!

                                     HILDY
                              (resignedly)
                         Okay, Walter.
                              (sits down at her 
                              typewriter again)

               CLOSE TWO SHOT BRUCE AND HILDY

               Hildy begins typing again.

                                     BRUCE
                         I waited and waited and then I had 
                         an idea and wired Albany to send me 
                         a hundred dollars so I could get out 
                         on bail...
                              (desperately)
                         I don't know what they'll think -- 
                         they sent it to the police station!

                                     HILDY
                              (she barely stops 
                              typing)
                         We'll explain the whole thing to 
                         them.
                              (resumes typing)

                                     BRUCE
                         I know I got you into this, Hildy, 
                         but it does seem to me that you can't 
                         care much for me if you're willing 
                         to let me stay locked up for two 
                         hours.

                                     HILDY
                         Bruce, you know I'm mad about you 
                         and stop talking like that.
                              (calling o.s. to Walter)
                         Walter!

                         Take the President's speech and run 
                         it on the funny page...
                              (turns to Hildy, o.s.)
                         What is it, Hildy?

                                     HILDY'S VOICE
                         What was the name of the Mayor's 
                         first wife?

                                     BURNS
                         You mean the one who drank so much? 
                         Tillie!

                                     HILDY
                         Thanks.
                              (she types furiously)

               CLOSE SHOT THE DESK

               Its top opens slowly and Williams' head sticks out.

               CLOSEUP BURNS INCLUDING DESK IN B.G

                                     BURNS

                         Get back in there, you mock turtle!

               The desk-top falls, the fugitive disappearing within.

               CLOSEUP BRUCE

               turning around toward Burns.

                                     BRUCE
                         Did you say anything, Mister Burns?

               CLOSEUP BURNS

               covering up, fast.

                                     BURNS
                         No -- I was just talking to one of 
                         the guys at the office.
                              (indicating phone in 
                              his hand)

               MED. CLOSE SHOT BRUCE AND HILDY

                                     BRUCE
                              (to Burns)
                         Oh.
                              (turns to Hildy)
                         I wonder what's keeping mother? She 
                         was supposed to come down and get 
                         you.

                                     HILDY
                         Oh, she was here.

                                     BRUCE
                         Where'd she go?

                                     HILDY
                         Out some place.

               She types away. Bruce grabs her and stops her.

                                     BRUCE
                         Hildy! Where's mother?

                                     HILDY
                         Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know 
                         where she went.

                                     BRUCE
                         Did you give her the money?

                                     HILDY
                         No, I was going to give it to her -- 
                         but she left hurriedly.

                                     BRUCE
                         Then suppose you give me the money. 
                         Four hundred and fifty dollars.

                                     HILDY
                         Oh, yes. Here it is.

               She gets the wallet. Burns comes into the scene and pulls 
               another page out of her machine.

                                     HILDY
                         Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- 
                         three -- four hundred -- and fifty 
                         dollars.

                                     BRUCE
                              (drily)
                         Thank you.

                         And I'll take that certified check, 
                         too. I've decided I can handle things 
                         around here...

                                     BURNS
                         Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep 
                         going! Sorry, Bruce, but --

                                     HILDY
                         Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, 
                         here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, 
                         here's your wallet. I got it back.

                                     BRUCE

                         You got it back, eh? There's something 
                         funny going on around here.

                         Hildy!

                                     HILDY
                         All right, Walter.

               She sits down and begins to type.

                                     BRUCE
                         I'm taking the nine o'clock train, 
                         Hildy. And you can meet us at the 
                         station.

                                     HILDY
                         Fine.

               She types away.

                                     BURNS
                              (coming over to Bruce)
                         I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise 
                         you.

                                     BRUCE
                              (dramatically)
                         If she's not there, mother and I are 
                         leaving anyhow!

               But Hildy continues typing and doesn't even get it.

               as he leads Bruce away toward door.

                                     BURNS
                         I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've 
                         got to forgive her. She's only a 
                         woman, after all.

                                     BRUCE
                         Suppose she is -- I have feelings, 
                         too! Do you know where I've been for 
                         the last couple of hours? Locked up 
                         in a police station and she didn't 
                         move to do anything about it.

                                     BURNS
                         Ts! Ts! Ts!

                                     BRUCE
                         And now I don't know where my mother 
                         is. She may be lost.

                                     BURNS
                         I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to 
                         put every detective in the city on 
                         the job. Tell you what -- go over to 
                         the Missing Persons Bureau and 
                         describe your mother. What does she 
                         look like?

                                     BRUCE
                         She's -- well, she's very motherly. 
                         That's about the best description I 
                         know.

                                     BURNS
                              (nodding)
                         That's the kind of stuff they want!

               They go out the door.

               as they come out.

                                     BURNS
                         Oh, Bruce, let me see that money 
                         Hildy gave you.

                                     BRUCE
                         The money? Why?

                                     BURNS
                         There's a lot of counterfeit big 
                         bills going around.

                                     BRUCE
                              (worried)
                         Gee! Take a look, will you?

               He hands the money to Burns. Burns looks at it carefully and 
               hands it back.

                                     BURNS
                         Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just 
                         wanted to be sure.

                                     BRUCE
                         Say, I want to be sure, too!

               INT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT

               Hildy is typing furiously. Burns enters, grinning, locks the 
               door behind him and goes to phone and picks it up.

                                     BURNS
                              (into phone)
                         Duffy. Good. Stick close.

               He turns and crosses quickly to look out the window.

               Burns coming in to window.

                                     BURNS
                              (despairingly)
                         Now the moon's out!

               He turns away, crossing to the desk, the CAMERA TRUCKING 
               with him. At the desk he taps three times, being answered by 
               three taps from within.

                                     BURNS
                         Fine. Three taps is me. Don't forget! 
                         You're sitting pretty, now. Got enough 
                         air?

               He raises top an inch or two and fans air in to Williams.

                                     BURNS
                         Is that better? Now breathe deep!

               We hear an intake of breath from inside the desk.

                                     BURNS
                         Attaboy!

               He closes the desk and turns back to the table. As he passes 
               Hildy, who is still typing rapidly:

                                     BURNS

                         That's the stuff! Lam it into 'em, 
                         Hildy.

               He jerks the sheet from Hildy's machine, crosses to his desk 
               and picks up the phone.

                                     BURNS

               At the end of the hall are glass doors through which can be 
               seen a turmoil of activity in the street outside -- newsboys, 
               a crowd, and a mounted policeman or two. Bruce comes down 
               the hall, his face set and angry. As he goes, he sees a sign 
               set over a doorway in the hall. It reads: MISSING PERSONS 
               BUREAU. He stops and enters.

                              (deeply moved)
                         Oh, did you -- care for the poem, 
                         Mr. Burns?

                                     BURNS
                              (startled)
                         The poem?... The poem was great!

                                     BENSINGER
                              (blinking at these 
                              words)
                         Remember the ending?
                              (and he recites)
                         " -- and all is well, outside his 
                         cell, But in his heart he hears the 
                         hangman Calling and the gallows 
                         falling And his white-haired mother's 
                         tears..."

                                     BURNS
                              (overcome)
                         Heartbreaking! How would you like to 
                         work for me?

                                     BENSINGER
                         What?

               MEDIUM SHOT

               taking in table, Hildy typing there.

                                     BURNS
                              (to Bensinger)
                         We need somebody like you. All we've 
                         got now are a lot of low-brows. Like 
                         Johnson here.

               He starts shoving Bensinger away from the desk, toward the 
               table.

                                     BENSINGER
                         Seriously, Mr. Burns?

               Clinging to him, Burns takes him to the phone.

                                     BURNS
                              (into phone)
                         Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to 
                         see you.
                              (looking up at 
                              Bensinger)
                         Mervyn, isn't it?

                                     BENSINGER
                         No. Roy. Roy V.

                                     BURNS
                              (with a little laugh 
                              at his own 
                              forgetfulness)
                         Of course!
                              (into phone)
                         Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course 
                         you wouldn't know! You probably never 
                         heard of Shakespeare, either! Put 
                         Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.
                              (to Bensinger)
                         How much are you getting on the 
                         Tribune, Roy?

                                     BENSINGER
                         Seventy-five.

                                     BURNS
                         I'll give you a hundred and a by-
                         line.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               as Burns continues.

                                     BURNS
                              (into phone)
                         Let him have everything he wants.
                              (puts down the 
                              receiver; turns to 
                              Bensinger)
                         Now hustle and write me a story from 
                         the point of view of the escaped 
                         man.
                              (acting it out)
                         He hides, cowering... Afraid of every 
                         light, of every sound... hears 
                         footsteps... his heart going like 
                         that... And all the time they're 
                         closing in... Get the sense of an 
                         animal at bay!

                                     BENSINGER
                         Sort of a Jack London style?

               TRUCKING SHOT

                                     BURNS
                         Exactly!

               Leads him hurriedly to the door.

                                     BENSINGER
                         I got my rhyming dictionary in --
                              (indicating desk)

                                     BURNS
                              (getting him to door)
                         It doesn't have to rhyme!

               CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR

               as Bensinger turns there.

                                     BENSINGER
                         Gee, I'm terribly grateful, Mister 
                         Burns. Do you suppose there might be 
                         an opening some time as foreign 
                         correspondent? I parley a little 
                         French, you know.

               Burns shakes hands with him and opens the door with the other 
               hand.

                                     BURNS
                         I'll keep you in mind.

                                     BENSINGER
                              (going)
                         Au revoir, mon capitaine.

                                     BURNS
                              (never at a loss in 
                              any language)
                         Bon jour!

               Continuing his French, he gets the door closed and relocked 
               and turns for the table, singing as he does so:

                                     BURNS
                         Mademoiselle from Armontieres, parlay --

               MED. SHOT

               Burns returns alertly to table, not noticing that Hildy has 
               stopped typing, and sits staring moodily before her.

                                     BURNS
                              (into phono)

                         A rat from the Tribune is coming 
                         over to get a job -- Bensinger, the 
                         guy I told you about. Handle him 
                         with kid gloves. Tell him to get 
                         busy writing poetry... No, we don't 
                         want him. Stall him along until the 
                         extra comes out. Then tell him his 
                         poetry stinks and kick him downstairs.

               He lays down receiver.

               WIDER ANGLE

               taking in Hildy. She looks up at him.

                                     HILDY
                              (to Burns)
                         Double-crossing swine!

                                     BURNS
                         You said it! But this'll teach him a 
                         lesson. He won't quit his paper 
                         without giving notice after this.

               Hildy doesn't bother to reply. She rests her chin on her 
               hands and stares moodily ahead.

                                     BURNS
                         Tear into it, will you? Don't sit 
                         there like a frozen robin!

                                     HILDY
                         I'm finished.

                                     BURNS
                         Finished!

               He grabs the last sheet of paper out of her typewriter, kisses 
               her and rushes over to the telephone.

               EXT. CRIMINAL COURTS BLDG. - NIGHT MED. SHOT

               Diamond Louie, bearing evidence of a mishap, his hat crushed, 
               his face bruised and his clothes torn, comes running down 
               the sidewalk and up the steps into the buildings.

               INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT MED. SHOT

               Hildy is up now, pacing.

                                     HILDY
                         Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, 
                         you're not trying anything again, 
                         are you?

                                     BURNS
                              (coming over to her)
                         Hildy, you think I could? After this 
                         story?
                              (taking a flask from 
                              his pocket)
                         Here! You're just nervous.

               Hildy takes the flask and takes a drink. There is a knock on 
               the door. Burns takes the flask from her, restores it to his 
               pocket and goes to the door.

                                     BURNS
                         Who is it?

                         It's Louie!

               Louie slips in and Burns relocks the door.

                         What's the matter?

               Hildy crosses to Louie.

                         of the street.

                              (confidentially)
                         If Louie doesn't come back in five 
                         minutes we'll get it out alone. 
                         There's millions of ways. We can 
                         start a fire and get the firemen to 
                         carry it out in the confusion.

               He crosses to the desk and inspects it.

                                     HILDY
                              (into phone)
                         Ring that number, will you?

                                     BURNS
                              (to Hildy, oblivious 
                              of her telephoning)
                         Come here. See if we can move it.

                                     HILDY
                              (into phone)
                         Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- 
                         In Hospital? Did you have an auto 
                         accident in the last --

                                     BURNS
                              (interrupting)
                         Will you come here?

                                     HILDY
                              (into phone)
                         Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.

                                     BURNS
                         When I'm surrounded, with my back 
                         against the wall, you're not going 
                         to lay down on me, are you --

                                     HILDY
                         Yes.

               She jiggles the phone hook.

                                     BURNS
                              (going to her)
                         Hildy, you just can't leave me out 
                         on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be 
                         cricket!

                                     HILDY
                         I don't care what you say. I'm going 
                         to find Bruce's mother.
                              (she jiggles the hook 
                              madly)
                         Oh-h...
                              (she hangs up)
                         I'm going out and find her!

               Grabbing her hat and purse, she starts for the door.

               MED. SHOT OF HILDY, TAKING IN DOOR

               There is a loud knocking on the door.

                                     BURNS
                              (coming into scene 
                              after Hildy)
                         Don't open that!

                                     HILDY
                              (at the door)
                         Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- 
                         to look --

               She unlocks the door.

               CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR

               as Hildy flings the door open, only to find the Sheriff, 
               accompanied by two deputies -- Carl and Frank -- and 
               surrounded by McCue, Murphy, Schwartz, Wilson and Endicott.

                                     MURPHY
                         There she is!

                                     MCCUE
                         Say, Hildy...

               Hildy makes a decision and tries to push through them, but 
               the Sheriff grabs her and pushes her back.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Just a minute, Johnson!

                                     HILDY
                         Let go o' me. What's the idea?

                                     MCCUE
                         What's your hurry?

                                     MURPHY
                         We want to see you.

               The deputies seize her.

                                     HILDY
                         Take your paws off me!

                                     HARTMAN
                         Hold her, boys!

               Burns comes into scene.

                                     BURNS
                              (to Sheriff)
                         Who do you think you are, breaking 
                         in here like this?

                                     HARTMAN
                         You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't 
                         care who you are or what paper you're 
                         editor of.

                                     HILDY
                              (struggling)
                         Let me go!
                              (hysterically)
                         Fellows, something's happened to my 
                         mother-in-law.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Hang onto her! Keep her in here!

               MED. SHOT

               as Hildy breaks loose and retreats back into the room before 
               Hartman and the deputies.

                                     MCCUE
                         We know what you're up to.

                                     ENDICOTT
                         Probably goin' out to get Williams.

                                     SCHWARTZ
                         The door was locked.

                                     WILSON
                         She and Mollie were talking.

                                     HILDY
                         I don't know anything, I tell you. 
                         There's been an accident.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Johnson, there's something very 
                         peculiar going on.

                                     HILDY
                         You can send somebody with me if you 
                         don't believe me!

                                     HARTMAN
                         I wasn't born yesterday. Now the 
                         boys tell me you and this Mollie 
                         Malloy --

                                     HILDY
                         Nobody's trying to put anything over 
                         on you. I'm getting out of here and 
                         you can't stop me!

                                     MURPHY
                              (comes into scene)
                         You're not going anywhere.
                              (to the Sheriff)
                         She's got the story sewed up, Pete.
                              (indicating Burns)
                         That's why Burns is here.

                                     SCHWARTZ
                         We're on to you, Hildy. Let us in on 
                         it.

               TWO SHOT - SHERIFF AND BURNS

                                     BURNS
                              (purring)
                         If you've any accusations to make, 
                         Hartman, make them in the proper 
                         manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask 
                         you to get out.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (pop-eyed; stammering)
                         You'll ask me to what?

                                     BURNS
                         Get out!

                                     HARTMAN
                              (to deputies, off)
                         Close that door. Don't let anybody 
                         in or out.

               MED. SHOT - THE GROUP

                                     MURPHY
                         Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little 
                         third degree.

                                     ENDICOTT
                         Make them talk and you got Williams, 
                         Pinky!

                                     HARTMAN
                         Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of 
                         this. What do you know about Williams? 
                         Are you going to talk or aren't you?

                                     HILDY
                         What do I know about Williams?

                                     HARTMAN
                         All right, boys. Take her along. I 
                         got ways of making her talk.

               The deputies seize Hildy. She struggles.

                                     HILDY
                         Look out, you --

                                     MCCUE
                              (nervously)
                         What's the use of fighting, Hildy?

               Hildy manages to get in a few resounding smacks on the 
               deputies' faces. The reporters swarm around the struggling 
               trio. There are shouts of: "I got her!" "No, you don't!" 
               "Aw, Hildy...", etc. In the struggle, Hildy suddenly drops 
               her purse. It lands with a clank and comes open. A gun is 
               revealed on the floor. Hildy picks it up.

                                     DEPUTIES
                         Hey, she's got a gun! Look out, she's 
                         got a gun!

               The deputies and reporters start to close in on her 
               cautiously.

                                     HILDY
                              (trying to face in 
                              all directions)
                         No, you don't! Walter!

                                     BURNS
                         What is it? Here!

               She tosses the gun to Walter, but one of the deputies 
               intercepts the throw.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Gimme that.

               He takes the gun from the deputy.

               CLOSER SHOT

               The Sheriff stands frozen, staring at the gun.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (to Hildy)
                         Where'd you get this?

                                     HILDY
                         I've got a right to carry a gun if I 
                         want to.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Not this gun!

               Burns comes into scene.

                                     BURNS
                              (easily)
                         I can explain that, Hartman. When 
                         Hildy told me she wanted to interview 
                         Earl Williams I thought it might be 
                         dangerous and I gave her a gun to 
                         defend herself.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very 
                         interesting. This happens to be the 
                         gun that Earl Williams shot his way 
                         out with!

                                     REPORTERS AD LIB
                         What? What's that? Etc...

                                     BURNS
                              (advancing on Sheriff)
                         Are you trying to make me out a liar?

                                     MURPHY
                              (bitterly at Hildy)
                         It's the last time I ever trust a 
                         woman, Hildy.

                                     SCHWARTZ
                         Maybe Williams was gonna be her best 
                         man.

                                     WILSON
                         That's pretty rotten, Hildy. Crossing 
                         your own pals.

                              (shoving up to Hildy; 
                              trembling)
                         Where is Earl Williams? Where you 
                         got him?

                                     BURNS
                              (sympathetically)
                         You're barking up the wrong tree, 
                         Hartman.

                                     HARTMAN
                         I'll give you three minutes to tell 
                         me where he is.

                                     HILDY
                         He went over to the hospital to call 
                         on Professor Egelhoffer.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (outraged)
                         What?

                                     HILDY
                         With a bag of marshmallows.

               The Sheriff stands silent -- then hastily turns.

                         Come on, Hildy. Where is he?... This 
                         is a sweet trick, Hildy... I thought 
                         we were friends... Etc.
                              (to Sheriff)
                         Look here, Pete! What about Mister 
                         Burns?... Ask the Master Mind! What's 
                         he doing over here?

                                     HARTMAN
                              (grabbing Burns' arm)
                         Speak up! What do you know about 
                         this.

                                     BURNS
                              (gently but firmly 
                              disengaging his hand)
                         My dear Hartman!

               He moves casually to a post before the desk and maintains 
               it.

                                     MURPHY
                         Can that! Where is he?

                              (to Sheriff)
                         The Morning Post is not obstructing 
                         justice or hiding criminals. You 
                         ought to know that.

                                     HARTMAN
                         No? Well --
                              (turning to Hildy)
                         Johnson, you're under arrest.
                              (turning to Burns)
                         You, too, Burns.

                                     BURNS
                              (calmly)
                         Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, 
                         square-toed spy -- do you realize 
                         what you're doing?

                                     HARTMAN
                         I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, 
                         you're guilty of obstructing justice 
                         and so is the Morning Post. I'm going 
                         to see that the Post is fined ten 
                         thousand dollars for this.

                                     BURNS
                         You'll see nothing of the kind, 
                         Sheriff.

                                     HARTMAN
                         We'll just start by impounding the 
                         Post property.
                              (pointing to 
                              Bensinger's desk, 
                              addressing Hildy)
                         Is that your desk?

                                     HILDY
                              (jumping)
                         No!

                                     BURNS
                              (almost simultaneously)
                         Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I 
                         dare him to move that desk out of 
                         here.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Oh, you do, eh?
                              (to deputies)
                         All right, boys. Confiscate that 
                         desk.

               Several of the deputies start toward the desk.

                                     BURNS

                              deputies)
                         Hartman, if you take this desk out 
                         of this building, I'll put you behind 
                         bars.

                                     HARTMAN
                         You will, eh? Well, we'll see about 
                         that.
                              (to deputies)
                         All right, boys. Take it.

                                     BURNS
                         I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal 
                         offense.
                              (to deputy nearest 
                              him)
                         And you'll be an accessory!

                                     HARTMAN
                         We'll take a chance on that, Burns.
                              (to deputies)
                         Go ahead, boys.
                              (the deputies continue 
                              toward the desk)

               INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS ROOM - NIGHT MED. SHOT

               Flanked by two policemen, Mrs. Baldwin, dishevelled, with 
               her hat over one ear, is marching toward the Press Room, 
               bound for vengeance. Bruce, considerably upset, is with her. 
               As they reach the door to the Press Room, Mrs. Baldwin stops.

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                         You wait outside, Bruce.

                                     BRUCE
                         But, mother --

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                              (firmly)
                         No! You'll weaken when you see that 
                         little Jezebel! I'm going to tell 
                         her what I think of her!

               She plumps her hat down more firmly on her head and marches 
               into the Press Room followed by the two policemen. Bruce 
               remains outside the door.

               INT. PRESS ROOM

               Taking in door as it opens and Mrs. Baldwin, followed by the 
               policemen, comes in.

                                     HILDY
                              (leaping forward)
                         Mother!

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                              (pointing out Burns 
                              to the officers)
                         That man there!

                                     HILDY
                              (hugging Mrs. Baldwin)
                         Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! 
                         Are you all right? Tell me.

               Mrs. Baldwin indignantly shakes her off.

                                     HARTMAN
                         What's the idea here?

                                     POLICEMAN
                         This lady claims she was kidnapped.

                                     HARTMAN
                         What?

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                         They dragged me all the way down the 
                         stairs --

                                     HARTMAN
                         Just a minute. Did -- did --
                              (points to Burns)
                         -- this man have anything to do with 
                         it?

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                         He was the one in charge of 
                         everything! He told them to kidnap 
                         me!

                                     BURNS
                              (amazed)
                         Are you referring to me, Madam?

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                         You know you did!

                                     HARTMAN
                         What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, 
                         eh?

                                     BURNS
                              (round-eyed)
                         Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never 
                         saw this woman before in my life!

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                         Oh, what a thing to say! I was 
                         standing right here - after the girl 
                         jumped out of the window.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Did you get the Mayor?

                                     DEPUTY
                         He's coming over.

                                     BURNS
                              (to Mrs. Baldwin)
                         Now, Madam -- be honest. If you were 
                         out joy-riding, drunk, and got into 
                         some scrape, why don't you admit it, 
                         instead of accusing innocent people?

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                              (beginning to doubt 
                              her senses)
                         You ruffian! How dare you say a thing 
                         like that?

                                     HILDA
                         Please, Mother, he's just crazy!

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                              (to Sheriff)
                         I'll tell you something more. I'll 
                         tell you why they did it!

                                     BURNS
                              (fidgeting)
                         Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get 
                         bail.

                                     MRS. BALDWIN
                              (continuing crescendo)
                         I was in here -- and they had some 
                         kind of murderer in with them. They 
                         were hiding him!

               This is a bombshell. The room is electrified.

                                     HARTMAN
                         Hiding him? In here?

               Murphy, followed by the reporters, comes into scene.

                                     MURPHY
                         Hiding him where?

                                     HILDY
                         Mother!

                         Where was he?... Where'd they have 
                         him?... Etc.

               CLOSE SHOT BURNS

               at the desk.

                                     BURNS
                              (with superb 
                              indignation)
                         Madam, you're a cockeyed liar! And 
                         you know it!

               To emphasize his righteousness, he pounds on the desk three 
               times, forgetting that that is his signal to Williams. Then, 
               realizing what he has done, he gasps.

               MED. SHOT

               Burns advances from desk, the others retreating before him.

                                     BURNS
                              (anxiously)
                         Come on, Sheriff, we've got to get 
                         bail.

               Three answering knocks come from the desk.

                         You're going to be in office for 
                         exactly two days more and then we're 
                         pulling your nose out of the feed 
                         bag.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (into phone)
                         Give me the District Attorney's 
                         office.
                              (to Burns)
                         I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- 
                         making brooms in the State 
                         penitentiary.
                              (into phone)
                         Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. 
                         Come over to my office, will you? 
                         I've just arrested a couple of 
                         important birds and I want to take 
                         their confessions.

               He hangs up. Burns makes a sudden lunge for the Morning Post 
               phone and cries into it.

                                     BURNS
                              (into phone)
                         Duffy! Get Liebowitz!

                                     MAYOR
                         All the lawyers in the world aren't 
                         going to help you!

                                     BURNS
                         This is the Morning Post you're 
                         talking to!

                                     MAYOR
                              (enjoying himself)
                         The power of the press, huh!

               He laughs. Pinkus, the Governor's messenger, plentifully 
               stewed, reels in the door. He approaches the Mayor and Sheriff 
               who have their backs to him.

                                     BURNS
                              (at the Mayor)
                         Bigger men than you have found out 
                         what the power of the press is... 
                         President!... Yes -- and Kings!

                                     PINKUS
                              (woozy; handing Sheriff 
                              the reprieve over 
                              his shoulder)
                         Here's your reprieve.

               The Mayor and Sheriff spin around.

                                     MAYOR
                              (in a panic)
                         Get out of here!

                                     PINKUS
                         You can't bribe me!

                                     BURNS
                         What's this?

                                     HARTMAN
                         Get out of here, you!

                                     PINKUS
                         I won't. Here's your reprieve.

                                     HILDY
                         What?

                                     PINKUS
                         I don't want to be City Sealer. I 
                         don't like seals anyhow. They smell.

                                     MAYOR
                         Who is this man?

                                     HARTMAN
                              (to an officer)
                         Throw him out, Frank.

                                     HILDY
                              (seizing Pinkus with 
                              her free hand)
                         Who was bribing you?

               Burns also seizes Pinkus who is being pulled out of shape.

                                     PINKUS
                         They wouldn't take it.

                                     MAYOR
                         You're insane!

                                     BURNS
                              (triumphant)
                         What did I tell you? An unseen power!
                              (to Pinkus)
                         What's your name?

                                     PINKUS
                         Silas F. Pinkus.

                                     MAYOR
                         You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The 
                         idea of coming here with a cock-and-
                         bull story like that!

                                     HARTMAN
                         It's a frame-up! Some imposter!

                                     HILDY
                         Wait a minute!
                              (to the officers)
                         Let go there!

                              (to Sheriff and Mayor)
                         Murder, uh?

                                     HILDY
                         Hanging an innocent man to win an 
                         election!

                                     HARTMAN
                         That's a lie!!

                                     MAYOR
                         I never saw him before!

                                     BURNS
                              (to Pinkus)
                         When did you deliver this first?

                                     HILDY
                         Who did you talk to?

                                     PINKUS
                         They started right in bribing me!

                                     HILDY
                         Who's 'they'?

                                     PINKUS
                              (indicating the Mayor 
                              and Sheriff)
                         Them!

                                     MAYOR
                         That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. 
                         Burns! He's talking like a child.

                                     BURNS
                         Out of the mouths of babes.

                                     MAYOR
                         He's insane or drunk or something. 
                         Why, if this unfortunate man, 
                         Williams, has really been reprieved, 
                         I personally am tickled to death. 
                         Aren't you, Pete?

                                     HILDY
                         Go on, you'd kill your mother to get 
                         elected!

                                     MAYOR
                         That's a horrible thing to say, Miss 
                         Johnson, about anybody!
                              (to Burns)
                         Now, look here, Walter, you're an 
                         intelligent man --

                                     BURNS
                              (interrupting)
                         Just a minute.
                              (to Pinkus)
                         All right, Mr. Pinkus. Let's have 
                         your story.

                                     PINKUS
                         Well, I been married for ten years 
                         and --

                                     BURNS
                              (interrupting)
                         Skip all that.

                                     MAYOR
                              (loudly)
                         Take those handcuffs off our friends, 
                         Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (springing to obey)
                         I was just going to!

               He gets the key from the officer.

                                     MAYOR
                         Walter, I can't tell you how badly I 
                         feel about this. There was no excuse 
                         for Hartwell to fly off the handle.

                                     HARTMAN

                              handcuffs)
                         I was only doing my duty. Nothing 
                         personal in it.

               They are set free.

                         Sheriff, this document is authentic! 
                         Earl Williams has been reprieved, 
                         this Commonwealth has been spared 
                         the painful necessity of shedding 
                         blood.

                         That's right.

               He shows the Mayor a locket.

                                     PINKUS
                         Here's the picture of my wife.

                         was to go home and tell my wife --

                              (dreamily)
                         Wait till those two future jailbirds 
                         read the Morning Post tomorrow.

               Walter turns to Hildy and they suddenly smile at each other.

                                     HILDY
                         How was that for a tight squeeze?

                                     BURNS
                         Don't tell me you were worried!

                                     HILDY
                         Worried! I was petrified. Weren't 
                         you?

                                     BURNS
                         Uh-uh. As long as we were in there 
                         together pitching -- they couldn't 
                         lick us. Well, it's been a lot of 
                         fun.

                                     HILDY
                         In a way.

                                     BURNS
                              (laughs)
                         I mean -- working together. Just 
                         like the old days. The things we've 
                         been through, Hildy.

                                     HILDY
                         We've certainly been in some swell 
                         jams.

                                     BURNS
                         Remember the time we broke into the 
                         D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi 
                         Randell's diary?

                                     HILDY
                         Yeah. What about the time we hid the 
                         missing heiress in the sauerkraut 
                         factory? Six scoop interviews!

                                     BURNS
                         Yeah - but that time we stole Old 
                         Lady Haggerty's stomach off the 
                         Coroner's physician. We proved she 
                         was poisoned though, didn't we?

                                     HILDY
                              (laughing)
                         We sure did, but we had to go in 
                         hiding for a week.

                                     BURNS
                         In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only 
                         chaperon was the poor old lady's 
                         stomach.

                                     HILDY
                         Don't remind me. That's how we 
                         happened to --

               She breaks off. There is a moment's pause.

                                     BURNS
                         Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be 
                         making love to another man's fiancee.

                                     HILDY
                         That's all right, Walter. It's as 
                         much my fault as yours.

                                     BURNS
                              (glancing at the clock)
                         Bruce is making the nine o'clock 
                         train. I told him you'd be on it -- 
                         unless you want to write this story 
                         yourself.

                                     HILDY
                         Well, if it's my last story, I'd 
                         like it to be a good one. But -- I 
                         guess I can't, Walter.

                                     BURNS
                         Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for 
                         me to decide. Of course, you could 
                         make a later train and still be in 
                         Albany tomorrow morning.

                                     HILDY
                         Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --

                                     BURNS
                         He's going to have you the rest of 
                         his life, Hildy. Can't you give me 
                         another hour?

                                     HILDY
                         I don't know what to do, Walter.

                                     BURNS
                         Flip a coin.

                                     HILDY
                         All right.
                              (takes coin from her 
                              bag)
                         Heads I go -- tails I stay to write 
                         the story. Ready?

               CLOSEUP BURNS

               gazing nervously at the hand holding the coin.

               CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY

               She flips and catches the coin. She holds it tightly clasped 
               in her hand, afraid to look. They stare at each other a 
               second.

                                     BURNS
                              (nervously)
                         Well -- what is it?

                                     HILDY
                              (almost breaking)
                         What's the difference? I'm going to 
                         write that story -- and you know it!

               She puts the coin away without looking at it. Burns rushes 
               to her, tries to take her in his arms.

                                     BURNS
                         Hildy!

                              (furiously)
                         Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for 
                         you!

                                     BURNS
                              (softly)
                         Then why are you doing it?

                                     HILDY
                         Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven 
                         help me!

                         Thanks.

                         And what a way to quit. While you're 
                         still champion! That's the way to

                         What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting 
                         for you in Albany.

                                     HILDY
                         No, he won't. I wired him that I

                         the one he took, isn't it?

                                     BURNS
                         Sure.

                                     HILDY
                         It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs 
                         a wife who can give him a home -- 
                         and affection -- and peace. I couldn't 
                         do that for him, Walter. I'm what 
                         you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd 
                         give up her soul for a story!... Is 
                         that job still open?

                                     BURNS
                         Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- 
                         and being Mrs. Walter Burns.

                                     HILDY
                         Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We 
                         tried it.

                                     BURNS
                         Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! 
                         Only you expected it to be like other 
                         marriages. It can't be like other 
                         marriages -- we're different! We're 
                         a different world. Look at what we 
                         went through today. I wouldn't trade 
                         that for any honeymoon in the world. 
                         I bet you wouldn't, either.

                                     HILDY
                         A fine honeymoon, with a murderer 
                         right in the boudoir! And that other 
                         honeymoon in a coal mine!

                                     BURNS
                         That's what makes it romantic. Every 
                         other married couple goes away on a 
                         honeymoon and for two weeks the bride 
                         knows just where the groom is, and 
                         vice versa. But us -- you never know 
                         where I am and I'm not sure where 
                         you are. That's Romance!

                                     HILDY
                         Well, maybe I'd like to know just 
                         once!

                                     BURNS
                         Hildy, if that's what you want, all 
                         right. We'll even go to -- how about 
                         Niagara Falls?

                                     HILDY
                              (jumping)
                         Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't 
                         mean that?

                                     BURNS
                         Sure I do. And I'll tell you something 
                         else -- I'd like a baby.

                                     HILDY
                         Walter!

                         Sure, I can't last forever. I want a 
                         son I can train to take my place on 
                         this paper.

                         What would you do if it was a 
                         daughter?

                                     BURNS
                         Well, if she looked like you -- Say! 
                         My brains and your looks -- that 
                         mightn't be such a bad combination.

                                     HILDY
                         What's the matter with my brains?

                                     BURNS
                         What's the good of arguing about 
                         something that probably doesn't exist? 
                         Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. 
                         What do you say?

                                     HILDY
                         Well, I'd like to be lady-like and 
                         think it over.

                                     BURNS
                         I don't want to rush you. Take a 
                         couple of seconds.

                         Hello, Judge!

                                     JUDGE
                         This is an outrage, Mr. Burns! Sending 
                         a gunman to kidnap me!

                                     BURNS
                         Now, wait a minute, Judge. This isn't 
                         a kidnapping. You've got the legal 
                         power to perform a marriage ceremony, 
                         haven't you?

                                     HILDY
                         What!

                                     BURNS
                         Now don't argue, Hildy.
                              (to Judge)
                         How about it, Judge?

                                     JUDGE
                         Yes, but --

                                     BURNS
                         Then go ahead. Come on, Hildy.

                                     HILDY
                         Nobody's going to rush me into 
                         anything!
                              (as Louie sticks a 
                              gun in her ribs)
                         You keep away from me!
                              (but she's scared)

                                     LOUIE
                         All right, Judge.
