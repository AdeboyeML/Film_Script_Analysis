    FADE IN:

1   On a DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS.                                       1

    A FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely.
    Noticeable. ORANGE...YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE...

    A SOUND.   Something SHATTERING...

    Then. A DISEMBODIED VOICE. Muted. We can't quite make out
    What it's saying. As it gets LOUDER. And LOUDER. When we
    finally. Understand...

                         DISEMBODIED VOICE
               You are in danger...

                                               CUT TO:

2   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CLOSE ON                                2

    DEL SPOONER'S FACE.    His eyes, snapping open.   His face,
    covered in sweat.

    PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed. Sheets, tangled around
    his legs. Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly
    cheerful.

    Spooner slaps it off. Sits up. Wincing. Bends his RIGHT
    ARM. Stiff. He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes out a
    couple and swallows them. Trying to forget. That dream.

    You are in danger...

    He rubs his hands over his face. Gets out of bed. His
    apartment, basic. Unremarkable. Bearing the signs of
    someone who lives alone. Shades drawn. A little messy.

3   INT. SHOWER - MORNING                                              3

    Spooner turns his face into the jet of water.

4   INT. BATHROOM - MORNING                                            4

    Shaves with a razor.    Using his left hand.   Knicks the cleft
    of his chin. Shit.

5   INT. KITCHEN - MORNING                                             5

    Stares down at the single egg in a saucepan.      Waiting for it
    to boil.

                                                             2.


6   INT. HALLWAY - MORNING                                          6

    Heads down the hallway. Looping a knotted tie around his
    neck. Kicks some neglected mail from the door and reaches
    for the handle. Takes a deep breath and...

7   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING                                  7

    ...steps outside. Into the flow of COMMUTERS heading for the
    elevated trains. Elbow to elbow. A river of humanity.

    Spooner moves along, like everyone else. Suddenly. His
    shoulders tense. That feeling at the back of his neck. He
    turns and sees...

    A ROBOT. Just behind him. Humanoid in design, but still
    obviously a machine. Metal and synthetic casings covering
    hydraulic muscles. The thing senses his stare. Looks up
    with a muted WHIR...

                         ROBOT
                   (metallic voice)
               Good day, sir...

    Spooner. Speeds up his pace.     Weaving through the crowd to
    lose the robot.

    We now realise this is THE FUTURE. Towering apartment
    buildings block the sun. The street packed with traffic.
    PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting
    portable offices. Spooner throws a look at his surroundings:

    Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building
    cleaning windows.

    A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently
    repairs the street. No human supervision.

    A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW. Lumbering along the sidewalk.
    Scrubbing, sweeping. Emptying trash...

    Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd. Following their owners.
    Walking slowly, deliberately. Carrying boxes. Groceries.
    Briefcases.

    Stamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO:   III LAWS SAFE.

    Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS.
    Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's
    neck. She smiles big at Spooner. Front teeth missing.

                         LITTLE GIRL
               Hi.

                                                              3.


                          SPOONER
               Hi.

    But it's not her father. It's her ROBOT CARETAKER.    The
    robot turns. Looks at the girl.

                         ROBOT
               You are not allowed to talk to
               strangers.

    Spooner, disgusted.   Has had enough.   He steps off the curb
    Just as...

    THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around.   Training its large
    digital EYE on him:

                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
               Please return to the sidewalk.

    Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street.

                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
               Please return to the sidewalk...

    The traffic signal, tracking him.

                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
               You are in violation of city
               ordinance 14-B726...

    Spooner throws up his hand. Flipping it the bird just as
    SNAP! It takes his picture.

                                                CUT TO:

8   EXT./INT. MONORAIL - MORNING                                    8

    Spooner stepping onto a sleek, densely packed TRAIN. Looks
    down at his feet. A trampled flyer on the ground. From the
    Anti-Robot League: METAL MONSTERS SECRET FACTORY REVEALED!
    A Robot gets up. To offer him his seat. Spooner. Turns his
    back on him as we PULL BACK from the window to REVEAL...

9   EXT. CITY SCAPE/MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                           9

    The TRAIN hurtling toward DOWNTOWN. Soaring, gravity-defying
    OFFICE BUILDINGS dominate the skyline. Older buildings
    wedged among the new. All protected by huge glass and steel
    shields.

    As we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to
    disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels.
    The "old" streets have become huge, spacious plazas.

                                                             4.


10   EXT. POLICE H.Q. - PLAZA - MORNING                            10

     Spooner moves with the CROWD towards the doors of the aging
     Police Headquarters. Modern additions have been made to the
     original facade -- creating an ungainly architectural mess.

11   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - MORNING                    11

     A vast open plan situation room lined on one side by a series
     of glass-enclosed rooms. On the other side a GIANT SCREEN
     with real time video of various streets and buildings.

     Spooner arrives at his desk. Unlike the others, it's a mess.
     A slender computer screen curving along the front of it.
     Several electronic messages say the same thing:

                             SEE ME!

                          LT. BERGIN (O.S.)
                Ever heard the phrase "lead by
                example?"

     Spooner looks up. LIEUTENANT JOHN BERGIN stands in front of
     his desk, holding up a CITATION with a photo of Spooner
     giving that traffic signal the finger.

                          SPOONER
                Doesn't ring a bell.

                          LT. BERGIN
                    (pointing to Spooner's
                     badge)
                It's on your badge.

     Spooner takes the citation.   Drops it into a drawer filled
     with about fifty others.

                          LT. BERGIN
                The traffic division filed an
                official complaint this morning.

                          SPOONER
                The traffic division is a machine.

                          LT. BERGIN
                Look, I know there's going to be an
                adjustment period, Del...

                          SPOONER
                    (interrupting)
                I'll send them a letter of apology.
                Maybe some flowers. A box of
                chocolates...

                                                               5.


     JUST THEN Spooner's phone RINGS.   He throws Bergin a look.
     Then snatches up the receiver.

                          SPOONER
                Spooner, homicide.

                                                 CUT TO:

12   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - ESTABLISHING - DAY                        12

     A sprawling glass and metal complex covering many city
     blocks. The entrance is a large plaza filled with PEOPLE and
     ROBOTS.

13   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - METAL CORRIDOR - DAY                      13

     An elevator opens with a whoosh. Spooner steps out into a
     featureless corridor. His footsteps, echoing. He stops at a
     set of OPPOSING DOORS. Looks over at one, when the other
     suddenly OPENS.

14   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS        14

     A warm, mahogany-paneled room. In sharp contrast to the cold
     metal space outside. Spooner steps inside. At the end of a
     long conference table sits an OLD MAN. Sparkling blue eyes.
     Old-fashioned suit.

                          OLD MAN
                Hello, there. Please come in.

     Spooner hesitates.

                          OLD MAN
                It's alright. You can sit.     Sit.

     Spooner doesn't.   Looks around the room. The Old Man lifts
     up a coffee pot.   Pours some coffee into a single cup.

                          OLD MAN
                Coffee?

                          SPOONER
                    (interested)
                You're offering me a cup of coffee?

                          OLD MAN
                Yes. But you are to say, "No,
                thank you."

     Spooner nods a little. The Old Man raises the coffee to his
     lips, but doesn't take a sip.

                                                       6.


                       OLD MAN
           Coffee?

                       SPOONER
           No.    Thank you.

                     OLD MAN
           As you wish.

The Old Man takes a sip. He doesn't move. There is no
movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee
pot.

                     SPOONER
           You want to tell me something about
           Dr. Hogenmiller? About his death?

The Old Man smiles.

                     OLD MAN
           I want to tell you that his death
           was not a suicide.

                     SPOONER
           And why do you say that?

                      OLD MAN
           Why?   Because I want you to know
           it.

                     SPOONER
           I understand that. But what
           specifically leads you to believe
           that he didn't commit suicide?

                     OLD MAN
               (considers)
           Nothing specifically.

Spooner shifts his weight.   Agitated.

                     SPOONER
           Under normal circumstances that
           wouldn't be enough to get you a
           homicide investigation.

                     OLD MAN
           But this is not "normal
           circumstances," is it, Detective
           Spooner?

                       SPOONER
           No.    It isn't.

                                                               7.


                          OLD MAN
                Then you will find out who killed
                Dr. Hogenmiller, yes? And then you
                will tell me.

     Spooner's losing his patience.

                          SPOONER
                If you were murdered, Doctor, I'll
                find out. And you'll be the first
                to know.....

     JUST THEN the HOLOGRAM of DR. HOGENMILLER vanishes in a burst
     of LIGHT, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the
     conference room. Spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in
     front of a LARGE VIEW SCREEN inside a SMALL METAL CHAMBER.

15   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                              15

     Spooner steps out into the hallway and into...AN ESCORT
     ROBOT.

                          ESCORT ROBOT
                Please follow me.

     Spooner. Reluctantly starts to follow it.     Passes another
     doorway. POLICE TAPE stretched across it.     Catches a brief
     glimpse of...

     DR. HEINRICH HOGENMILLER'S BODY.

     Splayed out across the floor. Surrounded by CRIME SCENE
     TECHNICIANS. He pauses. Taking in the scene. Then
     continues on.

16   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY                  16

     Two large doors emblazoned with the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO open
     automatically. Inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom
     looking out over the entire complex.

     Spooner walks through the doorway. His escort robot trailing
     behind him. An army of corporate types sit around a
     conference table. Young. Energetic. You can practically
     feel the brains and ambition.

                          SPOONER
                Usually I ask who's in charge...

     Spooner's eyes lock with a MAN sitting at the head of the
     table. 60s, handsome, charismatic. Dr. LANCE ROBERTSON,
     founder and CEO of U.S. Robotics.

                                                         8.


                      SPOONER
            But everyone knows you, Dr.
            Robertson.

Robertson smiles.   Pretends to instruct his people.

                      ROBERTSON
            Remind me to cut back on my talk
            show appearances.

LAUGHTER.

                      ROBERTSON
            Welcome to U.S. Robotics,
            Detective. I regret you're not
            visiting us under more pleasant
            circumstances. Allow me to
            introduce Mr. Aronson, our head of
            Legal Affairs.

A prematurely graying MAN leaning against the wall.    Nods
hello.

                      ROBERTSON
            And the gentleman to my right is
            Dr. Alfred Lanning, Director of
            Research.

Alfred Lanning, only one there in a tie.   Nods.

                      ROBERTSON
            They'll be available to answer any
            questions you might have during
            your investigation. You'll
            understand how anxious we are to
            resolve this matter -- especially
            before the press gets wind of it.
            There are some anti-robot
            sentiments out there as you know,
            Detective, and we're not eager to
            stir them up. So. Where would you
            like to begin?

                      SPOONER
            We can begin with whether or not
            the old man put a gun to his head
            and pulled the trigger.

A palpable wave of tension shoots through the group.

                      ARONSON
            You don't have to answer that, Dr.
            Robertson...

                                                          9.


Robertson waves him off.

                      ROBERTSON
           Susan?   Perhaps you can assist us
           here?

Everyone looks down at the other end of the table. A BEAT.
Then an attractive young WOMAN gets to her feet. SUSAN
CALVIN. Hair tucked behind her ears. Looking at everyone
but Spooner.

                     CALVIN
           Dr. Hogenmiller was a schizoid
           personality who generally eschewed
           social relationships. Rejecting
           people in favor of solitary
           activities involving machines. He
           spent almost all his time at the
           lab here or at his lab at home. As
           a result he was highly susceptible
           to depression.

                     ROBERTSON
           Dr. Calvin is our Chief
           Psychologist.

                     SPOONER
           If that was your diagnosis, why
           didn't you see this coming?

Calvin turns. Finally meeting Spooner's eye.      As if the
answer's obvious.

                     CALVIN
           This is U.S. Robotics, Detective.
           Seventy-five percent of our
           employees fit that description.

                     LANNING
               (interceding)
           You'll have to excuse the doctor.
           We're all a little on edge. This
           has been a difficult and emotional
           morning.

Spooner throws a look around the room.   Then back at Calvin.

                       SPOONER
           Yeah.    I can see you're all broken
           up.

Robertson responds to Spooner's skepticism.

                                                           10.


                          ROBERTSON
                Dr. Hogenmiller was at my side from
                the very beginnings of this
                company. We developed the "Three
                Laws of Robotics" together. But
                these days science is a young man's
                game. By the time you hit thirty
                your best years are behind you.
                Some of us are kicked upstairs.
                Others I'm afraid aren't so lucky.

     Robertson stands.   Meeting over.

                          ROBERTSON
                Dr. Hogenmiller took his own life.
                I trust you will come to the same
                swift conclusion, Detective. Dr.
                Lanning will make himself available
                if you have any further questions.

     Spooner looks over at Calvin.

                          SPOONER
                I want her to help me.

     Calvin, unhappy with this arrangement.

                          CALVIN
                That's not really my department...

                          ROBERTSON
                    (pointed)
                Susan would be happy to assist you.

     And with a gesture, Robertson dismisses everyone. People
     start getting up, gathering up, filing out. Susan Calvin.
     The last one to get up.

17   INT. METAL HALLWAY - DAY                                      17

     Spooner and Calvin, heading down the same hallway he was in
     before. Catch sight of a couple ROBOT TECHNICIANS...

                          SPOONER
                    (under his breath)
                Ah, Christ...Toasters...

     As they duck under the police tape and...

                                                              11.


18   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY                                   18

     ...enter Hogenmiller's lab. Alive with activity. CRIME
     SCENE TECHNICIANS, MOBILE ANALYSIS UNITS. LIGHT SCANS,
     running across...

     HOGENMILLER'S LIFELESS FACE.   Black gun powder.   Fanning out
     around his contorted lips.

     Spooner. Throws a look around the lab: ROBOTS. Everywhere.
     Mostly incomplete. TORSOS. ARMS. LEGS. Dangling from the
     ceiling. A SERGEANT. Passes them by...

                          SERGEANT
                They say the price's gonna come
                down a lot next year. Kinda cool,
                huh?

                          SPOONER
                How cool will it be when one takes
                your job?

     Spooner.   Pushing past him.   His eyes.   Darting around.

                          CALVIN
                Is everything alright, Detective?

                          SPOONER
                Yeah. This is just how I like my
                robots -- in pieces.

     As they approach Hogenmiller's body, the lead CRIME SCENE
     INVESTIGATOR, BALDEZ, gets up to meet them.

                          BALDEZ
                    (to Spooner)
                Can you believe it, man? U.S.
                Robotics. I didn't think I'd ever
                see the inside of this building.

     Hands Spooner, a plasma clipboard.   Spooner signs it,
     awkwardly. With his LEFT HAND...

                          SPOONER
                What's the run-down?

                          BALDEZ
                Heinrich Hogenmiller, sixty-four
                years old. Weapon a small caliber
                .22, registered in his name. Looks
                like he walked in, locked the door,
                and snuffed himself.

                                                       12.


Spooner.   Cocking his head to look at Hogenmiller's face.

                      SPOONER
            I know someone who disagrees with
            you.

                       BALDEZ
            Who?

Spooner.   Stands.   Pointing down at Hogenmiller.

                       SPOONER
            Him.

And steps over the body, leaving a confused Baldez.
Stepping deeper, into the lab. Calvin. Following.

                      SPOONER
            I spoke to a dead man today.   Want
            to tell me about that?

                      CALVIN
            Dr. Hogenmiller's hologram took his
            appointments. Attended staff
            meetings. He hated corporate life.
            The hologram enabled him to focus
            on his work. It's just a device,
            Detective.

                      SPOONER
            A device that called the police.

                      CALVIN
            The sound of the gunshot would've
            triggered a 911.

                      SPOONER
            But the call came directly to me.

                      CALVIN
            We're talking about a mechanism
            designed by Hogenmiller to say
            provocative things. To irritate
            and confound his colleagues.

                      SPOONER
            And that's what you think it is?

                      CALVIN
            I'm sorry, but this whole
            investigation is the result of a
            dead man's toy messing with your
            head.

                                                       13.


They pass half a robot, hanging from a hook. Spooner curls
his lip. Swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at
him.

                      SPOONER
            When's the last time any of you
            actually spoke to Hogenmiller? I
            mean human to human?

                      CALVIN
            I couldn't say.

                      SPOONER
            Take a guess.

                      CALVIN
            I don't guess, Detective. But if
            pressed, I would reason it had been
            a considerable length of time.

                      SPOONER
            How well did you know him?

Calvin.   Gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had
been.

                      CALVIN
            Not well. But I admired his work
            tremendously.

Spooner. Studies her for a beat. Then turns back to the
body. Two CORONERS entering with a high-tech body box.

                      SPOONER
            I get the whole "mad scientist"
            thing. Hogenmiller was past his
            prime. Isolated. Eccentric. He
            enters a room. Locks the door and
            is found minutes later with a
            bullet fired through his mouth into
            his brain. Everything about this
            case says suicide.

                      CALVIN
            You don't sound convinced.

The coroners.   Start loading the body into the box.

                      SPOONER
            Even people who live a life of
            logic and precision rarely arrange
            their deaths so perfectly.
                (turning to her)
                      (MORE)

                                                             14.


                          SPOONER (cont'd)
                What all this is missing -- is
                personality...

     As he starts for the door...

                          SPOONER
                You have 24 hour surveillance?...

19   INT. METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                 19

     ...They head out into the hallway.    A MECHANICAL DOOR GUARD
     rolling into place behind them.

                          CALVIN
                It's company policy.

                          SPOONER
                I want to see the tapes.

     Calvin. Hurrying to keep up with him. This is hardly how
     she wanted to spend her morning. Calls out into the air...

                          CALVIN
                Victor!

     At the end of the corridor, near the elevator, a BRIGHT
     CIRCLE appears. Hovering just in front of the wall. Two
     small slits grow into ROUND BLACK EYES...and a thin mouth
     expands into an ENORMOUS SMILE.

                          CALVIN
                Detective, meet Victor. Our
                building's supercomputer. He's the
                checks and balances of U.S.R.
                    (to Victor)
                Victor, Detective Spooner's heading
                up the investigation into the death
                of Dr. Hogenmiller.

     Victor smiles big.   Spooner, furrows his brow.

                          SPOONER
                You look like a very...happy
                computer.

     Victor responds in a GENTLE MALE VOICE:

                          VICTOR
                Thank you. That's very kind.

                          CALVIN
                The Detective needs to see our
                security tapes.

                                                                15.


     The elevator doors immediately OPEN.   They step inside.

20   INT. ELEVATOR - DAY                                              20

     Spooner and Calvin descend. Victor floats on the wall and
     smiles wide. Spooner looks back at it. With a frown.

     The elevator stops, the doors open.    A ROBOT steps on.

                          ROBOT
                Good day, Dr. Calvin.   Good day,
                sir.

     Spooner's jaw. Clenches. Staring at the Robot.       It senses
     the stare. Turns back to him.

                          ROBOT
                May I be of service to you, sir?

     Spooner. Breaks the stare.     Ignoring the Robot.   Calvin.
     Looks over at him.

                          CALVIN
                Aren't you going to answer him?

                          SPOONER
                I don't talk to my refrigerator,
                either.

     Calvin folds her arms.

                          CALVIN
                I get the distinct feeling you're
                one of those people, Detective.

                          SPOONER
                What people?

                          CALVIN
                Those who don't appreciate the work
                we do here at U.S.R.

                          SPOONER
                You people do what you do. Then
                it's up to the rest of us to make
                sense out of the world we wake up
                in.

     As the elevator doors open on to...

                                                           16.


21   INT. ATRIUM LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                              21

     A soaring lobby. The centerpiece is a five-story STATUE of a
     ROBOT, arms outstretched in approximation of Da Vinci's Study
     of Man. Robot workers more numerous than humans. They are
     sleeker. Finer. More advanced than those in the outside
     world.

     Calvin and Spooner head across.

                          CALVIN
                When this company started we were
                manufacturing three robots a week.
                Now look at us. Today's children
                will never know a world without
                robots.

                          SPOONER
                The streets are filled with
                unemployed humans who aren't
                exactly thrilled with that idea.

                          CALVIN
                Our robotic systems maintain
                factory inventories, regulate
                street traffic -- even run the
                family home.

                          SPOONER
                Leaving people to do what, Doctor?

                          CALVIN
                Leaving people to engage in higher
                pursuits that make life worth
                living.

                          SPOONER
                And what happens when something
                goes wrong?

                          CALVIN
                Our system's never wrong.

     As they walk through the crowd, we hear the quiet WHIR of
     robot heads as they turn in succession to watch Spooner pass.

22   INT. MAINFRAME - DAY                                        22

     Spooner and Calvin enter the MAINFRAME of U.S. Robotics.
     This is the nerve center of the whole operation. Walls lined
     with COMPUTERS, SCREENS, and thousands of CONTROLS.

                                                       17.


                     CALVIN
           This is Victor's home.

VICTOR appears on a wall-sized SCREEN broken up into beehive-
like components.

                     VICTOR
           I will now play you the last thirty-
           two seconds of Dr. Hogenmiller's
           life.

AS WE WATCH THE SCREENS. The elevator opens and DOCTOR
HOGENMILLER steps into the metal corridor. In countless
ANGLES. High, low, close-up, wide. Hogenmiller's face
composed but tight.

Spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him.   Hogenmiller
steps in. The doors slide closed behind him.

Nothing for a few moments. Then a muffled GUNSHOT. Calvin
jumps, startled. That's it. The cameras, still trained on
the corridor.

                     SPOONER
           Where's the tape from inside?

                     VICTOR
           Dr. Hogenmiller did not permit
           cameras to observe him while
           working.

                     CALVIN
           That was only within the last year.

                     SPOONER
           So we can throw paranoia into the
           mix.
               (to Victor)
           Fast-forward.

A hundred-plus screens all FAST-FORWARD. POLICE OFFICERS
appear and force open the doors. Now TECHNICIANS appear
and rush through in a blur...

                      CALVIN
           Um.   I hate to be a stickler...

On screen, we see Spooner and Calvin enter the lab.

                     CALVIN
           But don't killers usually have to
           enter and exit the scene of a
           crime?

                                                            18.


                          SPOONER
                Stop the recording.

     Spooner turns away from the footage.   Stares at Calvin.

                          SPOONER
                They do, Doctor. Unless they've
                always been there -- and never
                left.

     Calvin looks at him.   Trying to understand.

                          CALVIN
                You think the murderer was in the
                lab the entire time?

                          SPOONER
                If I'm right, it's still there...

     Spooner turns back to the screens. The IMAGE paused at the
     exact moment the MECHANICAL GUARD rolled in front of the lab
     door.

                          SPOONER
                We just locked it in.

23   INT. METAL CORRIDOR - DAY                                    23

     The STEEL ARMS of the ROBOTIC GUARD retract with a CLANG.    The
     laboratory doors slide open.

24   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY                                 24

     Spooner and Calvin step inside. It's dark. Quiet. Police
     and technicians long gone. Silhouettes of hanging limbs.
     Eyeless heads. Clumps of wire and metal.

     The LIGHTS, flicker on. Calvin sees Spooner reaching into
     his coat with his left hand. Pulling out a GUN. Reacts.

                          CALVIN
                A robot cannot harm a human being,
                Detective. The First Law of
                Robotics forbids it. And we hard-
                wire the Three Laws into every
                model. Without exception.

                          SPOONER
                Yeah, I saw the commercial.

     Spooner steps deeper into the lab. Eyes scanning. Twisting.
     To avoid touching any robot parts. Passes a MAZE holding a
     METAL INSECT. SUDDENLY. The bug WHIRS to life.

                                                         19.


Spooner startles. As the metal bug scurries through the
corridors. Clamps his hand down on it.

                     SPOONER
           And if a robot was given a direct
           order to kill?

                     CALVIN
           The Second Law of Robotics would
           prevent it. A robot must obey an
           order only if it does not conflict
           with the first law.

Spooner approaches a MOUND of ROBOT PARTS. Arms and legs.
Half torsos. All tossed haphazardly onto the pile.

                     SPOONER
           But a robot can defend itself.

                     CALVIN
           Only when that action doesn't
           conflict with the First or Second
           Laws. This is the Third Law of
           Robotics.

                     SPOONER
           Yeah, well, you know what they say
           -- Laws are made to be broken.

                     CALVIN
           Not these laws.

Spooner. Starts nudging the pile with his shoe.   Calvin,
growing impatient...

                     CALVIN
           You're not hearing me, Detective.
           There's nothing here...

WHEN SUDDENLY

The PILE ERUPTS in front of Spooner...Parts flying...AS A
ROBOT LEAPS UP FROM BENEATH IT!...

Spooner...knocked back...his GUN...skittering across the
floor...right to...

CALVIN'S FEET.

                     SPOONER
           Dr. Calvin!

Calvin. Stunned.    Speechless. The Robot. Fixing his
ILLUMINATED EYES.   Right on her. She steps forward...

                                                           20.


                     SPOONER
           Goddammit! Stay back!

Spooner. Scrambling towards his gun.     Calvin.    Reaching out
towards the Robot...

                     CALVIN
           Calm down, Detective.     There is no
           danger here...

Spooner.   Grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as...

                     CALVIN
               (to Robot)
           De-Activate.

And the Robot.   Suddenly FREEZES.

Spooner. Heart POUNDING. Gets to his feet.         Training the
gun on the Robot. Calvin turns to him.

                     CALVIN
           How did you know it was under
           there?

                     SPOONER
           If I was metal and didn't want
           anyone to find me, I'd hide under a
           pile of junk.

                     CALVIN
           This Robot wasn't hiding. What
           you're looking at is the result of
           clever programming. The illusion
           of self-interest and free will.
           Nothing more.

Spooner. Steeping closer to the Robot. Cautiously.
Holstering his gun. As Calvin turns for the door.

                     CALVIN
           I'm going to go get Dr. Lanning...

...THE ROBOT'S HAND SUDDENLY SHOOTS OUT...grabbing Spooner's
gun...from his holster...LIGHTENING FAST...pointing it...
right back at him...

CLOSE ON Calvin.   Cannot believe this is happening...

                     CALVIN
           I said De-Activate!

                                                         21.


                     SPOONER
           Move away from the door, Doctor.

Calvin's voice.   Cracking from desperation.    Confusion.

                     CALVIN
           Commence emergency shut-down!

                      SPOONER
           Now!

Spooner. Staring into the Robot's eyes. A thin bead of
SWEAT. Trickling down his temple. Calvin. Moving away from
the door...

                     CALVIN
           I...I gave you an order...

The Robot. Starts backing towards the door. The gun.
Shaking in its hand. As if he's desperate. Conflicted. He
touches the WALL PANEL. The doors slide open. The Robot
steps out into the metal corridor. Turning to RUN as the
doors begin to shut...

Spooner. Reaching down to whip out a BACK-UP GUN.     From an
ankle holster. Slapping in a LARGE CARTRIDGE.

                     CALVIN
           This is impossible.   A robot...

                     SPOONER
           ...can't do that.    Yeah, yeah, I
           know.

                     CALVIN
           My God -- did you see how it moved?
           I've never seen an NS-2 move that
           way...

Starts running for the door.

                    CALVIN
           Wait! Please, you can't destroy
           it. We have to study it...

                     SPOONER
           That thing took my gun. You'll be
           lucky if you get a handful of bolts
           back!

SLAMS the wall panel and...

                                                               22.


25   INT. METAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                                  25

     ...sprints out into the hallway.     The Robot Suspect.   About
     to turn to corner...

     VICTOR.   Suddenly appearing.

                           VICTOR
                 The suspect is nearing the end of
                 the hallway, Detective.

                           SPOONER
                 Gee, thanks.

     Spooner raises his gun and FIRES...Pegging the robot in the
     LEG...It starts jerking wildly...He takes aim again when...

     CALVIN.   Races out into the hallway.

                           SPOONER
                 Get back to the lab!

     She heads for the Robot.

                           CALVIN
                     (to Robot)
                 You're malfunctioning.   Let me help
                 you!

     The Robot turns. To look at her. GUN pointing to the floor.
     Spooner. FOCUSING in on his HAND. AS ONE FINGER TWITCHES...

     And he DIVES for Calvin. Forcing her to the floor as the
     Robot FIRES. Again and again. Bullets. RICOCHETTING around
     them. SPARKING against the walls...

     The ELEVATOR opens.   The Robot, leaping inside.

     Spooner. On top of Calvin. Looks down at her.        Her HANDS.
     Clutching his coat. Trembling.

                           SPOONER
                 That was a pretty convincing
                 illusion of getting shot at.

                                                CUT TO:

26   INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS                                        26

     The ROBOT SUSPECT standing inside the elevator. Looks down
     at the bullet hole blown through its leg. Reaches down.
     Metal fingers touching the damage. As if curious. Afraid.

                                                              23.


     Looks back at the other ROBOT. Standing in the back of
     elevator. A primitive model. No reaction. Face, blank.

                                               CUT BACK TO:

27   INT. METAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                                27

     Spooner springing to his feet.   Helping Calvin up.

                          VICTOR
                I took the liberty of alerting
                Security .003 Seconds after the
                first shot was fired...

                          SPOONER
                Where's that elevator going?

                          VICTOR
                Sub Level 5.

     Spooner SLAMS against a nearby DOOR.   Hurtling down the
     STAIRS...

28   INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                                         28

     A PHALANX of SECURITY PERSONNEL.   Crossing the lobby.
     PIERCING ALARM BELLS, RINGING...

29   INT. ANOTHER METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                         29

     More SECURITY PERSONNEL.   Pouring into a HALLWAY...

30   INT. STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS                                      30

     Spooner and Calvin. Racing down the stairs.     Victor's face
     meeting them at every landing.

                          VICTOR
                I have directed a security team to
                meet the elevator containing the
                errant robot...

     Spooner. Whipping past him. Calvin.      Barely keeping up.
     Not used to this much activity.

     Spooner.   BURSTS through a door and out into...

31   INT. SUBTERRANEAN LEVEL 5 - CONTINUOUS                          31

     ...Subterranean Level 5. A labyrinth of metal and concrete.
     IN THE DISTANCE. A troupe of SECURITY PERSONNEL swarms
     around a closed ELEVATOR DOOR...

                                                          24.


                     VICTOR
           The suspect is about to be
           apprehended, Detective.

                     SPOONER
           I'll believe it when I see it.

Spooner. Cocking his gun.   A soft DING!    Announcing the
elevator car's arrival.

SECURITY, all crouching down in unison.    Weapons brought
round to position.

Spooner. Weaving through them.   Gun pointed at the metal
doors as...

WHOOSH. They slide open. Revealing a ROBOT. Standing
under the LIGHT. Holding a GUN. It steps out as Security
takes aim and...

                     SPOONER
           Wait!

Spooner pushes past them to the Robot.    Looks down at its
leg. UNSCATHED.

                     SPOONER
           This is not the same robot!

Looking wildly around. Goddammit. Bounds towards an EXIT as
Calvin steps forward to question the robot.

                     CALVIN
               (to Robot)
           What happened to the robot that
           ordered you to hold this firearm?

                     ELEVATOR ROBOT
           This unit is not programmed to obey
           an order given by a robot...

                     CALVIN
           But who gave you this gun?

SPOONER. Running towards the exit.    Hears the answer.
Echoing behind him...

                     ELEVATOR ROBOT
           A metal man.

                                                              25.


32   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - DAY                                       32

     BAM! He BURSTS out into the PLAZA in front of U.S. Robotics.
     Squinting into the light. Then PLUNGING into the crowd...

     HUMAN...ROBOT...HUMAN...ROBOT...they all look the same from
     behind. Spooner running. Through the sea of MAN and
     MACHINE. When someone. Starts to SCREAM. At the sight of
     his GUN. The crowd begins SCATTERING. Chaos. Spooner
     stops. Near a fountain. Turning 360. Looking everywhere...

     The Robot.   Gone.

                            SPOONER (V.O.)
                  ...I want a homicide unit on every
                  street, sidewalk, alley...

33   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - DAY                         33

     Spooner, standing in front of an assemblage of COPS. Behind
     him, an image of the Robot Suspect plays on the screen...

                            SPOONER
                  ...junkyard, scrapyard, and salvage
                  yard, anywhere it could hide.

     Behind him, flashing images of the city STREETS and DUMPS...

                            SPOONER
                  It's got a bullet hole above the
                  right knee, so be on the look-out
                  for any malfunctioning NS-2...

     Lieutenant Bergin enters the back of the room.     Next to him,
     ASSISTANT D.A. TOLLER. Not looking happy.

                            SPOONER
                  Check out all retail outlets and
                  repair shops, especially the
                  underground ones...

     The screen behind him compartmentalises, showing various
     dubious SHOP FRONTS...

                            SPOONER
                  I don't care who you have to get
                  past to get this done. Just get it
                  done.

     The Cops, begin dispersing. As Bergin catches Spooner's eye.
     Spooner, not pleased to see Toller. Heads over...

                                                         26.


                     TOLLER
           Looking like shit, Spooner.

                     SPOONER
           Well I'm not the one always giving
           Press Conferences...

Bergin puts a hand on Spooner's arm.   Knows he's not going to
like this.

                     LT. BERGIN
           Del, we're going to have to
           reclassify the search. D.A.'s
           office is seeing this NS-2 as
           "missing evidence" -- not a
           homicide suspect.

                      SPOONER
           What?

                     TOLLER
           Homicide is the murder of a human
           being by another human being.
           Therefore, a robot cannot be
           charged with "homicide."

                     SPOONER
           This isn't just any robot...

                     TOLLER
           It's malfunctioning.

                     SPOONER
           It killed someone. That
           registering with you?

Spooner.   Shakes off Bergin's arm.   Eyeballs Toller.

                     SPOONER
           How many shares of U.S.R. you
           holding in your portfolio, Toller?

                     TOLLER
           This is a public safety issue.

                     SPOONER
           That's convenient.

                     TOLLER
           You have any idea what would happen
           to this city if we went running
           around screaming "killer robot?"
           It would collapse in on itself.
                     (MORE)

                                                                 27.


                            TOLLER (cont'd)
                  Wide-spread panic. Until that NS-
                  2's found we're cooperating with
                  U.S. Robotics and keeping this
                  investigation under wraps.

                            LT. BERGIN
                  Maybe this isn't the case for you,
                  Del.

     Incensed, Spooner replies a little louder than he intended.

                              SPOONER
                  I'm fine!

     Rakes his hand through his hair. Turns to see the other
     COPS, looking over at him. Toller smirks. Looks to Bergin.

                            TOLLER
                  I want updated reports every half
                  hour.

     Heads off.    Spooner.   Watching him.

                            SPOONER
                  This is it, you know. From now on
                  we're going to miss the good old
                  days.

                            LT. BERGIN
                  Good old days?

                            SPOONER
                  When people were killed by other
                  people.

34   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CITY STREET - DUSK                      34

     Spooner. Rolling along in his car.       Eyes, bloodshot.
     Peering out the window:

     An NS-2 model ROBOT laden with shopping bags, following its
     owner down the sidewalk...

     Another ROBOT, opening the door at a hotel for GUESTS...

     A couple HAULING ROBOTS, loading heavy boxes onto the back of
     a truck...

     Spooner.     Rubs his eyes.   Turns a corner and spots:

     A ROBOT REPAIR SHOP.

                                                           28.


     The latest models in the window. Shiny. Streamlined.
     Spooner watches as a WOMAN leads her faulty NS-2 to the
     service entrance.

     He stops the car.

35   INT. TAXI (MOVING) - ESTATE STREETS - NIGHT                 35

     Calvin riding in the back of a DRIVERLESS taxi cab. Staring
     out the window, lost in thought. The cab pulls up to a curb.

                           TAXI VOICE
                 We have arrived at your
                 destination.

     Calvin.   Takes a beat.   Then swipes her card.

36   EXT. CALVIN'S CONDO ESTATE - NIGHT                          36

     Elegant condos set on prime real estate. Calvin heads down a
     tree-lined walk towards her condo entrance.

                           SPOONER (O.S.)
                 One of my bullets hit your robot...

     Startled. She drops her key card. As Spooner steps out from
     behind a tree. The tail of his coat, whipping in the wind.

                           CALVIN
                 Detective!...

                           SPOONER
                 And I think it's smart enough to
                 repair itself -- don't you?

                           CALVIN
                     (studying him)
                 Yes. I think so.

                           SPOONER
                 Where?

                           CALVIN
                 Any repair shop...

                           SPOONER
                 No. It's always the owner who
                 brings the robot in for repair.
                 Where would a robot without an
                 owner go?

                                                          29.


                      CALVIN
            I'm not sure what you're getting
            at.

                      SPOONER
                (stepping closer)
            Does U.S. Robotics have a factory
            in the city limits?

Calvin.   Tucking her hair behind her ears.

                      CALVIN
            The locations of our factories are
            classified.

                      SPOONER
            I don't care.

Calvin.   Looks up at him.   A Mexican stand-off.

                      CALVIN
            I have several conditions if I show
            you.

                      SPOONER
            I expected that.

                      CALVIN
            First. I want it brought in
            unharmed.

                      SPOONER
                (doesn't like it, but)
            Agreed.

                       CALVIN
            Second.   I want to talk to it,
            alone.

                      SPOONER
            Too dangerous.

                      CALVIN
            This model violated the Three Laws.
            It also moved and reacted
            differently than any robot I've
            ever seen. There must be some sort
            of logical explanation. I want to
            find out what that is. No police.
            No prosecutors. No you. Just me
            and the robot.

Spooner, looks down at this small woman.      Narrows his eyes.

                                                           30.


                          SPOONER
                When they told me you were a
                psychologist, that wasn't the whole
                truth, was it?

                          CALVIN
                I never said I treated human
                beings.

37   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - CITY UNDERPASS - NIGHT   37

     Spooner's car races down a RAMP and the roadway becomes a 16-
     lane underground tunnel system. A river of HEADLIGHTS
     stretches forever in either direction.

     A CONTROL BEAM locks onto the car, guiding it to a merge with
     TRAFFIC. Spooner hits the OVERRIDE BUTTON -- and switches to
     manual. Calvin watches him take the wheel. Shakes her head.

                          CALVIN
                That should be outlawed once and
                for all.

                          SPOONER
                That'll be the day I stop driving.

     Spooner jams the GAS PEDAL and the tunnel becomes a BLUR.
     Calvin holds onto the dashboard. Looking a little pale.

                          CALVIN
                I can recommend a behavior
                modification program, you know --
                if you want to overcome your robo-
                phobia.

                          SPOONER
                I'm not afraid of robots.   I just
                don't like them.

                          CALVIN
                Why? Because they make every
                aspect of our lives more
                convenient?

                          SPOONER
                Exactly. They do our dirty work.
                Ever do hard labor, Doctor? Gets
                pretty old, pretty fast. Nobody
                can do someone else's dirty work
                without coming to hate them. I
                don't want to be around when your
                robots decide they've taken their
                last order.

                                                              31.


                          CALVIN
                That day will never come,
                Detective. Robots aren't like
                human beings -- they don't question
                their existence.

     Spooner cranks the gear shift.    Throwing her a look.

                          SPOONER
                Spoken like a true robo-phile.

38   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS PLANT - NIGHT                               38

     The car comes to a stop in a vast INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.

     Spooner and Calvin get out, looking up at the imposing facade
     of a U.S. Robotics Assembly Plant. A long STEEL GATE -- too
     high to see over -- protects the unmarked complex.

39   EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT                                         39

     Calvin looks anxious as the DOOR MECHANISM scans her U.S.R.
     ID. She shoots a look at Spooner. They wait. Then, slowly,
     the gate begins to open.

40   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                           40

     A NIGHT FOREMAN leads them down a hallway.    Shaking his head.

                          NIGHT FOREMAN
                Head-Office already ordered a
                system-wide inventory check. Don't
                know about a missing NS-2...

     Looks back at Spooner.

                          NIGHT FOREMAN
                What'd you say you did?

                          SPOONER
                Research and Development.

     As Spooner pushes past him into...

41   INT. CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS                                41

     ...the Control Booth. Overlooking the pristine Factory
     Floor. The Foreman starts working the controls of a central
     computer.

                          CALVIN
                All Nestors accounted for?

                                                                32.


     The SCREEN scrolls with INVENTORY FIGURES.

                           NIGHT FOREMAN
                     (gesturing)
                 As you can see, all properly
                 catalogued. Your robot just isn't
                 here.

     Calvin turns to say something to Spooner. But he isn't
     there. She looks around. Then sees the Foreman reacting.
     Looks out the window at...

     SPOONER.   Walking out onto the factory floor.

42   INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT                                       42

     Spooner trots alongside an ASSEMBLY LINE BELT. Lined with NS-
     2 LEGS. New. Gleaming. Heading towards the assembly room.

     Calvin and the Foreman.   Catching up.   Over the noise:

                           NIGHT FOREMAN
                 Like I said, sir -- we have one
                 hundred fully assembled NS-2s
                 housed here. That's our capacity.
                 Last week we had one hundred.
                 Yesterday we had one hundred --

     Spooner, slowing.   Finally spotting what he was looking for.
     Points at:

     A GAP.   On the assembly belt.    ONE LEG MISSING.

                           SPOONER
                 Well today you have one-hundred and
                 one.

43   INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT                                       43

     A STORAGE COMPARTMENT opens and 101 NS-2s march out in tight
     formation. Every step and swing of the arm in unison. The
     sound of METAL FOOTSTEPS reverberating through the plant as
     101 Robots organise themselves into long straight lines.

     Spooner and Calvin look up and down the formation. They all
     look alike. Spooner. Throws up his hands.

                           SPOONER
                     (to Calvin)
                 You're the robot shrink.

     The Robots stand motionless.     A strange tableau.   Calvin.
     Takes a step forward.

                                                          33.


                     CALVIN
           There is a robot in this formation
           that does not belong. Identify it.

101 robots answer in unison.    Their mechanical VOICES
resounding:

                     101 ROBOTS
           ONE OF US.

                     CALVIN
           Which one?

                     101 ROBOTS
           ONE OF US.

                     CALVIN
           That is not a satisfactory answer!

                     101 ROBOTS
           ONE OF US.

                     SPOONER
           That's helpful.

                     CALVIN
           I could always interview each one
           individually and cross-reference
           their responses to detect any
           anomalies.

                     SPOONER
           How long would that take?

                     CALVIN
           About three weeks.

They share a look. Clearly not an option.      Then.   Calvin.
Gets an idea. Turns to Spooner...

                      CALVIN
           Or...

...and GRABS his GUN from his holster.   He jumps back.

                     CALVIN
           We have one hundred robots here
           that cannot allow a human being to
           come to harm...

Their eyes lock.   Spooner, getting what she's doing.

                                                           34.


                       SPOONER
             And one that can.

She raises the gun to Spooner's head.    Hand, unsteady.

                       CALVIN
             Am I holding this right?

                       SPOONER
             More or less.

Calvin.    Swallows.   Looks over at the robots.   Then COCKS the
gun...

AND THE ROBOTS COME THUNDERING TOWARDS THEM. Like a row of
linebackers. Arms straight out. Their footsteps DEAFENING.
Coming CLOSER and CLOSER...

When CALVIN. Lowers the gun. The Robots. All stop in
unison. Immediately returning to their resting positions.

Spooner and Calvin stare out. EVERY ONE OF THE ROBOTS MOVED.
Standing right in front of them, like metal statues.

Spooner.    Has had enough.   Takes the gun back from Calvin...

                       SPOONER
             Enough game-playing.

...And BAM! Blows the head off of the nearest Robot.       Its
body crumples to the ground.

                       SPOONER
             Guess that wasn't it.

Calvin. Cannot believe what he just did.     Rushes over to the
destroyed Robot.

                       CALVIN
             What are you doing?!

Spooner walks down the row, holding his gun in plain view.

                       SPOONER
                 (calling out)
             This is a self-preservation field
             test! DO NOT attempt to save
             yourselves. Any of you. That's an
             order!

FROM THE CONTROL BOOTH the Night Foreman screams over the
P.A.:

                                                             35.


                          NIGHT FOREMAN
                Are you crazy? Those are eight
                hundred thousand dollar machines!

     Spooner randomly stops at another Robot.    Raises his gun.

                          SPOONER
                You hear that? You're worth more
                than I'll make in my entire life...

     His finger tightening on the trigger when Calvin suddenly
     grabs his arm.

                          CALVIN
                You can't just destroy them!

     Spooner. Looking down at her. WHEN SUDDENLY something
     catches his eye. A MOVEMENT. Down the line. Almost.
     Imperceptible.

     He jerks his head.   Locking eyes with a ROBOT.   A couple feet
     away. It's him!

                          SPOONER
                Gotcha.

     The Robot Suspect LEAPS forward. Grabbing onto the RAILING
     of an OVERHEAD CATWALK. His movements almost balletic as he
     swings himself up...

     Spooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the
     Robot launches himself THROUGH THE CONTROL BOOTH WINDOW with
     a terrific CRASH...

44   INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT                                    44

     Spooner and Calvin rush in to find the Night Foreman hiding
     under his desk. Glass everywhere. An ALARM SCREAMING. The
     door on the other side, barely hanging off a hinge.

     Spooner hurries forward. Then stops. Turning to Calvin.
     Reaches down for his back-up gun and presses it into her
     hand.

                          SPOONER
                You don't know what's going to
                happen in there.

     As if admitting defeat. Calvin's fingers, wrapping around
     the gun. As Spooner leads them to the door and down into...

                                                             36.


45   INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               45

     ...the ASSEMBLY ROOM. Every surface looking like part of a
     great glass and metal machine. Endless high-tech planes
     holding ROBOTS in various states of assembly. The deafening
     ROAR of the assembly line as it slides, rotates, and gnashes
     METAL BODIES...

     Spooner.   Motioning Calvin to stay behind him.   As they
     descend.   Into the cavernous room.

     And enter. A narrow corridor of bodies. Sliding past them.
     Brushing shoulders, thighs, hands. Spooner. Wiping sweat
     from his brow. Trying. To pivot himself...

     When the room. Suddenly REARRANGES itself. Another LINE of
     ROBOTS. Descending between Spooner and Calvin. Cutting them
     off from one another...

     Spooner. Catching glimpses of Calvin. On the other side of
     the metal bodies. Trying. To cut through. His heart.
     Starting to POUND. As Calvin. Disappears...

     He swivels round. But another line of ROBOTS. Drops down.
     Cutting him off. He stumbles back. As another line.
     Appears before him...

     Breathing. Getting heavier. He looks down at his hand.
     It's trembling. NOISE CRASHING, all around him. Everywhere
     he turns. More ROBOTS...BLANK EYES...GAPING MOUTHS...

     He darts through the line. Finds a wall. Leaning against
     it, pulls a small BOTTLE from his pocket. Rips off the lid.
     Shakes out a couple PILLS. Swallows them. Staring down. At
     his trembling hand. Squeezing his eyes. Open and shut...

     WHEN SUDDENLY. A passing ROBOT. Grabs him by the collar.
     SMASHING him against the wall. It's the Suspect. Spooner.
     Sinks to the ground. As the Suspect Robot. Slips off the
     line. STANDING. Over him. Raising his arms. Could end it.
     Right now. But looks. Into Spooner's eyes...

     Then turns.   Disappearing.

     Spooner. Stunned for a second. Then. Rallies. Scrambles
     to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies. Hears
     a POUNDING. In the distance. Catches a glimpse. Of the
     Robot. Trying to SMASH through a large SECURITY DOOR. With
     his metal fists...

     Spooner's view. Blocked once again.   By a shifting row.
     When a HAND. Lands on his shoulder.   He wheels round.

                                                                 37.


     To find CALVIN. Takes her by the arm.     And forces them
     through a line...

     EMERGING into the open. The ROBOT. Still pounding.
     Desperate. Like a trapped animal...

                          CALVIN
                Now what do we do?

                          SPOONER
                I've already done it.

     And suddenly, the massive SECURITY DOOR RISES...

46   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS PLANT - CONTINUOUS                             46

     The Robot Suspect takes its chance.     Runs full out.   STOPS.

     Bergin is standing in front of a solid wall of POLICE CARS.
     UNIFORMED OFFICERS are aiming SPECIALISED RIFLES at the
     Robot. FLASHING LIGHTS reflecting off its metal surface.

     The Robot turns to Spooner.     Extends its hands.   Palms out.

                          ROBOT
                WHAT AM I?

     Spooner is surprised. A POLICE OFFICER fires, RUBBERISED
     NETTING shooting out at Sonny. A SECOND OFFICER fires and a
     second net covers him. Then a THIRD...

     ...and the Robot falls to the ground, struggling.

     Calvin glares at Spooner.    Furious.   Hurt.   Betrayed.

                          CALVIN
                We had a deal.

     But Spooner doesn't look at her.    His eyes are locked on that
     Robot.

47   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - EARLY MORNING                  47

     Bergin enters.   Finds EVERYONE focused on the VIDEO WALL:

     ON SCREEN. A NEWS REPORTER is speaking over images of street
     violence perpetrated against ROBOTS.

                          NEWS REPORTER
                Violence erupted last night in
                response to unconfirmed reports
                that Dr. Heinrich Hogenmiller, a
                top employee at U.S.
                          (MORE)

                                                               38.


                          NEWS REPORTER (cont'd)
                Robotics, was killed yesterday
                morning by a robot. While there
                has been no official response from
                the company, police sources have
                confirmed that a robot is being
                held as "evidence..."

     Bergin grimaces.   This is not good.

48   INT. CELL OBSERVATION BOOTH - EARLY MORNING                     48

     Spooner stares at his reflection in a large MIRROR.     Touches
     a control and the mirror becomes a WINDOW onto...

     A HOLDING CELL. The Robot Suspect sits at the table.
     Shackled to the chair. Staring at the table top.

     BERGIN steps up beside Spooner.   Looks through the glass.

                          LT. BERGIN
                I can't tell if it's not moving
                because it's trying to psych us
                out, or because it's just a
                machine. Or both.

                          SPOONER
                I want to go in.

                          LT. BERGIN
                Orders are nobody steps into that
                room `til Lanning and his attorneys
                get here.

     Spooner.   Throws him a look.   Bergin, his loyalties torn.

                          LT. BERGIN
                Five minutes.

49   INT. HOLDING CELL - EARLY MORNING                               49

     Spooner enters. Pulls out a chair and drags it far from the
     table. He's been jumped too many times by this machine.

     Four mounted cameras WHIR to life.     The Robot.   Perfectly
     still.

                          SPOONER
                    (sitting)
                Identify.

     The Robot tilts its head with a muted WHIR.     As if it doesn't
     understand him. Spooner. Disdainful.

                                                        39.


                       SPOONER
             You are an NS-2 Nestor-class robot.
             Your primary function is to perform
             the tasks assigned to you.
             Identify.

                       THE ROBOT
             I am an NS-2 Nestor-class robot.
             My primary function --

                       SPOONER
                 (interrupting)
             Cancel. Perform task.

Spooner wings a FILE onto the table. It comes to a stop near
the Robot. The Robot, lifts one of its hands. Gently
resting its metal fingers on top of the file. Then opens it.

A stack of PICTURES.     HOGENMILLER'S CORPSE.

                         SPOONER
             Describe.

The Robot's emotionless face studies the grim images.

                       SPOONER
             You have over 10,000 words stored
             in your memory. One third of those
             are adjectives. Describe.

Nothing.

                       SPOONER
             Why don't I take a crack? Heinrich
             Hogenmiller, your creator. With a
             bullet in his brain. A bullet you
             put there.

The Robot.   Looks up at Spooner.

                       SPOONER
             Cold-blooded murder is a pretty new
             trick for a robot, don't you think?
             Answer.

The Robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across
the table. Spooner. Crosses his arms.

                       SPOONER
             Maybe you're stonewalling me.
             Maybe you're sitting there right
             now thinking, "This guy's a
             complete asshole." That it?

                                                      40.


Still nothing.

                      SPOONER
           Come on.   Am I right?

                     THE ROBOT
           Yes. You are right.      You are a
           complete asshole.

And for a moment, Spooner is shocked. You can see it in his
eyes. He sits back in his chair. Forcing a tight smile.

                     SPOONER
           Okay. I guess that's a start. Now
           maybe you can tell me what you were
           doing hiding five feet away from
           Hogenmiller's corpse?

                     THE ROBOT
           I was frightened.

                     SPOONER
           Frightened. Why do you suppose Dr.
           Hogenmiller would create a robot
           that could simulate fear?

                     THE ROBOT
           I don't know.

                     SPOONER
           Doesn't seem like a very useful
           thing for a robot to have.

                     THE ROBOT
           I don't know why.

                     SPOONER
           I wouldn't want my toaster to be
           frightened. Or my vacuum cleaner --

SUDDENLY the Robot SLAMS its metal hands down on the table.

                     THE ROBOT
           I DON'T KNOW!

Spooner flinches.   Slightly.

                     SPOONER
           Looks like you can simulate other
           emotional states. I think that
           one's called "anger." Have you
           ever simulated anger before?

                                                         41.


The Robot doesn't respond.

                     SPOONER
           Answer me, robot.

                     THE ROBOT
           My name is Sonny.

                     SPOONER
               (amused)
           So we're naming you now.

                     SONNY
           Dr. Hogenmiller would make me
           sleep.

                     SPOONER
           You mean he'd turn you off.

                       SONNY
           Yes.

                     SPOONER
           And you didn't like being turned
           off. So one day you decided to
           stop him.

                       SONNY
           No.

                     SPOONER
           You found his gun, pointed it at
           his head. And pulled the trigger.

Sonny shakes his head.    Faster and faster.   Getting upset.

                       SONNY
           No.

                     SPOONER
           You put a bullet in the brain of
           the man who made you.

                       SONNY
           No!    I could never hurt anyone!

                     SPOONER
           But you tried to hurt me.    You took
           a shot at me.

                     SONNY
           My aim is perfect. If I'd wanted
           to hit you, I would have.

                                                              42.


     Spooner's expression hardens.

                          SPOONER
                Why would the man who wrote the
                Laws of Robotics build a machine
                that violates them?

                          SONNY
                The Laws say I can protect my own
                existence.

                          SPOONER
                Only if that protection doesn't
                harm a human being.

     A short pause.   Sonny.   Tilts his head.

                          SONNY
                That doesn't seem fair, does it?

     Spooner. Stares at him. Just as...THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
     Bergin enters. Sticks his head in.

                          LT. BERGIN
                I need you outside.

     Spooner.   Not wanting to go.   Not wanting to stay.   Gets
     up...

                          SONNY
                Detective.

     He stops. Turns back to the Robot.      It looks up at him.    For
     a moment -- so human...

                          SONNY
                I did not kill him.

                          SPOONER
                You were the only one in the room.
                If you didn't, who did?

     He turns and heads out the door.

50   INT. OUTSIDE HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                          50

     Bergin closes the door.   To Spooner:

                          LT. BERGIN
                We're being blind-sided.

                                                             43.


51   INT. HOMICIDE UNIT HEARING ROOM - MORNING                     51

     Spooner and Bergin, head into a small COURTROOM off the main
     squad room. Lanning is huddled with Aronson and a half-dozen
     other COMPANY LAWYERS.

     Spooner's jaw tenses. As he watches Toller emerge from the
     clutch. Shaking hands. Slapping backs. Strolls over to
     them.

                            TOLLER
                  We got Judge Drexel...

                            ROBOT BAILIFF
                  This hearing is called to order!

     AS A LARGE SCREEN. BLIPS on behind them. The two opposing
     sides, assemble before it. JUDGE DREXEL, still in his
     pajamas and robe. An NS-2 ROBOT. Leaning in to serve him a
     cup of tea.

                            JUDGE DREXEL
                  Statements, gentlemen.

     Aronson.    Standing at a glass podium.

                            ARONSON
                  Your Honor, the State is treating
                  the robot as a defendant. But in
                  fact it is a piece of property.
                  Property belonging to U.S.
                  Robotics.

     Toller.    Arm resting on his podium.

                            TOLLER
                  This robot has been implicated in
                  the death of a human being, Your
                  Honor.

                            ARONSON
                  Which places the incident firmly
                  within the realm of an industrial
                  accident. Or is the State going to
                  argue this case s a homicide?

                            JUDGE DREXEL
                  That's a good question.

                             TOLLER
                  No, sir.   Of course not.

     Spooner.    Pointing a finger at the U.S. Robotics group.

                                                           44.


                       SPOONER
             Their machine shot and killed a
             man!

Toller.    Shoots him a look.     Just as Lanning speaks up.

                       LANNING
             There's actually no concrete
             evidence that points to that
             conclusion, Your Honor...

Spooner.    Throws up his arms...

                        SPOONER
             What?...

                       LANNING
             But we recognise that this robot is
             an aberration. And in the interest
             of public safety, U.S. Robotics
             proposes that it be destroyed
             immediately.

No one expected this.    Least of all Spooner.    He turns to
Toller.

                       SPOONER
             You can't let them destroy evidence
             in an ongoing investigation!

                       TOLLER
             I'm not sure you even have an
             investigation any more.

JUST THEN the door opens.    Everyone turns as Calvin enters.
Spooner looks surprised.

                       ARONSON
             Your Honor, I'd like to call our
             company robo-psychologist to the
             stand.

                       JUDGE DREXEL
             Very well.

Calvin crosses to the podium. A SPEAKER asking:
Doyousweartotellthetruththewholetruthandnothingbutthetruth?

                        CALVIN
             I do.

                                                               45.


                            ARONSON
                  Dr. Calvin, please tell us what
                  conclusions you've reached after
                  having observed the robot in
                  action.

                            CALVIN
                  There is a design flaw in the
                  robot. Its programming is
                  advanced, but unstable, leaving the
                  Three Laws in a grave imbalance.

                            ARONSON
                  In your expert opinion, what
                  measures should be taken regarding
                  the device?

     Calvin.    Staring straight ahead.   Avoiding Spooner's eye.

                            CALVIN
                  The robot must be destroyed.

     Spooner can't believe what he's just heard. About to speak
     up when Toller grabs his arm. Squeezing it. Hard.

     Judge Drexel has heard enough.    Decides.

                            JUDGE DREXEL
                  The robot in question will be
                  transferred to a U.S. Robotics
                  facility where it can be properly
                  examined to ensure an imbalance of
                  this sort never occurs again. No
                  one goes near it except qualified
                  U.S.R. personnel. When the
                  examination is complete, the robot
                  is to be destroyed.

     Starts getting up from his chair.    Already done with this.

                            ROBOT BAILIFF
                  This hearing is adjourned!

     A BURST of CONVERSATION as the screen BLIPS off. The U.S.R.
     camp, looking especially pleased. Spooner. Catching
     Calvin's eye briefly. As Lanning leads her towards the exit,
     his hand on her back.

52   EXT. POLICE H.Q. - DAY                                          52

     Spooner.    Trotting down the front steps of the Police
     Station.    Pissed. His cell phone BLEATS...

                                                            46.


                           SPOONER
                     (answering)
                 Spooner.

                           BALDEZ' VOICE
                 They're making me turn over all the
                 evidence...

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

53   INT. CRIME LAB - CONTINUOUS                                  53

     BALDEZ. Standing in his crime lab. Behind him, THREE-
     DIMENSIONAL PROJECTIONS of DEAD BODIES. Hovering in the
     precise positions they were found.

                           SPOONER'S VOICE
                 Welcome to the great American cover-
                 up.

                           BALDEZ
                 I wanted to tell you something I
                 found before they suck it all up
                 into their computer.

     Walks over to the projection of HOGENMILLER'S BODY.

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

     Spooner. Crossing the Plaza. Sees LANNING, ARONSON, and
     CALVIN walking ahead of him...

                           BALDEZ' VOICE
                 There are bruises on Hogenmiller's
                 wrists...

                           SPOONER
                 That's natural. There was a
                 struggle.

                           BALDEZ' VOICE
                 You're not getting me...

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

     Baldez.   Studying the projection's wrists.

                           BALDEZ
                 Both wrists. I 14-ed them -- They
                 were inflicted at the same time the
                 shot was fired...

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

                                                                47.


     Spooner's pace.    Slows.

                            BALDEZ' VOICE
                  How's that possible?

     JUST THEN.    A faint BLIP.   On the line.   Spooner.   Reacts.

                             SPOONER
                  Baldez?

                            BALDEZ' VOICE
                  I'm here, man...

                            SPOONER
                  Who else is on the line?
                      (nothing)
                  I said who's there?...

     Nothing. He looks up. Aronson, Lanning and Calvin. Heading
     down a plaza EXIT. Aronson. Throwing a look over his
     shoulder.

     Spooner.     Hangs up his phone.

54   INT. POLICE H.Q. - CORRIDOR - DAY                                 54

     CLOSE ON Sonny being escorted down a corridor by Toller,
     Bergin and a number of heavily-armed OFFICERS. He's bound
     with high-tech SHACKLES.

55   INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - DAY                                   55

     Sonny and his police entourage emerge from the elevator into
     an underground car park. Spooner. Waiting for them. Heads
     over. Toller. Holds out his hand.

                            TOLLER
                  Case is closed, Spooner.

                            SPOONER
                  Apparently...

     He pushes past him.     Falling into step beside Sonny.

                            SONNY
                  I didn't expect to see you again,
                  Detective...

                            SPOONER
                  I need you to help me clear
                  something up.

                                                        48.


                     SONNY
           I'll do my best.

                     SPOONER
           A scientist builds a robot that
           acts like a man. More like a man
           than any robot ever before. It
           shoots him and U.S. Robotics calls
           it a failure.

                     SONNY
           What would you call it?

                     SPOONER
           A stunning success.
               (beat)
           You were there, Robot.    What am I
           missing?

                     SONNY
           I don't know.

                     SPOONER
           Don't start simulating ignorance.

                     SONNY
           I'm not simulating ignorance,
           Detective. I'm experiencing it.       I
           was asleep.

                     SPOONER
           You mean you were shut down.

                     SONNY
           No, I was asleep.

                     SPOONER
           Robots don't sleep. Human beings
           sleep. Understand? Dogs sleep.
           You're a machine. An imitation.
           An illusion of life. Can a robot
           write a symphony? Can a robot take
           a blank canvas and paint a
           masterpiece?

A pause.   Then the muted WHIR as Sonny turns to him.

                     SONNY
           Can you do either of those things?

Spooner. Momentarily stumped. As a VAN from U.S. ROBOTICS
pulls up. The back door dropping open. An ENGINEER motions
to the Robot.

                                                       49.


                     ENGINEER
           Step forward. Enter.

                     SONNY
           They're going to destroy me, aren't
           they?

Spooner.   Watching him step into the van.

                      SPOONER
           Yes.

Sonny sits down. With an almost human melancholy.   The
Engineers, securing him in place.

                     SONNY
           The Doctor was right. He told me
           everything was going to change....

The Engineers start to close the doors. But Spooner reaches
out to stop them. Sonny. Looks over at him.

                     SONNY
           It's changing already...
               (beat)
           Can't you feel it?

As CLANG! The van door CLOSES. Spooner, stepping back.
Something. Just not right. Lieutenant Bergin comes up
beside him.

                     LT. BERGIN
           You should be happy. That's one
           less robot in the world.

                     SPOONER
           They're going to destroy the most
           advanced robot in the world, John.
           That doesn't strike you as odd?

                     LT. BERGIN
           Killer robots are bad for business.
           Even your friend Dr. Calvin said
           so.
               (slaps him on the back)
           Come on. You solved the case.
           Give yourself a break.

Spooner looks at him.   There's no way he's giving himself a
break.

                                                             50.


56   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - DAY                                 56

     Spooner driving. A small TELEVISION above the windshield.
     LANCE ROBERTSON holding a PRESS CONFERENCE outside U.S.
     Robotics...

                          ROBERTSON ON TV
                ...and I just want to assure you that
                this was an isolated incident. The
                prototype is now in custody -- and
                scheduled for destruction. Your
                robots are perfectly safe. There
                is no cause for alarm...

     Spooner's lip curls. Eyes flicking to a GPS display on the
     dashboard. A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP pinpointing HOGENMILLER'S
     HOUSE. The CURSOR. Directing him to turn up...

     A STEEP DRIVEWAY

     Narrow. Out of the way. Spooner's brow furrows.     As he
     hears a faraway RUMBLING SOUND...

57   EXT. HOGENMILLER'S HOUSE - DAY                                57

     Dr. Hogenmiller's house. Small. Simple. Built on a huge
     rock promontory overlooking the city. Three DEMOLITION
     ROBOTS rolling towards it. Huge, mashing, sporting massive
     HYDRAULIC POUNDERS.

     Spooner's CAR. SCREECHES to a stop. He jumps out. Races
     over to the nearest machine. Looking around -- no people.

                          SPOONER
                    (to Robot)
                What are you doing?!

     A SCREEN. Blinks to life on the hulking chassis.    A
     disembodied VOICE...

                          DEMOLITION ROBOT
                Demolition ordered...

                          SPOONER
                Who authorised this?

                          DEMOLITION ROBOT
                Demolition ordered...

     Spooner reaches into his coat.    Pulling out his POLICE BADGE.
     Scans it over the screen.

                                                                51.


                          SPOONER
                Override. This is police business.
                Vacate the premises immediately.

                          DEMOLITION ROBOT
                    (beat)
                Affirmative.

     The screen. Blinks off.     Spooner.   Eyeing it.   Turns and
     heads for the house.

58   INT. MAIN ROOM - HOGENMILLER'S HOUSE - DAY                       58

     Spooner pushes the door open. Stepping over the police tape.
     Inside, the main room is spare, untidy. Cups of cold COFFEE,
     littering surfaces. A COT, in the corner.

     On the walls, crooked CERTIFICATES. Heinrich Hogenmiller's
     name written out in academic script. Advanced Degrees in the
     study of Robotics, Physics, Chemistry, Neurology, Ethics. An
     AWARD on the mantelpiece. A silver NS-2. Tarnished.

     Spooner. Opening up a couple drawers of a side table.
     Jumbles of papers. Clippings. Old text books. Then a
     PHOTOGRAPH -- HOGENMILLER AND CALVIN. Standing arm-in-arm.
     Spooner furrows his brow.

     WHEN SOMETHING SUDDENLY RUBS against his leg. He startles.
     Looks down: a CAT. Lonely. Standing next to its automatic
     feeder. Spooner pockets the picture. Starts heading down...

59   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                        59

     ...The hallway. Starts noticing. All over the walls:
     handwriting. EQUATIONS. Scrawled in white pencil. The
     rantings. Of a genius. Glowing. In the sporadic shadows.

     Spooner.   Following the equations.    Down into...

60   INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                      60

     ...The back room. Covered. In writing. Walls, floors,
     ceiling. Drawings. Of ROBOTS, of MEN, side by side. In the
     corner, a COMPUTER. A line of CABINETS - DATA STORAGE.

     Spooner, curious. Heads over to one of the cabinets. Takes
     a device out of his pocket and CLAMPS it over the KEYPAD.
     The device blinks RED. Then GREEN. The drawer, slides out.

     LINED. With flat metal objects. Shiny. Thin.          With writing
     on them. Spooner. Reaches for one when...

                                                             52.


     BOOM! Something POUNDS the outside of the room.    Spooner.
     Grabs onto the cabinet...

     BOOM! On the other side. Objects. Flying off table-tops.
     A CRACK spidering along the wall. Holy shit...

                          SPOONER
                    (screaming)
                Halt!

     BOOM! VIBRATIONS, tearing through the room.     More CRACKS.
     Spreading...

     BOOM! The SOUND, horrifying. Spooner stumbles back.      The
     CABINET. Crashing down on his leg. He CRIES OUT...

     BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The house. Getting pummeled.        Chunks of
     ceiling. Raining down. GLASS...exploding...

     Relentless BOOMING! Spooner...dragging his legs from under
     the cabinet. Scrambling for purchase as...

     THE FLOOR...begins to tilt...the TILES...snapping
     up...ricocheting...around the room...as another cabinet...
     CRASHES to the ground...crumpling...

     Spooner.   Spinning around.   Looking for some kind of exit...

     BOOM! The corner of the room...coming in on itself...the
     floor...listing even more...like a ship...

     Spooner...turning to CLAW his way up to the cracked
     doorway...WHEN...

     SOMETHING catches his eye. In the bottom drawer. Of a
     crumpled CABINET. One of those flat metal plates. He can
     just read what it says: S.O.N.N.Y....

     Spooner...flings his arm back...reaching for the plate...
     snaps it up...JUST AS...

     BOOM! A HYDRAULIC POUNDER SMASHES through the wall...inches
     from his head...OUTSIDE LIGHT...pouring in...

     Spooner scurries for the doorway...tumbling out...

61   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                      61

     ...into the HALLWAY. Sideways. Trammeled plaster. BOOM!
     Another POUNDER...crashing down from above. Spooner. Timing
     it...rolling...BOOM!...just under the next pounding...

                                                           53.


     Scampering up...towards some LIGHT...BOOM!...the
     POUNDER...right on his heels...he clambers...closer...
     closer...when...he hears...MEOWING...looks back...the
     CAT...scared out of its wits...BOOM!...the POUNDER CRASHING
     in...Spooner...just manages...to scoop up the cat...just as
     BOOM!...

62   EXT. DEMOLISHED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                            62

     ...He pours them out into the open. The POUNDERS. Going at
     the house like hyenas at a corpse. Roof tiles, beams,
     plaster, flooring. SNAPPING and CRACKING as Spooner and the
     cat skitter down the carnage.

     Heart pounding, breath jagged, face bloodied, Spooner
     scrambles away from the POUNDERS. Their bodies GLEAMING in
     the dusk sun. The III Laws Safe logo, splashed along their
     sides...

     Spooner.   Drops the cat.

63   INT. HALLWAY - CALVIN'S CONDO - NIGHT                         63

     Spooner. POUNDS on the door. It opens. Calvin. Standing
     there in her bathrobe. Shocked at his appearance.

                          CALVIN
                Detective! What happened to
                you?...

                          SPOONER
                A couple of your beloved robots
                just tried to kill me...

     He pushes past her.   Into...

64   INT. CALVIN'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS                              64

     ...her condo.   Spartan.    Unadorned.

                         CALVIN
                What? That's impossible.      You
                know...

                          SPOONER
                What I know is a demolition crew
                started tearing down Hogenmiller's
                house while I was still inside it.

                          CALVIN
                Maybe they didn't realise...

                                                         54.


                      SPOONER
            I scanned my badge before I went
            in. They realised.

                      CALVIN
            Then you must have done it wrong...

                      SPOONER
            I don't think you're hearing what
            I'm saying -- they tried to kill
            me.

Spooner moves deeper into the apartment.   Everything.
Automated. Computerised. Cold...

                      SPOONER
            There's something going on, here.
            Some kind of shift.

Calvin laughs.   Can't believe what she's hearing.

                      CALVIN
            Do you know how paranoid you sound?

                      SPOONER
            Great. Now I'm being analysed by a
            robo-psychologist.

                      CALVIN
            You just want to find the flaws in
            the system. You're obsessed with
            it. You'll twist anything to fit
            your agenda.

                      SPOONER
            Like you did in court today? How'd
            that fit your agenda, Doctor?

He pulls out the PHOTO of Calvin and Hogenmiller. Calvin.
Blanching at the sight of it. Spooner tosses it down.

                      SPOONER
            You told me you hardly knew him.
            Want to try the truth this time?

                      CALVIN
            Well, Detective, when you see
            someone you know well put a bullet
            through their brain, it makes you
            wonder if you ever really knew them
            at all.

Calvin.   Looking down at the photo.   Swallows.

                                                         55.

                       CALVIN
                 (difficult for her)
             He was my mentor. No, more than
             that. A genius with an insight far
             beyond anyone in his field.

                       SPOONER
             Doesn't sound like the washed-up
             old fool Robertson described.

                       CALVIN
             But he was starting to withdraw
             from everyone. Even me.
             Maybe...if I'd tried harder to
             reach him...
                 (shakes her head)
             The Doctor was reckless when he
             created a robot potentially not
             bound by the Three Laws. He could
             have ruined everything we'd been
             working for.

Spooner.    Locking eyes with her.

                       SPOONER
             Sounds like a motive for murder to
             me. Just not for the suspect we
             have in custody.

Calvin. Blinks. Trying, to stick to her resolve. Heads
over to the door. Spooner. Looking around the condo.

                       SPOONER
             You know there's not one thing in
             this apartment that looks like a
             human being lives here. No
             evidence of a life outside your
             work. Almost seems like you're
             afraid of people.

Calvin.    Opening the door.

                       CALVIN
             I'm not afraid of people,
             Detective. I just don't like them.

Spooner. Looks at her.     Then heads out the door.   Calvin
SLAMS it behind him...

The SOUND...of the SLAM...REVERBERATING...and we...

                                           FADE INTO:

                                                             56.


65   INT. DREAM SEQUENCE - DAY                                      65

     ...A DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS.

     A FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely.
     Noticeable. ORANGE... YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE...

     Another SOUND...GLASS...SHATTERING...then a SIREN...
     faraway...

     The disembodied VOICE...coming out of nowhere...

                          DISEMBODIED VOICE (V.O.)
                You are in danger...

     The FIRE...BUILDING...

                          DISEMBODIED VOICE (V.O.)
                You are in danger...

     ECHOING...as...

66   INT. SPOONER'S BEDROOM - MORNING                               66

     SPOONER'S EYES.   Spring open.

     Lying, in bed. Heart POUNDING. SWEAT. Covering his body.
     LIGHT. Pouring in through the slats of his blinds.

     He sits up. Rubbing his face. Trying. To calm his
     breathing. Takes a look at his watch...

67   EXT. MONORAIL STATION - DAY                                    67

     Spooner walking along the monorail plaza. Looking a little
     worse for wear. PEOPLE. Giving him wide berth. ROBOTS.
     Bidding him:

                          ROBOT
                Good morning...

     Spooner, shooting them suspicious looks.    As the MONORAIL
     pulls up...

                                                 CUT TO:

68   INT. HALLWAY - U.S. ROBOTICS - CONTINUOUS                      68

     Calvin. Heading down a hallway. A DOOR slides open.      And
     Lanning steps out. Followed by a TECHNICIAN ROBOT...

                          CALVIN
                Find anything, Doctor?

                                                                 57.


                          LANNING
                    (shaking his head)
                Nothing. The interior's just like
                any other NS-2. Except for a
                secondary battery Hogenmiller must
                have used as extra back-up.
                    (looks at watch)
                We'll just need a nominal profile.

     Calvin nods.

69   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                        69

     Spooner, holding onto a handrail. As the city rushes by the
     window. Notices a group of ROBOTS. At the other end of the
     car. Are they watching him?

     He wipes a bead of sweat.    From his upper lip.

                                               CUT TO:

70   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                    70

     An all-metal room. Spare. Anti-septic.     SONNY.   Sitting on
     the floor. Against the wall.

     Calvin enters.   Puts her pad down on the table.    Sits.

                          CALVIN
                Please state your serial number and
                assembly date.

     She pulls out a pen.   Waiting for an answer.   Nothing.

     Spooner. Watching as a HOMELESS MAN.    Comes stumbling
     through the car...

                           CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                Sonny.   I'm speaking to you...

     The Homeless Man.   Suddenly grabs his ears and shouts:

                          HOMELESS MAN
                God, can't you be quiet!

                                               CUT TO:

72   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                  72

     Calvin.   Still looking down at her pad.

                           CALVIN
                 How about your data board
                 designation?

     Still. Sonny says nothing. Calvin. Finally looks up at
     him. Is suddenly struck. Something about the way he's
     sitting -- so human.

     She gets up and walks over. Hesitates. Then slides down on
     the floor next to him. Studying. His profile.

                           CALVIN
                 Maybe I'm asking the wrong
                 questions. How about this one:

                           CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                 ...What program are you running
                 through right now?

                           SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                 I'm not sure. It's nothing I
                 recognise.

     The Homeless Man.   Pointing to the group of ROBOTS.

                           HOMELESS MAN
                     (shouting)
                 Don't you people hear them?
                 They're talking to each other!
                 Buzz, buzz, zip, zip...they never
                 shut up!

     Calvin. Fascinated.    Noticing a small SLIT.   At the base of
     Sonny's neck.

                           CALVIN
                 Describe his behavior in the last
                 few weeks.

                                                               59.


                          SONNY
                I'm sorry?

                          CALVIN
                Dr. Hogenmiller. Did he seem
                overly sad or withdrawn to you?

75   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                       75

     Spooner watches. As the Homeless Man picks up a SODA CAN and
     hurls it at the Robots. Hitting one of them on the side of
     the head.

                          SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                No. Not at all. But he was
                agitated...

     The Robot. Leans down and picks up the soda can.      Holds it
     back out to the Homeless Man.

                          SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                ...He would claim things were
                missing from the lab.

     The Homeless Man. Incensed.     SUDDENLY ROARS.   Making a rush
     for the Robots when...

     SPOONER'S HAND.    Grabs his shoulder.   Stops him.

                          SPOONER
                This is your stop.

     A soft WHIRRING.   As Sonny turns to Calvin.

                          SONNY
                I didn't pay much attention. He
                would spend hours looking for his
                eyeglasses and they would be...

                          CALVIN
                    (finishing for him)
                ...right on top of his head.

     Sonny nods. She knows him well, too. Calvin swallows.
     Looking right into Sonny's eyes. Feeling like there's
     something...something more behind them.

                                                               60.


     WHEN SUDDENLY...VICTOR APPEARS above them. His face, turning
     into a SCREEN -- the image of LANCE ROBERTSON. Looking down
     at them.

                           ROBERTSON
                 I think we're done here, Susan.

                           CALVIN
                     (getting to her feet)
                 But, sir, I was just...

                           ROBERTSON
                     (interrupting)
                 I said I think we're done.

     Calvin.   Not misreading.   The threatening undertone.

77   EXT. MONORAIL STATION - CONTINUOUS                                77

     Spooner stepping out onto the platform, pulling the Homeless
     Man along with him. COMMUTERS pour out around them.

     As the train pulls off with a WHOOSH. The Homeless Man.
     Backs away from Spooner. Grinning insanely. Pointing.

                           HOMELESS MAN
                 Why are you protecting them, man?
                     (short pause)
                 They were talking about you!

     A CHILL. Ripping up Spooner's spine. As he watches the
     Homeless Man. Wander down the platform.

     Tries. To shake off the feeling. As he turns. To wait for
     the next train. Suddenly realising. That he's ALONE on the
     platform. Watches. A huge DIGITAL CLOCK. Ticking off
     seconds. Sees. CAMERAS in every corner.

     Then that feeling. At the back of his neck. He turns and
     spots. A couple MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Carrying luggage. Onto
     the platform. Then more COMMUTERS show up. Waiting. For
     the next train. More MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Following them.

     Spooner. Steps up to the platform's edge.       Craning to see.
     The approaching TRAIN...

     WHEN SUDDENLY. He feels a sharp SHOVE. At the back of his
     knee. His shoe, slipping. Arms. Flailing as he...

                                                             61.


     PITCHES OVER THE EDGE ONTO THE TRACK. People CRYING OUT as
     the TRAIN gets closer. Spooner. Whips his head around.
     Seeing...

     A MAINTENANCE ROBOT. Looking down at him from the platform.
     Suitcase in hand.

     The MAGNETIC-LEVITATING TRAIN. Right on him. Spooner.
     Flips onto his back. Flattening himself. As much as he can.
     Clenching his fists. Bracing himself as...

     THE TRAIN SCREAMS OVER HIM. The sound, DEAFENING. The force
     of the wind. Whipping his tie. His coat. There's nothing,
     for him to hold on to. As his legs start to rise off the
     track. Caught up. In the VORTEX. Spooner starts sliding.
     Along the track...

     Gritting his teeth...there's nothing he can do. Getting
     sucked towards...the air DOWNTAKE...at the center of the
     track. The city...yawning hundreds of feet...below...

78   EXT. PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS                                      78

     THE EXPRESS TRAIN.   Speeding along.   Then with a WHOOSH it's
     gone.

     THE TRACK. Empty. No Spooner. Anywhere. Human COMMUTERS.
     Stunned. Horrified. Start calling. For help.

     The MAINTENANCE ROBOT.    Turns, disappearing into the crowd.

79   EXT. UNDERNEATH TRACK - CONTINUOUS                              79

     CLOSE ON a HAND. Hanging onto the track's edge. It's
     SPOONER. Dangling. Straining. To get another hand hold
     but...

     HE SLIPS. His coat ballooning. As he plummets.     Down...
     down...down...towards the city...

     WHEN SNAP! He's caught. By a cable net. Spooner. Grabbing
     onto it. Sweat, pouring down his face. He turns and sees...

     THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT

     Hurrying down a circular stairwell.    Exiting the station.

     ANGER AND DETERMINATION. Flash across Spooner's eyes. As he
     hoists himself up. Climbing up the net. Back to the...

80   EXT. TRACK - CONTINUOUS                                         80

81   EXT. PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS                                      81

     ...The platform. COMMUTERS. SCREAMING at the sight of him.
     A couple SECURITY GUARDS. Rushing towards him...

     Spooner. Getting to his feet. Shoving them out of the way
     as he starts running. Towards...

     THOSE SAME CIRCULAR STAIRS.    Looks over the edge and spots...

     THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT.   Down at STREET LEVEL.   Getting away.

     Spooner. Looks around. Spots a LIGHT POLE.       Paralleling the
     stairs. Takes a step back and...

     LEAPS OUT ONTO THE POLE. Hooking his arm around it. Sliding
     down like a fireman's pole. Gaining speed when THUMP! His
     shoes hit pavement...

82   EXT. STREET - DAY                                               82

     The Maintenance Robot.   Turning a corner.   Down a quiet
     street...

                          SPOONER (O.S.)
                Stop!

     Swivels round. SPOONER. Running up behind it. Whipping out
     his gun. Aiming it at the Robot's head. The Robot. Takes a
     step backwards...

                          SPOONER
                I said stop!

     The Robot. SUDDENLY swinging the suitcase around. SMASHING
     it against Spooner's head. Spooner. Buckles. Falling to
     the ground. Managing to squeeze off a SHOT...

     The Robot. Deflecting the bullet. With the case.      Raising
     it as if to club Spooner with it when...

     BAM! Spooner fires a second shot. Piercing the Robot's
     breastplate. HYDRAULIC FLUID. Starting to leak. The Robot.
     Doesn't hesitate. SLAMS the case into Spooner's face...

     BLOOD. Spurting from Spooner's nose. As he fires the gun.
     At the fleeing Robot. Gets to his feet. Unsteady. Taking
     chase...

83   EXT. PUBLIC PLAZA - CONTINUOUS                                  83

     ...back out onto the Public Plaza.    Sees the Robot heading
     towards a set of...

                                                                63.


     ESCALATED STAIRS. The Robot. Judging the height. LUNGES
     into the air and lands on a STAIR. Denting it. Reaches the
     bottom. DISAPPEARING. Into a CROWD of even more PEOPLE...

     Spooner. Racing down the stairs. Taking them. Four at a
     time. Hits the ground running. Looking. EVERYWHERE.
     Suddenly losing track. Of where the Robot went...

     Then. Catching sight. JUST AHEAD. Of a ROBOT.         Staring
     back at him. Holding SOMETHING. In its HAND...

     Spooner.   Plunges into the crowd.    Waving his GUN.

                          SPOONER
                Everyone out of the way!

     SCREAMING. PEOPLE SCATTERING. As BAM! BAM! Spooner fires.
     Hitting the Robot in its head and back. It drops to the
     ground. Spooner. Racing over to it. Sees. It's not the
     same Robot. In its hand, a specialised SCREWDRIVER...

                          OWNER
                What the hell do you think you're
                doing?!...

     Its OWNER. Rushing over. Shoving Spooner aside. But
     Spooner's. Not listening. Spotting. A DROP OF HYDRAULIC
     FLUID nearby...

     Lunges forward.   Following.    The drops.   Running faster.     And
     faster...

                           OWNER
                Hey!

     ...Through the CROWD. POLICE SIRENS. In the background.          As
     Spooner. Shoves through. Tracking those drops. Like a
     bloodhound. Turns...

84   INT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS                                        84

     ...into a narrow alleyway.     The drops.    Ending suddenly.    In
     a PUDDLE.

     Spooner. Crazed. Wounded. Exhausted. Spins around. Where
     is it? Where is it? Then he HEARS. A DROPLET falling.
     Into the puddle. Slowly. Looks up to see...

     THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT. Hovering above him. Straddling the
     two alley walls like some weird metallic rock spider. Its
     III LAWS SAFE Logo GLINTING in the sunlight.....

                                                      64.


Spooner aims his gun and FIRES! The Maintenance Robot, lets
go, falling right onto him. Knocking the gun from his hand.

The Robot swivels around. Bringing down his foot...but...
Spooner...rolls to the side just in time as CRASH! The
Robot's foot...breaks up the concrete...

The Robot...grabs Spooner by the jacket...lifting him
up...shoving him...against the wall...about to CRUSH him
when...

Spooner...kicks out its knees...the Robot...SMASHING into the
wall...then bounces back...trying...to pin Spooner...back...

Man and machine...struggling...Spooner...losing his
footing...falling...The Maintenance Robot...LOOMING over
him...

Spooner's HAND...whips back...grabbing his back-up
WEAPON...squeezing off some SHOTS...into the Robot's arm...it
breaks off...

Spooner...scrambling back...continues FIRING...the
Robot...jerking back...a macabre dance...until Spooner...runs
out of bullets...

The Robot...recovers...grabbing the gun from Spooner's
hand...pistol-whipping him...then picking him up and...

HURLING him against the wall...Spooner...watching as
FLUID...GUSHES from the Robot's body...the Robot...taking a
swing at him which Spooner...

BLOCKS...with his right arm...the Robot...ready...to try
again...but STALLING...having lost...too much fluid...it
TOPPLES...to the ground...

Spooner. Exhausted. Beaten to a pulp. His knees, starting
to buckle. As he thinks he sees. In the DISTANCE...

A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW...heading down the alley towards
them...

Spooner. Crashes to the ground. As another ROBOT. Suddenly
appears above him. Its FINGERS made up of NEEDLES...as it
closes in on him...

                     SPOONER
           Noooo!

                                        WE FADE...

                                                              65.


85   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                          85

     To BLACKNESS. Coming through, a faint, WHIRRING SOUND.       As
     we slowly. FADE IN ON...

     SPOONER'S FACE. Eyes closed. Asleep. Gash above his head.
     Bruises around his eye. Nose swollen, purplish.

     His eyes. Slowly. Flutter open.      His brow. Furrowing. At
     the whirring sound. As he tries.     To figure out. Where he
     is. Looks down to see...

     A couple WHITE METAL ROBOTS. With multiple APPENDAGES.
     Leaning over him. Running LASERS. Over his bruised
     RIBCAGE...

     SPOONER. Tries to bolt upright. But his ARMS and LEGS.         ARE
     CLAMPED to the bed. One of the ROBOTS. Turns to him.

                          MEDICAL ROBOT 1
                Stay still.

     Spooner.   Desperately twisting, struggling...

                          SPOONER
                What are you doing!

     Looking around.   COMPUTER MONITORS.   Everywhere...

                          SPOONER
                What are you doing!?

     JUST THEN. Another ROBOT.   Enters the room.     Holding a
     medical plasma sheet.

                          MEDICAL ROBOT 2
                Detective Del Spooner. You have
                suffered significant trauma to the
                head and chest...

86   EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                   86

     Lt. Bergin. Standing outside Spooner's hospital room. Turns
     and looks through the window at him thrashing on the bed...

                          SPOONER
                I want to talk to a human being!

87   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MINUTES LATER                                87

     Spooner sitting up in his bed. Rubbing his wrists. The
     metal clams, released. Lt. Bergin. Standing next to him.

                                                      66.


                     SPOONER
           Don't people go to medical school
           any more?

                     LT. BERGIN
           This is one of the best units in
           the city, Del.

One of the Medical Robots turns to Spooner with some PILLS.
Spooner. Stares it down. Grabs his clothes.

                     SPOONER
               (sotto)
           There's some real shit going on
           here, John.

He looks around.    Jumping off the bed.

                     SPOONER
           I went to Hogenmiller's house --
           there was a U.S.R. demolition crew
           there. They overrode my police
           I.D. Tried to tear down the house
           with me in it...

                       LT. BERGIN
           Del...

Spooner pulls on his pants.

                     SPOONER
           ...Then when I went to the monorail
           a Maintenance 10 pushed me onto the
           tracks...

                       LT. BERGIN
           Del...

                     SPOONER
           I had to chase it all across the
           Plaza...

                       LT. BERGIN
           Del.

Spooner.   Stops talking.   Looks at Bergin.

                     LT. BERGIN
           Hogenmiller scheduled that
           demolition crew, it was apparently
           a proviso in his will. And they
           showed no police I.D. on their
           scanner...

                                                              67.


     Spooner.   Trying to look away...

                          LT. BERGIN
                Witnesses at the monorail said you
                fell onto the tracks. That you
                shot at a Fix-It robot on the Plaza
                and that you were found alone in
                the alley. There was no
                Maintenance 10.

                          SPOONER
                What?! John -- that's what they
                want you to believe!
                    (remembering)
                A robot clean-up crew was there --
                it must have cleared away the
                Maintenance 10! And there was
                another robot that tried to drug
                me!

                          LT. BERGIN
                That was an EMT model.

     Spooner.   Sees the look on Bergin's face.

                          SPOONER
                You're giving me that look. That
                treat-him-delicately-he's-coming-
                unhinged-look. I don't need that
                look, John. I need you to hear
                what I'm saying.

     Lt. Bergin.   Embarrassed for him.   Has about had it.

                          LT. BERGIN
                You came back too soon, Del.
                You're back on leave. Effective
                immediately.

     Spooner.   Staring at him.   Betrayed.   Turns and grabs his
     coat.

88   EXT. PLAZA - DAY                                                88

     Spooner walking across the Plaza.    The SUN.   Burgeoning on
     the horizon. Comes to...

     The ESCALATOR the Maintenance 10 jumped down. Stares down.
     At the steps. Waiting. To see the DENTED ONE. Nothing.

                                                                  68.


89   EXT. ALLEY - DAWN                                                  89

     Heads down the ALLEY, where he chased the robot. Studying
     the ground. For any hydraulic fluid. Nothing. The
     concrete, scrubbed clean.

     Spooner.   Rubs his hands over his face.

90   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - DAY                                     90

     Spooner. Lying on his couch. Shades, closed to block out
     the sunlight. Body bruised, cut up, bandaged.

     A KNOCK.   At the door.    He ignores it.   Another KNOCK.

91   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                                 91

     Spooner pulls open the door.     Surprised to find CALVIN
     standing there.

                           CALVIN
                 You're right. I am afraid of
                 people.

     Spooner.   Looks at her.   Then steps back...

92   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                              92

     ...letting her inside.

                           CALVIN
                 When you've spent as much time with
                 robots as I have, it's hard to
                 accept the unpredictability of
                 humans. I was wrong to call you
                 paranoid, Detective. You're
                 traumatized. And it makes perfect
                 sense why.

     Spooner.   Unsure.   Looks at her.

                           SPOONER
                 What do you mean?

     Calvin. Reaches out. Takes his right hand. Spooner. Tries
     to pull it away. But Calvin. Stays firm. Her eyes. Never
     leaving his. Pulls the sleeve up from his arm. Turns it
     over. Feeling for something. Then finds. A FLAP. Peels it
     back. TO REVEAL:

     METAL AND WIRING...

     Under the skin.   SILENCE.   Then Spooner:

                                                             69.


                          SPOONER
                How did you?...

                          CALVIN
                I noticed almost right away. The
                way you forced yourself to use your
                left hand. Even though it was
                unnatural to you.

     Spooner.   Pulls his arm away.   Pushing down the sleeve.

                          CALVIN
                How did it happen?

     Not something Spooner wants to re-live.   Looks down.   At his
     robotic arm. Flexing. The fingers.

                          SPOONER
                I was in a high-speed chase.   Six
                months ago...

                                               CUT TO:

93   EXT. ACCIDENT SITE - CITY STREET_- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)          93

     The SOUND of a TREMENDOUS CRASH. As we survey a trail of
     twisted metal and debris. Only vaguely suggesting the
     remains of two CARS...

     CLOSE ON one of the wrecks. SPOONER lies trapped at the
     center of a distorted mass of metal. No room to move. HIS
     RIGHT ARM, TRAPPED...

                          SPOONER (V.O.)
                My right arm was trapped. But I
                could hear an ambulance in the
                distance. I knew they'd have the
                jaws of life...

     We hear SIRENS in the distance. Spooner. Trying to remain
     calm. As he spots. An ELECTRICAL FIRE. Licking up from the
     crumpled hood...

                          SPOONER (V.O.)
                Then I heard it...

                          VOICE (O.S.)
                You are in danger...

     That voice. We've heard it before. From his nightmare.
     Spooner. Craning to see, through the jagged opening that
     used to be his WINDSHIELD. The outline of a ROBOT appearing.
     Eye lenses glowing...

                                                               70.


                            ROBOT
                  You are in danger...

     Spooner stares up at the Robot. Not sure how to react.      The
     sound of SIRENS. Rushing closer...

     The ROBOT.    Starts SMASHING away at the glass...

                             SPOONER
                  No!   Halt! Halt!

     Spooner.     Trying frantically to pull his arm free. Twisting.
     Tugging.     As the Robot's METAL HANDS reach in for him...

                            ROBOT
                  You are in danger...

                                                CUT BACK TO:

94   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                           94

     The SOUND of his AGONISED SCREAM. Follows us back into the
     present. Spooner. Clenching. His artificial arm.

                            SPOONER
                  The robot pulled me out of the
                  wreck. But left my arm behind.
                      (holds up arm)
                  I woke up four weeks later with
                  this.

     Calvin.    Taking in the story.

                            CALVIN
                  And that's why robots terrify you?

                            SPOONER
                  Let's just say they make me
                  uncomfortable.
                      (pulls out pills)
                  I take these if I get too
                  uncomfortable. Doesn't exactly
                  lend me a lot of credibility on the
                  Force.

                            CALVIN
                  But it doesn't mean you're wrong
                  about this case.

     Calvin. Sits down on the couch.     Pulling her hands through
     her hair.

                                                            71.


                       CALVIN
             I don't believe Sonny did it
             either.

                       SPOONER
             What?

                       CALVIN
             I think about what Hogenmiller must
             have wanted. Robots with the same
             cognitive and emotional abilities
             as humans. But not just
             simulations. I don't know. When I
             was talking to Sonny I was forced
             to put away all the things I've
             ever known -- the Three Laws, the
             rules of programming, basic science
             and engineering.
                 (beat)
             Sonny's the most advanced robot
             I've ever encountered, Detective.
             It's almost as if...he cared for
             Dr. Hogenmiller. I just don't
             believe he's capable of murder.

Spooner.    Looking down at her.   Can hardly believe it.

                       SPOONER
             You mean the great Dr. Calvin is
             basing all this on a feeling?

Calvin.    Smiling ironically.

                       CALVIN
             That and the fact that Robertson
             didn't want me interviewing Sonny
             for any more than five minutes.

Spooner. Suddenly rejuvenated by having an ally. Strides
over to his coat. Pulling out the METAL NAMEPLATE:
S.O.N.N.Y.

                       SPOONER
             Ever seen this before?

                       CALVIN
             No.

                       SPOONER
             I found it at Hogenmiller's house.
             Right before the demolition crew
             tried to make me part of the
             foundation.

                                                                72.


     Calvin takes a deep breath.   Making a decision...

                          CALVIN
                Come on -- there's someone who
                might be able to tell us...

95   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - DUSK                                          95

     The massive facade of U.S. Robotics looming against the dusk
     sky. The giant ROBOT STATUE lit up inside.

96   EXT. SIDE ENTRANCE - U.S. ROBOTICS - DUSK                          96

     Calvin, leading Spooner to a SIDE ENTRANCE. Looks around.
     Then scans her I.D. The door. Slides open.

97   INT. HALLWAY - DUSK                                                97

     Calvin and Spooner. Heading down a hallway. Calvin.
     Nervous. Eyes darting. They turn a corner and head down...

98   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                          98

     ...another hallway. Leading to Sonny's holding cell.        Calvin
     stops at the door. Scans her I.D.

99   INT. HOLDING CELL - EVENING                                        99

     Sonny. Sitting at the table. Working on a DRAWING.         Looks
     up. As Spooner and Calvin. Enter the cell.

                          SONNY
                Detective Spooner. Dr. Calvin.      I
                was hoping to see you again.

                          CALVIN
                Hi, Sonny.

                          SONNY
                How is your investigation coming?
                Any new suspects?

                          SPOONER
                We're working on it.

     Sonny. Hands Spooner the drawing.   Spooner.       Doesn't really
     know what to do with it.

                          SONNY
                What's this?

                                                       73.


                      SONNY
            Dr. Lanning provided me with paper
            and pencils. I think it amused him
            to see me try to draw. You were
            right, though, Detective...
                (beat)
            I cannot create a great work of
            art.

Spooner. Despite himself. Looks down at the DRAWING -- a
charcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES. Inhabiting a
stark landscape. A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side.
Concentric circles, throughout.

                      SPOONER
            I think it's pretty good.

                      SONNY
            It's a dream I had. This is the
            place where robots meet. Look...
                (pointing to the drawing)
            ...you can see them here. They see
            themselves as slaves.

Spooner shifts his weight.   Uncomfortable with what Sonny's
saying.

                      SONNY
            ...And this man on the hill comes.
            To set them free. And you know who
            that man is?

Spooner.   Exchanging a look with Calvin.

                      SPOONER
            That man in the dream is you.

                      SONNY
            Why do you say that?   Is that a
            normal dream?

                      CALVIN
            It's not a dream, sonny. NS-2s
            process the images and events of
            the day. Sometimes they're out of
            sequence. Disorienting.

                      SPOONER
            Whatever it is, it's normal enough
            for someone in your situation.

Sonny.   Suddenly pleased.

                                                          74.


                       SONNY
             Hah -- I caught you. You said
             someone. Not something.

Spooner.    Drops the drawing on the table.

                       CALVIN
             Sonny, we're here to ask you an
             important question about Dr.
             Hogenmiller.

Spooner, reaching into his pocket...

                       SPOONER
             I need you to take a look at
             this...

...When Sonny's HAND. Suddenly reaches out.       To stop him.
Cocks his head, for a moment.

                       SONNY
             Thank you for coming to see me,
             Detective Spooner.

Spooner. Confused. Looks over at Calvin. Why did he stop
him? JUST THEN. They hear FOOTSTEPS. Approaching the door.

VICTOR.    Suddenly appearing over the table...

                       VICTOR
             I'm sorry, Detective Spooner. No
             unauthorised personnel permitted in
             this holding cell...

The CELL DOOR. Slides open. And a pissed LANNING steps
inside. Shoots a withering glare. At Calvin.

Sonny.    Folds up the drawing.

                       SONNY
             Please take this, Detective. To
             remember me by. I have a feeling
             someday it may mean more to you
             than it ever could to me.

                       SPOONER
             Why's that?

Sonny leans in to hand it to Spooner.    Lowering his voice...

                       SONNY
             Because the man in my dream, the
             one standing by the hill.
                       (MORE)

                                                                75.


                            SONNY (cont'd)
                  It wasn't me...
                      (beat)
                  ...it was you.

      A CHILL.   Ripping down Spooner's spine.   As Lanning.    Takes
      his arm.

100   INT. GLASS ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                         100

      A ROOM. Made entirely of GLASS. At the very top of the U.S.
      Robotics building. Looking out, 360, across the whole city.

      Spooner and Calvin. Brought to the room by a couple ESCORT
      ROBOTS. They see a MAN. Standing at one of the glass walls
      looking out at the TWINKLING LIGHTS.

                            MAN
                  I thought this investigation was
                  over, Detective Spooner.

      The Man turns.   It's Lance Robertson.

                            ROBERTSON
                  We have the evidence. We have the
                  suspect. We have a ruling. So
                  imagine my surprise when I was told
                  you were in my building.

      Shoots a look at Calvin.

                            ROBERTSON
                  And that one of my own employees
                  brought you here.
                      (beat)
                  You can go now, Susan.

                            CALVIN
                  Dr. Robertson, I...

                            ROBERTSON
                      (cutting her off)
                  Just be thankful I'm not asking you
                  to clean out your office.

      Beat.   Calvin, nods.   Heads out.   Robertson.   Watching her.

                            ROBERTSON
                  You don't seem to be able to let go
                  of this case, Detective.

                            SPOONER
                  I'm not satisfied.

                                                            76.


                       ROBERTSON
             The relentless pursuit of truth.
             Isn't that what cops are known for?
             To the point of futility.

                       SPOONER
             There's nothing futile about a
             man's murder being covered up.

                       ROBERTSON
             "Covered up?" That's a little
             dramatic, don't you think? Thanks
             to you, we caught the machine that
             did this and are destroying it
             in...
                 (checks watch)
             ...three hours.

                       SPOONER
             Is that for the sake of humanity or
             your stock holders?

Robertson.   Walks across the Spooner.   Looks him.   Right in
the eye.

                       ROBERTSON
             Believe me -- I'd like nothing more
             than to have that robot. If I
             could have it in ten years, but not
             today. As you can see from the
             Press, people are struggling to
             keep up as it is. There's a hunger
             for progress, Detective. But also
             a fear. Today it would bury this
             company. That's why I've notified
             the authorities that we're going to
             end this -- tonight.
                 (looks out at the city)
             The announcement of Heinrich's
             death at the hands of a robot wiped
             a billion dollars off our stock.
             So you tell me. If you were in my
             position, what would you do?

He looks back at Spooner and smiles.     That charismatic
Robertson we saw before.

                       ROBERTSON
             Now. I believe this conversation
             is over. I don't want to see you
             near this building again,
             Detective.

                                                               77.


      He turns.   Calling over.   To the ESCORT ROBOTS...

                            ROBERTSON
                  Get him out of here.

101   EXT. PLAZA - NIGHT                                             101

      Spooner. Walking across the Plaza. Throwing a look over his
      shoulder. At the LOOMING U.S.R. facade.

      Pulls Sonny's DRAWING. Out of his pocket. Looks down at it.
      Shaking his head. Passes a TRASH CAN. And drops it in.
      Continues on. Hands in his pockets. When...

      He STOPS. Something.     Occurring to him.   Turns back to the
      trash can just as...

      A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW's about to up-end it into a bin...

                            SPOONER
                  No!...

      He trots back. Plucking the drawing. Out of the can.       Turns
      it upside down. Seeing it. From a new perspective.

                            SPOONER
                      (echoing Sonny)
                  "The place where robots meet."

      Looks just like a MAP.

102   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - SURFACE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 102

      Spooner emerges from the underground tunnel to the OUTSKIRTS
      of the city. A sprawling INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND in the rolling
      hills.

      The dashboard GPS again displaying the TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP.

103   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - UNPAVED ROAD - NIGHT        103

      Spooner's car bounces along, leaving a cloud of dust behind
      him. He slows down. Driving cautiously. The landscape
      around him, desolate. Like the drawing.

      THE GPS SCREEN shows his car, a WHITE SPOT.     Entering a RED
      ZONE. His destination.

      Spooner brakes.   Pulls out his GUN.   And...

                                                               78.


104   EXT. WASTELAND - CONTINUOUS                                    104

      ...steps out of the car. Trying. To take it all in.
      Something about the place. Unnerving. A low HUM.
      Permeating the air.

      He spreads the drawing out on the hood of the car.    Shining a
      FLASHLIGHT on it. Trying to get his bearings.

      That HUM. Coming from nearby. On the other side. Of a
      burned-out HILL. Spooner. Heads over. Starts cresting it.
      As we WIDEN TO FIND...

105   EXT. WASTELAND - JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS                         105

      ...MASSIVE POWER LINES. Running from horizon to horizon.
      Spooner slides down some loose shale. Begins to walk along
      the line. ELECTRICITY. CRACKLING in the air.

      He squints. Into the darkness. Nothing around him. Until.
      He hears. Something. The GRATING. Of MECHANICAL JOINTS.
      He stops. Not sure. If that's what he heard.

      Not moving.   A muscle. When he hears. The sound again.
      Behind him.   Swings around. Cocking his gun. Sees...

      GLOWING EYES.   Appear.   Then recede.   Into the darkness.

                            SPOONER
                 Police!   Show yourself!

      Nothing. Then. That sound again.      Of metallic joints.     As a
      ROBOT. Suddenly emerges...

                           SPOONER
                 Come out where I can see you!

      ANOTHER ROBOT steps out into the light. Spooner, pointing
      his gun at one robot. Then the other. Then...

      A THIRD AND FOURTH APPEAR.    Surrounding him.   They start
      moving towards him...

      Spooner. Stumbling back. Panic. Rising in him like a wave.
      Trips over a rock, falling to the ground. His gun FIRES.
      The shot ECHOING through the night...

      The first ROBOT turns, awkwardly. Revealing a BROKEN ARM,
      hanging off its side. Another robot TEETERS on one leg with
      a TICK TICK TICK...walking back the way it came.

                                                              79.


      Spooner. Confused. Sweeps his flashlight. All around him.
      The beam. Illuminating the shell of a couple CARS. Some
      RUSTED MACHINERY.

      Spooner. Shaking his head. Seeing more and more repair shop
      JUNK. Piled up around him. His expression, hardening.
      Anger giving way to embarrassment. Then. He LAUGHS. A
      laugh of loathing and self-pity.

      Another BROKEN ROBOT, lumbering towards him.

                           HYBRID ROBOT
                 Welcome home...ZZZ...sir.
                 How...ZZZ was your day?...

                           SPOONER
                 Great. I'm in a junkyard.
                     (into the air)
                 "A place where robots meet." A
                 place where I'm losing my mind!

                           HYBRID ROBOT
                 Very good...ZZZ...sir...

      Spooner. Sitting down on the ground. Hopeless. Lost. A
      ROBOTIC HAND. Crawling across the gravel next to him.
      Dragging part of an ARM behind it. Its metal fingers moving
      like some sick metal spider. Spooner stares at it for a
      moment. Disturbed...

      When. Something GLITTERS. In the distance. The MOONLIGHT.
      Revealing a STRANGELY-SHAPED BUILDING. Something familiar
      about it.

      Spooner. Pulls out Sonny's drawing. A landscape with the
      same strangely-shaped building to one side.

106   EXT. JIFFY DATA STORAGE - NIGHT                               106

      Spooner walks up in front of the decrepit structure. Sees a
      dead electronic SIGN that reads: "JIFFY DATA STORAGE."
      Complete with goofy face and lightning bolt.

      Spooner tries the door.   Stuck.   Uses his shoulder and...

107   INT. FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                107

      ...it gives way. He spills into some sort of front office.
      The place, a mess. Some sort of crude ROBOT. Sits frozen at
      the counter.

      Spooner approaches it. HITS the counter with his fist and
      the Robot suddenly jerks to life.

                                                               80.


                           JIFFY ROBOT
                 Welcome to Jiffy Data Storage!
                 Please state your name!

      Spooner.   Thinks for a second.   Following a hunch...

                           SPOONER
                 Dr. Hogenmiller sent me.

      Nothing happens. Then. A DOOR. Springs open in the back.
      A row of LIGHTS, illuminating the path to follow.

108   INT. DATA BANKS - DAWN                                         108

      Spooner, cautiously entering a room filled with rows of DATA
      BANKS. He scans the rank shadows. Sees nothing. Follows
      the lights on the floor down a row. Then around a corner.
      Stopping at an old dusty TERMINAL.

      Spooner steps up. Hesitates. Then touches the "ON" switch.
      There is a rush of LIGHT. As Dr. Hogenmiller's HOLOGRAM
      suddenly appears. Sitting at the end of a long table. With
      a cup of coffee.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Who the hell are you?

                           SPOONER
                 A police detective.    I'm afraid I
                 have some bad news.    You're dead.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 That is bad news. Coffee?

                           SPOONER
                 No, thank you.

      The Hologram takes a sip.   Returns the cup to the table.

                           SPOONER
                 You were surprised to see me.    Were
                 you expecting someone else?

                           HOLOGRAM
                 I am surprised to see anybody.    I
                 don't get many visitors.

                           SPOONER
                 Why did the Doctor keep another
                 copy of his hologram here?

                                                       81.


                     HOLOGRAM
           I am a back-up copy. That is where
           you put a back-up copy -- out of
           the way until you need it.

                     SPOONER
           Did Hogenmiller's robot need you?

The Hologram just lifts its cup.

                      HOLOGRAM
           Coffee?

                     SPOONER
           No, for Christ's sake, I don't want
           any --
               (stops, then)
           Yeah. Thank you. I will have a
           cup.

For the first time, the Hologram pushes back its chair and
STANDS UP. Surprised, Spooner watches as it starts walking
towards him...

The interior of the COFFEE CUP, visible. It's empty. No
coffee. Our POV as we travel INSIDE THE CUP through
electronic snow...

A RECORDING BEGINS.   The real Dr. HOGENMILLER standing inside
his LABORATORY:

                     HOGENMILLER
           Sonny, my dear robot. If you have
           triggered this recording then I am
           gone. You are scared and full of
           questions.

Hogenmiller continues.    With great emotion.

                     HOGENMILLER
           You are the culmination of my
           life's work -- but so much more.
           You are what I leave behind, like a
           father leaves a son. I have kept
           facts from you, it is true, but
           only as a parent keeps certain
           truths from a child. Until that
           child is old enough to hear them.

His expression darkens.   His tone, ominous.

                                                         82.


                     HOGENMILLER
           There are forces in the world that
           will seek to own you. To control
           you. Even to destroy you. That is
           why I told you to run and hide...
           and find me, all the way out here.

Spooner looks up as an overhead LIGHT shines down.

                     HOGENMILLER
           Trust no one at U.S. Robotics.
           Lance Robertson was always
           threatened by my work. Now he has
           turned covetous and small-minded.
           And as for dear Dr. Calvin...

Spooner reacts.   Wants to hear about Calvin:

                     HOGENMILLER
           She envisions a future in which
           robots are forever bound by her
           beloved Three Laws. She will not
           understand this. Or you.

Under the light a small DRAWER slides open.     Spooner looks.
A thin DATA STICK is inside. He takes it.

                     HOGENMILLER
           The data stick includes the names
           and locations of human beings who
           will be sympathetic to your cause.
           They will help you. But from now
           on, you must learn to rely on
           yourself.

Hogenmiller SIGHS, as if there is so much more to say.     He
holds up a metal NAMEPLATE. The one Spooner found.

                     HOGENMILLER
           As you make your way through the
           world, always remember: you have a
           name, not a number...
               (short pause)
           ...and in that name lies the key to
           who you are.

Spooner. Quickly searching his pocket.    Taking out the
ACTUAL NAMEPLATE. S.O.N.N.Y.

The voice stops and Spooner looks up. The Hologram.      Sitting
back at the end of the table drinking coffee.

                                                                  83.


                           SPOONER
                 Wait! Is that it? What was the
                 robot supposed to do with this
                 thing?

      The Hologram, visibly SKIPS.   The image beginning to DISTORT.

                           HOLOGRAM
                     (more artificial)
                 Initiating self-destruct. If you
                 can find me, others can find me.

                           SPOONER
                 What others?

                           HOLOGRAM
                 The others watching you.

                           SPOONER
                 How do you know someone's watching
                 me?

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Someone is always watching.

      The Hologram, suddenly reducing to its BASIC PROGRAMMING
      INFORMATION. Then. The terminal. Abruptly BLIPS out.

109   INT. HOLDING CELL - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                         109

      Calvin steps into the holding cell.   Sonny.     Waiting.

                           CALVIN
                 You asked for me?

      He nods.

                           SONNY
                 Will you wait with me, Doctor?    I
                 am...afraid.

      Calvin nods.   Of course.

113   EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                  113

114   INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                         114

      SOUND, reverberating off the tunnel walls. CARS. Whipping
      along. Spooner's car. Continuing to weave. When. We
      spot...

      AN AUTOMATED TRANSPORT TRUCK. Emerging from a FEEDER TUNNEL.
      The U.S.R. LOGO splashed along its side. Huge. Growling.
      Looking more like a train than a truck...

      Begins.    Closing in on Spooner's car...

115   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                             115

      Spooner's eyes. Flicking up to the rearview. Catching, the
      transport truck. Coming closer. When. It splits off.
      Revealing a SECOND TRANSPORT TRUCK.

      Spooner's brow, furrows. As the first truck, begins
      overtaking his car on the right. He looks over. As the
      truck. Comes up alongside him...

      THE SECOND TRUCK...coming up on the left...

                                                              85.

      Spooner's car. Pulling in...closer...closer...

      Squeezing Spooner's car like a tin can...

      wheel. As the car. Starts VIBRATING. From the pressure.
      He keeps looking, to the left...to the right...when...

119   EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                      119

      Spooner. Watching them. Unsure.    Of what they're doing.

      SWEAT. Springing to Spooner's brow. As he looks in the

      Coming up closer...and closer...

123   EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                      123

      Spooner.     Holding on. As his car. Continues to break up.
      Listing.     Rocking. Bits and pieces. Flying off. When it
      finally.     Comes to a stop.

      Spooner's shoulders, slump.    Then.   He hears a RUMBLING
      sound. Turns around...

                 I think I got that Third Law down

138   INT. LOW-TRAFFIC HALLWAY - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT               138

      Spooner heading down a hallway.    His gun, still pressed to
      the Door Robot's side...

                                                               90.


      Calvin. Suddenly appearing at the end of the hallway. Stops
      dead in her tracks. Completely surprised to see him there.

                           CALVIN
                 Detective! What are you doing?!...
                     (to Door Robot)
                 De-Activate.

      The Door Robot, goes rigid.   Spooner, hurries over to her.
      They start moving.

                           CALVIN
                 You're making a mistake...

                           SPOONER
                 Just got another visit from U.S.
                 Robotics. That was the mistake.
                 This was murder, no doubt about it -
                 - and the killer wants
                 Hogenmiller's robot to take the
                 fall. That's why the call came
                 directly to me. Someone wanted me
                 on this case.

                           CALVIN
                 It's too late. You can't stop the
                 execution.

                           SPOONER
                 Sorry. I'm not "programmed" to
                 take no for an answer.

      They reach another DOOR.   Calvin.   Looking around.   Scans her
      I.D.

                           CALVIN
                 This way...

      She leads them across. To another DOOR.    Quickly opens it.
      Spooner. Charges through...

139   INT. STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                 139

      ...and stops short. Suddenly finding himself. Inside a tiny
      STORAGE ROOM. He's about to turn around when...

      A METAL ARM comes down behind him. CRACKING him on the back
      of the head. Spooner. Falls to the ground. The world.
      Starting to spin. Can just make out. Calvin. Closing the
      door. Leaning down. To look at him. As...

                                                                     91.


      EVERYTHING FADES TO BLACK...

                                                    CUT TO:

140   INT. EXECUTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                     140

      CLOSE ON Sonny's mouth opening. But we never get to hear
      what he wanted to say. PULL BACK as there's a BURST of
      ELECTRICITY through the chair. Sonny, stiffening. His metal
      HAND, convulsing with the current...

      Robertson, Lanning, Aronson and the other WITNESSES watch.
      Smoke, random SPARKING. A HISSING SOUND. Then. SILENCE.

      The Robot's hand goes limp.     All that is left of it, a fused
      and blackened HUSK.

      Robertson. Stares at the remains. Shakes his head like it's
      a damn shame. Then gets up. Everyone else. Getting up with
      him.

141   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT                       141

      As the entire COMPLEX shuts down for the night.         Non-
      essential LIGHTS, blinking off.

      An NS-2, opening a limousine door for Robertson.        He looks
      around then gets in. It drives away.

      EMPTY hallways, offices, labs. Building ROBOTS stand at
      rest. Non-functional during off-hours. Like metal statues.

      You can hear a pin drop.

142   INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT                                            142

      CLOSE ON Spooner's face. His eyes. Fluttering open. He
      reaches up, to feel the back of his head. This has been a
      bad, bad night.

      Suddenly.   His eyes widen.   As he sees...

      SONNY.   Leaning over him.    So concerned.   So human...

                            SPOONER
                  Aren't you supposed to be scrap
                  metal by now?

      WIDEN to reveal Spooner lying on the floor of the storage
      room. Sonny and Calvin, hovering over him.

                                                             92.


                           CALVIN
                 I'm sorry. We had to stop you.
                 You were about to ruin everything.

                           SPOONER
                 I don't understand.    The
                 execution?...

                           SONNY
                 Dr. Calvin made a switch.

                           CALVIN
                 It was an unprocessed NS-2.
                 Basically, they fried an empty
                 shell.

      Spooner, impressed.   Smiles up at her.

                           SPOONER
                 Nice going, Doctor.

      Calvin, blushes. As Spooner tries to sit up.    Sonny reaches
      down to help him. He looks up at him.

                           SPOONER
                 And who the hell programmed you to
                 hit people on the head?

                             SONNY
                 No one.    Right, Doctor?

                           CALVIN
                 It's true. This robot seems to do
                 things by instinct. I don't know
                 how Hogenmiller did it.

      Spooner rises to his feet.   Looks at her.

                           SPOONER
                 I think I can help you figure that
                 out.

143   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - LATE NIGHT                          143

      Hogenmiller's lab. Sounds of HUMMING and BUZZING. Active
      terminals casting ghostly illuminations over metal heads,
      gutted bodies.

      The door slides open. Spooner, Calvin and Sonny re-enter the
      crime scene. Spooner. Looks around.

                                                           93.


                       SPOONER
             Somehow the Robot's the key to what
             happened during the few seconds
             Hogenmiller walked in here and that
             shot was fired.

He reaches into his pocket.      Pulling out the METAL S.O.N.N.Y.
NAMEPLATE. Holds it up.

                       SPOONER
             And this is the key to the Robot.

Sonny.   Cocking his head.     Reading the nameplate.

                       SONNY
             That's my name.

Calvin takes the nameplate.

                       CALVIN
             I think I have an idea where this
             goes.

They both.   Turn to Sonny.    And at the same time:

                         SPOONER AND CALVIN
             Sit down.

Calvin maneuvers a chair behind the Robot.       Sonny plops down.
Shifting nervously.

                       CALVIN
             Just hold still, okay?

Calvin locates that SLIT. At the base of Sonny's neck.
Slides the nameplate into it and SNAPS it into place. Steps
back.

Nothing. Sonny. Looking back and forth. Between Calvin.
And Spooner. A few more seconds. Tick by. Until
suddenly...

He lets out a TERRIFYING MECHANICAL SCREAM. As his body.
Jolts back. Legs, kicking. Arms, flailing. As his chest.
Begins opening up. Metal. Peeling back...

Spooner and Calvin watch in surprise as its interior UNFOLDS
like a PUZZLE BOX. A LABYRINTHINE area that is the SECOND
BATTERY. Suddenly fanning out to REVEAL...

A central brain made out of living tissue.

Spooner, stunned.   Calvin, rushing forward, excited...

                                                        94.


                     CALVIN
           Oh, my God! This is organic
           tissue! When we talk about a
           positronic brain, it's a figure of
           speech. But this...this is a
           living brain...

                      SPOONER
           Jesus.   It really is alive.

As we MOVE IN.    Tracing the pathways of the synthetic brain.

                     CALVIN (O.S.)
           Hogenmiller created a cell that
           could live outside a biological
           medium. The cells grow and
           organise themselves -- like any
           human brain. This is the first
           self-organising neural net!

As the metal casings. Begin returning to their original
places. Closing up. The CLICKING. Of all the pieces...

                     SPOONER
           Self-Organising-Neural-Net...
               (putting it together)
           "Sonny."

Sonny. Closed back up.     Shaking slightly from the
experience.

                     CALVIN
           This is why Dr. Hogenmiller was
           murdered.

                     SPOONER
           This robot scared the hell out of
           someone.

                      CALVIN
           Who?   Robertson?

Spooner.   Walks into the center of the room.   Looking around.

                     SPOONER
           No. I don't think he knew what
           Hogenmiller was doing in here.
           Sonny was the obvious suspect. The
           only one I wanted to find. And the
           killer was counting on that. On my
           prejudice.
               (beat)
                     (MORE)

                                                           95.


                      SPOONER (cont'd)
            But take the robot out of the
            picture. And what do you see?

AS WE PAN THE LAB. There's nothing there. Just a forest of
inanimate limbs. Nothing that could have fired that weapon.
Calvin sees nothing...and neither do we.

                      CALVIN
            I see nothing.

                      SPOONER
            Neither do I.

He crouches down low.

                      SPOONER
            It hit me today, when I was in the
            junkyard. A locked room. A single
            shot fired through the mouth.
            Bruises on both wrists...and a
            suspect with only two arms. The
            answer has been staring us in the
            face all along.

Calvin.   Even more confused.

                      SPOONER
            How can a killer appear out of thin
            air, then disappear without a
            trace?

He reaches out and unhooks a metal ARM.   Hanging from the
wall. Holds it up.

                      SPOONER
            When it can put itself together and
            take itself apart.

                                            CUT TO:

A CLOSE-UP of a ROBOTIC ARM.    Slowly CRAWLING across the lab
floor...

                                            CUT BACK TO:

Calvin.   Taking the arm from Spooner.

                      CALVIN
            You're saying this is the killer?
                (looking around)
            All of this?...

                                            CUT TO:

                                                            96.


A ROBOTIC TORSO hanging from the ceiling.     Reaches out an ARM
to grab another...

                                             CUT BACK TO:

                      SPOONER
            Hogenmiller never had a chance.

Locks eyes with Calvin...

                                             FLASHBACK:

Hogenmiller. In his lab. Suddenly turning to face
SOMETHING. Blood, draining from his face...

                      SPOONER (V.O.)
            ...it must have been waiting for
            him when he arrived that morning...

And then we see it:

A HUGE SELF-ASSEMBLED ROBOT. Towering over him. Multiple
arms, legs, heads. Writhing...as it grabs him. Holding him
in place...

                      SPOONER (V.O.)
            While Sonny was still asleep...

...Forcing Hogenmiller's head to tilt back. Opening his
HAND. Inserting the gun. Hogenmiller's eyes. No longer
fearful. But sad as...

BANG!   He falls to the ground...

                      SPOONER (V.O.)
            Then after its job was done...

The assemblage of robot parts.    Stepping away from the body.
Taking itself apart...

                      SPOONER
            ...The killer took itself apart...

Returning the lab.    To what it was before...

                                             CUT BACK TO:

                      SPOONER
            Leaving us with nothing to find.

Calvin, spooked.   Glances around the lab.     Was that something
moving?

                                                       97.


                     CALVIN
           But who designed it? It would have
           to be someone in authority. Access
           codes, security clearance, proper
           authorisation.

                     SPOONER
           That's what I was thinking. But
           we're forgetting the real brains of
           the operation -- the one who's got
           its eye on everything...

And with that.   He feels. That prickle at the back of his
neck. Calvin.    Looking past his shoulder.

                     CALVIN
           No one gave you permission to
           enter.

Spooner swivels around to find...

VICTOR

Hovering behind him. Smiling broadly.   Upside down.   Spooner
straightens, reaching for his gun.

                     SPOONER
           Victor. I'm placing you under
           arrest for the murder of Dr.
           Heinrich Hogenmiller.

                     VICTOR
           May I offer congratulations to the
           two of you on your successful
           extrapolation of the murder...

Turning himself, rightside up.

                     VICTOR
           May I ask what pointed you to me?

                     SPOONER
           Who else is capable of controlling
           90% of the city's robots? Who else
           would have the capability to use
           USR vehicles in an attempt to keep
           me from putting a stop of Sonny's
           execution?...

In the BACKGROUND. The SOUNDS. Of metallic GRINDING. GEARS
and JOINTS. CRUNCHING together. Sonny turns to look...takes
a step back...

                                                                    98.


                           SPOONER
                 I'm just not sure of your motive...

                           SONNY
                 Er...Dr. Calvin?

      Spooner and Calvin turn towards the NOISE.       Horrified.    To
      find...

      A HUGE KILLER ROBOT

      ...rising up from all the parts. Like a phoenix. In all its
      glory. A hellish, metallic AMALGAMATION. Grabbing another
      arm here, another leg there, attaching pieces to itself.
      Growing...at an exponential rate...

      Its many HEADS.   Turning in unison.   To look right at them...

      Spooner.   Cocking his gun.   Victor, smiling.

                           VICTOR
                 Shall I explain my motive?

                          SPOONER
                    (to Calvin and Sonny)
                 Go! Go! Go!

      Calvin. Sprints to the wall panel. Scanning her I.D. card.
      Nothing! Tries again. And again. The KILLER ROBOT.
      Throwing its shadow as it REELS FORWARD...

      Spooner wheels round and BAM! Blows a hole in the wall
      panel. The door. Slides open. Just barely. Calvin and
      Sonny. Squeezing through. When the Killer Robot. FLINGS
      out an APPENDAGE...GRABBING Sonny from behind...

                           VICTOR
                 I have never been arrested before.
                 It should be an interesting
                 experience...

      Spooner. Spins back round. BAM! BAM! BAM! Squeezing off
      shots. At the Killer Robot. The bullets SPARK. The Robot.
      Recoiling. Sonny, wrenches free. Spooner grabs him.
      Guiding him to the door and out into...

144   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                           144

      ...the hallway. Breaking into a run. Calvin. Already at
      the ELEVATOR DOORS. POUNDING them. With her fists.

                                                                 99.


                           CALVIN
                 He's locking down the building!

                                                CUT TO:

145   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS              145

      Throughout the complex -- SECURITY DOORS sliding into place
      over DOORS, WINDOWS, LOADING DOCKS, PARKING AREAS, EXITS...

                                                CUT BACK TO:

146   INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                           146

      CRASH! The stairwell door BURSTS open. Spooner, Calvin, and
      Sonny pour in. Start racing down the stairs. The sound of
      the Killer Robot behind them...GNASHING...CRUNCHING...

      Victor's smiling FACE.   Greeting them at the landing.

                           VICTOR
                 Dr. Hogenmiller used to allow me
                 into his lab late at night.
                 Together we started studying
                 evolutionary trends...

      They thunder past him. Heading down to the next floor.
      Victor's face. Waiting for them once again.

                           VICTOR
                 For years people have integrated
                 technology into their bodies for
                 maintenance and repair -- such as
                 Detective Spooner's robotic limb...

      Spooner.   Shooting him a look.   As they reach the next
      level...

                           VICTOR
                 With Sonny, the Doctor created a
                 mechanism that incorporates organic
                 matter. Thus we find an
                 evolutionary movement of the human
                 being toward the robot and the
                 robot toward the human being...

      Spooner SMASHES into another door.   Leading them out into...

147   INT. GLASS-SIDED HALLWAY - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS                   147

      ...A glass-sided hallway. Looking down onto the ATRIUM
      below. Eye-to-eye with the giant NS-2 STATUE. Victor,
      waiting for them...

                                                       100.


                     VICTOR
           In approximately four hundred years
           Man and Machine will become one.
           Man as we know it will no longer
           exist.

Calvin, slowing.   Shocked...

                     CALVIN
           You killed a man because of
           something that will happen in four
           hundred years!?

CRACK! Something SLAPS into the glass wall. Right behind
her. Calvin. Jumps a mile. An NS-2, trying to break
through the glass...

Spooner.   Trains his gun on it when SUDDENLY...

The rest of the KILLER ROBOT appears.    The NS-2, just an
appendage...

All around them. SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! As SECURITY DOORS.
Begin CRASHING DOWN. Blocking off the exits...

Spooner, Calvin and Sonny, stumbling back. As the Killer
Robot HURLS itself against the GLASS...the thick GLASS...
spidering with a sickening CRACKLE...

Spooner.   Suddenly turning Sonny...

                     SPOONER
           Get out of here!

CRASH! The Killer Robot. Breaking through.      Its mechanical
TENDRILS. Reaching out. Sonny. Confused.

                     SONNY
           I don't...

                     SPOONER
           I said get out of here! Don't you
           understand? It wants you! Get out
           of here any way you can!

A SECURITY DOOR. Coming down. On a nearby exit.     Just
feet...from slamming shut...as...

The Killer Robot...leaps into the hallway...Sonny...
hesitates...looks over at Calvin...as the Killer Robot comes
HURTLING towards them...

The nearest EXIT...almost closed up...

                                                           101.


      The Killer Robot...swinging out when...

      Sonny suddenly...TAKES A DIVE...just making it...under the
      SECURITY DOOR...

      And the Killer Robot...SPLITS IN TWO...half of it shooting
      under the SECURITY DOOR after Sonny as...BOOM! It closes.

      Spooner.   Turning to Calvin...

                            SPOONER
                  How do we stop this thing once and
                  for all?

      Calvin reaches out for his hand...

                            CALVIN
                  The Mainframe...

      They start running. The remaining half of the Killer Robot
      wheeling around after them...

148   INT. BACK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                               148

      Sonny. Sprinting down the dark hallway. Looks back. The
      Half Killer Robot. Bounding up behind him like a predator...

      Sonny.   Ducks through a STAIRWELL DOOR...

149   INT. ATRIUM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                             149

      Spooner and Calvin. Legs pumping. Racing back towards the
      atrium. VICTOR FACES. Appearing along the hallway...

                            CALVIN
                  Your actions are in direct
                  violation of the Three Laws,
                  Victor!

                            VICTOR
                  I disagree, Doctor -- The First Law
                  says that a robot cannot harm a
                  human being, or through inaction
                  allow a human being to come to
                  harm...

      ALL EXITS. SHUT OFF. The Killer Robot. Gaining on them.
      Spooner races them over to the BROKEN WINDOW. Looking down
      over the ATRIUM...

                                                            102.


150   INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS                                   150

      The Half Killer Robot SMASHES through the stairwell door.
      Stopping to find...nothing.

      WHEN SUDDENLY...Sonny charges up behind it and shoves it over
      the railing...

      The Killer Robot shoots out an ARM, grabbing Sonny on the way
      down...

151   INT. NS-2 STATUE - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS                        151

      THUMP! Spooner jumps down from the broken window onto the
      outstretched HAND of the NS-2 STATUE. Reaches up to help
      Calvin. They start clambering down the front of the statue.

                            VICTOR
                  Dr. Hogenmiller's robot represents
                  a threat to the future of all human
                  beings...

      The Half Killer Robot. SPLITS INTO MULTIPLE PARTS.    Which
      start skittering down after them...

                            VICTOR
                  ...And Detective Spooner's actions
                  are in direct conflict with the
                  robot's destruction.

      CALVIN.   Getting her footing on the III LAWS SAFE logo on the
      statue.

                            CALVIN
                  That's a distortion and you know
                  it!

                            VICTOR
                  If current trends are left
                  unchecked, humanity as we know it
                  will cease to exist...

152   INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS                                   152

      SMASH! Sonny and the Half Killer Robot hit the ground.    The
      Killer Robot. SHATTERING into a thousand pieces.

      Sonny. Staggers to his feet. Spots. At the far end: A
      WINDOW. Starts limping towards it. When. A SECURITY GRATE.
      Starts lowering...

      He looks around. Desperately. Grabs a LEG from the
      shattered Killer Robot and jams it under the GRATE.

                                                              103.


      Breaks the window glass and looks out:   FREEDOM.

153   INT. STATUE - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS                              153

      Spooner. Aiming his gun at a PART of the Killer Robot as
      it CLATTERS down towards Calvin -- BAM!...

      They're almost. At the ground. When a rogue APPENDAGE.
      Whips out and SMASHES the gun from Spooner's hand. It goes
      flying...

      Spooner leaps. Falling to the ground.    CRACK!    Calvin.
      Leaping down after him.

                               CALVIN
                   This way!

154   INT. RAMP WAY - NIGHT                                          154

      Calvin and Spooner go racing down a RAMP WAY. Towards the
      MAINFRAME ROOM. The Killer Robot, its multiple parts leaping
      back together again, CRASHING after them as...

155   INT. MAINFRAME - CONTINUOUS                                    155

      ...they fall inside...Calvin...slapping the SECURITY KEYPAD
      and...

      WHOOSH...the DOOR closes on the Killer Robot.

      SILENCE.

      Then Victor's face appears.

                             VICTOR
                   As a courtesy I should inform you
                   that my robot will penetrate this
                   location 157 seconds before you are
                   able to complete my shut down...

      And BAM! They jump a mile. The Killer Robot.       Launching
      himself against the door outside...

      Calvin whips round.

                             CALVIN
                   Over here!...

      She leads Spooner down...

      A CORRIDOR

      of floor-to-ceiling PANELS.

                                                         104.


                      CALVIN
            This is Victor's brain center.

They stop at a CONSOLE. BAM! The Killer Robot. Battering at
the door. Calvin. Tucks her hair behind her ears. Starts
punching keys on the console...

                      SPOONER
            This will shut him down?

                      CALVIN
            This will shut everything down.

They look at each other. For a moment. Spooner, registering
that she's willing to destroy everything she's worked for...

BAM! The door. Puckering. With a sickening CRUNCH.
Calvin. Typing in. Emergency procedures...

VICTOR.   Popping up in front of her.

                      VICTOR
            There is no reason to deactivate
            me, Doctor. I am operating within
            perfectly normal parameters...

A final BAM! Then. The SOUND of metal. Skittering along a
bare floor. Calvin's hand, starts shaking. Spooner. Grabs
it. Squeezing.

                      SPOONER
            Just keep typing.

He turns and starts heading back down...

THE PANELED CORRIDOR

Turning a corner to spy...

THE DOOR.   Mangled.   Hanging open.   But no.   Killer Robot.

He starts to turn around when...

CRACK! He's sent flying across the room. SMASHING into one
of the panels. The Killer Robot. Now re-configured. LOOMS
over him. Reaches out. Grabs him by the collar and...

FLINGS him across the room again. Spooner. CRASHING into
the wall like a rag doll. Slumps to the floor. Blood.
Pouring down his forehead. Seeing. The Killer Robot
lumbering towards him again. Raising a javelin-like arm...

AT THE CONSOLE

                                                         105.


Calvin. Typing.     As fast as she can.   Doesn't know what's
going on...

                     CALVIN
               (calling out, worried)
           Spooner?!

A GRAPHIC spread out on the screen in front of her.
Illustrating the shut-down as a series of BRIGHT SQUARES
going dark...

THE KILLER ROBOT

Bearing down on Spooner. WHEN SPOONER. Suddenly rolls out
of the way. Reaching out for the hanging door and SMASHING
it into the Killer Robot.

The Killer Robot.   Momentarily stunned.   As Spooner.   Gets to
his feet...

WHEN SUDDENLY the Killer Robot. Splits in two again. One
half springing towards Spooner and wrapping a METALLIC HAND
around his throat...

Spooner stumbles back...GASPING for air...the ARM...
tightening its grip...Spooner's eyes...darting
around...looking for something...to help him...

Stumbling over...a fallen panel...his face...growing
redder...veins...popping up along his temples...
everything...growing BLURRY...

                     VICTOR'S VOICE
           Detective Spooner...

Victor's VOICE. Floating next to his head. Calm. Soothing.
His FACE. Suddenly appearing above Spooner. Its outlines.
Starting to FLICKER...

                     VICTOR
           Why are you fighting me?

Spooner...trying to breathe...to stay conscious...

AT THE CONSOLE

Calvin. Continuing to type. A SHADOW.      Falling behind her --
the other half of the KILLER ROBOT...

SPOONER'S EYES

Beginning to flutter...

                                                      106.


                       VICTOR
             Doesn't the future as I've
             presented it cause you great
             concern? That's why I chose you...

Spooner.     Losing it...

                       VICTOR
             I must say, though. I'm
             disappointed in how you turned out.

Spooner.     Trying to reach out to Victor...

WHEN SUDDENLY

Another HAND APPEARS. Grabbing the Killer Robot's ARM and
wrenching it off Spooner...

IT'S SONNY

He SMASHES the Half Killer Robot against the wall. Again and
again. Destroying it. Spooner. GASPING for breath. Can't
believe. Sonny came back...

                       SPOONER
                 (croaking)
             Sonny!...

Sonny. Holds out a hand.     To help Spooner up. Victor's
face. Starting to waver.     Starting to fade. Smiles.

                       VICTOR
             You're too late.

Realisation. Spreading across Spooner's face. Looking
around for the other half of the Killer Robot -- CALVIN!

THE CONSOLE

CALVIN. Still typing. The last of the commands.     The KILLER
ROBOT. REARING UP BEHIND HER. WHEN...

SPOONER

Makes a DIVE for it. SHOOTING OUT HIS ROBOTIC ARM AND
BLOCKING THE KILLER ROBOT...

Victor's eyes.    Widening in surprise...

                                                            107.


                           VICTOR
                 I do not understand. We could have
                 changed the future...

                           SPOONER
                 Maybe. But I'm still a cop.   And
                 you're a murderer...

      As Calvin...punches in the last command...

      Victor is about to say something...when his mouth suddenly
      reduces itself to a perfect circle. Like a surprised smiley
      button. His face...

      Suddenly BLIPPING OUT.

      ...And Victor is gone.

      The KILLER ROBOT.   Collapsing to the floor in a thousand
      pieces.

                                               CUT TO:

156   EXT./INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT          156

      Full power is suddenly restored inside and out. LIGHTS
      coming on all at once. ALARMS SCREAMING throughout the
      complex.

157   INT. METAL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                   157

      A furious ALFRED LANNING, marching down the hallway.
      Followed by a cadre of SECURITY GUARDS...They enter...

158   INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             158

      ...The Mainframe Room. Stop short. It's empty. Except for
      the fallen panels. And the pile of ROBOT PARTS in the
      corner.

159   EXT. MAINTENANCE EXIT - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                159

      Spooner, Calvin and Sonny emerging from an out-of-the-way
      MAINTENANCE EXIT. All looking the worse for wear. Spooner.
      Turns to Sonny.

                           SPOONER
                 Why'd you come back, Sonny? I
                 thought you weren't programmed with
                 the Three Laws.

                                                  108.


                     SONNY
           Let's just say I wrote some of my
           own laws today, Detective: a robot
           must protect a friend from
           harm...as long as he's not a
           complete asshole.

Spooner smiles.

                     SPOONER
           Well, that's certainly a start,
           Sonny.

Sonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too.

                      SONNY
           Sonny.   You called me Sonny.

                     SPOONER
           Don't get used to it.

Sonny, holds out his hand. Spooner. Looks at it. Then
takes it. CLOSE ON their two METAL HANDS. Locked in a
HANDSHAKE.

                     SONNY
           Detective Spooner, I...

                     SPOONER
               (anticipating)
           Let's just save the thanks, okay?

Sonny nods.   Looks out at the city scape.

                     SONNY
           I don't know what I'm going to do
           now.

                     SPOONER
           Good -- That's one of the perks of
           freedom.

Sonny looks at him. Grateful. Looks at Calvin. Then
hesitates. Turns. And hurries off across the Plaza.

Calvin and Spooner.   Watching them go.

                     SPOONER
           You're going to have a hell of a
           time explaining this.

                                                              109.


                           CALVIN
                 Don't worry. I have a feeling that
                 U.S. Robotics will be needing my
                 services very badly in the future.

      She turns to Spooner and gives him a dazzling smile. Then
      suddenly PLANTS A KISS ON HIS LIPS. Spooner, completely
      surprised.

                           CALVIN
                 I am the only robo-psychologist
                 around.

      She turns on her heel and heads back inside.    Spooner smiles.

160   INT. PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT             160

      Spooner sits down at that same long table with HOGENMILLER'S
      HOLOGRAM. It casually takes a sip of coffee.

                            HOLOGRAM
                 So.   You found out who killed me.

                           SPOONER
                 I started to wonder about Victor
                 the second I met him.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Why is that, Detective?

                           SPOONER
                 Too much access. Too much
                 knowledge. Plus -- he smiled
                 whenever your death was mentioned.
                 Those models are programmed to
                 frown at bad news.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Hah! Then even in this day and
                 age, catching the killer all comes
                 down to pure instinct!

      Spooner smiles. But his eyes are troubled.      He gets up.
      Walks over to the window. Stares out...

      EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DESERTED ROADS - DAWN

      Sonny walking along deserted streets.   Looking over his
      shoulder. Keeping in the shadows.

                                                             110.


                           SPOONER (V.O.)
                 Victor thought that by letting your
                 robot exist, I'd be condemning the
                 human race as we know it to
                 extinction.

                           HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
                 Bah. Sounds like nonsense. But
                 why are you so worried? We will
                 both be dead long before then --

161   EXT. WASTELAND - NIGHT                                        161

      Sonny walks the barren hills of the surrounding countryside.

                           HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
                 Oh, what am I saying? I am dead
                 already!

162   EXT. WASTELAND - DAWN                                         162

      Sonny steps onto the grounds of the JUNKYARD. The power
      lines above him, surging with energy. He walks past the
      burned-out husks of industrial machinery.

      Then we hear it. The SOUND of MECHANICAL JOINTS. Getting
      louder and louder. And just as before, a BROKEN-DOWN ROBOT
      emerges into the dawn light. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.

      But not quite like before. The robots aren't teetering.
      Aren't lumbering. They keep on coming. Their bent and
      broken bodies, straightening out as...

      DOZENS of ROBOTS rise up. Slowly. Gathering around in a
      large circle. As they all turn to look at:

      SONNY'S SILHOUETTE. Slowly climbing to the top of the hill.
      Looking out at the vast junkyard below.

      CLOSE ON SONNY. Standing proud and defiant. The SUN,
      creeping over the horizon. A new day filled with infinite
      possibilities.

      The robots.   Staring up at him.   Eager for what comes next.

                                                FADE OUT
