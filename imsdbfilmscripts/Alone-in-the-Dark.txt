          1                                                                     1
               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
          
               A dense forest on a dark, misty night.
          
               YOUNG EDWARD CARNBY (age 10), small, thin, and terrified,
               runs for his life.
          2
                The forest is pitch black. Young Edward ducks between trees,
               under branches, not stopping for anything, GASPING for
               breath. He doesn't turn to look behind him. He just runs as
               fast as he can.
          
               P.O.V. CREATURE:
               Tomething chases Young Edward through the dark forest. Its
               P.O.V. is skewed, inhuman. It is gaining on him.
          
               As Young Edward runs, beams of light become visible through
               the closely packed trees. Something is up ahead, something
               bright. Edward runs towards it.
          
               Young Edward bursts out into a clearing in the woods, running
               towards the bright light.
          
               P.O.V. CREATURE:
          
               The light stops whatever is chasing Young Edward at the edge
               of the forest. What is making the light isn't visible, only
               Young Edward's silhouette running towards the blinding light.

               The beams of a dozen flashlights cut through the mist of the
               dark forest.
               A dozen uniformed DEPUTIES move through the forest, shining
               their flashlights around, searching.
          
                The trees tower over them. A low fog hangs in the air. The
               flashlight beams can barely penetrate it.

               A large and stately old house stands on the edge of town. A
               small, dense forest stretches out behind it.
          
               The sign on the front reads: OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL LIGHT
               ORPHANAGE.
          
          
          
                                                                  (CONTINUED)

               Several patrol cars are parked along the Orphanage's gravel
               driveway. DEPUTIES mill around the front lawn.
          
               Another patrol car pulls up. Out of it steps the SHERIFF
               (late 40s). DEPUTY ADAMS (mid-30s) approaches him.
          
                                   SHERIFF
                         What's going on, Adams?
          
                                   DEPUTY ADAMS
                         Twenty kids live at this orphanage,
                         Sheriff. All twenty have gone missing.
          
               SISTER CLARA (mid-40s), an anxious-looking nun, stands on the
               front porch, wrapped in a shawl. She speaks with two
               DEPUTIES. The Sheriff walks up and listens in.
          
                                   SISTER CLARA
                         After the power went out, I went to check
                         on the children. But their beds were
                         empty. Every one of them. They just
                         disappeared...

               The Deputies sweep through the forest with their flashlights.
               The trees are close together, blocking out the moonlight. A
               thick mist hangs in the trees.
          
               As Deputy Adams moves through the forest, he sees a bright
               light streaming through the trees up ahead.

               Deputy Adams comes through the trees and emerges into a
               clearing in the woods.
          
               He sees a Shed in the clearing up ahead. A bright light is
               posted over the Shed's front entrance.

               Deputy Adams shines his flashlight around the outside of the
               Shed.
          
               He sees that the door is open just a crack. On the door is a
               sign marked: DANGER, along with the symbol for ELECTRICITY.

               Deputy Adams enters the Shed.

              CONTINUED:
          
          
              The Shed is small, packed with electrical equipment, power
              cables, and various implements for repairing power lines.
          
              Deputy Adams sweeps through the Shed with his flashlight.
          
              He approaches a large transformer module that sits at the
              back of the Shed. It HUMS and CRACKLES with electricity.
          
              There's a LOW SHUFFLING sound. Deputy Adams stops.
          
              He carefully peers around behind the transformer. The space
              is too small for a full-size person.
          
              But sitting on the ground behind the transformer is Young
              Edward. He clutches himself, shivering, frightened.

              The Sheriff stands with his Deputies. His walkie-talkie
              CRACKLES to life.
          
                                    DEPUTY ADAMS (ON THE WALKIE-TALKIE)
                          Sheriff! I found one! White, male, about
                          ten years old. Looks to be unharmed. He's
                          in a utility shed maybe half a mile from
                          the orphanage.

              Deputy Adams approaches Young Edward. He takes off his jacket
              and wraps it around Young Edward's shoulders.
          
              Young Edward pulls the jacket around him and smiles, still
              scared, but happy to see the Deputy.
          
                                    DEPUTY ADAMS
                          Are you okay, son? Are the other kids
                          around here?

              SUPER: 20 YEARS LATER
          
              EDWARD CARNBY (early 30s), lean and intense, wakes up. He
              quickly looks around to get his bearings.
          
              He sits in a large commercial airplane. The compartment is
              full of seated PASSENGERS.
          
                SMALL BOY (age 8) sits next to Carnby, looking up at him.
              The Small Boy's MOTHER (early 40s) sleeps next to him.
          
                                    SMALL BOY
                          Did you have a nightmare?
          
              Carnby looks at the Small Boy, curious. He doesn't respond.
          
                                    SMALL BOY (CONT'D)
                          You ate cheese with dinner. My mommy says
                          cheese gives you nightmares. Want to see
                          my coloring book?
          
              The Small Boy has a Halloween-themed coloring book open on
              his lap. It's a graveyard scene, full of cartoon drawings of
              ghosts, werewolves, and vampires.
          
                                    SMALL BOY (CONT'D)
                          I think there's a vampire living in my
                          closet, but my mommy says vampires and
                          ghosts aren't real. She says there's
                          nothing to be afraid of in the dark.
          
              Carnby weighs what he's going to say.
          
                                    CARNBY
                          Your mother is wrong. Being afraid of the
                          dark is what keeps most of us alive.
          
              The Small Boy's eyes open wide.
          
                                    SMALL BOY
                          Everybody else tells me not to be afraid.
          
                                    CARNBY
                          That's because they don't know the truth.

                Carnby exits the Terminal and heads over to a row of taxis
                waiting outside the Terminal. He doesn't carry a suitcase.
          
                                    CARNBY (V.O.)
                          So, maybe you're thinking I'm an asshole,
                          trying to scare this poor kid for no
                          reason. But that's where you're wrong.
                          Because I've got my reasons. There's a
                          world around you that you've trained
                          yourself not to see. You've willfully
                          closed your eyes. But your fear of the
                          dark is not a weakness. It's there to
                          protect you from things you'd better pray
                          you never see. My eyes were forced open a
                          long time ago. Now I know. Just because
                          you can't see something, doesn't mean it
                          can't kill you.
          
                Carnby steps into the first taxi waiting in the row. The taxi
                shifts into gear and drives off.
          
                Another taxi is parked up ahead. As Carnby's taxi passes it,
                the second taxi pulls out and follows it.

                Behind the wheel of the taxi sits JAMES PINKERTON (early

                Carnby rides in the backseat. He looks out the back

                Carnby takes a burlap sack out of his trench-coat pocket.
                Inside the sack is a stone carving of a demonic-looking head.

          The edges are soft, worn-down, the detail roughed away. But
          it is clearly not a human face.
          
          Carnby puts the carving back in his trench-coat pocket.

                    Trust me, I'm carrying enough baggage for
                    the both of us.
          
          The Cabbie CHUCKLES as he steers through traffic.
          
                              CABBIE
                    That's pretty funny, man. What do you do?
          
                              CARNBY
                    You really want to know?
          
                              CABBIE
                    Yeah, man. Hearing about my passengers'
                    lives keeps the job interesting.

                    I'm an effective solution to unusual
                    problems.
          
          Carnby turns to look out the back windshield. Pinkerton's
          taxi is still following from a few cars back.
          
                              CARNBY (CONT'D)
                    Speaking of which, that taxi's been
                    following us since the airport.
          
                              CABBIE
                    No shit? Want me to lose him?

                    If you can...
          
          The Cabbie GUNS the motor and speeds off.
          
             
          
          13CC EXT. CITY STREETS                                            13CC
               Carnby's taxi accelerates down the street, pulling away from
               Pinkerton's taxi.
          
               As soon as it's evident that they are on to him, Pinkerton's
               taxi speeds up to give chase.
          
               The two taxis rocket down the streets, swerving past cars,
               SCREECHING around corners.
          
               Carnby's taxi speeds down the streets, narrowly avoiding
               collisions with other cars and PEDESTRIANS.
          
               Pinkerton just plows through whatever's in his way, SMASHING
               past other cars, forcing Pedestrians to jump out of the way.
          
               Pinkerton accelerates and tries to force Carnby's taxi off
               the road. The taxi's GRIND against one another.
          
               Carnby's taxi SCREECHES around a corner, speeding into a side
               street that leads to the Market Street.
          
              
          
                                                                            7.
          
          
          
                EXT. MARKET STREET
          13D                                                                    13D
                A busy street crowded with PEDESTRIANS, open shops, and
                produce stalls.
          
                Carnby's taxi races down the busy Market Street, followed by
                Pinkerton.
          
                They swerve and SCREECH down the Street, cutting off other
                cars, and narrowly avoiding Pedestrians.
          
                But then Pinkerton's taxi ZOOMS up beside Carnby's taxi and
                BUMPS into it with a GRINDING CRUSH of metal.
          
                Not stopping, Pinkerton's taxi continues to GRIND into
                Carnby's taxi. The momentum pushes Carnby's taxi around
                sideways.
          
                Pinkerton's taxi then SLAMS Carnby's sideways taxi into a
                parked car with a CRUSH of metal and SHATTERING glass.
          
                There's a moment as Carnby, trapped inside the CRUSHED taxi
                and Pinkerton, flooring the accelerator to add more pressure,
                exchange a look. Pinkerton's expression is fierce.
          
                Pinkerton gears the taxi into reverse, backing up in order to
                smash into Carnby's taxi again.
          
                The Cabbie is trapped by the crushed front of the taxi. His
                face is covered with a spiderweb of deep cuts. The Cabbie
                struggles to get loose.
          
                                      CABBIE
                            I'm trapped, man!
          
                                      CARNBY
                            I'll draw him away...
          
                As Pinkerton's taxi backs up, it CRASHES into a Van driving
                by, knocking it over onto its side and spilling the contents
                of the Van onto the street.
          
                This gives Carnby the brief moment he needs to extract
                himself from the crushed taxi. He wrenches himself out the
                window, just in time to see Pinkerton's taxi accelerating
                towards him.
          
                Carnby bolts away from the crushed taxi and the trapped
                Cabbie.
          
                Pinkerton immediately swerves his taxi, aiming it right for
                the running Carnby. Pinkerton's taxi rockets towards him.
          
          
                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                CONTINUED:
          
          
                Carnby leaps out of the way as Pinkerton's taxi CRASHES into
                the side of a Building, narrowly missing him. Pinkerton's
                taxi is CRUMPLED in a CRASH of metal and glass.
          
                Carnby narrowly avoids being crushed between the taxi and the
                building. With fluid grace, Carnby rolls to safety, landing
                on his feet. With a quick look back over his shoulder at
                Pinkerton in his crumpled taxi, Carnby runs.
          
                Pinkerton steps out of his taxi, seemingly unhurt by the
                crash. He looks around, but can't see Carnby anywhere on the
                street.
          
                Pinkerton runs for an iron-wrought staircase that leads up to
                a Pedestrian Bridge that hangs over the Street.
          
                At the top of the Pedestrian Bridge, Pinkerton looks up and
                down the street.
          
                He spots Carnby, running through the crowd of Pedestrians.
          
                Pinkerton leaps off the Pedestrian Bridge, arcing through the
                air with superhuman force.
          
                Pinkerton TACKLES the running Carnby to the ground, SLAMMING
                into him with a tremendous impact.
          
                But Carnby is quick. He takes the hit and spins Pinkerton
                around with a martial-arts kick. The kick sends Pinkerton
                CRASHING through the front window of a Bakery.

                Pinkerton comes CRASHING through the display window, landing
                in a pile of sticky buns and broken glass.
          
                But seemingly unfazed, he just picks himself up and walks
                back out the front door.

                Carnby stands in a crowd of BYSTANDERS, watching in surprise
                as Pinkerton exits the Bakery, his expression fierce.
          
                Pinkerton immediately spots Carnby and comes after him.
          
                Carnby bolts away, running into a Herbalist Store across the
                street.

                Jars of different shapes and sizes containing a variety of
                medicinal herbs and other such substances are on display.
          
                Carnby runs into the Herbalist Store, making his way through
                the displays.
          
                Pinkerton leaps right through the Herbalist Store's front
                display window in a hail of SHATTERED glass.
          
                He tackles Carnby, CRASHING through the jars on display.
          
                Pinkerton SLAMS Carnby to the ground. He grabs Carnby's head
                and SMASHES it against the floor once, then twice.
          
                Pinkerton tears open Carnby's trench-coat. He pulls out the
                burlap sack. He opens the sack, confirming the stone carving
                is inside it.
          
                While Pinkerton inspects the stone carving, Carnby's hand
                quietly moves to a large glass jar lying next to them.
          
                Carnby SMASHES the glass jar over Pinkerton's face.
          
                He grabs the stone carving out of Pinkerton's hand, scrambles
                to his feet, and runs.

                Carnby BURSTS out of the Herbalist Store's back door, exiting
                out into a small, cluttered Alley.
          
                Carnby lands hard in the debris, but he rolls with the fall
                and is back up on his feet, running.
          
                The Alley ends in a high Wall with a Billboard on top of it.
                The Wall has a railing along one side.
          
                Carnby vaults over the railing and keeps running.
          
                The Alley is crowded with WORKERS unloading crates out of the
                loading dock of the Ice Factory.
          
                A BEAT COP walks by. Carnby runs past the Beat Cop, just
                barely bumping into him.
          
                But as Carnby passes him, he deftly grabs the Beat Cop's gun
                from his holster.
          
                The Beat Cop doesn't even notice his gun is missing as he
                turns, annoyed to see Carnby racing away.
          
          
                                                                    (CONTINUED)

                          Hey!
          
                Pinkerton runs out of the Herbalist Store's back door. He
                runs directly at the high Wall.
          
                Pinkerton leaps up, scrambling right up the side of the Wall.
                He hauls himself up the Billboard, until he's standing at the
                top of the Billboard itself.
          
                Pinkerton looks down below and spots Carnby running into the
                loading dock of the Ice Factory.
          
                Pinkerton leaps off the Billboard.
          
                The Beat Cop looks up, stunned to see Pinkerton leaping
                towards him.
          
                Pinkerton lands on top of a moving dolly of crates, CRUSHING
                the crates on it. The WORKER pushing the dolly falls back,
                shocked. Pinkerton leaps off the dolly and keeps chasing
                after Carnby.
          
                The Beat Cop fumbles for his gun. It's not there. Pinkerton
                smashes the Beat Cop out of the way as he pursues Carnby.
          
                The Beat Cop flies into a pile of crates, knocked out.
                Pinkerton follows Carnby into the Ice Factory.

                The refrigerated Ice Factory is filled with neat rows of ice
                blocks. FACTORY WORKERS mill about, transporting the blocks
                of ice through the Factory.
          
                Carnby hides between the rows of ice blocks. He checks the
                Beat Cop's gun to make sure it's loaded. It is.
          
                Carnby stops, sensing something.
          
                In one fluid motion, Carnby suddenly spins, turning in the
                other direction and FIRING the gun.
          
                We follow the bullet as it rockets through the Ice Factory.
                It WHIZZES along, until we see Carnby's intended target.
          
                Pinkerton comes through the Ice Factory, running at Carnby.
                The bullet flies directly at him.
          
                The bullet hits Pinkerton in the shoulder. But it only seems
                to anger Pinkerton further. He keeps running at Carnby.

               in a hail of ice shards.
          
               Pinkerton rolls with his dodge and races off into the stacks
               of ice blocks.
          
               Carnby tries to track Pinkerton's movements through the ice
               stacks. He hears the sound of Pinkerton MOVING, but can't see
               him. His gun is ready. He searches around.
          
               Suddenly, there's a RUSH of movement behind him. Carnby
               dodges just as Pinkerton's fist comes flying out. Pinkerton
               connects with an ice block, SHATTERING it.
          
               Carnby is backed into a dead end in the Ice Factory. He turns
               to face Pinkerton, gun ready.
          
               But Pinkerton is on him too quickly. He lunges at Carnby,
               hoisting him over his head and SLAMMING him down on a
               conveyer belt.
          
               Pinkerton drags Carnby along the conveyer belt. But Carnby
               grabs a hanging chain to steady himself. With a quick kick,
               Carnby uses the momentum to flip Pinkerton over him.
          
               Pinkerton flies through the air towards a large ice pick
               wedged into the wall. The sharp point of the ice pick punches
               right through Pinkerton's torso, impaling him. He is
               immediately killed.
          
               Carnby leans up against the wall, steadying himself. He pulls
               the stone carving out of his pocket to check it. In the
               fight, the carving has been cracked into pieces.
          
               But the broken carving reveals something hidden inside it, a
               small gold artifact that was concealed in the carving.
          
               The artifact is a gold circle, flat on the top and bottom,
               its thick round side engraved with intricate Abkani symbols.
               This is the lynchpin artifact, the piece which connects the
               other artifacts together.

                Standing on the Ship's wide deck, Captain Chernick looks
                impatient. Hudgens stands over the large, barnacle-covered
                container. The container is secured with a heavy rusted lock.

                the Dock.
          
                                       CAPTAIN CHERNICK
                             Don't you want to open it? Make sure it's
                             what you're looking for?
          
                                       HUDGENS
                             The conditions must be perfect.
                             Otherwise, there will be... consequences.
          
                Captain Chernick steps up to the barnacle-covered container.
                He notices that a section of the barnacles have gotten
                scraped off in the transport.
          
                Under the barnacles, the container is revealed to made of
                gold. Chernick look startled.
          
                Captain Chernick rubs the gold spot on the container and
                looks closely at it.
          
                                       CAPTAIN CHERNICK
                             Is this made of solid gold?
          
                                       HUDGENS
                             Did you know the Abkani were the first
                             civilization to use gold for their
                             valuables? They believed it held the
                             power to contain evil spirits. Thousands
                             of years later, we don't even remember
                             why gold was valuable to us in the first
                             place. Now, let's load it onto the truck.
          
                Captain Chernick exchanges a look with the First Mate and
                Crewman Barnes. They both give him a subtle nod.

                          The pictograms are late-period Abkani. It
                          seems to be some sort of... prophecy.

                          is the first indication I've ever seen
                          that the Abkani had a myth about the end

                Captain Chernick approaches Hudgens at the container. The

                          If the container's made of gold,
                          whatever's inside must be worth a
                          fortune.

                Chernick pulls out a pistol.

                          But I'm looking forward to finding out.
          
                Chernick smacks Hudgens across the face with his pistol.
                Hudgens gives Chernick a grim look.

                 rewman Barnes grabs Hudgens and twists his arms behind his
                back, incapacitating him. The First Mate pulls out a revolver
                and points it right at Hudgens' face.

               Crewman Barnes SMASHES Hudgens' head against the container.
               Hudgens is dazed from the blow.

                         Throw him in there.
          
               Crewman Barnes throws the dazed Hudgens into a Storage Room
               built onto the Deck. He slams the thick metal door closed.
               The door has a small, glass-covered peephole built into it.
          
               Chernick pries open the lock with the crowbar. Chernick hands
               the First Mate the crowbar and he jams it into the handle of
               the door, wedging it closed.

               although it is clear something invisible is holding him up.
          
          
          
          
                                                                     (CONTINUED)

               The First Mate and Crewman Barnes look on, stunned, their
               revolvers aimed at the floating Captain.
          
               Captain Chernick's body contorts, as if something had been
               thrust into it. With a burst of blood, a hole is ripped into
               his torso, killing him.
          
               Captain Chernick's lifeless body is dropped to the ground.
          
               Terrified, the First Mate and Crewman Barnes aim their
          4    revolvers at the empty air. They OPEN FIRE.

               Hudgens stands at the door, listening to the GUNFIRE.
          
               He looks through the peephole in the door. The peephole is
               dirty, hard to see through. Something frantic is happening
               outside the door, but it's hard to see exactly what.
          
               There is more GUNFIRE and then SCREAMING. Short BURSTS of
               AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE follow, and more SCREAMING.
          
               And then, all is quiet.
          
               Hudgens grabs a discarded metal rod and jams it into the door
               handle, wedging it closed. He backs away from the door. The
               only weapon he can see is a box-cutter. He grabs it, holding
               it out in front of him.
          
               Suddenly, there's a CRASH at the door. Something pushes at
               the door, trying to get in. The door RATTLES and THUMPS from
               the impact.
          
               Hudgens, still holding the box-cutter, strains against the
               door, using all the effort he can muster to keep it shut. The
               metal rod wedged against the door is starting to buckle.
          
               Suddenly, the door is still. Hudgens waits. Nothing.
          
               There's a CRASH as another impact hits the door. The RACKET
               is even more intense. But the door holds.
          
               Finally, the thrashing stops. All is quiet again.
          
               The lights in the Storage Room stop flickering. They come
               back on. Hudgens listens, straining to hear anything at all.
          
               Cautious, Hudgens pulls away the metal rod. He gingerly
               touches the door. With a long CREAK, it slowly swings open.
               The crowbar was shaken loose from all the impacts.

               Hudgens steps out of the Storage Room. He looks around the
               Deck. Mist blows in off the water. The night is quiet.
          
               Bodies lie everywhere, Captain Chernick, the First Mate,
               Crewman Barnes, the other Crewmen. Their weapons lie next to
               their slashed, ripped open bodies.
          
               Bullet holes are pocked around the Deck. Streaks of blood are
               smeared everywhere. Shell casings and corpses are all that
               remain of the battle.
          
               Tense, carefully looking around, Hudgens walks up to the
               empty gold container.
          
               He reaches into it, pressing a concealed panel at the back of
               the container.
          
               The panel opens, revealing a small artifact. The artifact is
               a thin hollow cylinder with a thick little protrusion on one
               end. It is covered in Abkani symbols.
          
               Hudgens takes out the artifact. He turns it around in his
               hand. He looks pleased.

                Sister Clara opens the front door. SOPHIE (age 13) stands
                with her, eyeing Carnby suspiciously.
          
                                    SISTER CLARA
                          Welcome home, Edward.

                          Yes. Thank you, Sophie.
          
                Sophie sneaks a look back at Carnby as she enters the house.
          
                Sister Clara approaches Carnby, smiling warmly.
          
                                    SISTER CLARA (CONT'D)
                          Let me get a look at you. Are you
                          sleeping enough?

                          Sister... John disappeared last night.
                          And something happened to me as well.
          
                Sister Clara's expression drops.

                          It's happening again.
          
                A YOUNG GIRL (age 8) runs up to them. She hides behind Sister
                Clara, staring up at Carnby, curious, a little scared. Carnby
                smiles at the Young Girl and she ducks behind Sister Clara.
                But then she sticks her face out to watch him again.
          
                                    CARNBY
                          I need your help, Sister. I need to find
                          the others.
          
                                    SISTER CLARA

                Carnby is on the phone, sitting in front of his computer.
                While he speaks, he reads information on the FEDERAL MISSING

               Carnby has a list of nineteen names, the grown-up ORPHANS
               from his Orphanage. Next to each name, Carnby has written a
               note. Fourteen are missing. Five are unaccounted for so far.
          
               Carnby writes a note next to the second-to-last name on the
               list. Also missing. Four now unaccounted for.
          
               On the work station is a stack of the Orphanage's worn-out
               old file folders. Each file matches a name on the list.
          
               The database finishes processing. It has found a match. A
               MISSING PERSON REPORT flashes onscreen. It's the final name
               of the list. Carnby makes a note next to the name.
          
               Carnby hits PRINT and the report comes out of the printer. He
               adds it to a small stack of similar reports.
          
               Each report has a photo of a missing Orphan, both MALE and
               FEMALE. One of the photos is of John Houghton.
          
               Sixteen are missing. Three are unaccounted for.

               The outdoor patio of a downtown Restaurant. Carnby sits with
               a coffee and a cherry pie at a table for two.
          
               AGENT PAUL FISCHER (mid-50s), precise but friendly,
               approaches the table and sits down across from Carnby.

               A WAITER walks up. He puts down a plate of pecan pie in front
               of Fischer. The Waiter smiles and walks away.
          
                                   CARNBY
                         I ordered for you, Fischer. It's pecan.
          
               Fischer gives Carnby a smirk.
          
                                   FISCHER
                         You've got a good memory, Carnby.
          
               Fischer takes a bite of the pecan pie.
          
               Fischer pulls out a file and slides it across the table.
               Carnby opens the file. Inside it are photos and reports on

                         I tracked down the three you asked about.
                         They all disappeared last night. Same
                         story. No suitcase. No car. Just up and
                         walked out in the middle of the night.

                         grew up in the same orphanage. Your

               her fingers over the Abkani symbols carved into it.

                          Yesterday, maybe not. But something
                          happened last night.

                INT. MUSEUM/ALINE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
          
                Aline and Carnby stand at a work station. A piece of cloth
                covers up something on the work station.
          
                 line pulls back the cloth, revealing three Abkani artifacts.
          
                Each of the three artifacts is a gold ring, one small and
                thin, one medium and slightly thicker, and one large. The
                large ring is shaped like a pyramid with the top cut off and
                has thin protrusions on its base. Each of the ring artifacts
                is well-worn from age and engraved with Abkani symbols.
          
                Aline puts the lynchpin artifact down next to the others.

                          They were found in completely different
                          locations. Alaska. Newfoundland.
                          Venezuela. And now this one's from Chile.

                          Ten thousand years ago, it would've been
                          like burying them at the ends of the
                          earth.
          
                Aline picks up the lynchpin artifact again. She runs her
                fingers over one symbol in particular, carved into the flat
                top of the artifact: the DARK SPIRIT.

                          The Abkani's written language is based on
                          pictograms. Combinations of symbols to
                          create different meanings. But there's
                          one here I've never seen before.
          
                 he lights in the Office start to flicker. In unison, the
                computer monitors all go dark.
          
                Carnby pulls out a flashlight and flicks it on.
          
                                    CARNBY
                          You're not trying to seduce me, are you?

                          Give me that.
          
                Aline grabs Carnby's flashlight. She lights their way to the
                Office door.

                The lights flicker. Large shadows are cast through the area
                by the remaining, dim lights.
          
                The Guard sits at the Security Desk, talking on the phone.

                          our power. Get someone down here, pronto.
          
                The Guard hangs up the phone.
          
                There's a WHOOSH of movement behind him. The Guard turns to
                the sound. Silence.
          
                He flicks on his flashlight, shining the beam into the dark
                corners of the area. Nothing is there.
          
                Something CLATTERS in another room. The Guard quickly turns
                to the sound of the movement.

                Carnby and Aline walk down the Hallway. Framed art hangs from
                the walls. Small sculptures sit on pedestals along the way.
          
                The overhead lights in the Hallway emit only a low glow,
                flickering sporadically.
          
                Aline leads the way with a flashlight. They come up to a door
                to a second Hallway.
          
                The hairs on the back of Carnby's neck rise up. He touches
                the back of his neck, spooked. Aline notices.

                Aline gets it.
          
                Carnby pulls out his PARA-METER. It's an old, battered
                device. The display lights up as Carnby turns it on. The para-
                meter immediately picks up some readings.

                Carnby listens at the door. Carnby nods to Aline as he opens
                the door. Nothing is there.

                The Guard enters the Ceramics Room. The overhead lights give
                off only low glows, flickering sporadically.
          
                The display cases and large sculptures give off long shadows.
          
                The Guard walks through the room, shining his flashlight
                around. He can't see anything out of the ordinary.
          
                A WHOOSH of movement slips past the Guard. He turns quickly.
                Nothing.
          
                He shines his flashlight around, looking for anything out of
                the ordinary. He stands with his back to a display case.
          
                From out of the shadows behind the display case, a long,
                segmented tail emerges.
          
                 The tail is covered in hard, dark scales. At the end of the
                tail is a sharp spike.
          
                The tail suddenly flicks at the Guard, piercing him through
                the back of the head and out his mouth. The tail's spike
                glistens with fresh blood.
          
                The Guard's flashlight CLATTERS to the floor. The bulb
                BREAKS.
          
                The tail withdraws from the Guard. The Guard's body falls to
                the ground, dead.

                Aline leads the way with the flashlight, followed by Carnby.
                The Hallway is only faintly lit.
          
                From up ahead, they hear a CLATTERING sound.
          
                Carnby reaches into his holster and pulls out his revolver.
                Aline hands him the flashlight without a word.

               Aline and Carnby quietly come out a service door that leads
               to the Ceramics Room. They conceal themselves behind a pair
               of columns, scanning the area before they step out.
          
               The lights are dim, with long shadows stretching out through
               the area.
          
               Aline is about to speak, but Carnby puts a finger to his
               mouth and shakes his head, no.
          
               The dead body of the Guard lies in a pool of blood on the
               ground. There seems to be no one else around.
          
               But then, silently, moving with a fluid grace, a XENOMORPH
               CREATURE emerges out of the shadows.
          
               The xenomorph creature is huge, terrifying. It is seven feet
               tall, covered in thick, dark scales. It stands on two legs,
               with long, powerful arms that end in razor-sharp claws and a
               segmented, spiked tail poised behind it.
          
               Its demonic head has black, sunken eyes and a severe jaw
               lined with jagged, fang-like teeth. The head is identical to
               the stone carving in which the lynchpin artifact was encased.
          
               Carnby and Aline look shocked. They freeze, not moving a
               muscle.
          
               Another xenomorph creature steps out of the shadows.
          
               The two creatures congregate in the middle of the room. They
               are the same hulking, grotesque brutes.
          
               The two creatures start to communicate. An unintelligible
               language passes between them.
          
               Suddenly, one of the creatures looks up, sensing something.
          
                The creature looks directly at Carnby and Aline, hiding
               behind the columns.
          
               The creature delivers a SHARP WHISPER.
          
               And with that, the creature fades into invisibility. It has
               totally disappeared.
          
               The second creature immediately follows suit, also fading
               invisible.

                Carnby and Aline scramble to their feet and sprint back
                towards the service door.
          
                An invisible creature comes racing after them. All that is
                visible is the effect of the creature's movement. It knocks
                over a statue as it chases after them. The statue SMASHES to
                the ground.

                Aline and Carnby run down the long Hallway, towards a pair of
                double-doors at the other end.
          
                The service door behind them bursts open. An invisible
                creature runs down the Hallway towards them.
          
                As the invisible creature runs, it knocks framed art off the
                walls, smashes aside tables and chairs. The creature isn't
                visible, only the effect of its movement.
          
                Carnby turns and FIRES his gun at the on-rushing creature.
          
                But his bullets don't hit anything except the wall on the
                other side of the Hallway.
          
                Carnby keeps FIRING, still not hitting anything.
          
                The invisible creature races towards them.
          
                Suddenly, the double-doors at the other end of the Hallway
                burst open. The second invisible creature starts running
                towards them.
          
                Both directions down the Hallway are now blocked.
          
                Carnby spots an open door marked STORAGE ROOM. He pushes
                Aline into it and jumps in after her.

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          There's a CRASH as the creature SLAMS against the other side
          of the door. Carnby strains to keep it closed. The door
          RATTLES as the creature CRASHES into it again.
          
          Aline finds the right key. She gets it into the lock.
          
          Suddenly, the creature PUNCHES a clawed hand right through
          the door.
          
          The hand is visible as it digs its claws into Aline's arm.
          The claws cut deep gashes into her. She SCREAMS in pain.
          
          The impact knocks the key out of the lock. Aline drops the
          keys as she clutches her arm.
          
          The creature's arm retracts out the hole in the door. It
          SMASHES into the door even harder, trying to break through.
          
          Carnby strains against the door, trying to keep it closed.
          
                              CARNBY
                    Can't hold it...
          
          Aline grabs her keys. She finds the right key, jams the key
          in the lock, and turns the bolt.
          
          There's another CRASH at the door. But the lock holds.
          
                              CARNBY (CONT'D)
                    Is there any way out of here?
          
                              ALINE
                    No! Why didn't you ask me that before you
                    pushed me in here?
          
          There's another CRASH. Carnby and Aline back away from the
          door. The door starts to buckle from the impacts.
          
          Carnby reloads his revolver. He has it ready.
          
          But then the CRASHING stops. Aline and Carnby listen.
          Everything is quiet.
          
          The sound of HELICOPTERS can be faintly heard in the
          distance.
          
          Carnby listens against the door.
          
                              ALINE (CONT'D)
                    What do you think?
          
          Carnby nods to her. Aline unlocks the door.
          
           
          
                                                                            37.

               Carnby steps out of the Storage Room, revolver ready. The
               Hallway is empty.
          
               Aline steps out behind him. She motions to the double-doors
               at the end of the Hallway.

                            Those doors lead to the front entrance.
          
               Carnby hands Aline the flashlight. He grips his revolver.
          
               Carnby and Aline move down the Hallway towards the double-
               doors. As they move, they listen intently. The only thing
               they can hear is the sound of their FOOTSTEPS.

               Aline and Carnby quietly open the double-doors leading into
               the Main Hall.
          
               The lights are dim. Moonlight streams in through the skylight
               above them.
          
               Aline shines the flashlight around. She hears a WHOOSH of
               movement behind her and shines the flashlight towards it.
          
               The sound of a quickly approaching HELICOPTER can be heard in
               the distance.
          
               The double-doors BURST open as an invisible creature SMASHES
               through them.
          
               It chases after them, knocking everything in its path out of
               the way
          
               Carnby and Aline run.
          
               Up ahead of them, the second invisible creature comes
               CRASHING through the display cases, heading right for them.
          
               Carnby and Aline are trapped between the two invisible
               creatures. They have nowhere to run.
          
               The sound of a HELICOPTER rises up overhead.
          
          
                                                                      (CONTINUED)

               Suddenly, powerful spotlights switch on, shining bright blue
               beams through the skylight. Another set of spotlight beams
               shine through the high windows lining the Main Hall.

               EXT. MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS
          
               A sleek black Bureau 713 helicopter hovers over the building.
               A pair of spotlights shine beams down through the skylight.
          
               INT. MUSEUM/MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS
          85                                                                   85
               In a hail of shattered glass, AGENTS BARR (male), CHEUNG
               (female), and MARKO (male) burst through the skylight,
               rappelling down on zip-lines from the hovering helicopter.
          
                They each carry a sleek, high-tech assault rifle with a lamp
               mounted on the top. They all wear full Bureau 713 combat
               gear, body armor with a headset comm-link and a helmet with a
               dark visor mounted on it.
          
               The creatures HISS in reaction and scramble out of the
               spotlights from the helicopter.
          
               The Agents immediately open FIRE. Their bullets glow with a
               pulse of yellow light as they streak through the air.
          
               All Carnby and Aline can see is the Agents shooting glowing
               bullets into the unnaturally long shadows.
          
               But the SQUEAL of one of the creatures shows that the Agents'
               bullets have found their target.
          
               As the glowing bullets hit the creature, it momentarily
               flashes visible, then invisible again.
          
               The two invisible creatures scatter, slipping away into the
               shadows.
          
               The Agents cut their zip-lines, dropping to the ground.
          
               As they land, they all flip on their rifle-mounted lamps. The
               bright blue beams cut through the darkness.
          
               Their movements are precise, controlled. They all have their
               rifles out, scanning the area.
          
               Agent Barr has a high-tech scanning device attached to his
               rifle. It is an updated version of Carnby's para-meter that
               monitors the electromagnetic energy in the vicinity. It is
               used to detect the presence of the xenomorph creatures.

                A long shadow slips across the room. Agent Cheung sees it.
          
                                       AGENT CHEUNG
                          There!
          
                Agent Cheung opens FIRE. Agents Barr and Marko are
                immediately at her side, FIRING at the invisible creature.
                Their bullets glow as they streak through the air.
          
                But the creature is too fast. The glowing bullets streak
                through the air, but don't hit it.

                Agents Cheung and Marko open FIRE, sending streams of glowing
                bullets across the Main Hall. But they don't hit anything.
          
                Agent Barr scans around with his rifle-mounted para-meter and
                lamp. Nothing.
          
                Carnby and Aline stand back, not wanting to get in the
                Agents' way, not equipped to really help.
          
                The dim lights suddenly flicker and come back on at full
                strength, bathing the debris of the battle in a warm glow.
          
                Agent Barr turns his rifle to Carnby and Aline. They stand
                their ground, facing him.

               A pair of Bureau 713 Humvees are parked with large spotlights
               set up in front of them, shining into the Museum.
          
                ommander Burke stands with Agent Miles. They both wear full
               combat gear, visors, and headset comm-links. Burke addresses
               five AGENTS in combat gear.

          Aline looks over at Carnby. He nods to her.
          
                              CARNBY
                    I'll catch up.
          
          Agent Miles escorts Aline out of the Museum.
          
          Burke and Carnby regard one another.
          
                              BURKE
                    Why am I still looking at you?
          
                              CARNBY
                    I need to know what those things are.
          
                              BURKE
                    That information's classified. If you
                    were still an agent, you'd already know.
                    But since you're not, stay out of my way.
          
          Burke turns to stride away. Carnby grabs his arm. Burke turns
          back, annoyed.
          
                              CARNBY
                    I'm asking nicely.
          
           Burke grabs Carnby's arm, trying to twist it away. But
          Carnby's fast enough to slip out of Burke's hold.
          
          Now angry, Burke grabs Carnby by the collar, shoving him
          against a stone column.
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                CONTINUED: (2)
          
          
                But Carnby deftly twists out of Burke's grip and shoves him
                up against the same stone column.
          
                In the struggle, Carnby's hand flicks into Burke's pocket.
          
                Agent Barr intervenes, pulling Carnby away. Burke straightens
                himself out, trying not to look rattled.
          
                                    BURKE
                          Get him out of here!
          
                Carnby shrugs off Agent Barr and walks away.
          
                                    CARNBY
                          You're right, Commander. I guess I have
                          gone soft.
          
                As Carnby walks off, he looks down in his hand. He has lifted
                Burke's I-D card out of his pocket.

                Aline sits in the back of a 713 Emergency Medical Vehicle. A
                713 MEDIC finishes dressing the cuts on her arm.
          
                Carnby approaches her. Aline nods to the Medic and gets up to
                join Carnby. They speak quietly.

                Burke oversees a team of AGENTS in biohazard suits as they
                sweep the scene, running scans of the area on high-tech hand-
                held devices. Photos are snapped by another AGENT.
          
                Agent Miles escorts Aline over to Burke. Burke is distracted
                by the scanning device he is holding.

                          The museum's quarantined until we're
                          done.
          
                                    ALINE
                          At least let me pack up my work. There's
                          priceless artifacts in there. If they get
                          damaged...
          
                Burke looks up at Aline. He gives a minute nod to Miles.
          
                                    BURKE
                          If you notice anything out of the

                Aline looks around at the Agents scanning the destruction
                caused by the creatures.

                The Lab is full of sleek, high-tech lab equipment and state
                of the art computers. The room is lit with a HUMMING
                fluorescent light. Surgical equipment and various pieces of
                high-tech machinery BUZZ by an autopsy slab. Surgical tools
                are laid out on a table.
          
                Pinkerton's body is laid out on the slab, face-down.
          
                Fischer stands over Pinkerton's body. He holds a high-tech
                hand-held scanning device. The scanner is connected to a
                large monitor on a dolly next to the slab.
          
                Fischer holds the scanner a few inches above Pinkerton's
                body, passing it along the length of him.
          
                The image on the monitor matches the movements of the
                scanner. It shows a real-time internal scan of Pinkerton's
                body, displaying the skeleton, internal organs, and so on.
          
                Visible on the monitor is a spinal worm curled up tight
                around Pinkerton's spine.
          
          
                                                                    (CONTINUED)

          Fischer doesn't look up, but his tone suddenly changes.
          
                              FISCHER
                    You shouldn't be here, Carnby.
          
          Carnby stands in the doorway. He waves Burke's I-D card.
          
                              CARNBY
                    I'm not here. Commander Burke is. Now
                    what the hell is that thing inside him?
          
                              FISCHER
                    Your curiosity have anything to do with
                    the fingerprint of yours I found on his
                    corpse?
          
                              CARNBY
                    The list of people I trust is short,
                    Fischer. Is it about to get shorter?
          
          Fischer turns back to Pinkerton's body. Carnby comes up and
          stands next to him.
          
          Fischer takes a scalpel off the table and makes a careful
          incision along Pinkerton's back.
          
                              CARNBY (CONT'D)
                    Have you I-D'd him?
          
                              FISCHER
                    Yeah, we got dentals. Agent James
                    Pinkerton. He's ex-713.
          
                              CARNBY
                    He was an agent? When?
          
          Using tongs, Fischer peels back the skin of Pinkerton's back.
          The spinal-worm is attached to Pinkerton's spine.
          
                              FISCHER
                    Went MIA twenty years ago. Presumed dead.
                    I'm trying to get more intell, but his
                    records are so classified, they're
                    practically invisible.
          C
           arnby takes the tongs from Fischer, holding open the skin.
          Fischer makes a series of incisions with the scalpel,
          disconnecting the spinal-worm from Pinkerton's spine.
          
                              CARNBY
                    It's fused with his nervous system.

                         I've never seen this kind of symbiosis
                         before.
          
               Fischer pulls the spinal-worm out of Pinkerton's open back
               with a pair of tongs. It hangs limply, motionless.
          
               The spinal-worm is long and thick, covered with hard, dark
               scales. It has dozens of tiny clawed feet that were connected
               to Pinkerton's spine.
          
                ischer drops the spinal-worm in a tub.
          
                ischer notices the hand-held scanning device is BEEPING
               faintly, still registering something. He looks at the read-
               out, curious, then concerned.

                         Scanner's still reading something...
          
               Fischer runs the scanner over Pinkerton's corpse. Nothing.
          
               Now Fischer looks even more concerned. He turns the scanner
               on himself, running it up and down his torso. Nothing.
          
               Fischer looks at Carnby. Carnby gets it. It might be him.
          
               Fischer runs the scanner over Carnby's torso. The scanner
               immediately starts BEEPING louder.
          
               They exchange a look between them. Something's inside Carnby.

          Hudgens stands up to his full height, suddenly menacing.

          Agent Cheung stands at the door, still wearing her full 713
          combat gear. Her visor is up. She casually holds her rifle.

                Hudgens looks back at Aline and smiles warmly.

                Hudgens turns back and gives Aline another smile.

                          Just an empty shipwreck. You were right.
                          It was another wild goosechase.
          
                Hudgens exits quickly. Aline and Agent Cheung watch him go.

                A spinal worm is visible around Carnby's spine. But it looks

                Aline sits at her computer, checking out 3-D scans of the
                four Abkani artifacts. She is running an analysis the symbols
                carved into each artifact.
          
                Streams of calculations run across the screen as the computer
                processes. The computer BEEPS as it comes to a conclusion.
                The symbols correlate to constellations in the night sky.
          
                Aline hits COPY on her computer and it burns a CD of the
                information she has processed.
          
                Aline searches through a roll of maps. She pulls out a map of
                North America and lays it out on a work station.
          
                Aline draws lines across the map, trying to pinpoint a
                location based on the constellations. She marks the map up
                with latitude and longitude calculations.
          
                She stops. She looks back up at the computer screen. She taps
                her pen on the map. She looks frustrated.

                coat and lets it drop on the floor.
          
                He drops the duffle-bag on the floor. He kicks off his boots.

                Hudgens walks through a dank cement room. Various pieces of
                scientific equipment sit in a corner. Shelves are lined with
                ancient artifacts, small sculptures, and masks.
          
                Hudgens stops at a work station and pauses. A look of pain
                crosses his face. He winces, holding it in. He steadies
                himself.
          
                At the other side of the Lab is a large recess in the space.
                The opening is covered by thick cage bars covered in gold.
                The cage appears to be empty.
          
                But suddenly, an invisible creature SLAMS into the bars of
                the cage, trying to lunge at Hudgens.
          
                As it hits the bars, fingers of electricity jolt through it,
                making it visible for a split second.
          
                Hudgens watches calmly. He goes to a small dial built into
                the wall beside the cage. Hudgens turns up the dial.
          
                In the cage, jagged bolts of electricity jolt around the
                invisible creature. It SQUEALS and HISSES from the
                electricity.

                Finally, the creature collapses and fades visible. The
                creature is unconscious, but still alive.
          
                Hudgens turns the dial back down.
          
                Hudgens picks up a hypodermic syringe from a counter next to
                the cage.
          
                He injects the syringe into the creature's neck, between two
                of its scales. He withdraws a syringe-full of the creature's
                black, sticky blood.
          
                He goes back to the work station, rolling up the sleeve of
                his shirt. His arm is pocked with injection marks.
          
                Hudgens ties off his arm, preps a vein, and injects himself
                with the syringe of creature's blood. He closes his eyes,
                feeling the substance flow into him.

                Aline walks up to an imposing, slightly decrepit-looking old
                brick building in a bad area of town.
          
                She goes to press the buzzer, but the box is broken, the
                wires limply hanging out.
          
                She KNOCKS on the door. No answer.
          
                She stops, annoyed. But then a slight, involuntary smile
                comes across her face.
          
                 Aline fishes in her purse and pulls out a set of keys. She
                finds the key she's looking for and slips it into the lock on
                the front door.

               looking around.

               Aline stops. She sees Carnby lying on his bed, asleep. She
               smiles. He looks peaceful.
          
               Aline sees the lynchpin artifact sitting in the lab area. She
               unpacks her bag, taking out three items wrapped in cloth. She
               places the three items next to the lynchpin artifact.
          
               She looks over at Carnby, sleeping in his bed.
          
               Aline kicks off her shoes and walks over to the bed.
          
               She climbs onto the bed, careful not to disturb Carnby. He
               stirs a little, but he doesn't wake up. Aline lies down next
               to Carnby on the bed. She notices the new scars and bruises
               along his back.
          
               Aline lays her head on a pillow. Their faces lie close
               together. She watches Carnby sleep.
          
               Aline leans over and gives Carnby the lightest of kisses. He
               doesn't wake up.

               The Kitchen is comfortable, lived in. Fischer's suit jacket
               hangs on the back of a chair. His revolver and holster also
               hang on the chair.
          
               Fischer's wife, SARAH FISCHER (early 50s) stirs the contents
               of a pot with a wooden spoon. Fischer makes a salad.

                         You did the right thing, Paul. From what
                         you've told me, Carnby can take care of

               touches her hair, purses her lips, and turns to the door.

               Fischer dives for the revolver hanging in his holster on the
               chair. He pulls a container of glowing bullets out of the
               pocket of his jacket.
          
               The container spills on the floor. He scrambles to pick up
               the bullets and load them into the revolver.
          
               Fischer edges to the Kitchen door, listening, anxious.
               Everything is quiet.

               Fischer quietly opens the door to the Living Room, gripping
               his revolver tightly. He steps into the room.
          
               The lights in the Living Room are out. A broken lamp lies
               SMASHED on its side.
          
               Fischer comes around the side of the couch. He stops,
               shocked.
          
               Sarah Fischer's dead body lies in a pool of blood.

          Fischer is suddenly grabbed and SLAMMED into the wall. The
          impact knocks several framed photos of Fischer and his Wife
          off the wall. They SHATTER as they hit the floor.
          
          Fischer is PUNCHED in the face, hard. He is stunned.
          
          Fischer is hurled over the couch. He lands heavily on a glass
          coffee table, SHATTERING the glass tabletop.
          
          The impact knocks his revolver out of his hands.
          
          Fischer lies dazed in the broken glass. He looks up at his
          attacker.
          
          It's Hudgens, standing over him.
          
          Hudgens SLAMS his fist into Fischer's face. Fischer is now
          only semi-conscious.
          
          Hudgens pulls out a long, thin spinal-worm. Its many clawed
          feet and razor-sharp jaws snap away, its segmented, scaled
          body writhing in his grip.
          
                              HUDGENS
                    If you can't beat us, Fischer, join us.
          
          Hudgens grabs Fischer by his hair and pulls his head back,
          forcing his mouth open.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          We follow the spinal-worm as it enters Fischer's mouth,
          slipping down his throat.
          
          We continue to follow the spinal-worm as it makes its way
          through Fischer's body, weaving through the twists and turns
          of his digestive system and internal organs.
          
          The spinal-worm tears through layers of Fischer's insides,
          finally making its way to his spine. The spinal-worm then
          wraps itself around Fischer's spine, its tiny clawed feet
          grabbing hold and attaching themselves along its length.
          
          We move up Fischer's spinal cord to his brain. The spinal-
          worm seems to be causing synapses to fire in chaotic bursts.
          We travel through Fischer's brain and out of his eyes.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          Fischer's expression is now calm. Hudgens regards Fischer,
          looking pleased with himself.

                fresh shirt.
          
                Carnby pads over to the lab area and turns on a desk light.
                He sees the wrapped items Aline placed on his work station.
          
                Carnby unwraps the items. They are the three Abkani artifacts
                from the Museum.
          
                Carnby picks up the lynchpin artifact, turning it around.
                Something catches his eye. Carnby fiddles with the artifact.
          
                Suddenly, the artifact telescopes out. Instead of one thick
                ring, it is now three successively smaller rings, one piled
                on the other, with a common hollow middle.
          
          
          
          
                                                                     (CONTINUED)

                CONTINUED:
          
          
                Carnby picks up the large ring artifact. He slots it into
                place on the telescoped lynchpin artifact. Next, Carnby slots
                in the medium and small rings into place.
          
                The four pieces fit together perfectly, creating a
                cylindrical device with a small, round opening in the bottom.

                INT. CARNBY'S LOFT - LATER
          
                Carnby cooks omelettes in the Kitchen area of the Loft. The
                ingredients are spread out on the counter.
          
                Aline wakes up. She sits up in the bed and looks around.
          
                                    ALINE
                          Something smells amazing.
          
                Aline trots over to the Kitchen area as Carnby serves up the
                omelettes. Aline gives him a look.
          
                                    ALINE (CONT'D)
                          I love omelettes.
          
                                    CARNBY
                          I know.
          
                Carnby sits down across from Aline. They eat while they talk.
          
                                    ALINE
                          I figured out a connection with the
                          symbols on those artifacts. They
                          correspond to constellations. But
                          something's missing.
          
                                    CARNBY
                          Maybe this will help...
          
                Carnby takes out the assembled Abkani device and puts it down
                on the table between them.
          
                Aline picks up the device, fascinated. She runs her fingers
                over the Abkani symbols carved into the lynchpin artifact.
          
                She goes to her bag and pulls out the map she was working on
                and the CD. She hands Carnby the CD.
          
                                    ALINE
                          Can you run the program on this?
          
                Carnby goes over to his computer and inserts the CD.
          
          
          
          
                                                                    (CONTINUED)
          
                  
          
          
                                                                                   59.
                CONTINUED:
          
          
                Aline spreads out the map. She draws lines across it,
                connecting up constellations with locations on the map. She
                writes out latitude and longitude calculations.
          
                Aline comes up to Carnby at the computer. The program is
                waiting for her calculations.
          
                She leans past Carnby and enters the latitude and longitude
                numbers into the program. The computer processes the
                information. Hundreds of map images flash across the screen
                as the computer searches for a match.
          
                                    CARNBY
                          What are we looking for?
          
                                    ALINE
                          The Abkani used constellations to pin-
                          point a geographical location. But I
                          don't think I can isolate it closer than
                          a hundred mile radius.
          
                The computer finds a match. A specific map appears onscreen,
                with a 100 mile radius circle marked in the center of it.
          
                                       LINE (CONT'D)

                                    CARNBY
                          Yeah. That's us right there.
          
                Carnby points to a spot on the onscreen map.
          
                 SCENE 126 OMITTED 
          
                INT. CARNBY'S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER
          127                                                                     127
                Carnby puts the dishes from their meal into the Kitchen sink.
                The sink tap is RUNNING. Aline clears the dishes.
          
          
          
          
                                                                      (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          The para-meter Fischer gave Carnby starts faintly BEEPING,
          but the RUNNING sink tap covers the sound. Something is
          coming.
          
          The lights in the Loft flicker once.
          
          Carnby turns off the tap and they listen intently. They can
          hear the scanner BEEPING faintly.
          
          The lights in the Loft flicker and go out.
          
          Aline grabs the flashlight and switches it on.
          
          Carnby runs to his revolver and holster. He checks the
          chamber in his revolver. The bullets glow.
          
          Carnby looks up, sensing something. He spins around, ready.
          
          A FIGURE stands behind him. It is John.
          
          John looks fierce, his face drawn, gaunt. His eyes are sunken
          into dark recesses, with nearly clear irises.
          
                              CARNBY
                    John?
          
          John lunges at Carnby. Carnby is too surprised to defend
          himself. John SLAMS Carnby against the wall, knocking his
          revolver out of his hands.
          
          John picks Carnby up and hurls him across the Loft. Carnby
          CRASHES through furniture as he lands heavily.
          
          Out of the shadows behind Aline, two FIGURES emerge. They are
          both missing ORPHANS, one MALE, one FEMALE. They have the
          same gaunt faces and clear irises as John.
          
          Carnby picks himself up. He spots the Orphans behind Aline.
          
                              CARNBY (CONT'D)
                    Behind you!
          
          The two Orphans lunge at Aline, but she's able to dodge out
          of the way. The Orphans are fast and fierce. Aline leaps
          forward, sliding across the floor towards Carnby's revolver.
          
          She grabs it and spins to face the two Orphans. They're gone.
          
          
          
          
                                                                 (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          
          But then the Female Orphan leaps out at her. Aline FIRES,
          hitting the Female Orphan in the shoulder.
          
          The Female Orphans jumps away, into the shadows. Aline
          scrambles to her feet, the revolver ready. But the Female
          Orphans has disappeared.
          
          Aline runs over to Carnby. He grabs a shotgun from the
          weapons cabinet and loads it.
          
                              ALINE
                    That looked like John.
          
                              CARNBY
                    It is. The other two are from the
                    orphanage as well.
          
          Carnby pumps the shotgun. Carnby and Aline creep forward into
          the darkness of the Loft. They listen.
          
          Suddenly, John lunges at him, his teeth bared.
          
          Carnby SMASHES John across the head with the shotgun. But
          John keeps coming, SLAMMING him against the wall. Carnby
          breaks John's hold and swivel-kicks him out of the way. John
          skitters off into the shadows.
          
          The Female Orphan leaps out at Aline, trying to tear into her
          with her teeth.
          
          Carnby grabs a pipe leaning against the wall and runs for
          Aline.
          
          The Male Orphan lunges out at Carnby. He SMASHES the Male
          Orphan across the face with the pipe.
          
          Aline struggles with the Female Orphan. Carnby turns to see
          John rising up behind her, about to strike.
          C
           arnby reacts instinctively. He FIRES, shooting John in the
          chest with a shotgun BLAST. John flails back, dead.
          
          The Male Orphan jumps out at Carnby. Now working on instinct,
          Carnby spins and jams the pipe into his gut, impaling him.
          The Male Orphan stumbles to the ground and dies.
          
          Aline gets away from the Female Orphan. As the Female Orphan
          lunges at her again, Aline FIRES, shooting her three times in
          the chest.
          
          
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          
          But it's only the third bullet, the one that hits the Female
          Orphan dead center in the chest that takes her down. The
          Female Orphan falls back, dead.
          
          Aline comes up to Carnby. He stands over John's corpse.
          
                              ALINE
                    You had no choice.
          
                              CARNBY
                    Something's controlling them.
          
                              ALINE
                    How many are there altogether?
          
                              CARNBY
                    Twenty. Including me.
          
          The para-meter starts BEEPING again, louder and more
          frenetic. The lights start to flicker, fading up and down.
          
          Carnby unzips the duffle-bag. It's full of 713 equipment
          given to him by Fischer. Carnby loads an assault rifle with
          713 magazines. He loads a pistol with the glowing bullets.
          
          Carnby throws Aline the pistol. She catches it in mid-air.
          She checks it like a pro.
          
          Aline and Carnby stand together, guns drawn, ready.
          
          There's a moment of quiet. They listen.
          
          The lights in the Loft flicker. The scanner BEEPS.
          
          Something SMASHES into the Loft's front door.
          
          Carnby grabs the para-meter. It BEEPS more insistently.
          
          The front door BURSTS open, knocked right off its hinges by
          the invisible creature crashing through it.
          
          P.O.V. CREATURE:
          
          The invisible xenomorph creature's skewed, inhuman P.O.V. as
          it looks across the Loft, searching. It locates Carnby and
          Aline and heads directly for them.
          A
           ll that is visible of the creature's trajectory is furniture
          being knocked aside as the creature rushes towards them.
          
          The creature SMASHES right through a glass-topped work table,
          SHATTERING it. Papers whirl around in its wake.
          
                                                                 (CONTINUED)

          Aline and Carnby stand their ground, facing the on-coming
          creature as it lunges towards them.
          
          Carnby and Aline leap out of the way at the last moment.
          Rolling away in opposite directions, they simultaneously OPEN
          FIRE. Their glowing bullets hit the creature dead on.
          
          The creature SQUEALS, flashing visible from the multiple
          impacts. Their glowing bullets pierce the creature and it
          tumbles to the ground, dead.
          
          The creature's invisible corpse lies motionless. Broken
          furniture and shattered glass is everywhere.
          
          Carnby's para-meter is quiet, the readings subsiding with the
          creature's death. The lights stop flickering.
          
                              CARNBY (CONT'D)
                    We'd better get out of here.
          
          Suddenly, all the lights in the Loft go out in unison. All
          the computer monitors also go dark.
          
          The scanner starts BEEPING frenetically. Electromagnetic
          readings shoot up, registering multiple sources nearby.
          
          Carnby and Aline back up together, ready for an attack.

               But the first thing they hear isn't a creature. It's the
               sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE.
          
               Streaks of glowing bullets fly through the air.
          
               It is a 713 unit, laying down suppressing FIRE as the Agents
               enter the Loft through the broken front door.
          
               Agents Barr, Cheung, and Marko enter, followed by five other
               AGENTS. They all wear full 713 combat gear, their rifle-
               mounted lamps illuminated, their weapons in use.

               The Agents FIRE glowing bullets through the dark Loft. There
               are invisible creatures everywhere.
          
                                   AGENT BARR (INTO COMM-LINK)
                         Roger that. We're hot.
          
               The muzzle FLASHES and glowing bullets pierce the darkness of
               the Loft.
          
                hadows swim through the space as the invisible creatures
               move around them, attacking the Agents with their razor-sharp
               claws and spiked-tails.
          
               P.O.V. CREATURE:
          
               An invisible creature swoops out of the shadows towards an
               Agent, who is FIRING in the opposite direction. The creature
               whips past the Agent, slicing him open with a fluid slash of
               its claws. The creature keeps moving directly for Carnby.
          
               Carnby and Aline, standing together, FIRE their weapons in
               the darkness, oblivious to the creature rushing towards them.
          
          
          
          
                                                                   (CONTINUED)
          
          
          
          But at the last second, Carnby turns instinctively as the
          creature lunges at him.
          
                               CARNBY
                    Aline!
          
          Carnby and Aline turn and OPEN FIRE on the creature. It
          flashes visible from multiple hits, flailing off into the
          darkness.
          
          Agent Barr FIRES controlled bursts of glowing bullets into
          the dark Loft. He screams into his comm-link.
          
                              AGENT BARR (INTO COMM-LINK)
                    Where the hell's our back-up?

          The sound of a HELICOPTER can be heard outside the Loft.
          
          P.O.V. CREATURE:
          
          Another invisible creature skirts along the edge of a wall,
          avoiding the GUNFIRE. It locates its target, an Agent FIRING
          up at the ceiling. It races towards the Agent.
          
          The Agent turns to the attack and tries to fire. But the
          creature is too fast. It SLAMS the Agent back against the
          wall and impales him with its spiked-tail.
          
          Agents Barr and Cheung spot this and OPEN FIRE on the
          creature. It flails about, fading visible from the impacts.
          
          The creature tries to scurry away, but Barr and Cheung are on
          it. With precision and speed, they blow the creature away.
          
          But more creatures attack. The fighting is fierce. Glowing
          bullets streak through the darkness. The Agents are calm and
          determined as they engage the creatures.
          
          Carnby and Aline hold their own, sticking together, SHOOTING
          at whatever shadows move around them.
          
          Six AGENTS in full combat gear burst into the Loft. Leading
          the unit is Commander Burke. Agent Miles is with him, as is
          AGENT TURNER (mid-30s).
          
          Burke, Miles, Turner, and the other Agents immediately join
          the battle, laying down suppressing FIRE.
          
          
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                             66.
          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          
          An Agent carrying a rifle-mounted grenade-launcher FIRES an
          incendiary flash-grenade at the Upper Level of the Loft.
          With a flash of blinding light, the grenade EXPLODES.
          Creatures SQUEAL as flames swoop up through the Upper Level.
          
          Glowing bullets fill the dark Loft. Creatures SQUEAL and
          flail from the hits.
          
          In the darkness of the Loft, Carnby, Aline, and the Agents
          finish off the remaining invisible creatures.
          
          The last creature goes down in a hail of glowing bullets. The
          Agents strafe the creature's corpse to make sure it's dead.
          
          Agent Barr and Carnby exchange a look between them. Barr
          clearly respects Carnby's abilities.
          
          The Loft is still dark. Barr's rifle-mounted scanner no
          longer registers any creatures.
          
                              AGENT BARR
                    We're clear, sir.
          
          Burke looks around at the remains of the battle. The Loft is
          totally trashed. A small fire burns in the Upper Level.
          
                               BURKE
                    Love what you've done with the place,
                    Carnby.
          
          Miles runs a hand-held scanning device over John's corpse.
          The scanner BEEPS, indicating the presence of a spinal-worm.
          
                              AGENT MILES
                    Sir, this one's infected too!
          
          Agent Turner scans the Female Orphan's corpse. His scanning
          device BEEPS. She has a spinal-worm too.
          
                              AGENT TURNER
                    Got another one here!
          
          Burke immediately turns his weapon to Carnby. The red laser-
          sight makes a glowing dot on Carnby's chest.
          
          Taking their cue from Burke, the other Agents in his unit all
          train their weapons on Carnby. Several glowing red dots
          hover on his chest.
          
                              BURKE
                    Drop your weapon and get down on the
                    ground.
          
          
                                                                 (CONTINUED)

                              ALINE
                    What are you doing?
          
                              BURKE
                    He's been infected with some kind of
                    organism. He could be under its control.
          
          Aline turns to Carnby.
          
                              CARNBY
                    It's true. I've got one inside me. But
                    it's not controlling me.
          
                              BURKE
                    You'll excuse me if I don't take your
                    word for it. Now drop your weapon.
          
          Carnby holds his weapon at his side. He doesn't drop it. But
          he doesn't move either.
          
          Aline steps in between Carnby and the Agents. The red dots
          are now trained on her chest.
          
                              AGENT TURNER
                    Get out of the way!
          
          The Agents try to get a clear shot around Aline.
          
                              ALINE
                    He's not one of them.
          
                               URKE
                    If I've got to shoot through you to get
                    to him, I'll do it.
          
          Carnby looks up at the lights. They are still dark.
          
                              CARNBY
                    Why are the lights still out?
          
          Barr consults his scanner. It isn't registering anything.
          
                              AGENT BARR
                    Scanner's clear.

                              BURKE
                    Forget to pay your power bill, Carnby?
          
          An Agent standing at the other end of the Loft hears
          something SHUFFLING behind him. He turns to look.
          
          Something grabs the Agent, SLAMS him back against the wall,
          and rips out his neck.
          
          It's another ORPHAN, with the same fierce, gaunt look and
          clear irises.
          
          Burke turns away from Carnby for a moment, trying to figure
          out what's happening.
          
          Carnby suddenly lifts his weapon and points it at Burke.
          Burke sees this, but before he can react, Carnby FIRES.
          
          Carnby's bullet WHIZZES past Burke and hits an ORPHAN dead
          center in the gut, sending him flailing back, dead. The
          Orphan was about to pounce on Burke.
          
          There's a moment as Burke and Carnby look at one another.
          Burke realizes Carnby just saved his life.
          
          The ORPHANS attack.
          
          They are the grown-up Children from Carnby's Orphanage. Like
          Pinkerton, they are difficult to kill, immune to pain, fast,
          and deadly. They all have the same gaunt, wild look, with
          sunken eyes and nearly clear irises.
          
          The Orphans leap out at the Agents, quick and fierce. They
          bite and claw and use their superhuman strength to throw
          around the Agents and tear them apart.
          
          The dark Loft is again lit up with glowing bullets, streaking
          through the darkness. The Agents' rifle-mounted lamps shine
          around, but the effect is chaotic, disorienting.
          
          
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (5)
          
          
          As the Orphans attack, they make quick work of many of the
          Agents. Glowing bullets fly around everywhere. The SCREAMS of
          Agents being torn apart mix with BURSTS of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE.
          
          Carnby and Aline stay together, dodging the attacking
          Orphans, and FIRING into the darkness.
          
          An Orphan rises up behind Carnby. He spins and SHOOTS her in
          the side. But she just keep coming. Carnby SHOOTS the Orphan
          again, this time dead center in the chest. The Orphan
          collapses, dead.
          
          Carnby checks the corpse. The bullet came out the other side.
          A mixture of red blood and black, sticky ooze drips from a
          bullet hole right over the Orphan's spine.
          
          Carnby grabs the comm-link off the body of a dead Agent.
          
                              CARNBY (INTO COMM-LINK)
                    All Agents! You've got to kill the
                    organism to stop them! Aim for the spine!
          
           cross the Loft, Burke listens to the comm-link.
          
          An Orphan is attacking Agent Miles. Burke takes careful aim
          and SHOOTS the Orphan in the back, right on the spine. The
          Orphan falls over, dead.
          
                              BURKE (INTO COMM-LINK)
                    Confirmed. Spinal shot's a kill shot.
          
          With this information, the Agents quickly gain the upper-hand
          against the Orphans' attack. The Orphans are fast and deadly,
          but they have no organization. Now that the Agents have a
          handle on this new threat, their precision and speed returns.
          
          Soon, the battle is over. Dozens of bodies of dead Agents and
          dead Orphans lie littered around Carnby's destroyed Loft.
          
          Only Carnby, Aline, Burke, Miles, Barr, Cheung, Marko, and
          Turner remain alive.
          
          Burke's and Carnby's eyes meet. Burke approaches Carnby.
          
          The other Agents all stand by, waiting for an order from
          Burke. Aline watches them, ready to step in.

          Burke turns to walk off, but then stops. He turns back to
          Carnby. Burke holds out his hand.

                A massive, long-abandoned structure built directly against
                the face of a mountain. This is the Entrance Hall of
                Britannia Mine.
          
                713 AGENTS mill about, setting up perimeter defenses. Humvees
                are being positioned as barricades. Large spotlights are
                being set up to illuminate the area, with power cables
                leading inside the Entrance Hall.
          
                Agents Barr, Cheung, and Marko are part of the team outside,
                setting up the defenses.
          
                The 713 helicopter carrying Carnby, Aline, Commander Burke,
                and Agents Miles comes down for a landing next to two other
                helicopters already sitting in front of the Mine.
          
                The moment the helicopter touches down, Burke leaps out,
                barking into his comm-link. Carnby, Aline, and Miles exit
                after him.

                 rash swivels in her chair, processing data, making
                adjustments to sensors, and checking out the information
                scrolling across the bank of monitors. She wears a head-set.

                             We're practically off the scale,
                             Commander. This is unprecedented. Should
                             I initiate Contingency Nine-Alpha?

                             But I won't hold my breath. By the time
                             this clears Defense Council, we'll be

                Rusty construction vehicles, detritus, and rubble lie
                discarded throughout the Hall. Several shafts have been dug
                into the mountain. Narrow paths lead up the slope.
          
                AGENTS scurry around, setting up the defense system. The main
                position is set up just inside the entrance to the Hall.
          
                Burke and Miles enter, followed by Aline and Carnby.
          
                                       AGENT MILES
                             We've got three perimeters of flash-
                             mines. Gatling guns are set to
                             electromagnetic motion tracking. And
                             every available agent in the vicinity is
                             here. But Commander...
          
                                       BURKE
                             I know, Miles. But back-up won't make it
                             before sunrise.
          
                Several raised Platforms stand in the middle of the Hall.
          
                On one Platform, Agent Turner helps two AGENTS unload a large
                gold-plated generator from the back of a Humvee.
          
                                       AGENT TURNER
                             Generator will be on-line shortly, sir.
          
                Burke nods to Turner as he and the others walk by. Carnby and
                Aline get into step with Burke and Miles.
          
                                       ALINE

                             We are. The highest xeno concentration on
                             record is closing in on this location.
                             This could be our chance to wipe them out
                             once and for all.
          
                A Tunnel, carved directly into the rock wall of the Mine,
                leads off into darkness. Carnby stares down at the Tunnel.

                             We need to go down there.

                           They're coming here for a reason. Until
                           we know what they're after, we're never
                           really going to be able to stop them.
          
                Agent Miles consults his hand-held para-meter.
          
                                     AGENT MILES
                           Something's definitely down there, sir.
                           But there's too much interference to get
                           a clear reading from here.
          
                Miles looks at Burke expectantly. Carnby and Aline watch him
                as well. Burke looks conflicted.
          
                                     BURKE
                           Goddamn it. Miles, you're in charge of
                           perimeter defense. Nothing gets in or out
                           until we find out what's down there.

                Batteries of flash-mines (mines that explode with a burst of
                blinding light) set to electromagnetic sensors are being
                positioned in wide perimeters around the Entrance Hall.
          
                Automatic gatling guns loaded with chains of glowing bullets
                are set up at key points around the area. The gatling guns
                are mounted on swiveling robotic bases, able to automatically
                turn to face on-coming targets.
          
                AGENT FEENSTRA (mid-30s) tests the motion sensor on one of
                the gatling guns with her hand. The gun swivels accurately to
                match the movement of her hand.
          
                Agent Feenstra nods to the two AGENTS standing behind the
                gatling gun. They tinker with its guidance system.

                Carnby and Aline walk carefully down a pitch black tunnel,

                Along with them are Commander Burke, and Agents Barr, Cheung
                and Marko. They each carry assault rifles with lamps mounted

                          I've been thinking about something. The

                Agent Barr carries a hand-held para-meter. It's picking up
                high electromagnetic readings.

                          It's definitely this way, sir.
          
                They pass by various pieces of mining equipment, long since
                discarded. Thick dust and cobwebs hang off the equipment.
          
                They make their way down the Tunnel.

                The Tunnel ends at a slightly larger, rounded Chamber with
                walls of solid rock. They can't go any further. Cobwebs and
                thick dust hang everywhere.
          
                Carnby, Aline, Burke, Barr, Cheung, and Marko emerge out of
                the Tunnel into the Chamber.

                          Readings are getting stronger.
          
                Carnby looks around, sensing something. He wipes away some
                cobwebs and dust and runs his hand over the Chamber walls.

               Aline approaches the spot where Carnby stands. She shines her
               flashlight beam in the wiped off area. Faint Abkani symbols
               are carved into the wall.

                            They're Abkani.
          
               The Agents all start wiping away the cobwebs and dust,
               examining the walls for more symbols. They all shine their
               beams of light through the dark space, searching.
          
               Cheung finds more Abkani symbols on another wall.

               As Agent Marko moves through the space with his lamp, his
               boot hits a small protrusion in the dusty ground. Agent Marko
               shines his lamp down on ground. With his boot, he pushes away
               the dust on the ground. There's a carving on the floor.
          
               Agent Barr spots Marko and shines his lamp towards him.

               Agent Marko presses down on the carving with his boot.
          
               Suddenly, the stone floor beneath Agent Marko crumbles away,
               revealing a deep circular Shaft.
          
               Agent Marko can't hold on and he falls into the Shaft. He

               his descent.
          
               The Shaft walls are rough-hewn rock. Small fingers of lichen

                The Shaft drops into a round, sand-covered room. Razor-sharp
                spikes poke out of the loose sand beneath the Shaft.
          
                Agent Marko falls directly onto the spikes. He is impaled on
                them.

                She looks a little nervous, having trouble getting it to fit.
          
                Miles gently takes the rifle from Feenstra. He SLAMS the
                magazine in and checks the rifle. He hands it back.

                Jagged bolts of lightning and RUMBLING THUNDER echo around
                them. The sound of HISSING comes up around them.
          
                Suddenly, one by one, creatures start fading into visibility
                behind them. More and more creatures appear, fading visible,
                until there are dozens of xenomorph creatures stretching down
                the mountain-side.
          
                Hudgens looks back at his creature army. He lets an evil
                smile slip across his face.
          
                All at once, the creatures start leaping down the

                Burke, and Agents Barr and Cheung lower themselves down the

                been carved directly into the rock walls of the chamber.
          
                One wall is covered, floor to ceiling, with human skulls.

               Carnby approaches Aline in front of the Abkani symbols.

                         It's a warning.
          
               Carnby looks at the wall of human skulls.

                         much interference.

               The Agents OPEN FIRE, letting loose a barrage of glowing
               bullets. Streaks of light fill the night.
          
                                                                            80A.

                The THUNDERING GUNFIRE of the rotating gatling guns fills the
                air. Thousands of glowing bullets streak through the night.
          
                The hovering helicopters open FIRE with their side-mounted
                gatling guns.
          
                The on-rushing creatures SQUEAL and flash visible as the

                and more creatures continue to rush towards them.
          
                The automatic, ground-mounted gatling guns start running out
                of ammunition. The sound of GUNFIRE is replaced by the HIGH-
                PITCHED WHINE of the turbines rotating without bullets.
          
                The helicopters continue to lay down suppressing FIRE, but
                they are also running out of ammo.

                Cheung tests her injured ankle. She can walk with a limp.
          
                Something moves through the sand towards Aline. Carnby looks
                over at the last moment.
          
                                    CARNBY
                          Aline!
          
                With a loud SQUEAL, a SAND WORM bursts out of the sand in
                front of Aline. At the end of its elongated body, a pair of
                snapping jaws fold out, lined with razor-sharp teeth.
          
                Aline scrambles back and falls down. Her rifle is out of
                reach.
          
                Another sand worm bursts out of the sand, diving for Carnby.
                But he is quick on the draw. He SHOOTS the sand worm before
                it can bite him. The bullets BLOW APART the sand worm's head.
          
                The sand on the Chamber floor comes alive with movement as
                sand worms burrow towards them.
          
                Agents Barr and Cheung OPEN FIRE on the sand worms.
                Aline fumbles for her flashlight, shining it at the sand
                worm. It recoils from the light and HISSES at her. The sand
                worm's jaws fold open, revealing its razor-sharp teeth.
          
          
          
                                                                    (CONTINUED)

               CONTINUED:
          
          
               The sand worm tries to dodge the light. It snaps at Aline
               with its jaws and lunges at her.
          
               She grabs it by the torso, just under the snapping jaws. The
               sand worm struggles, trying to bite Aline. She can barely
               hold it away from her. Her grip starts to loosen.
          
               The sand worm's snapping jaws are almost at Aline's face. She
               strains to hold it away.
          
               With the sound of a GUNSHOT, the sand worm's head explodes.
               It flops to one side, dead.
          
               Carnby stands behind it, his gun smoking from the shot.
          
               A sand worm bursts out and chomps down on Cheung's bad foot.
               She SCREAMS.
          
               Barr SHOOTS the worm that bit Cheung. Cheung falls back, her
               body seizing up from its poisonous bite.
          
               Cheung's body contorts. Barr grabs her as Cheung's head reels
               back and her body goes limp. She's dead.
          
               Burke turns, his face grim. He OPENS FIRE on the sand worms.
               With precision and intensity, he FIRES controlled bursts at
               any movement under the sand.
          
               Carnby FIRES along with him. After a few seconds, the
               movement has stopped.
          
               Aline, Carnby, Burke, and Barr stand together. They look down
               at Cheung's body.
          
               Over the comm-link, Burke can hear the sounds of the BATTLE
               going on up above them.

               Flash-mines EXPLODE close by.
          
               A creature leaps out at Agent Miles. He spins and opens FIRE.
               The creature flashes visible as Miles riddles it with
               bullets. The creature flails around, dying.
          
               Creatures start leaping out at the Agents, jumping over the
               Humvee barricades and slashing at Agents with their claws.

                Dozens of creatures stream into the Hall. The Agents lay down

                Fischer appears at the end of the Platform.
          
                Fischer approaches Agent Turner and the other Agent standing
                at the generator. His demeanor is now totally different. He
                is cold, menacing.
                A
                 gent Turner turns to see Fischer approaching.
          
                                     AGENT TURNER
                          Fischer?
          
                In a quick motion, Fischer grabs Agent Turner by the throat
                and hurls him out of the way.
          
                The other Agent FIRES on Fischer with her weapon. Fischer
                takes a bullet in the shoulder. It doesn't stop him.
          
                Fischer lunges for the Agent. He knocks her back and grabs
                her face. Fischer snaps the Agent's neck, killing her.
          
                Agent Turner runs towards Fischer, FIRING a sustained BURST
                of automatic GUNFIRE. Agent Turner's bullets rip into him,
                but Fischer keep coming.
          
                Fischer lunges at Turner, grabbing him and SLAMMING him
                against the generator. Fischer SMASHES Turner in the face,
                almost knocking him out.
          
                Fischer tears open Turner's combat vest. Four grenades hang
                from the vest.
          
                 ne by one, Fischer pulls the pins out of the four grenades.
          
                Turner starts to regain consciousness just in time to see
                this. His eyes go wide in fear.
          
                Fischer hold Turner against the generator. Fischer is too
                strong for Turner to get away.

                The grenades all EXPLODE. Fischer and Turner are instantly
                killed.
          
                The explosion ignites the generator. It EXPLODES in a
                crescendo of flame and sparks.

                The spotlights are extinguished. Agent Miles and the
                remaining Agents turn on their rifle-mounted lamps.
          
                Miles' scanner registers dozens of signals approaching.
                A
                 gent Miles OPENS FIRE, sending a stream of glowing bullets
                at the approaching creatures.
          
                GUNFIRE rings out all around. Glowing bullets streak through
                the dark night in all directions. Nearby, an Agent SCREAMS.
          
                The 713 defenses have become chaotic, uncontrolled. Glowing
                bullets fly everywhere. The SQUEALS of injured creatures
                mingle with the SCREAMS of dying Agents. The constant RATTLE
                of automatic GUNFIRE fills the night.

                But all that he can hear through the comm-link is GUNFIRE and
                the occasional SCREAM.

                exploring it with their lamps.
          
                Carnby approaches Aline. She is standing over one of the sand
                worm corpses. Its head has been blown off, but its torso is
                intact. Carnby turns the sand worm's body over with his boot.

                Burke stops at a dark recess carved into the Sand Chamber.
                The recess is thick with cobwebs and dust.
          
                Burke cleans the cobwebs away. He stops, surprised at what he
                sees in the recess behind the cobwebs.

                 gents Miles, Agent Feenstra, and two other AGENTS, are
                barricaded behind pieces of mining machinery. They SHOOT
                streams of glowing bullets across the dark Entrance Hall.
          
                Suddenly, an invisible creature grabs the first Agent from
                behind a rusty piece of machinery. The creature throws the
                Agent into the air. He lands heavily, stunned.
          
                Before the Agent can get to his feet, three invisible
                creatures pounce, tearing him to shreds.
          
                 rom behind his position, Miles SHOOTS at the creatures with
                glowing bullets, scattering them.
          
                The second Agent stands behind a piece of machinery, tense,
                rifle ready. She hears a WHOOSH of movement nearby. She
                turns, but can't see anything.
          
                She hears a SHUFFLING sound above her. She looks up. The
                creature is above her, on top of the machinery.
          
                The Agent tries to SHOOT, but the creature's tail SNAPS at
                her, impaling her with its tail-spike.
          
                Agent Miles and Agent Feenstra SHOOT at the creature with
                precise BURSTS of glowing bullets.
          
          
                                                                     (CONTINUED)

                The creature leaps at them. Miles and Feenstra hold their
                positions, RIDDLING the creature with glowing bullets.
          
                A creature leaps out at Feenstra. She hears the WHOOSH of
                movement at the last moment and swivels, FIRING in the
                direction of the creature.
          
                 ut she's SLAMMED off her feet. Feenstra gets a deep GASH in
                her thigh from the creature's spiked tail.
          
                                      AGENT MILES
                          Feenstra!
          
                The creature pounces. But Feenstra is fast enough. She BLOWS
                AWAY the creature with a BURST of glowing bullets.

                Aline, Carnby, Burke, and Barr stand in front of the dark
                recess in the Sand Chamber. The recess is completely sealed
                up by a solid concrete wall.
                A
                 line comes up to the concrete wall, running her hands along

                Agent Miles and Agent Feenstra are barricaded behind an old

                Agent Feenstra bleeds from the wound in her thigh. The lights
                on their rifles are the only lights in the Hall.

          Agent Miles OPENS FIRE into the night. His bullets glow as
          they streak through the air. Feenstra picks herself up and
          OPENS FIRE alongside him.
          
          Creatures SQUEAL in the distance as the bullets find their
          marks. Feenstra empties out her last magazine.
          
          An invisible creature leaps over the barricade and pounces on
          Feenstra, tearing into her.
          
          Miles SHOOTS at the creature, emptying his last magazine. But
          he's too late to save Feenstra. Her torn-up body slumps
          against their barricade
          
          Agent Miles is alone. He is out of ammunition. He pulls the
          trigger futilely. Miles stands firm. He flips up his visor.
          
          Miles closes his eyes. He is hoisted into the air by an
          invisible creature and thrown to the ground. Invisible
          creatures tear him apart.

                down: 3... 2... 1...
          
                A tremendous EXPLOSION rocks the Sand Chamber. Sand whirls
                through the air. Concrete fragments blow out from the recess.
          
                As the smoke clears, Carnby, Aline, Burke, and Barr approach
                the recess. The concrete wall has been blown open. Smoke
                rises up off the ruined wall.

                They are in a large abandoned Bureau 713 Lab. Thick dust
                covers all surfaces. But it was once a high-tech facility.

                Medical equipment, scientific instruments, and computers have
                been left as they were, untouched for two decades.
          
                A series of glass tubes are lined up along one wall. In each
                tube, a spinal-worm lies dead, floating in gelatinous liquid
          
                Aline checks out a series of diagrams affixed to another
                wall. They are anatomical schematics for the spinal-worms.
                There are also diagrams of the human body with markings
                isolating key areas of the spinal cord.
          
                Carnby stands in front of a row of twenty clear glass basins,

                    This is where it happened.                              
          
                                                                            
          Aline steps up next to Carnby.

                    Who did this to you?
          
          Burke and Barr continue to explore the room with their rifle-     
                                                                            
          mounted lamps. Barr finds a pair of huge metal hangar doors.
          
                              AGENT BARR
                    Commander...
          
          Carnby, Burke, and Aline approach Barr at the hangar doors.
          
          Next to the hangar doors is a control panel. Barr pulls the
          front off the control panel, revealing a rusted hand-crank.
          
          Barr pulls on the hand-crank. It won't give. Carnby joins him
          and, together, they strain to move the hand-crank. The hand-
          crank CLANKS into the open position.
          
          An old mechanism is engaged. The hangar doors slide open,
          revealing another doorway behind them. But this one is
          clearly not part of the Lab.
          
          It is an ancient, solid gold door, carved with Abkani
          symbols. The gold door is built into a wall of rough rock. It
          looks like the Lab was built right around the gold door.
          
          In the center of the door is a small cylindrical opening.
          A
           line uses her flashlight to read the symbols on the door.
          One symbol is prominent among the others: the DARK SPIRIT.
          
                              ALINE
                    Edward, look...

          Aline reaches into her pack and takes out the Abkani device.
          It is the exact size of the cylindrical opening in the door.
          The same DARK SPIRIT pictogram is engraved on the lynchpin.
          
                              CARNBY
                    So it's a key.
          
                                                                             
          Burke surveys the room with a grim expression.
          
                              BURKE
                                                                             
                    I say we got two options. One, we open
                    this door, deal with whatever's on the                   
                    other side.                                              
                              ALINE
                    The pictograms carved here make it pretty
                    clear that's a bad idea.
          
                              BURKE
                    Two, we set enough C-4 to bury this                      
                    place. Keep whatever's in there, down                    
                    here for good.
          
          Carnby stares at the gold door.
          
                              CARNBY
                    The answers I've been looking for my
                    whole life could be in there.

                    Some doors are locked for a reason.
          
          Carnby looks away from the gold door.                              
          
                              CARNBY
                    Barr... how much C-4 you got left?
          
          Barr pulls open his pack, revealing several packages of C-4.
          
                              AGENT BARR
                    Enough to blow this place to...
          
          Barr is cut off by a bullet hitting him in the head.
          
          Blood spurts out as Barr collapses to the ground, dead.
          
          Hudgens stands behind them, carrying two pistols.

                              HUDGENS
                    I'm afraid I can't allow that.
          
          Before they can react, Hudgens presses a pistol to Aline's
          throat. He points the other pistol at Burke and Carnby.
          
                              HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                    Now drop your weapons and back away.
          
          Carnby and Burke drop their guns and step back. Carnby glares        
                                                                               
          at Hudgens.

                    It was 713.
          
                              HUDGENS
                    Our early work was crude, I admit. But                     
                    eventually we perfected the implant                        
                    process. You were our last failure,                        
                    Carnby. If you hadn't escaped, 713 never
                    would've shut down the experiments.                        
          Burke's eyes flash with anger.
          
                              BURKE                                            
                    There's no way this was sanctioned.                        
                              HUDGENS                                          
                    Before your kind took over, 713 had very                   
                    different... priorities. Now, you just                     
                    blaze in and destroy everything before we                  
                    can learn to control it. I've wasted                       
                    twenty years working in secret because of                  
                    short-sighted men like you.                                
          Hudgens sees the Abkani device Aline is holding.
          
                              HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                    There it is...                                             
          Aline's expression is firm, unafraid. She grips the device
          tightly. Hudgens is about to pull the trigger.
          
                              HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                    You were a fine archeologist.

                    Aline...
          
          Hudgens turns to Carnby, curious.
          
          
          
          
                                                                 (CONTINUED)

                              CARNBY (CONT'D)
                    Give him the key. Enough people have died
                    today.
          
          Aline sees Carnby is serious. She holds out the device to
          Hudgens.
          
                              HUDGENS
                    You couldn't have opened it anyway. Not
                    without this...
          
          Hudgens takes out the hollow cylinder artifact he found on
          the Erebus. He hands it to Aline.
          
          Aline inserts the artifact into the hollow circular space at
          the bottom of the device, turning it into place. The device
          is now a full cylinder with a flat protrusion on the bottom.
          
          With one pistol pointed at Burke and Carnby and the other at
          Aline, Hudgens directs her to the gold door.
          
                              HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                    Insert the key.
          A
           line inserts the device into the opening in the door.
          
                              HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                    Now turn it.
          
          Aline rotates the device, using the flat protrusion on the
          bottom. It CLICKS into place.
          
          A small crack splinters away from the opening where the
          device sits. The crack splits off into several other cracks.
          
          Hudgens points his pistols at the others, but his attention
          is clearly directed at the gold door.
          
                              HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                    When we found the first of them, 713 saw                
                    just another threat to be eliminated. But
                    I knew it was something more. It was the                
                    first. The first to wake. I've woken                    
                    others since then. But the rest are
                    coming...
          
          As Hudgens speaks, Carnby, Burke, and Aline exchange a look
          between them. Carnby's eyes indicate the C-4 in Agent Barr's
          pack. Burke and Aline understand.

               The cracks splinter out, dividing, until they cover the
               entire door. In a rush of fragments, the cracked gold
               crumbles to the ground.
          
                he empty doorway now leads into darkness on the other side.

               Hudgens steps through the doorway.
          
               The doorway opens up into a vast Cave, hundreds of feet high
               and wide, stretching off into darkness. The cave walls are
               rough-hewn rock, untouched by human hands.
          
               The walls of the Cave are marked with hundreds and hundreds
               of tunnels, pocking the rock like a hive, leading off into
               the depths of the mountain.
          
               Hudgens moves into the Cave, tentative, but excited.
          
               Suddenly, there's a SCRATCHING, SCURRYING sound.
          
               A xenomorph creature emerges out of one of the tunnels.
          
               Out of another tunnel comes a second xenomorph. And a third.
          
               Across the vast cave, dozens of xenomorphs creep out of
               individual tunnels.
          
               Hudgens steps further into the Cave. The xenomorphs approach
               him, their heads darting about.
          
               The xenomorphs surround Hudgens on all sides. His steps are
               careful. He reaches his hand out to one of the creatures.
               T
                he creature moves up to Hudgens' hand, smelling it.
          
               The creature lunges at him, ripping into him with its teeth.
          
               The other xenomorphs surrounding Hudgens pounce on him as
               well. The creatures tear Hudgens apart.
          
               Like a dam breaking, hundreds of xenomorphs start streaming
               out of the hive-like tunnel system of the Cave.
          
               Standing in the doorway, Aline sees the creatures coming.

                Carnby shoves the hand-crank into the closed position.
          
                The hangar doors in front of the Abkani doorway start to
                close. Aline backs away from the doorway.
          
                Aline OPENS FIRE with an assault rifle. The glowing bullets
                streak into the dark Cave, hitting several of the approaching
                creatures. But there are too many of them. They keep coming.
          
                The hangar doors are almost closed. The xenomorphs are only a
                few feet from the doorway.
          
                The hangar doors SLAM closed just in time.
          
                A heavy impact THUMPS against the other side of the hangar
                doors. Then another. The xenomorphs are trying to get though.
          
                Burke is positioning C-4 charges around the Lab. He wires
                them all through a remote detonator.

                             Once we get out, we can remote detonate.
          
                Carnby approaches the sliding metal door at the side of the
                Lab. The dust around the door has been swept back.
          
                                       CARNBY
                             Look at the dust on the floor. This is
                             where Hudgens got in.
          
                Carnby engages the opening mechanism and the door slides
                open, revealing a dark Tunnel leading away from it.
          
                Burke makes sure the remote detonator signal is active. All
                he has to do is press the button on the detonator.
          
                The hangar doors SHAKE from the impacts of creatures slamming
                into them.

                Carnby, Aline, and Burke run down the long, dark Tunnel,
                lighting their way with flashlights.
          
                A few doors line the Tunnel, but they are all welded shut.
          
                Carnby spots a dim light up ahead.

                The Tunnel ends at the rungs of a metal ladder built right
                into the wall. Aline shines her flashlight up it. A strip of
                light is visible way up high, at the top of a long Shaft.
          
                Aline climbs up the ladder. Carnby climbs up behind her.
          
                Burke shines his lamp down the dark Tunnel. The CRASHING
                sound of impacts against the doors echo down the Tunnel.
          
                Burke looks at the remote detonator in his hand. The signal

                opening mechanism. The door slides open.
          
                Carnby races down the Tunnel towards him.

                Carnby looks torn. Aline reaches out her hand.

                The hangar doors are warped from the impacts. The gap between
                the doors is being pulled open by dozens of creatures. The

                at the top of the Shaft.
          
                The Shaft is sealed with a pair of corrugated metal doors.

               just wide enough for one creature to stick its head through.
               It SNAPS its jaws at Burke.

               Carnby and Aline dive out of the Shaft just in time. The
               geyser of flame erupts out of the Storm Cellar.

                    Here's what I know. There are two worlds
                    on this planet. A world of light and a
                    world of darkness. For millions of years,
                    these worlds were in balance. But now,
                    the lights of human civilization burn
                    everywhere. The dark places are
                    disappearing. We forced them to come out
                    of the shadows. Now, it's my job to force
                    them back in. My name is Edward Carnby.
                    I'm here to protect you from things you
                    don't believe in.
          
          We start to drop back down, faster and faster, the ground
          rushing towards us. We are descending directly above Carnby
          and Aline, standing alone in the empty intersection.
          
          We swoop down right in front of Carnby. His trench-coat blows
          in the wind. Aline stands next to him, ready.
          
          Carnby reloads his revolver.

                    Aline...
          
                              ALINE
                    Yes Edward?
          
                              CARNBY
                    It's going to be a busy day.
          
          The sun shines down above them, illuminating the deserted
          city streets. Carnby's expression is determined.
