    No sound. We are in a speeding SUV. The passenger, LARA,
    unsnaps her seat belt and reaches for the door handle. The
    driver, JOHN, sees her door open and dives to GRAB her. The
    SUV spins, HORNS BLARE, TIRES SCREECH, cars swerve to avoid
    collision. We aren't sure what is happening, but we know
    something has gone terribly wrong. Cut to BLACK. Read:

2   INT. STEAK HOUSE -- NIGHT                                       2

    Two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, JOHN and
    LARA BRENNAN on one side, MICK and ERIT on the other. JOHN           
    is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a
    kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him
    to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He
    is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd.
    LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears
    to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking
    at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking
    brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous,          
    if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of
    her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing.        
    Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card.                

                           LARA
               You know what? If you were smart
               you would stop talking right now.

                           ERIT
               Sue me. I just know that women should                     
               never work for women.

    John laughs and applauds.   Mick buries his head.                    

                           LARA
               How can you say that??

                           ERIT
               They're always threatened. Especially
               if you're beautiful and they're not.

                           LARA
               Erit, you are so full of shit.

                           ERIT
               So, your boss isn't threatened by
               you?

    Lara shoots John a burning look as Erit builds on her victory.

                             ERIT
                 Women should work under men, men
                 under women. That's it.

     takes it and puts the keys with other visitors' belongings.
     John guides his son toward the metal detector. Luke walks
     through and the buzzer goes off.

     round tables and plastic chairs. The concrete block walls
     are covered with naive paintings in bright colors and messages
     of hope. Luke plays at his feet with a basket of Legos.

     The door at the far side buzzes, a guard opens it and
     prisoners in red jump-suits marked VISITING ROOM enter.

     Lara enters and looks around. She is pale, thin and her
     hair has returned to its natural color. Lara hurries to him

     John drives through a rough part of town on their way home.
     He stops at a light and notes the dealers on the corner. A

     He takes a roll of cash from the dealer, looks around, catches
     John staring. John looks away quickly and drives off.

     his wife, who's attached to an I.V. and monitors, pale and
     weak, her arm bandaged where she cut it open along the artery.

     Lara opens her heavy eyelids and John glimpses something
     terrible in her eyes: she's tortured to be alive. He kneels
     beside her and puts a hand on the bed. She takes his little
     finger, wraps her fingers around it.

     Dirty dishes piled in the sink, John unloads the dishwasher.
     He finds the handle has cracked off Luke's favorite mug. He
     places the cup and handle on the counter, opens a drawer
     crammed with tools and screws and tape and such. He rummages
     through it. Not finding what he is looking for, he pulls
     handfuls of junk out of the drawer and slams it all down on
     the counter. The harder he searches the more he becomes
     frustrated, until he slams the drawer and leans on the
     counter, feeling destroyed and needy.

     And then a female hand appears beside him, opens another
     drawer and reaches in. John stares at the hand, afraid to
     move, afraid to look up. The hand finds a tube of glue,
     places it on the counter and moves away.

     John turns to see LARA walking away. She turns, smiling and
     shaking her head, and disappears into the dining room.

     Stunned, John looks down at the glue on the counter, then
     suddenly pushes away and rushes into the dining room. No
     sign of her. And she isn't in the living room. He bolts
     into the foyer and finds the front door slightly ajar. He
     flings it open...

     and fake ID's.

89   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                        89

     John enters his bedroom and closes the door. We see how
     dramatically his plan has evolved on the wall as every inch
     is covered in notes, photos, maps, and various writings. He
     studies it as he bites into a sandwich.

90   INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY                                  90

     John and Luke walk near the front of the group of visitors
     toward the visitation rooms.

     Just ahead he notices a guard using a key to call the
     elevator. John stops near the elevator and kneels, pulling
     one of Luke's shoelaces loose.

                            LUKE
                It was already tied.

     John reties the lace as the group moves on.    He keeps one
     eye on the elevator.

     The door opens and the guard   steps in - and John notices two
     WORKMEN in hardhats inside.    The elevator closes, the shoelace
     is tied, the group has moved   on down the hall and they are
     alone. John pulls the laces    and unties Luke's shoe.

                            LUKE (CONT'D)
                You untied it again!

     The guard looks back, now impatient. John offers a smile
     and throws a look down at the elevator tread, sees the name:
     OTIS ELEVATOR COMPANY. Suddenly a voice comes from behind:

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                  Mr. Brennan?

     Startled, John turns to see DR. LIFSON.

                  We met briefly. Byrdie Lifson.

     John leaves Luke playing and steps into the office. Lifson             
     partially closes the door, so John can still see his son.

                  it's just another form of suicide.

     terrible. John stands and embraces her.

     Lara smiles to cover and bends down and kisses her son, who

     seat. John sits beside her. They speak in whispers.

     The massive rooftops of the jail. But then he sees exactly
     what he is looking for: workmen wearing yellow helmets spread
     hot tar and roofing paper. He spots a workman carrying a
     bucket heading around a tall outcropping on the roof.

                 stairs allowed, there was a niche in
                 the column, about a yard wide, and
                 in this niche the prince felt
                 convinced that a man stood concealed.
                 He thought he could distinguish a
                 figure standing there.

      Where a magazine clipping of a helicopter sits under the
      heading ESCAPE. Overlapping it he pins trimmed print-outs

      Directly underneath is the Google Earth photo of the rooftop
      of the jail, the door marked with an arrow, and the landing
      site indicated with an X in a circle.

      Below that is a rough sketch of the visitor's room and the
      adjacent corridor with an arrow marking the elevator. In
      block letters beside it is the word "KEY?"

      Hip-hop blares, the clientele are low-lives, John doesn't
      exactly fit in as he enters and orders. His words are drowned
      out. The bartender gives him a beer on tap. John asks for
      "Hart." The bartender nods to a man at the back who is
      playing a video game. John walks off, passing a LONG-HAIRED

      John moves down the hall with the fifty or so other visitors.
      He eases toward the elevator, keeping his eye on the guard
      ahead. By the time the group stops for the door ahead to
      open, John's managed to be right beside the elevator.

      He folds his coat over his arm to block others from seeing
      and feels for the slot. Finding it, he slips in the bump
      key. It fits.

      The guard at the lead opens the door to the first visiting
      room and the crowd starts moving again. John quickly bumps
      the key and turns it -- but it won't turn. He bumps it again.
      Visitors keep moving past him.

      He looks over his shoulder, sees the guard following them is
      preoccupied at the door.

      He turns it harder. Nothing.     He tries to pull it out.
      It's stuck. John panics.

      The rear guard closes the entry door and follows the crowd.

      John tugs at it one last time, and then turns it hard and
      snaps it off in the lock. A BLACK WOMAN among the visitors
      sees what he is doing but averts her eyes.

      John drops the rest of the broken key and kicks it into the
      slot between the elevator and the shaft. He slips back into
      the crowd and moves on.

      Near the rear of the crowd now, John approaches the door to
      the visiting room.

      to run. The door opens just before he gets there and Collero
      steps in, Quinn holding the door for her. John charges past,
      noticing neither of them -- but Quinn recognizes him. Quinn
      turns and watches as John doubles over the short wall nearby
      and vomits.

      dismisses the idea. Then he hears the voice: his brother.

      John doesn't move. As we pull back we see that the living
      room and dining room have been stripped of every bit of
      furniture, save an old TV set sitting on a box. John knows
      he can't let his brother see this.

      The MALE NEIGHBOR in the house to the south opens his door

      John finishes writing a letter on lined paper. He opens his
      drawer; it is full of letters in yellow envelopes. He pulls
      one out; it is from Lara, on lined paper. He stuffs his new
      letter in the old yellow envelope.

      This is the only room that is still furnished. John pokes
      his head in, sees Luke on his bed playing by himself.

                               JOHN
                   You want to read a letter from Mom?

      Luke shrugs as if he doesn't care, but then scoots over in
      his bed so that his dad can sit beside him. John does. He
      pulls the letter out of the envelope and reads.

                  Because sometimes people get so sick
                  you have to go to the hospital to
                  get fixed.

       Something tweaks. John turns and looks back across the alley,
       at his open garage...and remembers their conversation. He
       drops the hose and takes Luke's hand.

       delivery vans arriving at the jail. Not seeing what he wants,
       he charges the desk & rifles through more photos.

      He finally snatches the photo he's looking for. He turns it
      over -- on it is written TUESDAY 9:30 AM. And right over
      the phrase FIND THE KEY he pins the photo of a delivery van
      from a medical laboratory.

      his key fob; the van chirps and locks. He enters the building
      as John steps up to the driver's door.

      John checks no one is watching, places the tennis ball over
      the key slot and punches the ball flat. The lock pops open.

      A quiet neighborhood bank sits in the corner of an outdoor
      mall. The Prius pulls into a spot; we dolly over to see the
      stolen license plate.

      Inside the Prius, John opens the backpack, puts on the hat
      and sunglasses and places the gun on his lap. And again he
      looks at the bank, tapping his toe manically. A guard opens
      the bank door for a departing customer, smiles and heads
      back inside. John tightens his grip on the gun, tries to
      work up his courage, but ultimately realizes he can't do
      this.

      Furious with himself, he jams the car into reverse and backs
      up without looking. He hears a scream, brakes hard and looks.

      A WOMAN screams. John stomps on the brakes. He leaps out
      of the car and sees a woman dropping her groceries and
      scooping her child up in her arms. Call her ELAINE.

      A car shows up - the same flashy car he saw weeks ago. The

      over the fences.

      He stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a

      He waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and

      a few words with whoever opened it and then packages are
      exchanged. The door closes and David walks off the way he
      came.

      John waits a moment, then moves down the alley, hops the
      fence, and sneaks through the twisted bramble of the back
      yard. He finds a place to hide, on the ground right beside
      the back porch. He pulls out his gun and settles in to wait

      on and John is bathed in bright light -- he didn't realize
      he'd fallen asleep. David stands above him on the porch,
      holding the screen door open -- if he glanced down there is
      no way he wouldn't see him.

      John holds his     breath and waits. The porch light flicks
      off, the locks     are unbolted, and finally the thick door opens.
      As before, the     two exchange words, but now the POUNDING in
      John's ears is     so loud we can barely hear anything else.

      John takes a deep breath and springs to his feet -- knocking
      over the trash cans -- and onto the porch!

      He smacks David with the gun, grabs him by the hair and jams
      him forward into the doorway, preventing the supplier --
      ALEX -- from slamming the door on them.

      And the thug goes in the closet after the barking dog.            John
      sees the bolt and drives it home, locking the door.

      Alex doesn't obey, so David grabs it and hands it to him.
      John props it under the handle of the closet door.

      down the hall. They peer into one room, nothing. Into the

      Alex kneels on the far side of the room, barely visible behind
      the small bed, his back to us.

      Until he wheels, gun in hand, and FIRES twice.

      A bullet strikes David in the chest, the second grazes John's
      side. Both men are knocked back into the hall and onto the
      floor. John pulls himself out from under David as...

      to where Alex was kneeling, sees a bureau pushed aside, a
      safe crudely installed in the wall lying open, a trash bag

      way into the car.

      Through the front windshield he sees THE THUG leap over the

      The dog barking disappears. All that's left are the sounds

      shoulder.

      back seat. We don't have to see the body to know he's dead.

      John sits there a moment, listening to the sounds of
      approaching fire engines. He catches a glimpse of himself

                 No, but someone left through the back
                 door bleeding. Zone Three found a
                 gunshot victim dead on a transit bench.

      Nabulsi nods and descends the stairs.
                                                                   77.

      and walks back to the Prius.

      John eases open his parents' front door and removes his key
      from the lock. It's the middle of the night, so he is
      surprised to see a light on in the kitchen. He enters,
      carrying his jacket and backpack, and places them on a chair.
      When he gets to the kitchen he sees his father in his pajamas,
      reading a biography and sipping a cup of tea.

                               JOHN
                 Hi.    What are you doing up?

      George shrugs.     An uncomfortable silence.

                             JOHN (CONT'D)
                 I've come to get Luke.

      George nods. After another silence, John starts down the
      hall. His father appears in the hallway behind him.

                               GEORGE
                 John?    Are you alright?

      John turns around, surprised.

                               JOHN
                 I'm fine.

      The two men look at each other for a moment, John leaves the
      room.

      His father steps into the living room and notices his jacket
      falling off the chair. George lifts it to set it right and
      sees something is sticking out of the backpack: airplane
      tickets and passports.

218   INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                                 218

      John steps into the room that he had as a teenager. Luke
      sleeps in the single bed. John sits beside him, touches his
      face, then looks around the room, wondering how he got here,
      and is overwhelmed.

219   INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                  219

      George slips the tickets and passports out of the side pocket.
      We do not see the destination, but he does. He opens the
      passport and reads each of the false names.
                                                                 78.

      John brushes away tears, no idea how he could be acting like
      this. He tries to wake Luke.

                              JOHN
                 Hey.   Hey, buddy.

      Not a chance. John checks the old alarm clock: it's just
      after three AM. He lies down beside Luke for just a moment.

221   INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- NIGHT                                    221

      John WAKES to the sound of a whistle. He checks the clock.
      It's almost five. How could that have happened?

      John helps a sleepy Luke with his jacket, pancake rolled in
      his hand. John stands from the table strewn with food.

                 What do you say?

      John thinks about saying something, can't.   He watches Luke
      give Grace a kiss.

                 Thank you, Grandma.

      John turns to his father, who stands in the doorway.

      His father holds out the jacket in silence. John takes it.
      The airline tickets stick out from the inside pocket.

      John realizes the tickets have been moved from the bag. He
      looks at his father, who gazes back at him in silence. John
      can tell by the look in his father's eye that he knows.

                                JOHN
                   Bye Mom.

      He pats his father's back. They break.

      him and starts stuffing them in his pants pocket.

      wrist, right beside the watch. 15, and under it, 35.                      

      He then turns and stares at his wall, all the photos,
      sketches, notes, wondering if he's forgotten anything. He
      decides it is too late to worry. He loosens an edge of
      wallpaper and starts tearing it all down.

      tries to stuff all the garbage bags full of paper into the
      back.

      the alley. He looks around, then stuffs this final bag into
      his neighbor's trash can.

      A second handgun and holster      slides across the floor to meet              
      the one that already lies by      John's feet. The two guards
      kneel, facing the far wall.       John pulls a roll of duct tape

       the Nurse's Desk but he keeps walking. As they pass we notice            
       DR. LIFSON standing there with Lara's file in her hand. The              
       Duty Nurse notices as well. It takes a second for Lifson to              
       understand what is going on. She steps out into the hall

      He hears Nabulsi's heavy feet on the stairs, angles and aims
      the weapon -- Lara can't believe what she's witnessing.
      Suddenly the doors close, just a heartbeat before Nabulsi
      gets there. Nabulsi spots the discarded lab coats and runs
      out into THE GARAGE. He heads for the ramp, scanning the
      parked cars.

      Getting to the bottom of the ramp he looks up and sees a

      he sees a squad car screeching to a halt. He grabs Lara's
      hand and leads her out of the elevator and around the corner.

      They weave down a corridor, deeper into the hospital, passing
      another cop at the Emergency Desk who has his back to them.

      They turn the corner, see a hospital guard running toward
      them. John recognizes him as the guard he argued with when
      Lara attempted suicide. John stiffens, but the guard runs
      past -- looking for a couple in lab coats. They quicken
      their steps. The guard stops at the end of the hall and
      turns to stare, recognizing them. He lifts his walkie and
      speaks.

300   INT. SUV - DRIVING THROUGH INTERSECTION -- MORNING                300 

      John brakes as he spots a State Trooper vehicle at an                    
      intersection. As he keeps an eye on the rearview mirror,                 
      the squad car puts on its flashers, turns and follows them.

      John's hands tighten on the wheel. He keeps the speedometer              
      at 35, praying he's not their target.

      The police vehicle passes them and takes off fast down the
      four lane street.

      John breathes again and drives on. He checks the stopwatch -
      29 minutes flicks to 30. He pushes the button on the GPS.

                               GPS VOICE

      Signs appear quickly now.    Interstate: Keep Right; Zoo: Next
      Left.

      John keeps driving, hoping somehow that he won't have to
      make this choice -- their freedom, or their son.

      Too many questions rage across his face. Perhaps they can
      escape and his parents can somehow arrange to get Luke to
      them. Or perhaps Luke would be better off with his
      grandparents after all.

      Then there it is:

      The sign to the interstate points to the entrance ahead on
      the right.

      Lara unsnaps her seat belt. She reaches for the door latch.
      John sees her pull the door and GRABS her by the shirt as he
      slams his foot on the brakes!

      The tires SCREAM, the SUV skids into an uncontrolled turn.

      Horns blare. Cars behind them swerve to avoid collision.
      John holds Lara in her seat as the SUV flies around in a
      circle and finally comes to a dead stop on the shoulder,
      miraculously facing in the right direction.

      John allows himself to breathe. He lets go of Lara's shirt.

      pulled over. John nods to him that everything is okay and                 
      comes around the bumper to find Lara sitting on the gravel
      shoulder, leaning against the back tire, staring out at the
      field beyond. He sits beside her in silence.

      Behind them the cars whip by.    No one even thinks to stop to
      see if they need help.

      Lara and John watch a cow in the farmer's field.

      There is nothing for either of them to say, they both know
      how they got here.

      Their hands sit on the gravel between each other. Without
      looking at him, Lara tentatively entwines a single finger
      with his. He slowly gathers strength from her touch.

      He speaks to a large woman; she shakes her head. He goes on
      to speak to a black couple, who apparently aren't interested.
      He approaches an elderly couple.

      Harris steps out into the HALL, passing an INTERVIEW ROOM.

      Behind the glass he sees QUINN grilling MICK. Harris keeps
