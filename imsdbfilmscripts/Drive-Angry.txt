          EXT. LAUGHTER, COLORADO - DAY

          Half a dozen abandoned shacks and a boarded up gas station
          make up the central hub of Laughter, Colorado. She'd be a
          ghost town âcept the ghosts considered her a shithole ages
          ago and baled. The buck ten for leaded sign gives us an idea
          how long ago this place went dry.
          Suddenly an old Chevy RIPS around the corner, wheels sending
          PLUMES of dust skyward.

          INT. OLD CHEVY - DAY

          Three grimy looking fuckers are stuffed into the cab.
          FUCKING DRIVER looks as though he may piss himself. FUCKING
          MIDDLE twists around, glares through the back glass and
          FUCKING PASSENGER white-knuckles a tire iron.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          Goddamned old man!

                         FUCKING PASSENGER
          I thought he was dead! She said he
          was dead!

                         FUCKING MIDDLE
          I don't see him. Just go. I think
          we lost him.

          EXT. LAUGHTER - MAIN STREET - DAY

          They race through the dusty derelict little town, peeling for
          the main road in the distance when they round a corner --
          --to face a â70 PLYMOUTH ROADRUNNER, beat to shit, engine
          screaming. SPEEDING head on. This ain't chicken because
          these three Fuckers don't even have time to react before:

                         MILTON
          âThe Old Manâ, shock of white hair, drives the Roadrunner,
          locks the tires and spins the wheel.
          The Roadrunner fishtails, slides sideways AT THEM!
          The truck's gonna ram the driver's side. At least it would

                         BUT:
          MILTON AIMS A SHOTGUN through the driver's side window.
          Fearless. Pissed off. He FIRES!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          The shot BLOOMS right at us! Then SLOWS TO NEAR FROZEN -
          Hanging in mid-air - suspended, like we could touch it:
          TITLE CARD appears--

                         "DRIVE ANGRY"
          --then the shot BURSTS through the title! SHATTERING the
          words right at us!

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          ...EXPLODING into the hood of the Chevy! The hood RIPS up,
          SLAMS the windshield.
          Truck CAREENS out of control!
          Milton GUNS the Roadrunner away from truck...but...
          KRAACK - The Truck nails the Roadrunner's rear quarter panel.
          Roadrunner and truck go into a spin. A tornado of dust
          SWIRLS around the two vehicles.
          The Roadrunner SPLINTERS into a boarded store front!
          The Truck HITS a ditch and UPENDS. Flips. SLAMS into the
          dirt on its roof, wheels SPINNING.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Smoke HISSES from the totalled Roadrunner. Door creeks open.
          Milton emerges slow and sure. He crosses toward the Chevy.
          Fucking Passenger rises from behind the truck and rushes
          Milton, tire iron held high over his head!
          Milton spins and KUH-FOOM!
          --blows Fucking Passenger's hand clean off! Passenger
          screams as Milton snatches the iron out of the air and --

          KER-ACK!
          -- slams it across his face! Passenger drops. Hard.
          Milton stoops, removes Passenger's wallet, digs the cash out.

          OVER MILTON'S SHOULDER
          Fucking Driver scrambles from behind the wheel, springs to
          his feet and runs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          Milton spins, BLOWS his knee apart from 20 paces. Driver
          SCREAMS and face-firsts the cracked pavement.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          As Fucking Middle drags himself from the passenger side. He
          got the worst of it. Looks like his face went through the
          windshield. He looks up --
          -- into the barrel of Milton's shotgun. A beat.

                         FUCKING MIDDLE
          I'll never tell you where they've
          taken her...NEVER.

                         MILTON
          I know.
          The EXPLOSION vaporizes what's left of his face.

          ON FUCKING DRIVER
          As he tries to stand but his lower leg dangles from a piece
          of cartilage. He falls, WRITHES on the ground. He looks up
          at Milton standing over him.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          You...you took my leg you fuck!
          Milton presses the shotgun barrel into the man's good knee.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          Wait. Wait!

                         MILTON
          Where is she?

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          I...I don't...
          Suddenly Fucking Passenger, flattened by the tire iron, sits
          up, dazed. Sees Milton. Spots the iron. Goes for it.
          Milton spins and KAFOOM!
          Blows Fucking Passenger to hell.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          Stillwater! Stillwater Marsh! I
          don't know where exactly. They
          call it Wolf Deer Run, that's all I
          know. I swear!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.
          Milton digs Driver's cell phone out...stares at it for a
          moment, drops it, finds wallet, takes cash.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          But you're too late. You gotta
          know that. Next full moon she's
          dead. Nothing you can do. She's
          dead and hell will walk the earth--

          WHAM!
          Milton shoves the barrel of his shotgun into the man's mouth,
          breaking a couple teeth in the process.
          Milton hisses, his throat dry, like a man who hasn't quenched
          his thirst in a decade.

                         MILTON
          You tell him I'm coming. You got
          that? I'm coming to get her back.
          You tell him. Tell him I'm gonna
          kill every last one of you fuckers.
          Milton turns on his heels. Walks into the dust and doesn't
          look back.

          EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          Black smoke billows from the BBQ of this shithole diner.
          It's the only building as far as the eye can see. The lot
          dotted with vehicles past their prime. A muscle bound â67
          GTO stands out.

          INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          Covered in a thick layer of cooking grease, this is one of
          those diners where white trash goes to die. Half a dozen
          PATRONS sit at bar and booth as a young American Indian
          couple, MARY and DALE, enter with their children 2, 4 and 7.
          Two waitresses, PIPER (25) and NORMAJEAN (57) stand at the
          kitchen pick-up window. Through which we can see the
          joint's owner, FAT LOU, dripping sweat into a pile of
          scrambled eggs. Fat Lou is fat. Holy fuck fat.

                         PIPER
          So I tell him, I says, âFrank,
          that's it. No more free milk. You
          gonna have to buy the cow you son
          of a bitch.â

                         NORMAJEAN
          But you're not fat, Piper

                         PIPER
          Wha? No, NormaJean, âbuy the cow.â
          Marry me? He's got to marry me.
          I'm sayin I cut him off.

                         NORMAJEAN
          You cut him off?

                         PIPER
          Not just yes but hell yes! No
          tits, no ass. And I told him if I
          see that big ol' dick of his
          anywhere near my face I'm gonna
          bite it in half.
          Normajean giggles with embarrassment.

                         NORMAJEAN
          You said that? How long's it been?
          Piper frowns.

                         PIPER
          Well, it's only been two days but
          that's like a decade in horny
          fucker years.

                         NORMAJEAN
          So he bought you a diamond?

                         PIPER
          A diamond? God no. If Frank had
          money for a diamond I would have
          jacked his sorry ass ages ago and
          put this shithole life in the rear
          view. But he did get down on his
          knees and ask me to be his bride.

                         NORMAJEAN
          No way.

                         PIPER
          Yes way!
          NormaJean grabs Piper in a great big hug.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Oh! Piper!

                         PIPER

          I KNOW!

          FF-FF-FFUMP!
          Something yellow peppers them both. The girls look up as --
          Fat Lou SLAMS two plates of food into the window.

                         PIPER
          Did...did you just throw scrambled
          eggs at us?

                         FAT LOU
          I don't pay you bitches to stand
          around. Now get the fuck back to work!
          Piper snatches one of the plates.
          She delivers it to a Patron sitting at the bar, then turns
          toward the newly arrived customers.
          The American Indian couple scans a menu...
          ...and Milton (the old guy from our opening) scans her...he
          quickly looks down at an unfolded map of Colorado as --
          NormaJean steps up to Milton.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Hello beautiful, coffee?

                         MILTON
          That'd be great. Tell me,
          Stillwater Marsh around here?

                         NORMAJEAN
          (shrugs) Stillwater...doesn't ring
          a bell. I'll get that coffee.
          But Milton makes eye contact with Mary, the Indian mother.
          She quickly looks away. She knows something...
          Milton opens his mouth to speak as--
          --Piper approaches the American Indian couple.

                         PIPER
          Hi guys, I'm Piper. Can I bring
          you something to drink?

                         MOTHER MARY
          We'll take this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          Mary points to the menu, Piper leans in, reads.

                         PIPER
          âShe's a Brickhouseâ breakfast.
          Ten monster flapjacks for 4.99.

                         MOTHER MARY
          And five waters.

                         PIPER
          Five waters. And what can I get for...
          Father averts his eyes. He's embarrassed.

                         MOTHER MARY
          That's it. Just the pancakes. If
          that's okay?
          Piper stares at them as if for the first time. Shit...
          they're hungry. And broke.

                         PIPER
          Oh. Of course. Coming right up.
          Piper shoots Milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen.
          Milton rises slightly. He's clearly trying to get Mary's
          attention. She's ignoring him.
          Piper calls through the window to Fat Lou.

                         PIPER
          One brickhouse.
          She turns and stops suddenly. Stares at a pile of muffins
          kept fresh within a glass cake stand.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Mary can no longer avoid Milton's stare.

                         MILTON
          Stillwater Marsh? You know it?
          Dale, the father, keeps his back to Milton as he speaks.

                         DALE
          No. We don't.

                         MILTON
          It's important.

                         MOTHER MARY
          You're in the wrong state.

                         DALE
          Mary!

                         MILTON
          And what state Should I be in?
          Dale turns, glares at Milton.

                         DALE
          Nevada. Catch the 50 and cut across.
          It's a two day drive from here.

                         MILTON
          And Wolf Deer Run?

                         DALE
          Never heard of it.
          The 7 year old LITTLE GIRL'S eyes brighten.

                         LITTLE GIRL
          Yes you have daddy. Wolf Deer Run,
          that's where The Smiling Man takes
          the wicked children to see the
          Mother of all things.
          Mary SHUSHES her Little Girl and pulls her close.

                         MILTON
          Mother of all things, that sounds
          very interesting.

                         LITTLE GIRL
          Oh it is! The Mother of all things
          bleeds black tears unto those who

                         CUT HER--
          Mother places her hand over her daughter's mouth.

                         MOTHER MARY
          It's nothing. Just a story parents
          tell to their children. Like the
          boogey-man or the tooth-fairy.
          A plate filled with muffins thumps down before them. Piper
          leans in with three kiddie cups.

                         PIPER
          And three milks.

          But we didn't order--

                         PIPER
          (whispers) --On the house.
          She winks and moves away...eyeing the kitchen window. She
          doesn't notice...

                         MILTON
          staring at her again. An impressed smirk on his face.
          Suddenly NormaJean steps in front of him.

                         NORMAJEAN
          So, aren't you gonna ask what time
          my shift ends? Full moon tonight.
          I'm always a little ârandy' during
          full moon.

                         MILTON
          Full moon's three days off.

                         NORMAJEAN

          You sure âbout that, sweetie?

                         MILTON
          Pretty sure. (looks outside) Hell
          of a ride out there. Yours?

                         NORMAJEAN
          The GTO? I wish.

                         MILTON

          Hers?

                         NORMAJEAN
          Sure but if you're lookin' for a
          ride...

                         MILTON
          And would you be gentle?

          Piper enters with two dirty plates, scrapes them and drops
          them into a soapy sink. She turns right into --

          Oh relax. We gotta toss them
          muffins out today anyway.
          She sidesteps him, exits the kitchen.

          INT. HIGHWAY 50 - FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          As Piper crosses toward the bar, Lou grabs her from behind,
          spins her around.

                         PIPER
          Get your hand off of me!
          His fat fingers tighten around her shoulder.

                         FAT LOU
          You get over there and you charge
          them for those muff...
          Piper strikes. Like a snake. Her hand reaches beneath the
          fat of his belly and vice grips his balls. Hell, we even
          hear the CRUNCH.
          Fat Lou GASPS and doubles over allowing Piper to SLAM her
          forehead into the bridge of his nose!

          KER-RACK!

                         PIPER

          His nose seeps blood.

                         FAT LOU
          Let...go...of...my...
          She SLAPS him across the face with her free hand.

          She takes a step backwards, but keeps her hand clamped to his
          nuts. He has no choice but follow.
          She pulls him up to the American Indian family.

                         PIPER
          Tell'em.

                         FAT LOU
          Wha...what?
          We see it in her face. She squeezes. Lou's eyes go
          wide...flutter...he's about to pass out.

                         PIPER
          Tell them...the muffins...are on
          the house.

                         FAT LOU
          On. The. House.
          She lets go. Lou drops to his knees, then timbers to the
          floor as Piper turns to the family.
          The children are huddled, terrified against their parents.

                         PIPER
          I'm sorry your kids had to see
          that. Put some honey butter on
          those bran muffins and they taste
          an awful lot better.
          Piper turns and crosses toward the door.
          NormaJean is pale as she watches her go.
          Piper brushes past Milton's booth. His cup is there but
          Milton is gone.

          We're close on a car door as it SLAMS.
          CLOSE ON GLASS PACK EXHAUST PIPES as the car RUMBLES with

          With Piper behind the wheel the GTO tears onto the highway...
          ...and blows passed Milton, as he walks west, duffle bag
          thrown over his shoulder.

          The GTO pulls off the road...white smoke HISSES from beneath
          the hood.
          CLOSE ON ENGINE as the hood POPS.
          Piper waves a hand in front of her face as the smoke devours
          her. She COUGHS. Stares. It's clear she don't know jack
          shit about engines.
          FOOTSTEPS. Piper slips the keys between her fingers. Ready.
          Milton appears through the smoke.

                         MILTON
          Car trouble?
          Piper stares. It's the way he said it. Too knowing.
          Milton glances at the engine.

                         MILTON
          Oh, that's not so bad. I can fix

          Milton leans in, flicks something then rises and THUMPS the
          hood shut with a smile.

          Piper behind the wheel focuses on the road. Milton sits in
          the passenger seat, hugs his duffle bag, glances at Piper.
          Suddenly Piper turns on him.

          Get it straight old man. I ain't

          hand, gives her a smile.

          Piper inserts her key, glances back at Milton.

          First thing we see is MONA'S naked ass and back. Long red
          hair, she is riding a naked FRANK. Neither realizes Piper
          has opened the door.

                         MONA
          Oh Frank, you know how long I've

          Oh, you want it faster?
          Mona thrusts her pelvic the tiniest bit faster.
          Suddenly Piper's hand clinches a handful of red hair and
          yanks! Mona SCREAMS in pain, Frank YELPS in fear as Piper
          drags Mona backwards off the bed.

          Piper drags Mona, KICKING and SCREAMING, into the lot, then
          drops her and whirls toward the room--
          -- where Frank struggles, desperate to find his pants.

          It shuts Mona up.
          Piper storms back toward the room.

                         HER POV
          Frank hops with one leg in his jeans. He sees her coming.
          Although he's a big fella, he looks scared.
          Suddenly Mona steps in front of Piper and SLAPS her across
          the face!

          Piper stares for a moment. It's like she's been sucker
          punched. Then she zips her bag and crosses to the door.

          I said, you ain't taking my car, bitch.
          Frank grabs her by the shoulder. Piper spins and --

          WHAM!
          -- punches him in the face. Caught off guard, Frank
          stumbles, nearly goes down.

          payments you out of work, skanky
          Mona fucking piece of shit?!
          She drops the gym bag and launches into him. A blur of FISTS
          and CLAWS. The tears flow. Heartbreak, anger, humiliation.
          Frank stumble backwards. Tries to block the blows. WHAM!

          He blocks the blow and BACKHANDS her with the force of
          thunder. She spins and SLAMS into the ground. Doubtful
          she'll get up this time, then --

                         QUIET LAUGHTER
          Frank stares as Piper rolls over.

                         PIPER
          Frank. Sweetie. I'm gonna tell
          everybody what I caught you doing
          with my pink dildo.
          Her laughter becomes a hysterical fit.

                         FRANK
          That's it.
          He drops on top of her, his fingers curl into a fist.

                         FRANK
          You don't wanna fuck me? Fine.
          When I'm done nobody's gonna wanna
          fuck you. Ever.

                         PIPER
          Go to hell.
          Frank raises his fist into the air. Then...

          MILTON (O.S.)
          Hey.
          Frank looks up as a boot catches him under the chin, lifting
          him off Piper.

          Frank, pounding him with his fists.

          FADE TO BLACK.

          FADE UP ON:

          EXT. COLORADO PLAINS - DUSK

          The sun is a glow to the west. The horizon dances and
          shimmers. Then...is that...yes. Someone is out there.
          Walking toward us. As if they appeared within the heat.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          We start close to the ground. Dress shoes. Suit pants.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          The ACCOUNTANT. Least he sure as shit looks like an
          accountant in blue suit and purple power tie. Not especially
          large. Nice looking face. Something trustworthy about him.
          Friendly even.
          He loosens his tie, slips his jacket off and tosses it over
          his shoulder. There's a bounce in his step.

          INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DUSK

          NormaJean looks up as the Accountant enters.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Have a seat sweetie. Mary there
          will be right with you.
          Indian Mother Mary turns. Piper's replacement. She stops in
          her tracks. Stares at the Accountant.
          He winks at her.
          A shiver runs through Mother Mary. She backs away then
          rushes from the diner.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Mary?!
          Fat Lou leans from the Kitchen window.

                         FAT LOU
          Where's she going?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You. Fat fuck. Come here.
          Lou stares.

                         FAT LOU
          What did you call me?
          The Accountant smiles.
          Fat Lou vanishes from the window then BURSTS from the kitchen.

                         FAT LOU
          I said, what did you call--

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --I called you âfat fuck' and we had
          better leave it at that unless you'd
          prefer I call you âdead fat fuck.'

                         FAT LOU
          Wha-what?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm looking for someone. An old
          man. White hair. Five-eleven.
          The Accountant smells the air, embraces it.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          He was here earlier. Traveling
          light. Likely on foot.

                         FAT LOU
          Who are you?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm the Accountant.

                         FAT LOU
          That's supposed to mean something
          to me?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          It will if I add you to the books.
          And if you don't tell me what I
          want to know...
          NormaJean opens her mouth to speak. Shuts it.

          The Accountant turns to her, quickly. So quickly she takes a
          step back.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You had something to say?

                         NORMAJEAN
          He was here. Earlier.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Yes. We've established that.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Terrible tipper.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm sure he was. Where did he go?
          She points.

                         NORMAJEAN
          That way. West. On foot.

          The GTO THUNDERS past.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          Piper is curled up in a fetal position in the big back seat.
          She sits up slowly. Her eyes are blackened. But clearly
          Milton has cleaned her up. She props herself on an elbow,
          looks at the jacket covering her.
          Milton is driving. He gazes out the window...up to the sky.
          Piper looks.
          The MOON hangs a few days from full.
          Piper slides over the seat, drags Milton's jacket with her,
          then slips into it, wrapping herself as if cold.

                         MILTON
          Want me to roll the window up?

                         PIPER

          No but he'll likely piss blood for
          a day or two.

                         PIPER
          Thanks for that.

                         MILTON
          Hungry?
          He gestures through the windshield as they pass a âWelcome to
          Utahâ sign. Beyond, there are lights ahead.

                         PIPER
          Utah?

                         MILTON
          You mentioned San Francisco.

                         PIPER
          Appreciate what you done for me
          back there but I ain't takin you
          all the way to--

                         MILTON
          --My business is in Nevada. Can
          you get me that far?

                         PIPER
          What business?

                         MILTON
          I'm looking for someone. You
          hungry or not?
          Piper considers for a moment, then--

                         PIPER
          Yeah. I could eat.

                         MILTON
          Name's Milton. You're Piper,
          right?

                         PIPER
          You try to kill me and dump me in
          the desert I'll cut your nuts off.

                         MILTON
          Fair enough.

          Pool tables, old pin ball machines and an odd mix of BIKERS,
          COWBOYS and the SLUTS who love them.
          Piper and Milton slide into a booth. Piper eyes a Latino
          BUSBOY, nice biceps, jeans too tight.
          ROY, a greasy fella in his fifties approaches, big happy
          looking fucker, owns the joint.

                         GREASY FELLA
          Greetings folks, welcome to the
          Bull by the Balls...
          He stops. Smile fades. Stares at Milton, mouth agape.

                         MILTON
          Roy.

                         ROY
          Milton?
          Roy doesn't even try to hide his dislike of Milton.

                         ROY
          Thought you were dead.

                         MILTON
          You hoped I was dead. Not the same.

                         ROY
          You planning on staying?
          Milton eyes a door marked âMotel Guestsâ.

                         MILTON
          Got a problem with that?

                         ROY
          Your money's good as any Iâspect.
          But be gone by dawn.
          With Roy turns his back on them and walks away.

                         PIPER
          What was that all about?

                         MILTON
          Back in another life I used to
          drive a truck through these parts.

          And you'd spend the night here?

                         MILTON
          I'd spend the night here fucking
          his wife.
          Suddenly Milton twists around, stares toward the bar.

                         PIPER
          What's wrong?

                         MILTON
          I...nothing I guess.
          A large breasted waitress, fuckin' hot for a woman in her
          fifties, approaches with chips and salsa. Eyes Milton.

                         CANDY
          Well, hello. I'm Candy. Start you
          off with some drinks?

                         MILTON
          Beer.

                         PIPER
          Same.
          Candy plops two pens and index cards on the table.

                         CANDY
          And I'll need to see your IDs.
          Piper pulls her license absently and slides it over, begins
          filling out the card.

                         MILTON
          What is this?

                         PIPER
          Guess it's been awhile since you
          drove that truck through here.

                         CANDY
          You want a drink? You gotta be a
          member. Dry county.

                         MILTON
          You're kidding.

                         CANDY

                         MILTON
          Call me Milton.

                         CANDY
          This license isn't just expired.
          It's an antique.

                         MILTON
          Fine, then bring me a milk.
          She tosses his card on the table.

                         CANDY
          For you, gorgeous, we'll break the
          rules. Shhhh, don't tell nobody.
          Milton watches her go. Drinking her up.

                         PIPER
          You gonna tap that?

                         MILTON
          Tap what?

                         PIPER
          Jeez, Milton, how long's it been?
          Sounds like you used to stick it in
          anything with a crack.

                         MILTON
          Yeah. Well. I've been distracted.

                         PIPER
          Suit yourself. But nobody reaches
          the end and says, âWish I hadn't
          fucked so much.â
          Milton's gaze returns to Candy. Even a man as driven as he
          needs a reboot sometimes. Candy catches his look, smiles.
          Piper slides from the booth.

                         MILTON
          Where are you...?

                         PIPER
          I'm gonna do my nails, take a hot
          bath and sleep in a warm bed.

                         MILTON
          What about your beer?

                         PIPER
          You drink it. See you at dawn.
          But she walks right passed the âMotel Guestsâ door and
          approaches the Busboy, who's already eyeing her.
          As she does, our focus settles on a shadowy area at the back
          of the bar. JONAH KING steps into the light. Ruggedly good
          looking. He wears a necklace with something bulky hidden
          beneath his shirt. There's an old scar under his left eye
          but a scar on this guy simply adds to his fuckabilty factor.
          He glances at Milton then --

                         JONAH KING
          It's Roy isn't it?
          Roy spins from the bar, smiles a friendly smile.

                         ROY
          Sure is. Get you a drink friend?

                         JONAH KING
          Fantastic place you have here. You
          don't happen to rent it out for
          parties do you?

                         ROY
          We sure do. You planing a party?
          Again Jonah glances at Milton.

                         JONAH KING
          Oh yes. Tonight, in fact.

          Frank clicks his phone shut, jerks the door open to find --
          The Accountant smiling at him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          There was an old man, yes?

                         FRANK
          Wha?
          The Accountant sniffs the air.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          White hair. Angry with attitude.

                         FRANK
          Sumbitch kicked me in the face.
          Who are you?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm the Accountant.

                         FRANK
          The wha? I called the cops, not a

          The bitch, the old man and my car!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          What kind of car?

                         FRANK
          You know what, fuck you. You ain't
          no cop. I'm done talking.
          Frank starts to close the door but the Accountant grabs his
          wrist, twists him around and shoves him into the room!
          Frank doesn't stumble forward. He flies. Lifted off the
          ground his toes drag the floor, Frank SLAMS into the opposite
          wall and bounces into the dresser.

                         FRANK
          You son of a --
          Frank staggers to his feet. Dazed. Mouth bleeding. He
          wipes blood onto the back of his hand.

                         FRANK
          You...you made me bleed.
          Frank pulls a baseball bat from behind the dresser.

                         FRANK
          You leave me no choice but to beat
          you with this Louisville Slugger.
          Frank takes a step, swings at the Accountant.
          The Accountant dodges.
          Bat SMASHES down on the TV. SPARKS & GLASS fly.
          The Accountant STOMPS on the bat, SNAPS it in two.
          SLOMO: The short end rips from Frank's hands, knocks him
          backwards. The piece spins in the air - for a second, hangs
          there until...
          The Accountant snatches it, letting his follow-through gather
          momentum.
          Frank can only watch as the Accountant -

          HURLS THE JAGGED TIP OF THE BAT RIGHT AT HIM --

          The tip STRIKES Frank in the shoulder with such force, it
          impales him up to the knob. Drives him backwards where it
          embeds into the wall!
          The Accountant grabs the broken barrel end of the bat, tosses
          it from hand to hand with a loud SLAP of flesh on wood.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          What kind of car?

                         FRANK
          (dazed) I...what?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Your car. What kind is it?
          Frank stares down at the bat protruding from his shoulder.

                         FRANK
          Wha...what did you do?
          The Accountant reaches out and twists the bat. Frank SCREAMS
          out in pain.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Answer the question.

                         FRANK
          A â67 GTO! Arrgg!
          The Accountant turns and walks toward the door. Stops to eye
          a framed photo of Piper and Frank on the dresser.

                         FRANK
          Hey! Just hold on!
          The Accountant pivots and flings the barrel of the bat.

          FRANK'S POV
          It's coming right at his face. Frank tries to dodge...twists
          his head...no good.
          The other end of the broken bat RAMS through his face, PINS
          his head to the wall. The words Louisville Slugger just
          visible where Frank's face should be.

          EXT. LAURA'S MOTEL - NIGHT

          The Accountant exits as two STATE TROOPERS approach, their
          vehicle parked behind them.

                         TROOPER #2
          You called about a stolen car?
          The Accountant gestures over his shoulder.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          In there.
          Trooper #1 moves toward the opened door. The Accountant
          steps in front of Trooper #2.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm looking for someone. Five-
          eleven. White hair. Driving a â67
          GTO. He's traveling with her.
          He hands Trooper #2 the framed photo.

                         TROOPER #2
          Excuse me?
          The Accountant pulls a shiny, ancient coin, worn from being
          worried over the years, from his pocket. He tosses it, the
          coin catching the light, glinting madly. Trooper #2 stares at
          it. Can't seem to take his eyes off it.
          Trooper #1's eyes widen as he stares into Frank's room.

                         TROOPER #1
          Jesus.
          He pulls his gun. Points it at the Accountant.

                         TROOPER #1
          Keep your hands where I can see them!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Troopers, this is your lucky day.
          Trooper #2 is watching the hypnotic glinting coin.
          ANGLE - High looking down on the trio as the coin spins right
          in front of us - we glimpse the ancient face in the worn
          silver - Roman maybe?

                         TROOPER #1
          Show us your hands, asshole.
          (to his partner)

          Trooper #2 slowly reaches for his gun until...
          The Accountant snatches the coin from the sky, thrusts it at
          the two cops.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Here. Look at this.
          They don't see a coin. But a badge. Letters F.B.I. on it.

                         TROOPER #1
          You're... you're a Fed?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          In pursuit of a white haired man. John
          Milton. He's travelling with the girl
          in this picture.
          Trooper #1 fixes his eyes on the photo of Piper & Frank in
          his partner's hand. Lowers his weapon.

                         TROOPER #1
          But, that guy, in the room. He's -

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --Dead. Yes. I'd say it's
          unfortunate, but I'd be lying.
          World won't miss him. Look,
          troopers. I need your help with my
          pursuit of this fugitive. If we,
          we three, can apprehend him...you
          are ambitious, correct.

                         TROOPER #2

          Yes, we are...

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Wasn't actually a question. I can
          tell you are. Success will mean
          promotion. Pay raise. I guarantee
          it. Now we are going to hunt this
          Milton, we are going to find the
          GTO he's driving and when we find
          him, you will shoot to kill. You
          understand? Shoot. To. Kill.
          The Accountant's voice is velvet. Hypnotic. Seductive.
          Purposeful. Promising glory with a hint of damnation.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          This man is highly dangerous. He
          has killed and will kill again. He
          must be taken down on sight. The
          time it takes you to follow your
          protocols is the time it takes him
          to end your life.
          The Accountant crosses to the cruiser's back door, the coin
          disappearing back into his pocket.

          Shall we?

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS MOTEL - NIGHT

          We're staring into two motel rooms. We're cheating...the
          wall that divides the rooms...divides the screen. The beds
          in each room butted up against the dividing wall.
          On one side we see Piper, on her back. Still clothed. At
          her feet, on his knees and completely naked, the Busboy.
          He's painting her toenails.
          On the other side we see Milton, on his back. Candy riding
          him like a fucking big-tittied stallion. Candy is a SCREAMER.
          The Busboy looks up, timidly. Then...

                         BUSBOY
          Uh, are we gonna do it?

                         PIPER
          Well, I don't know, baby. Depends
          on how well you do those nails.
          Now pay attention. You might need
          to redo that one.
          He hunches over and gets back to work. As Piper ties her
          hair up with a pink bandanna. Candy's SEX SCREAMS are
          starting to annoy the fuck out of her.
          She twists around with frustration and POUNDS the wall.

                         PIPER
          Shut the fuck up in there!
          Milton twist and POUNDS the wall right back.

          That's it!
          Piper swings her legs off of the bed. Busboy wasn't prepared
          and topples backwards to the floor.

                         PIPER
          (giggles) Oh! Sorry, I didn't
          mean...
          She stops. Stares.
          Movement. Someone stepped quickly away from the window.

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

          Piper BURSTS into the room ready to kick ass and take names.
          But...the place is...empty. Food still on the plates. Beer
          in the mugs. The TV over the bar is still on.
          We see footage of a Nevada Amber Alert. âBaby Tabitha still
          missingâ A photo of a baby in pink onesie. Then appearing
          beside it...the photo of Jonah King.

                         TV NEWS
          ...issued an all points bulletin for
          Jonah King's immediate detention in

          married couple in Loveland, Colorado.
          Their infant girl is believed to have
          been abducted by this religious sect.
          A nation-wide Amber Alert is now in
          full effect.
          Piper stares at the TV for a moment, then scans the bar.
          What the fuck?
          She eyes the EXIT sign where an assortment of athletic
          equipment hangs from the wall.

          Piper exits with a hockey stick.
          A few cars are left in the lot. A black Chevy van with flames

          A light GLOWS within the barn, bleeding through the wood
          slats. Then...
          CRREEEEEEEK...barn door slowly swings open.
          ...revealing THREE SILHOUETTES backlit by a hanging lamp.
          One holds a shovel. The other heaves an ax over his
          shoulder. The third holds a shotgun.
          The side door on the flamed van slides open. TWO SILHOUETTES
          step out. Baseball bat and machete.

                         FOOTSTEPS
          Piper spins as THREE DARK FIGURES appear around the side of
          the bar/motel. Sledge hammer, iron pipe, sickle.
          Surrounded. All seven begin walking toward her.
          Piper rushes back inside.

          Still empty. Piper turns toward the door marked âMotel

          Instead she dives under a booth table...as...
          The back door opens.

          LEGS. Three sets. Beat up sneakers. Work boots. Cowboy
          boots with a duct tape patch.

          MAN WITH AN IRON PIPE held high rushes into the room.
          Milton comes up with a 357 hand cannon!

          KAFOOM!
          IRON PIPE is BLOWN backwards into MAN WITH MACHETE!
          Milton thrusts upright, suddenly Candy finds herself beneath
          him as --
          Machete HEAVES Iron Pipe to the side and rushes toward Milton
          as -- KAFOOM! He's blown off his feet!

          KER-SMASH!
          The window shatters as a MAN WITH BASEBALL BAT dives, hits,
          rolls and comes up swinging!
          Milton snakes an arm beneath Candy and rolls from the bed
          with her! As they fall--
          The bat SLAMS onto the mattress just missing them as --

          Milton on bottom again as they crash to the floor, still
          intertwined.

          FWOOM!
          The door adjoining Milton and Piper's room EXPLODES open at
          his feet!
          MAN WITH AXE and MAN WITH SHOTGUN enter!
          Milton, presses Candy's face into his chest, twisting his
          body to shield her as his 357 THUNDERS twice!
          Shotgun's eye vaporizes in a mist! He drops to his knees.
          Man with Axe clutches his throat...blood gushing...turns and
          flees back into the adjoining room as --

          KUH-FWAM!
          The bathroom door flies open!

          MILTON'S POV
          Staring under the bed, Cowboy boots with duct tape patch
          appears.
          Chamber opens. Shells drop to dirty carpet. Milton rolls
          Candy over, still connected. Fumbles in his bag on the floor.
          COWBOY with SLEDGE HAMMER freezes at the carnage. Can't see
          Milton. Because he's hidden by the bed.

          COWBOY WITH SLEDGE
          Old Man. You know you can't stop
          what's comin' That little girl's
          as good as dead.
          TWO BULLETS slide into the 357. Chamber SNICKS shut.
          Milton aims under the bed. FIRES!
          Half the man's foot is blown to hell! He hops then crashes
          to the floor!
          He and Milton make eye contact beneath the bed...a nanosecond
          before Sledge Hammer's forehead implodes.

                         A NOISE
          Milton rolls Candy beneath him again and raises his head just
          in time to see--

          He stares at his dead comrades in rage then glares at Milton.
          The glare becomes fear.
          Milton's already aiming the 357, then --

          CLICK. CLICK-CLICK-CLICK
          Sickle smiles, raises the bladed weapon and--

          KUR-RUNCH!
          The top of his head SPATTERS BLOOD as a hockey stick crashes
          down from above and behind.
          Sickle drops to the floor revealing Piper, white knuckling
          the hockey stick...her face pale.

                         MILTON
          Thanks. Apparently I shot my wad.
          Milton stares down into Candy's face.
          Her whole body QUAKES...CONVULSES. She sucks in breath and
          opens her eyes.

                         CANDY
          Jesus Christ. You're the best fuck
          I've ever had.
          Piper crosses to the adjoining room.

                         CANDY
          Hello? Do you mind?! We're...
          Candy sits up and suddenly takes in her surroundings. She
          SCREAMS, wraps herself in a sheet and flees from the room.

          PIPER'S POV INTO HER ROOM
          Man with Axe is lying face down in his own blood. Dead. But
          it's Busboy who draws Piper's attention. Lying beneath blood
          drenched white sheets. He never saw it coming.

                         PIPER
          Aw, hell.
          Milton, in pants, pulls his shirt on, rolls Man with
          Shotgun's face with his boot. Reloads the 357.

                         MILTON
          I definitely got their attention.

          Milton flings his duffle over his shoulder.

                         MILTON
          Come on. There are probably more.

          EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - FRONT - NIGHT

          Jonah King slips from the bar and rushes toward a parked
          Sedan. He POPS the trunk and grabs a gym bag. As he crosses
          toward the Driver's side door...
          The gym bag starts to CRY.

                         JONAH KING
          Shhhh. Don't cry little precious.
          FF-FFUMP! Two doors shut.
          Jonah King turns, freezes.
          Our two State Troopers stand near their parked cruiser,
          staring from Jonah to the CRYING gym bag.
          For a cop, this is that one in a life time event. A career
          maker. News. Media. Leno. Then--
          The cruiser's back door opens. The Accountant steps out. He
          ignores Jonah King and the crying gym bag.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Troopers. Remember why we're here.
          He walks by them towards the front door of the bar.
          Both Troopers turn and move around the side of building.
          Jonah King...stares...stunned, he absentmindedly scratches at
          the old scar on his face then leaps into the Sedan with the
          gym bag, engine ROARS to life.

          EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - BACK LOT - NIGHT

          Milton and Piper exit into the back lot.

                         PIPER

          They turn as the SPEEDING Sedan tears onto the highway. As
          it disappears behind the barn it reveals --
          --Man With Shovel. He FLINGS the barn doors open, stares at
          Milton and Piper for a moment then vanishes within.

                         MILTON
          Yeah, we both want some answers.
          Milton moves toward the barn as--
          The State Troopers walk around the bar.
          Everyone freezes.
          The Troopers stare from Piper to Milton, then back to Piper.
          Recognition.

                         MILTON
          Aw fuck.
          Milton grabs Piper, places himself between she and the
          Troopers as they go for their guns.

                         MILTON
          Come on!
          Milton pulls the 357 and opens fire!
          The Troopers, emboldened and fearless, stand their ground and
          shoot back!

          FFFUMP!
          Milton staggers, clutches his side. A crimson spot spreads
          across his belly. Piper tries to catch him as he stumbles,
          falls to one knee, his duffle tumbles to the ground, clothes
          spilling from within.

                         PIPER
          No!
          The Troopers keep FIRING!
          Piper stares down at Milton's open duffle. There's a gun
          lying within the spilled clothes. An ancient six shooter.
          We get just a glimpse, but we can tell this isn't just any
          old gun. There's detailed inscriptions scrawled into the
          metal. The steel of it is thick, tarnished and somehow angry.
          She reaches for it.

          No! Not that one.
          He shoves the 357 toward her. Piper snatches it without
          hesitation, rises and --

          KUPOW!
          Trooper #1's chest EXPLODES. The force spins him...still
          firing...he SHOOTS Trooper #2 in the ear!
          Both men crash to the ground. Dead.

          KAFOOM!
          The barn doors explode outward as a big Dodge truck powers
          toward the highway, Man with Shovel behind the wheel.
          Piper turns to find Milton struggling toward the GTO.

                         PIPER
          What are you doing?!

                         MILTON
          Have to stop him...

                         PIPER
          Milton! Those cops weren't trying
          to arrest us!

                         MILTON
          No. They weren't. Get in.
          Milton climbs behind the GTO's wheel.

                         PIPER
          I'll drive.

                         MILTON
          You gotta patch me up. I'll drive.
          Piper fumes but climbs into the passengers seat.

          The car RUMBLES to life!

          They were trying to kill us!

          Yes.
          Milton floors it! As the GTO fishtails toward the highway--

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          The Accountant steps from the back door of the bar.
          Hunter and Hunted glare.

                         MILTON
          Christ.
          Piper's attention is still on the dead cops.

                         PIPER
          Christ is right! They start
          shooting with no warning?! What
          are you, a murderer? You escape
          from prison or something?
          The GTO tears onto the highway!

          The Accountant just stands there...fading into the darkness.

          Both.
          Piper raises the gun, points it at Milton.

          What have you gotten me into? I
          should...I should...Jesus, I just
          killed a cop! I'm going to prison.
          Give me one good reason I shouldn't
          shoot you in the face.

                         MILTON
          Because I'm driving.

          They took my grand-baby. Took my

          He breaks off. Looks away.

          We see the lighted Amber Alert sign come into view and
          quickly blur passed.
          Piper stares at Milton.

          The little girl on the news? The
          baby girl they're looking for?

          But the news said the baby's
          parents were...
          Piper stops.
          Milton's eyes glisten. He speaks in a whisper.

          Sons of bitches killed my daughter.
          Piper stares. Milton steadies himself.

          So Yeah. I busted out. And I'm
          gonna get my grand-baby back. I'm

          It's the Trooper's cruiser. The Accountant, face blank, sits
          behind the wheel.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          Milton fights with the wheel as the muscle car fishtails. He
          mashes the accelerator pulling out of the spin!

          In the back seat. Now.

          cruiser pull up along side him.

                         MILTON
          Shotgun. It's already loaded.
          Piper digs the shotgun from the duffle and heaves it into the
          front seat.

                         MILTON
          Have the other one ready. Not the
          357. The OLD one.

          THROUGH PASSENGER WINDOW
          The cruiser pulls up and matches the GTO's speed. After a
          beat the Accountant turns and smiles at Milton.
          Milton smiles back, lifts the shotgun, shoves the barrel
          through the passenger window.

          When he looks back at Milton its with a face of arrogance. A
          cat toying with a three-legged mouse. He pulls the cruiser
          next to Milton. Matches the GTO's speed. Shouts across.

          It's over, Milton. Stop the car.

          Now.
          Piper hands Milton the ancient Six Shooter. Milton snatches
          it, points it across the gap between cars, pulls back the
          hammer with a thunderous...KUH-THUNK.

          The recoil nearly rips Milton's arm off.
          We travel with the slug, fire trailing it, as it SLOMOs
          toward the Accountant...his eyes continuing to widen...the
          muscles in his face contracting.

          Piper behind the wheel. Milton, shirtless, his stomach
          wrapped in homemade bandages, grabs his shotgun, reloads.

          preaching quiet revolution.
          He places the shotgun on the dash, grabs the 357.

          It was four months before she

          Voodoo, the occult, not much he

          Gassed up her car. Cooked her a

          months. That's when they met with
          some witch doctor bullshit artist
          in Chinatown. It was Chinese New
          Year so the place was wall to wall
          slants. She saw her chance,
          stabbed Jonah in the face with a

          into the crowd.

          Milton grabs the ancient six shooter. It's got real weight.
          His blood-stained fingers run down the scrolled steel. The
          gun almost seems alive. Pops the chamber.

          I didn't find out about any of this

          Milton climbs from the GTO and crosses toward the overturned
          Dodge. He lets the shotgun dangle at his side, keeping it
          hidden behind him.
          TATTOOED GUY and SKANKY GAL stand near the RV with MAN IN
          LEATHER JACKET. BUSINESS WOMAN paces on her cell phone.
          Milton glances at MAN WITH WIG sitting in the driver's seat
          of his station wagon, his face in his hands. LADY IN
          LEOPARDSKIN HOTPANTS kneels beside him. In the passenger
          seat, BURLY DUDE's on his phone. Watching Milton.
          There's a couple near the overturned Dodge. TRUCK DRIVING
          WOMAN gazes into the upsidedown cab. THIN OLD MAN rises and

          drops to one knee, aims into the cab.

          look at him. It's Man with Shovel. Piper's getting out,
          doesn't see Tattooed Guy until he's grabbed her. Presses the
          pistol in her ribs.

          Don't Piper! (to Thin Old Man)
          Let her go. She's a pain in the

          Milton still hasn't let go of his shotgun.

          THIN OLD MAN
          Drop it. Or we'll gut her.
          To emphasize the point, Truck Driving Woman pulls a Rambo
          Knife from her purse and smiles a missing toothed smile.
          Milton drops the shotgun as --

          Skanky Gal and Business Woman open the RV's door.
          Jonah King steps from within then smiles down at Milton. He
          cradles a baby in his arms.

          Man With Wig pops the back of the Station wagon. Truck

          Burly Dude drags Leather Jacket's body next to Milton's as
          the others join him.
          They gaze down at Milton, his one eye open and unseeing. A
          single tear runs from it. The other, pools blood where the
          bullet entered.

          MILTON'S GOOD EYE TWITCHES.
          Everyone stares. Did they just see that right?

          THE 357 COMES UP IN MILTON'S HAND - FIRES!
          The bullet RIPS BURLY'S SCALP WIDE. He stumbles back.
          The others recoil.
          Burly ROARS, blood streaming from his head wound - charges
          Milton with the ax.

          MAN WITH WIG comes from the back of the Station Wagon with
          the scoped hunting rifle. Aims.
          BLAM - His shot rips into the GTO, blows the side mirror off.
          Milton FIRES back with the shotgun - forcing Man with Wig
          back behind the wagon.

          Milton falls heavily across the front seats. Ties Piper's

          Man with Wig hasn't had enough yet. He aims the rifle.

          The cratered cruiser lies on its crushed roof, both doors
          shut. No windows visible.
          TEEN #1 lights a chillum pipe, inhales. Holds it, passes the
          pipe, then speaks as only a pothead can.

          The Accountant rolls from the cruiser, stands, brushes
          himself off as he strides forward.

          Carpenter and despite what you've
          heard, prefers short hair.
          Teen #2 sits up suddenly, coughing.

          Jonah's gun slides from beneath the foldaway bed. It slides
          right up to him.
          He snatches it.
          Piper leaps through the door.

          Piper SLAMS into the side of the RV. She tries desperately

          Jonah leans through the door. Gun in hand.

          Jonah looks up. Milton is driving beside them, shotgun in
          hand, barrel aimed right at Jonah!

          KUH-FWAM!
          But before Milton can get his shot off --
          The Corvette SLAMS into the back of the GTO!
          Milton fires! Blowing a hole in the side of the RV a foot to
          the right of Jonah's head!
          Jonah leaps back inside the RV.
          Piper clings on for dear life but she's slipping.

          Lady in Leopardskin slows as Milton's GTO goes into a spin.
          There's a smile on her face. She thinks he's lost control!
          Until the GTO does a 180. Milton now driving in reverse.
          His shotgun pointing through the remnants of windshield...
          ...directly at Lady in Leopardskin.

          BOOM!
          Her head goes buh-bye.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CHASE FINAL - DAY

          The Corvette swerves off of the road, jumps a ditch and flips

          EXT. GTO - DAY

          She looks up, through the GTO's windshield into Milton's
          battered face. He stretches his hand out to her. Piper
          snags it before slipping off into oblivion.

                         MILTON
          Got ya.
          Piper nods, crawls toward the windshield, Milton tries to
          pull her in as --

          KUH-THUNK....CRUNCHCHCHCH...
          A horrible sound of grinding metal roars from beneath the
          GTO's hood.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CHASE FINAL - DAY

          The GTO pulls to the side of the road.
          Milton leaps out and stares.
          He can just make out Jonah standing in the back window...
          holding his granddaughter.
          Piper eases from the hood.
          She stares at her bandanna, at the blood on his face.

                         PIPER
          Jesus, Milton. How?
          She pulls him close...looks at the back of his head.

                         MILTON
          It's still in there. The bullet. I

                         MILTON
          I know, baby. I know. Jonah only
          had about twenty followers. We
          hurt him good today.

                         PIPER

          The Devil and demons? Once those
          doors are opened you're fucked.
          Milton rolls his one good eye.
          Piper turns back to the GTO. Smoke hissing from the engine.

                         PIPER
          What do we do now?

                         MILTON

          curl...dig into the ground.

          fluid stretching back to the highway.
          Left hand hits the ground, right hand digs into the dirt. He
          drags himself forward a few inches.

                         HIS POV
          He's crawling toward the Station Wagon.
          Someone...somewhere...is HUMMING
          Wig turns, squints.

          A SILHOUETTE APPROACHES
          Back lit by the early day sun. There's a bounce in his step.
          Wig holds his hand out to the savior as--
          The Accountant's smiling face becomes clear.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Scorcher today, huh?
          He takes a big long swing from an oversized water bottle.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Christ on a cracker. My apologies.
          The Accountant grabs the man by the collar and drags him into
          the shade of the Station Wagon where he flips him around into
          a sitting position.
          Wig's shirt falls open revealing a pentagram tattooed above
          his left breast.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          What's that supposed to mean?

          Wig takes the offered water as Accountant kneels before him.

          you people want with Milton?

          MAN WITH WIG
          You're the who?
          The Accountant smiles, places his hand around Wig's clearly
          shattered femur and squeezes.
          Wig's body convulses! He SCREAMS.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Does it matter? Milton. Why is he

          Why?
          Wig stares...searches for an answer.
          The Accountant snatches a mangled ankle and twists. Wig's
          body stiffens and he SCREAMS.

          MAN WITH WIG
          Because! Because of what we did.
          Because of who we took.

                         ACCOUNTANT

          down the black asphalt.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          Milton sits on the GTO's hood. Piper stands between his legs
          cleaning his wound.

                         PIPER
          Lemme know if I hurt you.

                         MILTON
          Do what you gotta do. You get used
          to the pain.
          Piper pulls a black bandanna from her pack, there are white
          skulls on it. She folds it, ties it around Milton's head.

                         PIPER
          There. That's better.
          When she moves aside we see she's lined up a skull over his
          missing eye.

          A VEHICLE APPROACHES.
          Milton slides from the hood, steps protectively in front of
          Piper as a banged up wrecker pulls toward them, pulls to the
          side of the road.

          POV FROM APPROACHING VEHICLE
          From this angle it looks as though an innocent old man and
          his granddaughter are having car trouble.

          POV FROM BEHIND THE GTO
          From this angle we can see Milton concealing the shotgun
          behind him. Piper stands close, her hand on the handle of
          the 357 protruding from his waistband.

                         ON WRECKER

          Like Piper, the Driver has his right hand tucked behind his
          back, wrapped around the handle of a .44 Magnum.

          Now we get a good look at him. His name's WEBSTER. An old
          black man, as tough as Milton is angry.

                         PIPER
          Why does everyone keep saying that?

                         WEBSTER
          Because he IS dead. Sure as shit
          supposed to be anyway.
          Webster and Milton eye one another for a long beat then --

          I carried your coffin, old man. I
          was there the day we put your ass
          in the ground.
          Piper stares at Milton. Milton stares at Webster.

          Webster, you gonna yank that .44 or
          just keep stroking it?

          That depends. How's this possible?

          It true they took the little one?
          Milton nods.
          Webster considers for a long beat, then releases the .44.

          Put her in neutral. I'll pull the
          truck around.

          Police tape, half a dozen state and county cruisers. Three
          meat wagons and a news van. Humans buzz the scene like
          insects. The two dead State Troopers lie where they fell.
          Undisturbed. ROOKIE stands out. Young, county uniform, wide
          eyed. Very busy at having no idea what he should be doing.

          And less than three feet from the

          Sarge points to an ash bin filled with sand. Over a hundred
          cigarette butts salute the sky.

          Pay attention, Rookie.
          But Rookie's attention has quickly OCD'd elsewhere.

                         WEBSTER
          You never watched...forget it.
          Milton was a bad husband but he was
          a good father. Used to say it was
          the only thing he was ever good at.
          Then we went and got mixed up with
          the wrong crowd. Power and money
          and once you're in there ain't no
          gettin' out. So to keep her safe
          he vanished the year before she
          went off to college.

          That's what they tell ya, what they

          It ain't about the fire and brimstone.
          Ain't about your suffering. It's

          Brawny cultists erect a makeshift stone altar. On the

          The Accountant, moves. Quickly. With a crisp flick,
          suddenly there's a blade at Piper's throat. She GASPS.

          Why help me?

          I know why. It's because of those
          crazy fucks out there isn't it?
          They figured something out didn't
          they? Somehow they know how to
          summon a piece of hell to earth.
          The Accountant laughs.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          That's cute. You haven't told her?

                         MILTON
          She don't listen.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Young Ms. Piper, let you in on a
          little secret. The Dark Lord?
          Satan? Beelzebub? Lucifer? Simply
          the warden of a very large prison.
          Quiet man, actually. Thoughtful.
          Well read. I happen to know the
          idea of sacrificing children in his
          honor annoys him greatly.

                         MILTON
          Then why? Why help me?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Simple. Like the warden, we all
          have jobs to do. Getting you here
          makes my job easier. You get what
          you want, I get what I want.

                         MILTON
          Then help me, now. There are forty of
          them down there. You and I could--

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --No.

                         MILTON

                         BUT--

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --No. You want to save her then go
          do it. If you win, I win. If they
          take you down, I win.
          He hugs Piper closer.

          It's sure to be a grand show.
          Piper doesn't know what to say.
          The Accountant glances back at Milton.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You're still here? Milton, the clock
          is ticking. Midnight approaches.

          Then get off my fuckin car.

          EXT. OIL RIG RAVINE - NIGHT

          The RV door flings open revealing Jonah King. He walks with
          arrogance through the orgy around him, his followers turn to
          him with reverence. His name is WHISPERED like a secret.
          He approaches the make-shift stone altar where Skanky Gal
          holds the baby within a bundle of blankets.
          HIGH ABOVE: the moon is full and ripe.

                         JONAH KING
          It's almost time.
          Skanky Gal nods. But there is hesitation in her eyes. She's
          grown attached to the baby.
          Jonah takes the baby, places her on the stone altar.

                         JONAH KING
          My brothers and sisters, we have come
          so far. To this place where the
          dying earth bleeds its corrupt soul
          at our feet. From its death, it shall
          be reborn. As we will be. We who
          have survived the slings. The
          arrows. The revulsion of those too
          weak to believe. We have been cast
          out. And hunted. But no more.
          Followers gather, move in unison, dance, writhe, fuck.
          Tattoo approaches with an old rusty knife. It was probably
          elegant once. Now it is worthless. He hands it to Jonah.
          The Followers GASP in holy awe.

          (raising the knife)
          With this sacrifice, no more will
          we be shunned. They say the meek
          will inherit. They LIE. We are
          not meek. We are chosen. The
          hounds of perdition will howl at
          our command. For now we...
          A HOWLING noise.
          No. An engine. Distant but thunderous.
          Heads turn. The sound echoes throughout the ravine then --

          FOOOM!
          The NOVA ROCKETS from the cliff's edge!
          It plummets straight at the cultists!
          They scatter! But three are not so lucky, they vanish as the
          giant Chevy turns them to PULP!
          Jonah's jaw drops. This can't fuckin' be.
          Skanky Gal, grabs the baby and flees toward one of the giant
          oil derricks!

          INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Milton wears a mask of rage as he rips the Nova into a 180,
          his 357 aimed out the window.

          KABOOM! BOOM! KUHFWOOM!
          He's shooting Cultists in a barrel.
          But the Nova is the better weapon. He FLOORS it, then LOCKS
          the brakes, fishtailing.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          The Nova's ass-end veers like a dragon's tail SMACKING
          cultists aside with BONE-SHATTERING brutality.

          EXT. OIL RIG RAVINE - NIGHT

          Jonah grabs a shotgun from behind the altar, opens FIRE.

          Kill him! KILL HIM!
          Followers produce an assortment of firepower and RIDDLE the
          Nova with lead!
          Milton sights Jonah, ready to blow him to fuck, catches the
          reverend while he cocks the pump.
          JONAH can see Milton's got him.
          MILTON grits and pulls the 357's trigger: Click. Click.

          BLAM!
          Jonah fires a fresh round - barely missing as--
          Milton GUNS the engine - SMASHES two followers head on. They
          fly up the hood, SMASH the glass - but shield him from
          another frontal assault. Their bodies RIDDLED with lead.
          The Cultists circle him to get a better shot.
          A Magnum is thrust into the driver's side window - right in
          Milton's face.
          He leans back just as the gun is FIRED. Milton yanks the
          wheel, reverses the Nova - wrenches the Magnum from the
          fucker's hand. The Cultist hangs on. Claws at Milton.
          Milton twirls the Magnum, gunslinger style. Jams the barrel
          into the Cultist's face and FIRES.
          Milton runs down any that get in his way.

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - CLIFF'S EDGE - NIGHT

          The Accountant stands above the battle, Piper at his side.
          He can hear her heartbeat.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You want to help him.

                         PIPER
          Yes.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          He chose you, you know that. Fast

          Then go.
          She rushes toward a goat path leading down to the valley
          below. Suddenly something catches her eye.

          CLOSE ON GROUND
          The Ancient Revolver.
          Without the slightest pause, Piper snatches it, spins and
          aims it right at...
          The Accountant's smiling face.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Hold on tight. It has quite a kick.

                         PIPER
          If I kill you, you can't take him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Someone else will come...someone
          else always comes.
          Piper considers, the SOUNDS of battle rising from below.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Piper, he didn't steal that gun to
          kill me. He stole it to slow me down.
          He's getting what he wanted. Now, go
          to him. Before it's too late.
          Piper turns and scrambles down the goat path.

          INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Milton is ROARING in anger as the NOVA is PEPPERED with
          bullets and shotgun blasts. GLASS, SPARKS and CHAOS rain
          down on him. Steam and oil SPEW from the engine.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Ducking in the seat, unable to see, Milton fights to keep

          The NOVA pitches hard to the left, PIN-WHEELING right into an
          oil derrick.
          The SCREAM of metal on metal rips through the ravine. The
          Nova SCREECHES to a halt, tires SPIN, smoke spews, gas drips
          from the wreck.
          Jonah and the half a dozen remaining Cultists zero in around
          the Nova, guns trained on the driver's door.
          Jonah nods to Tattoo who approaches close to the ground,
          reaches out slowly and YANKS the door open.

          KA-FOOM!
          Tattoo is blown backwards by a shotgun blast!

                         JONAH KING

          Jonah and his men open FIRE!

          INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Milton SCREAMS as the Nova's cab turns into a warzone. He
          clambers deep inside the wreck. Praying they don't ignite
          the leaking fuel. Then the firing stops.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Jonah and his men draw closer and closer.

                         THEIR POV
          Soon they'll have a direct shot right into the Nova's open
          driver's side door.

          PIPER (O.S.)

          HEY!
          The men spin to find Piper standing behind them, ancient
          revolver aimed into their group. She pulls the trigger.

          KAFOOM!
          Jesus wept. The KICKBACK blows Piper off her feet, the gun
          jerked from her hands.
          She lands on her back. Hard. The wind KNOCKED out of her.

          The GOD SLUG slams into a cultist's stomach. It EXPLODES
          through him, and into the BATTERED RV BEHIND:

          KABLAAAAM!
          The RV goes nuclear - blows shrapnel and cultists helter
          skelter across the ravine, shredding the remaining five.
          JONAH is spattered with his men's blood, dives behind the
          wreck of the Nova.

                         JONAH KING
          Well...this has all gone to shit.
          He steadies himself, grips the shotgun and shoves it into the
          Nova's open driver's side door.

                         HIS POV
          Empty. The passenger door is open. Milton is gone.
          Jonah spins in all directions. Expecting a trick. But
          nothing. He rushes around the Nova to find...
          Milton crawling. Bleeding.

          MILTON'S POV
          Skanky Gal cowers twenty yards away beneath an oil derrick.
          The baby wrapped in pink blankets in her arms.
          Jonah walks up oozing arrogance. He knows he's won.
          He places the barrel of the shotgun to Milton's chin.

                         JONAH KING
          You lose.

                         (LOOKS UP)

          Someone near CLEARS HIS THROAT.
          Jonah turns, stares.
          The Accountant leans against the Nova's hulk. He winks.
          At Jonah's feet, Milton scrambles forward and we realize he
          wasn't crawling toward his grand-baby.
          He was crawling toward the ancient revolver.
          He snatches it, rolls onto his back as--
          Jonah swings his gun toward Milton --

          KAFOOM!
          The burning God Slug HITS JONAH IN THE FACE!
          Jonah's head is obliterated. The force yanks his headless
          body into the air, spins it sky-wards in a plume of flame.
          The Accountant moves away, watching as --
          The burning corpse slaps onto the leaking wreck of the Nova.

          THE GAS IGNITES
          FLAMES ERUPT with THUNDER clear to the heavens - the Nova
          ROARS one final time, living up to it's name in a furious
          ball of fire that consumes whatever's left of Jonah King.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Piper SUCKS in air. Sits up. Fire lighting her face.

                         PIPER
          Milton?!
          He lies on his back several yards away.
          Piper rushes up, falls beside him.
          He's alive, mouth filled with blood. She takes his hand.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Skanky Gal looks up to find...
          ...the Accountant standing over her. He holds out his arms.

          I'm curious. Would you have let
          him do it?
          She opens her mouth to speak, says nothing...

                         ACCOUNTANT
          That's what I thought.
          He turns and walks away from her.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          See you. Soon.
          Skanky bolts. Races off into the darkness.

                         PIPER
          Milton...no...
          Milton struggles. His head lolls back and forth. Eyes flick
          around. Searching.

                         MILTON
          Where...where is she?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          She's here.
          The Accountant hands the baby to Milton.
          Milton stares at the tiny face. The big bright eyes.
          Innocent. Beautiful in every miraculous way.
          He places her in Piper's arms.

                         MILTON
          Keep her safe.

                         PIPER
          I will. Anyone tries to hurt her
          and I'll kill'em.

                         MILTON

          WEBSTER climbs from the 69 Camaro.

                         MILTON
          Webster will look after you both.
          As long as he can. And he'll keep
          trying long after he can't.

          Milton. This can't...you can't
          just give up. There's gotta be
          something we can do to...

                         MILTON
          Beat the devil? Nah. Never gonna
          happen. I'm askin more than I have
          a right to. I know it. But love
          her for me, Piper. Love her and
          make her yours. I don't have any
          right to ask for your promise...

          I promise. Milton. I promise.
          Milton coughs.

                         MILTON
          Thank you.
          And like that. The life fades from his eyes.
          Piper holds the baby close, SOBS.
          She looks up at the Accountant. But he is gone.

          His one good eye opens. It rolls around then settles on
          something above.

          How was that?

          MOVE TO REVEAL
          The Accountant stands over him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I've seen better. Guess she
          doesn't know you can beat him, slow
          him, shoot him, even stop him...

                         MILTON
          ...But you can't kill a dead man.
          Milton sits up slowly. Bones CREAK. He holds his hand out.
          The Accountant takes it. Pulls him to his feet.
          They turn and walk toward the rising sun.
          They walk until they are just silhouettes against a bright
          yellow glow...then...
          ...they fade into the shimmering heat...
          ...and they are gone.
