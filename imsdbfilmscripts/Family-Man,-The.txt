		CHAPTER ONE - EARLY HISTORY

	1	INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, PAN AM TERMINAL - NIGHT

		SUPER:  AUTUMN, 1987

		A line of PASSENGERS about to board a Pan Am flight to 
		London.

		JACK CAMPBELL, 22, head full of long unkempt hair, Tom 
		Selleck mustache,  the hopeful look of youth in his 
		eyes... sitting next to...

		KATE REYNOLDS, 21, pretty, Dorothy Hamill haircut...
		rubbing the tears from  her swollen red eyes...

					KATE
			I got you a few necessities...

		Kate hands Jack a new copy of Vonneguts Cats 
		Cradle.

					KATE  (CONTD)
			Your copy was a mess...

		Jack accepts the book but hes unable to take his eyes 
		off Kate.  She hands him a cassette.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Every one of these songs will 
			remind you of me in a slightly 
			different way...

					JACK
			All in one tape?

					KATE
			I also put side two of London 
			Calling on there...

		Kate leans over and kisses him passionately on the 
		lips.

					KATE  (CONTD)
			That was not officially the 
			goodbye kiss. It was just an 
			interim kiss...

		He looks at her, his eyes welling up. He pulls her 
		close, kissing her deeply. Then...

					ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
			This will be the final boarding 
			call for Pan Am flight 4 to 
			London, Heathrow.

		Jack takes Kates hand, getting up, turning sadly to 
		the gate.

					KATE
			You have your ticket?

		Jack pulls out a BLUE PAN AM TICKET ENVELOPE.  Kate 
		nods. They embrace and kiss again.  As they separate.

					JACK
			Im not even gonna say it, 
			Kate. Maybe itll be like 
			I never left...

		Jack takes one lastlook at her, then heads for the 
		gate.

		Kate stands there, watching him go.  Then...

		...a  moment of intuition. Something isnt right. She 
		looks at Jack, about to disappear into the jetway, 
		trying to decide...

					KATE
			Wait.

		Jack turns. Kate approaches him.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I have a bad feeling about 
			this.

					JACK
			About the plane? What do you 
			think its gonna crash? Dont 
			say that...

					KATE
				(shaking her head)
			I know weve talked about this a 
			thousand times and we both agree 
			that going to London is the 
			right thing to do. But in my 
			heart... this feels wrong.

		She looks at the gate...the last few passengers are boarding, 
		then back into Jacks eyes.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Dont  go, Jack...

					JACK
			You mean dont go at all?  
			What about my internship?

					KATE
			Believe me I know what an 
			incredible opportunity this 
			is for you...

					JACK
			For us, Kate.

					KATE
			Right, for us. But...Im
			afraid that if you get on 
			that plane...

					JACK
			What?

		Kate looks at him, pleading with her eyes, but she cant 
		say...

					KATE
				(torn)
			Go. Im sorry, you should just 
			go...

					JACK
				(thinking, then...)
			No, youre right.  What are we 
			doing?

					KATE
			We're being responsible.  Go.
			Get on the plane.

		His eyes narrow as he measures her determination...

					KATE (CONT'D)
				(a smile)
			Get the hell outta my sight.
			You bother me.

		A laugh from Jack.  Kate gives him a calm smile and a
		nod - it's not entirely convincing but it's enough for
		Jack.

					JACK
				(resolute)
			Okay, I'm going...

		He takes her in his arms one last time and hugs her
		tight.  Jack looks toward the gate, the line
		disappearing...Kate grasps his shirt tightly.

					KATE
			I can't seem to let go of
			you...

					JACK
			You hear me complaining about
			that?

		A sober look in Jack's eyes.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			Look, we're at the airport and
			no one ever thinks clearly at
			the airport so we should just
			trust the decision we already
			made.  You've been accepted to
			one of the best law schools in
			the country, I've got this
			internship at Barclay's Bank.
			We have a great plan, honey...

		Kate nods, then, with resolve...

					KATE
			You want to do something
			great, Jack?  Let's flush the
			plan...start our lives right
			now, today...I don't know what
			that life's gonna look like
			but I do know it has both of
			us in it.  And I choose us...

		Jack is jolted by her words.

					KATE (CONT'D)
			The plan doesn't make us
			great, Jack.  What we have
			together, that's what makes us
			great.

		Her words sink in...A long moment of decision...He
		looks toward the gate, only one person left in
		line...back to Kate...imploring him with her eyes.

		Finally...He kisses her deeply on the lips...

					JACK
			I love you, Kate...

		...a smile from Kate...relief...then...

					JACK (CONT'D)
				(taking her face in
				 his hands)
			...and a year in London's not
			gonna change that.  A hundred
			years couldn't change that...

		Jack gives her one final kiss then walks pensively to
		the gate, handing the attendant his ticket, not able to
		look back.

		Kate watches him go, tears streaming down her face, as
		the gate door closes behind him.  She waits, almost
		willing it to open again...waiting...waiting...but it
		doesn't...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    1A	EXT. MANHATTAN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

		The skating rink at Central Park...Christmas tree at
		Rockefeller Center...the view down Fifth Avenue with
		Christmas decorations...Park Avenue.

	2	EXT. MANHATTAN - EARLY MORNING

		We close in on a spectacular pre-war doorman
		building...

	3	INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

		A huge space with gleaming hardwood floors, ornate
		moldings, and a great view of the Hudson and Jersey
		behind it...

		The place looks like a museum display...everything is
		of the highest quality and meticulously maintained.

		A wall of photos - Jack and Clinton, Jack with Patrick
		Ewing, Jack between Alan Greenspan and Henry Kravis.

		And a "Willie Mays" baseball bat encased in glass...

	4	INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...impeccably decorated and obsessively neat.

		Close in on the bed where JACK CAMPBELL, now 35, sans
		mustache and long hair, opens his eyes.
		A FLASH of bright morning light from the window.  Jack
		shields his eyes, turning his head toward the bathroom
		where he sees...

		A WOMAN'S BACK...draped in a towel...an incredible
		back, neither flabby nor overly toned, beautifully
		curved...Jack focuses on it a moment. As the woman
		turns to him...

		PAULA.  Beautiful, late 20s, a toothbrush in her
		mouth...

					PAULA
				(holding up toothbrush)
			   I hope you don't mind.  There
			   were like ten new ones in the
			   cabinet.

		A playful smile from Paula.

					JACK
			   It's not what you think.  I
			   took Mentadent public...

		Paula smiles, moves over to a chair and grabs a little
		black dress hanging neatly over it.

					PAULA
			   Did you really mean what you
			   said about Tuscany?

					JACK
			   Of course I did.

					PAULA
			   Last night was great...

					JACK
			   You are an amazing lover.  You
			   should be giving motivational
			   seminars.

					PAULA
			   Thanks.  You're not bad
			   yourself...

		Jack grabs his Frank Mueller watch from the night
		stand, puts it on his wrist.  He looks at Paula as she
		slips the dress on.

					JACK
			   I want to see you again.

					PAULA
			   I'd like that, too.

			JACK
			   Tonight.

		She turns to him.

					PAULA
			   It's Christmas Eve, Jack.

					JACK
			   So we'll get egg nog.

		Paula laughs.

					PAULA
				(putting on her shoes)
			   I have to go to my parents'
			   house out in Jersey.  Would
			   you like to come?

					JACK
			   Jersey?  You know what the
			   traffic's gonna be like?

					PAULA
			   I'm taking the train...

		Paula approaches Jack, leaning over him, her long hair
		dangling on his chest.

					PAULA (CONT'D)
			   Don't you have anywhere to go?

					JACK
			   I've got plenty of places to
			   go.

		He stays there, confident, sexy, waiting for an
		answer...

					PAULA
				(a sexy laugh, then...)
			   Maybe I can try and sneak away
			   some time tomorrow morning...
				(kissing him on 
				 the lips)
			   Okay?

					JACK
				(coy)
			   If it's something you feel
			   strongly about.
 
		Paula walks to the door, then turns back to Jack.

					PAULA
			It was nice meeting you, Jack...

		CHAPTER TWO - MAIN TITLES

    4A	INT. JACKS APARTMENT - MORNING

		Jack saunters over to a Yamaha Grand Disclavier in the 
		living room.  He puts a disk into the piano and...

		...the keys come alive with the music of BACH.  Jack 
		hits a switch and suddenly the entire apartment is 
		enveloped in music...

    4B	INT. JACKS BUILDING, CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

		Paula, waiting for the elevator, hears the MUSIC 
		emanating from Jacks apartment...an intrigued glance 
		back at the apartment door as the elevator arrives...

	5	INT. JACKS BATHROOM - MORNING

		Backs Passion According to St. Matthew is blaring 
		through the speakers, the music is swelling to full 
		orchestra...

		Jacks at the mirror in this incredibly neat marble-
		tiled bathroom, shaving with a silver-plated Hammacher 
		Schlemmer razor, HUMMING with the orchestra...

	6	INT. JACKS CLOSET - MORNING

		...the size of a small house, a long row of Zegna 
		suits, shoe trees stacked with Italian shoes, tailored 
		shirts everywhere.

		Jacks still HUMMING to the music as he dresses in 
		front of a mirror.

	7	INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

		Jack, wearing an elegant camels hair overcoat and 
		carrying a leather briefcase, a Master of the 
		Universe smile on his face, now HUMMING the Bach piece 
		from memory...

		The doors open at 6.  Jack self-consciously stops 
		singing as ELIZABETH PETERSON, 60s, wearing a mink 
		coat, gets on the elevator carrying a yappy little dog.

					JACK
				(a charming smile)
			   Mrs. Peterson.

					MRS. PETERSON
			   Hello Jack.  You dont 
			   have to stop singing on 
			   my account...

					JACK
			   Its because Im shy, 
			   Betty.  So, when are you 
			   going to leave that old 
			   corpse Mr. Peterson and 
			   run away with me?

					MRS. PETERSON
			   You know you could never 
			   satisfy me the way he 
			   does...

		The doors open to the lobby.  Mrs. Peterson walks out 
		ahead.

	8	INT. JACKS BUILDING, LOBBY - MORNING

		TONY THE DOORMAN holds the door open for Jack and Mrs. 
		Peterson...

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   Merry Christmas, Mr. 
			   Campbell.

					JACK
			   Howd you do this year, 
			   Tony?

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   About four grand.  And a 
			   bottle of twenty five 
			   year old scotch from Mrs. 
			   Johnson in 9D.  Im 
			   putting it all in 
			   commercial paper like you 
			   said.

					JACK
			   Just until the Deutsche 
			   Mark turns...

		Jack exits the building...

	9   OMITTED

    9A	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari racing through the park...

    10	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - MORNING

		A modern Wall Street building.  The sign above the 
		glass doors reads, P.K. Lassiter and Associates, 
		Investment House.

		The Ferrari SCREECHES to a halt.  Jack gets out, heads 
		into the building...

    10A	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack throws his keys to a nearby SECURITY GUARD with a 
		smile on his way to the elevators...

		CHAPTER THREE - JACK THE BUSINESSMAN

		DISSOLVE TO:

    11	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

		The Manhattan skyline shines through the windows of
		this beautiful conference room.

		SIX EXECUTIVES are seated at a huge oak table littered
		with coffee cups and lunch waste.  At the end of the
		table, ALAN MINTZ, 30s, balding, sits with a faraway
		look in his eyes, three empty Diet Coke cans in front
		of him.

		Mintz is poking at a shiny gold cherub dangling from a
		small, plastic Christmas tree, sitting in the middle of
		the table.

		Jack is addressing the group from the front of the
		room, standing in front of a computer with a huge flat
		screen monitor, covered with stock charts and tables...

					JACK
			   ...if MedTech's shares sink
			   any lower than...
				(casually executing 
				 a keystroke)
			   ...forty three, we're in
			   trouble with the stock
			   valuation.  So for god's sake
			   watch what you say to your
			   institutional customers...

		Jack notices Alan Mintz playing with the cherub.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   ...we still have almost a full
			   day of trading before zero
			   hour and I don't want any
			   trouble...
				(distracted by Mintz)
			   ...penny for your thoughts,
			   Alan...

		Alan looks up.

					ALAN
			   Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and
			   the kids I'd be home by
			   dinner.  You know, it being
			   Christmas Eve and all.

					JACK
			   Is that tonight?

		A LAUGH from the group.  Jack approaches Alan.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   You think I like being here on
			   Christmas Eve, Alan?

					ALAN
			   I don't know.  Maybe...

		Another LAUGH.  Even Jack lets out a good-natured
		chuckle.

					JACK
			   Okay, maybe I do have a touch
			   of tunnel vision this holiday
			   season.  But in two days we're
			   going to announce one of the
			   largest mergers in U.S.
			   corporate history.  Thirty
			   billion dollars...
				(basking in the glory)
			   When this kind of deal turns
			   up you get on and you ride it
			   `till it's over.  You don't
			   ask it for a vacation...

		A chuckle from the group...the esprit de corps seems to
		energize Jack.

					JACK (CONT'D)
				(to the group)
			   December 26th.  After that
			   there'll be so much money
			   floating around here it'll be
			   like Christmas every day...
				(smiling)
			   December 26th, people.  If
			   you'd like to celebrate that
			   day, you all have my
			   blessing...

		Enthusiastic nods and words of agreement from the suits
		around the table...

					ALAN
			   You're right, Jack.  Sorry...
			   Jack approaches Alan.

					JACK
			   I don't want you to be sorry,
			   Alan, I want you to be
			   excited.  I want my gift to be
			   the first one you open this
			   year.  You know why?

					ALAN
			   Why Jack?

					JACK
			   Because my gift comes with ten
			   zeroes at the end...

		A MURMUR of excitement in the room, even Alan cracks a
		smile.  Jack puts a hand on Alan's shoulder.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Good man...

    12	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

		The conference room door opens and the SIX ENERGIZED
		SUITS emerge, each met by an ASSISTANT handing them
		messages.

		Jack is the last one out.  He's met in stride by
		ADELLE, 50s, carrying a Filofax and a pile of phone
		messages.

					ADELLE
			   Only eight thirty?  What's the
			   matter, had some last minute
			   shopping to do?

		Jack pops a peppermint Lifesaver in his mouth as Adelle
		hands him his messages.

					JACK
			   You too?  This holiday's about
			   giving, Adelle.  And I'm
			   giving everything I've got to
			   this deal, so in a way, I'm
			   more Christmassy than
			   anyone...
				(holding out the candy)
			   Lifesaver?

					ADELLE
				(ignoring the candy)
			   You're a ray of sunshine,
			   Jack.

		They approach an office, the words, "Jack Campbell -
		President" stenciled on the glass...

    13	INT. JACK'S OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		...continuing past Adelle's desk, Jack looking at his
		messages, and into Jack's office...

    14	INT. JACK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		A cavernous office, you could land a helicopter in it -
		high tech fixtures, full bar, leather sofa, $3,000
		Stairmaster...

		Jack walks to an enormous, bare mahogany desk, and sits
		down in a high tech ergonomic leather chair.

					ADELLE
			   Oh, and Oxxford called...

					JACK
			   Ooh, my suits are ready...

		He gets to the last message, sees the name on it, and
		reels back.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Kate Reynolds...

					ADELLE
			   Her assistant said you could
			   call her at home after eight.

		Jack stares at the message like he's looking at a
		ghost.

					JACK
			   Her assistant?

					ADELLE
			   Yeah Jack, her assistant...

					JACK
				(lost in the message)
			   Kate Reynolds was my
			   girlfriend in college.  I
			   almost married her...

					ADELLE
				(a hearty LAUGH)
			   You?  Married?

					JACK
				(snapping out of it)
			   Almost married.  And almost a
			   junior broker at E.F.
			   Hutton...

					ADELLE
			   Excuse me?

					JACK
			   She didn't want me to go to
			   London.  We're standing at the
			   airport saying goodbye and she
			   asks me to stay.

					ADELLE
			   So you left her?  Just like
			   that?

					JACK
			   God, no.  I thought about it
			   for practically the entire
			   flight...

					ADELLE
			   Stop Jack, I'm getting all
			   weepy.

					JACK
			   I took the road less traveled,
			   Adelle.

					ADELLE
			   And look where it's led you...
				(picking up the phone)
			   I'm gonna get her on the
			   phone...

		Jack pauses, focused on the message, his mind drifting
		back...

		Adelle begins dialing the number.  Finally, Jack
		reaches out and hangs up the phone.

					JACK
			   No...

					ADELLE
			   No?!  You almost married this
			   woman.  Aren't you even
			   curious what she wants?

					JACK
			   She's probably just having a
			   fit of nostalgia.  You know,
			   lonely Christmas Eve, call the
			   one that got away, that kind
			   of thing.

		Adelle rolls her eyes at him.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   I'm telling you, it's ancient
			   history...

		Jack looks up as PETER LASSITER, 60s, founder and
		chairman of P.K. Lassiter and Associates, saunters into
		the room.

					LASSITER
			   Eight forty-five on Christmas
			   Eve and Jack Campbell is still
			   at his desk.  There's a
			   Hallmark moment for you...

		Lassiter heads to the bar like he's done it a million
		times.

					JACK
			   Peter.  I don't see you
			   rushing home to trim the tree.

					LASSITER
				(pouring himself 
				 a scotch)
			   That's because I'm a heartless
			   bastard who only cares about
			   money.

					JACK
			   And God love you for it.

		Lassiter drops down in a soft leather chair opposite
		Jack.

					LASSITER
				(sipping the scotch)
			   I just got a call from Terry
			   Haight.  Bob Thomas is
			   nervous...

					JACK
			   That'll happen when you're
			   about to spend thirty billion
			   dollars on some aspirin...

					LASSITER
			   Someone's gonna have to nurse
			   him through this.

					JACK
			   Why are you staring at my
			   breasts, Peter?

					LASSITER
			   I need you, tiger..

					JACK
			   Where is he?

					LASSITER
			   Aspen.

		Jack pauses for a beat.

					JACK
				(to Adelle)
			   Call Aunt Irma.  Tell her I
			   won't be able to make it
			   tomorrow...

		Adelle rolls her eyes at him...

					LASSITER
			   You're a credit to capitalism,
			   Jack.

		Jack glances at Adelle, then looks back at Lassiter.

					JACK
			   Hey Peter, lemme ask you a
			   question.  An old girlfriend
			   calls you out of the blue on
			   Christmas Eve...

					LASSITER
			   You suddenly having trouble
			   getting dates?

					JACK
			   Not by a long shot.

					LASSITER
			   Then leave it in the past.
			   Old flames are like old tax
			   returns.  You keep `em in the
			   file cabinet for three years
			   and then you cut `em loose.

		Jack shoots Adelle a satisfied smile, crumpling up
		Kate's message and tossing a perfect hook into a N.Y.
		Knicks hoop.

					JACK
				(to Adelle)
			   I'll leave from the office
			   tomorrow afternoon.  Call the
			   group.  Schedule an emergency
			   strategy session for noon.

					ADELLE
			   That'll be a nice little
			   holiday treat.

    15	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT

		A single light remains on in the building.

    16	INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

		Jack is alone in the office working on his computer,
		checking spreadsheets on a large flat screen monitor.

		Jack leans back in his chair rubbing his eyes.  He
		checks his watch.  It's past eleven.  He gets up, goes
		to the window, sees the city in all its Christmas
		glory, then he see it...

		...the message from Kate, crumpled in the
		trashcan...then turns back to the window, gazing out at
		the night...

    17	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT

		Jack comes out of the elevator, walking past the lobby
		desk where FRANK, a security guard, sits watching the
		monitors.

					FRANK
			   Mr. Campbell.  Why didn't you
			   call down, I would've had Joe
			   get your ride.

		Jack looks outside the front door to the snowy, quiet
		street.

					JACK
			   I'm thinking I might walk
			   tonight, Frank.

					FRANK
			   Nice night for it.  I'll have
			   Louis send your car home.

		A nod from Jack.

					FRANK (CONT'D)
			   Merry Christmas to you, sir...

					JACK
			   Thanks.  To you too...

		Jack puts on a pair of soft leather gloves and heads
		out into the crisp night air...

    18	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINOUS

		Jack emerges from the building, walking across the
		large plaza, past the fountain...snow begins to fall...

    19	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack's walking down the nearly empty street, snow
		falling down on him, a bounce in his step, looking at
		the windows of the closed shops along the way.

		He gets to the end of the block spots the Wong
		Brothers' 24 Hour Deli across the street...

		He heads toward it...

    20	INT. WONG BROTHERS' DELI - SECONDS LATER
 
		Jack walks into the brightly lit deli...

		SAM WONG, 20s, is with his 80-year-old GRANDFATHER
		behind the counter.  There's a NERDY COLLEGE KID at the
		salad bar, a drunken DEPARTMENT STORE SANTA at the
		liquor display, a WOMAN with a BABY in an aisle and...

		...a BLACK MAN, 30s, with a dollar sign and the name
		"CASH" tattooed on his arm, stands in front of the
		coffee machine...

					CASH
			   Oh yeah...yeah, yee-ah!  She's
			   a certified winner...paper-
			   thin but good as gold...

		Jack notices Cash talking to himself, seemingly crazy.

		Jack approaches Sam Wong at the counter.

					JACK
			   Egg nog?

					SAM WONG
				(pointing)
			   Dairy case.  Five dollar.

					CASH
				(in the b.g., to 
				 Sam Wong)
			   Y'all do the lotto here...?
			   `Cause I got me a winner...I
			   know, I know, Lotto keeps the
			   black man down... but not
			   me...

		Jack grabs a carton of egg nog, then notices Cash
		handing Sam Wong his ticket.  Jack heads back toward
		the counter...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   ...06...14...18...48...right
			   there.  Four numbers...that's
			   two hundred and thirty eight
			   dollar...
				(a smile)
			   Merry Christmas and shit...

					SAM WONG
				(barely looking 
				 at ticket)
			   Ticket bad.  You draw in lines
			   with pencil.

					CASH
			   What're you talkin' about?

					SAM WONG
				(throwing the ticket 
				 back)
			   You draw lines with pencil!  I
			   know about this!

		The woman with the baby looks over...the college kid
		looks up, nervous...the drunken Santa, bottle of
		bourbon in hand, starts to walk by Jack...Jack
		instinctively puts an arm out, holding the Santa
		back...

					CASH
			   What!?  Look at the ticket...!

					SAM WONG
			   Get out, I call 911.

		The Santa looks at Jack, confused.

					CASH
			   You're lookin' at me, you're
			   not even lookin' at the
			   ticket!

		The woman with the baby puts a loaf of bread back on
		the shelf, starts nervously inching toward the door.

					SAM WONG
			   You leave now.  Take ticket
			   somewhere else.
				(calling out)
			   Next customer in line...!

					CASH
			   You first generation,
			   xenophobic, money-theistic,
			   hot pastrami sandwich
			   making...

					SAM WONG
				(screaming)
			   Get out!

		Just watching...Cash shoves the ticket in Sam Wong's
		face...

					CASH
			   LOOK AT THE GODDAMN TICKET!!

		A moment of decision for Jack.  Then...

					JACK
				(carefully)
			   Let me see that ticket.

		Cash turns to Jack.

					CASH
				(menacing)
			   Was I talkin' to you?!

		Jack looks at the woman, the college kid, the Santa,
		then...

					JACK
			   Maybe I'll buy it from you.

		Now Cash walks over to Jack...

					CASH
			   Guy in $2,000 suit gets ass
			   kicked tryin' to be a hero.
			   Film at eleven...
				(then...turning to 
				 the coffee machine)
			   What?!  Oh no, not another
			   lookie-loo.  You know how big
			   a job this is?

		The patrons exchange nervous glances...Jack watches,
		confused.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   You're double bookin' me!
			   You're gonna get double
			   billed!  Shit!

		Cash throws a bottle of Perrier against the wall, it
		SHATTERS.  The woman reels back in terror with the
		baby...

					JACK
			   Hey, c'mon...

		In a flash, Cash whips a .38 from the back of his
		pants, aiming it at Jack's face.  The woman SCREAMS,
		covers her baby.

					CASH
				(in Jack's face)
			   Do you want to die?

		Jack stares at Cash, trying his best to keep his
		cool...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   DO YOU WANNA DIE?!

					JACK
			   No.
 
					CASH
				(a smile)
			   Yes you do...

					JACK
			   Look, I'm talking about a
			   business deal here.  I buy the
			   ticket for two hundred, take
			   it to a store where the guy
			   behind the counter...
				(glaring at Sam Wong)
			   ...doesn't have a death wish
				(back to Cash)
			   ...I just made myself a quick
			   thirty eight dollars.

		Cash gets closer...

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Like I said, it's a business
			   deal...

					CASH
			   Damn, you are the real
			   thing...

		Cash narrows his eyes...then, a smile as he puts the
		gun back into his pants...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   C'mon, Jack, let's get outta
			   here...
				(to Sam Wong)
			   You were lookin' at me, papa,
			   you shoulda been lookin' at
			   the ticket.  That ticket was
			   legit, B.  You're fake...

		Cash starts out of the deli.  Jack follows...

    21	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Cash walking down the street...Jack, holding
		his carton of egg nog under his arm, counting out two
		hundred dollars...

					JACK
			   How'd you know my name was
			   Jack?

					CASH
			   I call all you white guys
			   "Jack."

		Jack nods...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   You know you seem pretty
			   relaxed for a guy who just had
			   a gun pulled on him.

					JACK
			   There's no way I was gonna die
			   in that deli...
				(off Cash's look)
			   Let's just say I've been on a
			   lucky streak lately.

					CASH
				(a big LAUGH)
			   A lucky streak, huh?

		Jack hands him the money.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   Sound pretty sure of yourself,
			   don't you?

		Jack nods.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   So you're telling me, you've
			   got a gun to your head and you
			   don't think for one second,
			   what if this, what if that,
			   maybe I shouldn't do this, I
			   shoulda done that.

					JACK
			   I don't do that.  That's just
			   not for me...

		Cash looks at him, then smiles.

					CASH
			   Okay, Jack.  Nice doing
			   business with you...
			   Cash is about to take off...

					JACK
			   Hey...

		Cash turns around.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   What do you want to carry that
			   gun around for, anyway?
			   You're just gonna do something
			   you'll regret...

					CASH
			   You want to talk about
			   regrets, you're talking to the
			   wrong person.

		Jack casually takes the egg nog out of the bag, opens
		the carton...

					JACK
			   I'm just saying that you seem
			   like a smart guy.  At a
			   certain point you're gonna do
			   something, and then there's no
			   turning back...

					CASH
			   Yeah, in most cases that'd be
			   true.

		Jack takes a sip of the egg nog.

					JACK
			   I mean there must be programs
			   out there, opportunities...

					CASH
				(a deep laugh)
			   Wait a minute, wait a
			   minute... you're tryin' to
			   save me?

		A look from Jack...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   Oh man, you're serious...
				(out to the street)
			   This man thinks I need to be
			   saved!

					JACK
			   Everyone needs something.

		Cash looks at Jack...

					CASH
			   Yeah?  What do you need?

					JACK
			   Me?

					CASH
			   You just said everyone needs
			   something.

					JACK
			   I've got everything I need.

					CASH
			   Wow.  It must be great being
			   you.  You got it all.

		Cash looks at Jack.  He smiles and shakes his head.

					JACK
			   Look, I'm not saying you'd be
			   able to do it without some
			   hard work...

					CASH
				(a hearty LAUGH)
			   You still think this is about
			   me, don't you?

					JACK
			   Sure it's about you.  But it's
			   about society, too.

					CASH
			   Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this
			   one... Just remember, Jack,
			   you did this.  You brought
			   this on yourself...

		And with that, Cash turns and leaves Jack alone on the
		street with his egg nog...

    22	INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks in and throws his keys on a table.  He takes
		off his gloves and overcoat, glances at the mail, then
		heads into the bedroom.

		Through the large windows we see snow falling...

    23	INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack, flat on his back in bed, fast asleep...

		CHAPTER FOUR - A DIFFERENT LIFE

		DISSOLVE TO:

    24	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

		Close in on Jacks face, bathed in morning light...he 
		opens his eyes...feels something strange...

		Jack looks down...theres a womans head resting on his 
		chest.

		A look of confusion crosses his face...trying to 
		remember... did he meet a woman last night...?

		He turns his head to find a large MUTT sitting 
		faithfully beside the bed, wagging his tail...

		...did she have a dog?

		He looks down at the woman again, craning his neck to 
		get a look at her face.  And then he sees her...

		...KATE REYNOLDS...

		...now 34 and even more beautiful, a look of utter 
		contentment on her radiant face, sleeping soundly...

		His head darts around the room - its cramped and lived 
		in, clothes and toys are strewn about, family photos on 
		the dresser, Laura Ashley curtains, a tiny poster bed 
		and a charming little bay window.

		He instinctively reaches for his Franck Mueller watch 
		on the night stand, but its not there.  Its a Timex 
		Indiglo and it reads, 7:57 A.M...

		Jack looks back at Kate...he rubs his eyes...maybe its 
		a dream...but nothing changes.  Then, Kate stirs...

					KATE
			   Mmmm...ten more minutes, 
			   Jack... its Christmas...

		Jack jumps as he hears Kate talk for the first time...

		Suddenly, the door bursts open...A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL, 
		ANNIE, in a little nightgown, walks into the room 
		carrying an 18 MONTH OLD BOY, JOSH, SINGING at the top 
		of her lungs...

					ANNIE
			   Jingle bells, Santa s
			   mells, Rudolph laid an 
			   egg...la la la, la-la la 
			   la, la la la la la...

		Annie places Josh on the bed and then jumps up 
		herself.  She gestures to the dog, patting the bed.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   You too, Luce...

		The dog faithfully jumps on the tiny bed, joining 
		everybody else and leaving very little room.  Annie 
		starts jumping.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   Rise...and...shine...!

					KATE
				(stirring)
			   Youre jumping, 
			   sweetheart...

		Jack looks at this activity like a man at his own 
		funeral.

					ANNIE
			   Mom, dont you think we 
			   need to open the 
			   presents?

					KATE
				(groggy)
			   Mommy needs five more 
			   minutes in la la land.  
			   That could be her 
			   present...

		Josh crawls directly up to Jacks stomach, climbing 
		on.

					ANNIE
			   Cmon, Dad.  Get up!

		She said Dad.

		Thats it.  Jack moves the baby gingerly over, then 
		gets out of bed, stumbling over a baseball bat lying 
		next to it.

		He picks up the bat...the same Willie Mays autograph 
		bat that was encased in glass in his N.Y. apartment.

		Frightened, Jack drops the bad, looking down at himself 
		for the first time...hes naked...

		...a mortified look on his face as he sees the kids on 
		the bed...

		...he quickly grabs a pair of sweat pants and a yellow 
		cardigan off the chair and throws them on...

		Kate, still half asleep, reaches out her hand.

					KATE
			   Jack...?

		Jack turns by instinct.  Kate grabs him, drawing him 
		near.  A look of fear on his face as Kate opens her 
		eyes...

		Eye contact...Jacks certain hes about to hear her 
		scream...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(still groggy)
			   Strong coffee, okay?

		She lets him go as Jack backs out the door...

    25	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

		A garishly decorated Christmas tree sits in the middle 
		of this messy and disorganized living room, a bevy of 
		gifts underneath and four red stockings over the 
		fireplace.

		Jack darts to the top of the steps...

					KATE (O.S.)
				(calling from 
				 the bedroom)
			   Use an entire can if you 
			   have to!

		He looks back at the bedroom, then at the 
		stairs...quickly heading down the CREAKY steps, still 
		in shock.

		He grabs an overcoat from a hook by the front 
		door...about to step out when he looks down and 
		realizes...

		...hes barefoot.  He glances at a pair of rubber over-
		boots sitting by the door, slips them on, just about to 
		leave when...

		He hears the sound of a KEY TURNING in the door 
		lock...Jack looks at the door, not quite sure what to 
		do...

		The door opens...into the house, arms laden with 
		wrapped gifts, walk BIG ED and LORRAINE REYNOLDS (both 
		60s), Kates parents.  Big Eds wearing a ten gallon 
		hat and a suede overcoat.  Lorraine has a cigarette 
		dangling from her mouth.

					JACK
				(drawing on a 
				 memory)
			   Ed?  Lorraine?

		Big Ed hugs Jack as best he can with an armful of 
		gifts.

					BIG ED
			   Jack you ol bird dog.  
			   Merry Christmas to ya...

		Lorraine plants a big fat kiss on Jacks cheek.

					LORRAINE
			   Talk to him, Jack.  
			   Please.  One day a year 
			   away from the Ponderosa.  
			   I dont think thats too 
			   much to ask.

					BIG ED
			   I heard that.  This is 
			   who I am, woman!
				(a wink to Jack)
			   Tell her, Jack!  Youre 
			   the only one who gets me, 
			   for gods sake!

		Jack, still holding the door open, plotting his escape.

					LORRAINE
			   I need some egg nog...

					BIG ED
			   Course you do.  Hell, 
			   its almost 8 a.m.  
				(shouting upstairs)
			   Where are my two lil 
			   pardners?  Annie!  Josh!  
			   Giddy up, Bid Eds here!

					JACK
			   Excuse me.

		Jack dashes out the door.

					LORRAINE
			   Where are you going, 
			   Jack?
				(to Big Ed)
			   Wheres he going?

					BIG ED
			   Damned if I know...

		They start to remove their coats, when...

		The door flies back open...

					JACK
			   Wheres my car?!  Wheres 
			   my Ferrari!?

					BIG ED
			   What the hell are you 
			   talking about?
				(to Lorraine)
			   Whats he talking about?

					JACK
			   Look, can I just borrow 
			   your car?!  I promise 
			   itll be returned!

					BIG ED
			   The Caddy?  Why dont you 
			   take your own damn car!

					LORRAINE
			   Oh just let him borrow 
			   your precious Cadillac, 
			   for gods sake.

		Jack spots a set of keys hanging on a hook.

					BIG ED
			   Hes got a perfectly good 
			   mini-van sitting out 
			   there in the driveway!

		Jack grabs the keys off the hook...darts back outside...

    26	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

		Jack emerges from this charming, suburban two-story 
		house, some tasteful Christmas lights decorating a tree 
		in the center of the snow-covered lawn...

		He races to a blue Dodge mini-van sitting in the 
		driveway, a My Ferrari Is In The Shop sticker on the 
		rear bumper.  He climbs into the mini-van and peels out 
		of the driveway...

    27	INT. MINI-VAN - SECONDS LATER

		Jack sees a sign, George Washington Bridge - 3 miles...

    28	INT. MINI-VAN - MINUTES LATER

		Jack driving over the bridge.  A sigh of relief as he 
		passes under a sign for Manhattan.

    29	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - EARLY MORNING

		The mini-van pulls up near Jacks apartment building.  
		Jack, still wearing pajamas under the coat, leaps out, 
		running toward the grand entrance where Tony stands 
		sternly in front.

					JACK
			   Tony, thank god...

		Jack starts to walk past but Tony blocks the way.

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   Sorry, pal.  Entrance is 
			   for residents and guests 
			   only...

					JACK
			   What are you talking 
			   about?  Its me, Jack 
			   Campbell.  Penthouse C.  
			   I put you into commercial 
			   paper!

					TONY THE DOORMAN
				(not moving)
			   Uh-huh...

		Just then, Mrs. Peterson walks to the door with 
		her little DOG.  Tony opens the door for her...

					JACK
			   Elizabeth Peterson!

		The little dog starts BARKING ferociously at Jack.

					MRS. PETERSON
				(to Tony re: 
				 Jack, annoyed)
			   Who is this man?

		Tony shrugs his shoulders.

					JACK
			   You know me, Betty.  You 
			   do.  Jack Campbell.  
			   Were on the co-op board 
			   together.  We fought side 
			   by side for garbage 
			   disposals.  Every morning 
			   we exchange quasi-sexual 
			   witty banter.  Think...

		She looks at Jack with a raised eyebrow, the dog still 
		YAPPING.

					TONY THE DOORMAN
				(to Mrs. Peterson)
			   Should I call the cops?  
			   Im gonna call the 
			   cops...

		Jack pleads to her with his eyes.

					MRS. PETERSON
				(raising a hand 
				 to Tony)
			   No...

					JACK
				(a sigh of relief)
			   Thank you, Betty.  I know 
			   if I can just sleep this 
			   off, Ill be fine...

					MRS. PETERSON			
			   And sleep you shall.  
			   Noblesse oblige is not 
			   dead.  Not yet 
			   anyway...Come, lets get 
			   you some help.  Surely 
			   there must be a shelter 
			   somewhere in this city.

					JACK
			   A shelter?!  Im the 
			   richest guy in the 
			   building...Ive got twice 
			   the square footage you 
			   have!

		Mrs. Peterson shakes her head at him, a look of pity on 
		her face.

		Frustrated, Jack turns and runs back to the mini-van...

		CUT TO:

    30	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

		Jack pulls up across the street and gets out of the 
		van.  Running across the empty plaza toward the 
		building entrance...

    31	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

		Jack bursts through the door, approaching the lobby 
		desk where FRANK the security guard sits.

		Frank spots Jack and blocks his way.

					FRANK
			   Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold 
			   it right there...

					JACK
			   Frank.  Wheres Alan 
			   Mintz?  Is he here yet?

					FRANK
			   Mr. Mintz?
				(a knowing chuckle)
			   I dont think 
			   so...buildings closed 
			   pal.  Youll have to come 
			   back tomorrow.

					JACK
			   Look, I dont know whats 
			   going on here but I am 
			   Senior Vice President of 
			   this company.

					FRANK
			   I dont care who you 
			   are.  Its Christmas and 
			   like I told you the 
			   building is closed.

					JACK
			   Maybe youre not hearing 
			   me.  I am Jack 
			   Campbell...
				(approaching the 
				 building directory)
			   Right here.  Jack 
			   Campbell, President...

		And then he sees it...ALAN MINTZ - PRESIDENT, listed 
		plain as day on the building director...

		Jack looks at Frank, then back to the building 
		directory...

		A pitying look from Frank...Jack stands there, in 
		shock...

		CHAPTER FIVE - WHATS HAPPENING?

    32	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING, PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER

		...its desolate...

		Jack walks through the plaza like a zombie, his face 
		registering nothing.  He crosses the street, moving
		toward the mini-van...oblivious...when...

		SCREECH...a Ferrari 456M stops within inches of Jacks 
		torso...a VOICE from the car...

					VOICE (O.S.)
			   Hey!  Watch where youre 
			   walking!

		Jack turns...sees the DRIVER low in the seat...cant 
		quite make out the face...

					VOICE 
			   You almost dented my two 
			   hundred thousand dollar 
			   car!

		Jack...still stunned...looks at the car, very 
		familiar...the voice of the driver, also familiar...

					VOICE (CONTD)
			   Thats right!  My new 
			   cars worth more than 
			   your shitty house!

		A look of realization on Jacks face...

					VOICE (CONTD)
			   I feel like I really did 
			   win the lottery!

		...its Cash, and hes in Jacks car...

		Jack moves over to the passenger window in shock...a 
		smile from Cash...

					CASH
			   Miss me, Jack?

					JACK
			   Thats my car!  You stole 
			   my car!

					CASH
			   Its a callable asset 
			   seized in accordance with 
			   the acquisition by-laws 
			   of your alt-fate 
			   contract...

					JACK
			   What?!

					CASH
			   Basically, its my car 
			   now.  Get in.

		Cash reaches over and opens the door.  Jack 
		hesitates...

					CASH (CONTD)
			   Look, I dont make the 
			   rules, Jack.  This is how 
			   it works.  Get in.

		Cash gives him a reassuring look.  Jack gets in...

    33	INT. FERRARI - CONTINUOUS

		Jack closes the door...Cash joyfully drives off in a 
		burst of acceleration...Jack practically ends up in the 
		back seat...

					CASH
			   Might wanna fasten your 
			   seat belt, Jack...

					JACK
				(recovering)
			   What the hell is 
			   happening to me?!

		Jacks freaking out and Cash is enjoying every minute 
		of it.  Cash hands Jack a paper bag.  Jack starts 
		breathing into the bag.

					CASH
			   This kinda thing makes a 
			   lotta guys throw up.  
			   Seen it happen.  So if 
			   you get the urge, do it 
			   out the window.
				(with a taunting 
				 laugh)
			   I dont want you marring 
			   this exquisite leather 
			   interior...

		Cash looks over at Jack...hes really losing it, 
		sobbing into the bag...almost hyperventilating...Cash 
		smiles...

					CASH (CONTD)
			   Look, I dont know what 
			   youre getting so worked 
			   up about, you did 
			   this...you brought this 
			   on yourself.

					JACK
			   Brought what on myself?!  
			   I didnt do anything!

					CASH
			   No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive 
			   got everything I need, I 
			   dont have regrets, 
			   thats just not for me... 
			   sound familiar?

					JACK
			   You mean because you 
			   thought I was cocky Im 
			   now on a permanent acid 
			   trip?!!

		Cash gets a laugh out of Jacks overreaction...

					CASH
			   Everyone else in that 
			   store is a statue, they 
			   see their lives passing 
			   in front of their eyes, 
			   but not you.  Youre 
			   making a business deal...

					JACK
				(enraged)
			   Give me my goddamn life 
			   back!

					CASH
			   You?  What about me?  Im 
			   working hard for you 
			   here, Jack.  On Christmas 
			   too!  Now you did a good 
			   thing last night, 
			   intervening that way.  I 
			   was moved...

					JACK
				(interrupting)
			   Please.  Just tell me 
			   whats happening to me.  
			   In plain English.  None 
			   of that mumbo jumbo...

		Cash turns to Jack.

					CASH
			   Its a glimpse, Jacko.

					JACK
			   I glimpse?  A glimpse of 
			   what!?  What glimpse?!  
			   Glimpse!

					CASH
			   Look, eventually, 
			   everybody gets one...some 
			   of em take a couple 
			   seconds...
				(looking at Jack)
			   ...some of em take a lot 
			   longer...

					JACK
			   I asked you a direct 
			   question!  A glimpse of 
			   what?!

		A look from Cash.

					CASH
			   Figure it out.  You got 
			   plenty of time.

					JACK
			   How much time?!

					CASH
			   As long as it takes to 
			   figure it out.  Which, in 
			   your case, could be 
			   considerable.

					JACK
			   Look, I just want my life 
			   back.  Now whats it 
			   gonna take?  You wanna 
			   talk turkey?  Lets talk 
			   turkey!  How much 
			   money...?

		Cash looks at Jack, relishing the moment.  He flashes 
		Jack a smile.

					CASH
			   Do I look like I need 
			   your money.  It doesnt 
			   work like that and I 
			   cant tell you why.

					JACK
			   Why not?

					CASH
			   Because you got to figure 
			   it out for yourself.
				(beat)
			   Are you listening to me?

					JACK
			   Figure it out?  Figure 
			   what out?!

		Cash just stares at him...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats it?  Thats all I 
			   get?!  A glare?!

					CASH
			   Look Jack, in my 
			   experience the best way 
			   people deal with this is 
			   to just relax and breathe 
			   through it...let it come 
			   to you.

		Jack faces Cash, simmering...with frustration.

					JACK
			   Look, I dont have time 
			   for this right now.  Im 
			   in the middle of a 
			   deal...
					CASH
			   Oh youre working on a 
			   new deal now...did I
			   mention that?

					JACK
			   You know what?  Ive had 
			   it with you.  Ive had it 
			   with all of this shit...

		SCREECH...Cash slams on the brakes...practically 
		sending Jack through the windshield.

		Jack recovers, looks up...the car is parked right next 
		to the mini-van.

		Cash pulls out a small plastic bag, holding it out to 
		Jack...

					CASH
			   Here...

		Jack looks inside the bag, pulls out a BARBIE BICYCLE 
		BELL.  He looks at it curiously.

					JACK
			   Whats this, a signal?  
			   Will you come whenever I 
			   ring it?

					CASH
			   Do I look like I live in 
			   a bottle?

		Cash reaches across Jack and opens the door.

					JACK
				(lost)
			   But what do I do?

					CASH
			   Look Jack Im late.  Id 
			   love to help you out some 
			   more but I gotta go 
			   handle my business...
				(gesturing to 
				 the mini-van)
			   Happy trails.

		Jack looks out to the lonely street outside, then back 
		to Cash.

					JACK
			   Hey, you did this to me, 
			   you cant just leave me 
			   like this.

		Cash looks at Jack, the desperation on his face.

					CASH
			   Fine.  You want to know 
			   everything, Ill tell you 
			   everything.  But not 
			   here.  Lets get some 
			   air...

		Jacks still a little unsure...he sees Cash open the 
		driver side door...

					JACK
				(relieved)
			   Thanks, man...

		Jack gets out of the car...and before he can even turn 
		around, Cashs door SLAMS shut and the car takes off in 
		a blast of horsepower...

		Jack stands there gazing down the street, listening to 
		the sound of the Ferrari shifting gears, 
		disappearing...

		The wind whips up...shivering, Jack looks toward the 
		Lassiter Building, then to the plastic bag in his hand, 
		and finally to the mini-van.

    34	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE MORNING

		The blue mini-van snakes through the curved streets of 
		the neighborhood, almost all the houses decorated for 
		Christmas.

    35	INT. MINI-VAN - SAME TIME

		Jacks trying to find the house, a map unfolded on the 
		steering wheel and the cars registration in his 
		hand...

		He spots ARNIE BENDER, late 30s, carrying an empty 
		science kit box to the trash.  His wife, JEANNIE, also 
		late 30s, is getting in a Ford Taurus wagon, a bowl of 
		fruit in hand...

		Jack pulls up to the curb near Arnie, rolling down the 
		window.

					JACK
			   Excuse me.  Do you know 
			   where Merrison Street is?

		Arnie looks up and sees Jack in the van.

					ARNIE
				(turning to his wife)
			   Jeannie!  I found Jack!

    36	INT. BENDER HOUSE, DEN - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack follows Arnie into the den of this garishly 
		decorated suburban home, Arnies arm around his 
		shoulder.

					ARNIE
			   You look terrible...

		Jack takes in the decor  its a male leisure time 
		fantasy  old pinball machine, wide screen TV, dart 
		board, and kitschy 50s style bamboo bar...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Truth is I expected you.  
			   Kate called before and 
			   asked if I knew where you 
			   were.

		Arnie notices Jacks fascination with the room...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   I know, I moved the 
			   Barca-lounger into the 
			   corner.  Its throwin 
			   everybody off.  What do 
			   you think?

					JACK
				(with a nod)
			   Great room...

		A satisfied smile from Arnie, Jacks approval means 
		something to him.

					ARNIE
			   You and me, buddy.  We 
			   know how to live...

		Arnie shepherds Jack onto a bar stool and pours a drink 
		out of a bamboo bottle holder.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   So Jack, you okay?

		Jack doesnt respond, his eyes drawn to a softball team 
		photo on the bar...Jack and Arnie kissing a huge trophy 
		with the caption, Plainfield, N.J. Softball League 
		Champs, 1994.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   I mean you leave the 
			   house on Christmas 
			   morning, you dont tell 
			   anyone where youre 
			   going...

		Jack looks over from the photo to Arnie...

					JACK
			   Were friends, arent we?

					ARNIE
			   Maybe I dont say it 
			   enough but you moving in 
			   next door to me...

		Arnie makes a fist and gestures to his heart.  Jack 
		nods.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Talk to me...

		A moment of decision for Jack as Arnie stands there, 
		open eyed, ready to listen.

					JACK
			   Im having kind of a bad 
			   day.

					ARNIE
				(nodding)
			   I read somewhere that the 
			   suicide rate doubles 
			   during the holidays...

		A raised eyebrow from Jack.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(to himself)
			   What am I saying?  You 
			   dont need to hear 
			   that...
				(back to Jack)
			   All I meant was a lot of 
			   people have a hard time 
			   dealing with all the 
			   forced reverie, thats 
			   all.  Is that you?

					JACK
			   Is it...?

					ARNIE
			   Trouble at work?

					JACK
			   I dont think so.

					ARNIE
			   Its not Kate, is it?

		Jack pauses at the mention of Kate.  Arnies eyes 
		widen...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(proudly)
			   You see, its like were 
			   in each others heads...

					JACK
			   Kates my wife...

		Jack looks at Arnie as if hes seeking confirmation.

					ARNIE
				(a playful smile) 
			   Just keep saying it, 
			   Jack, like a mantra.

		Arnie comes out from behind the bar, taking Jack by the 
		arm.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Cmon, I better walk ya 
			   home.  Shes mad enough 
			   as it is, right...?

    37	EXT. ARNIES YARD - SECONDS LATER

		Arnie walks Jack through his backyard...

					ARNIE
			   Look, you fit the profile 
			   exactly.  Thirties, 
			   house, kids, financial 
			   responsibilities.  You 
			   start thinking...this 
			   isnt the life I dreamt 
			   about.  Wheres the 
			   romance, wheres the joie 
			   de vivre?  Suddenly, 
			   every lingerie ad in the 
			   Newark Star Ledger 
			   represents a life you 
			   cant have...

					JACK
				(thinking, then...)
			   Its just two kids, 
			   right?

		A chuckle from Arnie.

					ARNIE
			   You made a choice, Jack, 
			   a promise to your wife. 
			   Maybe sometimes it seems 
			   like you gave up the 
			   world, but look what you 
			   got...

		They arrive at...the backyard of the Campbell house... 
		cluttered with a swing set, a dog run with chewed up 
		lawn, and a wooden sun deck in the process of being 
		built...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Four bedrooms, two and a 
			   half baths, and a 
			   partially finished 
			   basement...

		Jack trips over a wayward BIG WHEEL.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(shaking his head)
			   Kids...

		Arnie leads Jack toward the house.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Okay look, you probably 
			   dont want to hear this 
			   right now but remember
			   what you told me last 
			   summer when I almost had 
			   that thing with Arnie 
			   Jr.s speech therapist.

		A blank stare from Jack as they arrive at the sliding 
		glass door...Arnie faces Jack squarely, grabbing his 
		shoulders and looking him in the eye.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Dont screw up the best 
			   thing in your life just 
			   because youre a little 
			   unsure about who you 
			   are.  Okay?

		Arnie gives Jack a comforting smie...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   God, it feels so good to 
			   finally give something 
			   back to you...

		Arnie turns Jack toward the door and slides it open.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Im gonna hug you now...

		Arnie gives Jack a gentle hug...then gives him a little 
		push toward the door...

    38	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, DEN - CONTINUOUS

		Jack steps inside.  He turns back to the door but 
		Arnies gone.

		Then, Kate enters the room, holding a portable phone...

					KATE
				(into phone)
			   Hold on a second...

		She cups the receiver.  Jack looks at her, shes 
		dressed now, nothing fancy but she looks great.

					JACK
			   You cut your hair...

		A curious look from Kate.

					KATE
			   Ten years ago...

		Kate just stands there looking at Jack, giving away 
		nothing.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Are you okay?

					JACK
			   Yeah...fine.

		She gives him a resolute nod, then...

					KATE
				(into phone)
			   Never mind, he just 
			   walked in...

		Jack grimaces as she resolutely hangs up the phone then 
		stares him down angrily.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Do you have any idea what 
			   you put us through 
			   today?!  You walk out of 
			   here at 7:30 in the 
			   morning, dont tell me 
			   where youre going, or 
			   even that youre going, 
			   and I dont see you til 
			   hours later.  I had state 
			   troopers looking for 
			   you!  I called 
			   hospitals...
				(pointing at 
				 the phone)
			   ...I was just on the 
			   phone with the morgue 
			   for gods sake!

		Jack watches her vent, the frustration on his face 
		building.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   What kind of man leaves 
			   his family on Christmas 
			   morning without a word 
			   about where hes going?

		Jacks almost to a breaking po	INT.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   What kind of man does 
			   that!?

					JACK
				(jumping in)
			   I dont know!  Please 
			   stop yelling at me!

		She looks at him curiously.

					KATE
			   Where were you?

					JACK
			   I was in the city.

					KATE
			   The city?  New York 
			   City?  Why?

					JACK
			   Because thats where I 
			   live.

					KATE
			   Jack...dont even 
			   start...

					JACK
			   Look, you dont 
			   understand.  I woke up 
			   here...and this is very 
			   strange ...this is not my 
			   house...

		A raised eyebrow from Kate.  Jack moves around the 
		room...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(pointing upstairs)
			   Im not Dad....  Kate, 
			   youre not my wife...

		Kate looks him over, assessing, then...

					KATE
			   You know what, Jack?  
			   Its not funny this 
			   time.  Im really angry.

		She stares him down, expecting an answer.  But he has 
		no answer.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(loudly)
			   Jack!

		Jack takes the bell out of the plastic bag that Cash 
		gave him, holds it up in front of her and starts 
		RINGING it furiously.

		Then...Annie rides into the room on her new bike.

					ANNIE
				(re: bell)
			   Whats that?

		Jack watches as she pedals over, reaches into his hand 
		and takes the bicycle bell...

					ANNIE (CONTD)
				(examining the bell)
			   I like this...
				(jumping up and 
				 giving hima peck 
				 on the cheek)
			   ...thanks, Dad!

		Annie rides excitedly out of the room on her bike.

		Leaving Jack and Kate alone again...

					KATE
			   You missed the whole 
			   thing, Jack.  The 
			   pancakes, the 
			   presents...you spent six 
			   hours putting that bike 
			   together and you didnt 
			   even get to see the look 
			   on Annies face when she 
			   opened it...

		Jack sees the disappointment on her face...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   You missed Christmas, 
			   Jack.

		Jack looks down, almost ashamed...he relents, giving in 
		to the moment...

					JACK
			   Im...Im sorry.

		Kate looks at him.  He seems sincere enough...

					KATE
			   Look, we dont have time 
			   for this right now, well 
			   talk about it later.  Now 
			   get dressed...
				(pointing to his 
				 outfit)
			   Youre not wearing that 
			   to the Thompsons party.  
			   I dont care how 
			   hilarious you think it 
			   is...

					JACK
			   Party?  Oh no, I cant go 
			   to a party...

					KATE
			   You look forward to this 
			   party all year.  Whats 
			   with you today?

					JACK
			   Trust me on this Kate.  I 
			   really dont think going 
			   to a party is the right 
			   move for me at the 
			   present time.

		Kate looks at him a moment, then shakes her head.

					KATE
			   Fine.  Do whatever you 
			   want.

		She picks up the phone, starts dialing...

					JACK
			   What are you doing?

					KATE
			   Telling my mother she 
			   doesnt have to stay with 
			   the kids.

					JACK
			   Why not?

					KATE
			   Because youll be here.

		Kate just looks at him.

					JACK
			   Ill be ready in ten 
			   minutes.

		He walks past her...toward a hallway door, Kate 
		watching him...

		He opens the door...its a closet.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Christ...
				(turning around)
			   Where the hell is the 
			   bathroom?

					KATE
			   Funny, Jack.  Im 
			   laughing on the inside.

    39	INT. BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

		The light comes on...

		Jack walks in, looks in the mirror, determined to 
		collect himself...but somethings not right...

		He glances around...the bathroom is small and its 
		cluttered with Kates razors, loofah, skin creams...

		...none of this stuff is his...

		...he looks in the mirror again, his face revealing a 
		forlorn sense of displacement...

		...he stares at himself until...he starts to lose it... 
		anger, confusion...sadness...finally, he begins breaking down...

		After a moment, he turns on the water, rinsing his 
		face...

    40	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, BEDROOM CLOSET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack at the closet door, looking at a row of Hagar 
		slacks, Docker sport coats and imitation leather 
		shoes...

		He reaches in and touches the fabric on one of the 
		sport coats.

					JACK
			   This is just...
				(searching for 
				 the words)
			   ...this is sub-par...

		Annie appears at the bedroom door, watching Jack at the 
		closet.

		He turns...sees Annie watching him...a look 
		exchanged... then, Annie runs away...

		Jack turns back to the closet and mournfully takes a 
		pair of the slacks...

    41	EXT. THOMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT

		Jack and Kate, a casserole dish in her hand, walk up 
		the path to this tacky but large house, its outside 
		decorated with the most garish display of Christmas 
		decorations this side of Pasaic.

		Kate RINGS the doorbell...

		EVELYN THOMPSON, 30s, wearing a dress thats a bit too 
		tight and a bit too low cut, opens the door...

					EVELYN
			   Kate!  Jack!
				(turning around, 
				 to guests)
			   Everybody, Jack and Kate 
			   are here!

		Jack looks right past her...to the house filled with 50 
		GUESTS.

		A loud WHOOP from the guests...Jack has the look of a 
		condemned man on his face as he follows Kate inside...

    41A	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

		As Kate heads into the living room, Evelyn takes Jacks 
		arm...

					EVELYN
				(suggestively)
			   Like the dress...?

					JACK
				(glancing at it)
				 Its lovely...

					EVELYN
				(a satisfied smile)
			   I thought I saw you 
			   notice it at the kids 
			   recital.

		Jack shoots her a confused look...then walks in, trying 
		to catch up with Kate...

    42	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

		The party is in full swing, Christmas music in the 
		b.g., GUESTS talking, laughing, drinking egg nog...

		Jacks eyes dart around the room...its large, neater 
		than his and Kates house but still very lived in...The 
		Thompson KIDS run in and out of the room, playing with 
		new toys... nobody is wearing or eating anything 
		imported from Europe, but everyones having a good 
		time...

		...everyone except for Jack, standing with Arnie and 
		THE GUYS, having his ear chewed off by NICK CARELLI, a 
		walking advertisement for Levis Cotton Dockers...

					NICK
			   Did you see Van Horn last 
			   night?  This kids gonna 
			   single-handedly save 
			   basketball in the state 
			   of New Jersey...

					JACK
			   The Nets?  Youre kidding, 
			   right...?

		Nick looks at him in disbelief.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(recovering)
			   Well...theyre certainly 
			   due.

		BILL KRAMER, a huge pile of fried chicken wings on his 
		plate, tugs at Jacks shirt.

					BILL KRAMER
			   So tomorrows the big 
			   day, Jackie...

					JACK
			   Okay...why?

					BILL KRAMER
			   Triple bypass.  Im going 
			   under the knife.  I told 
			   you, didnt I?

					JACK
			   Triple bypass?
				(pointing to his 
				 plate)
			   You really think you 
			   should be eating all 
			   that?

					BILL KRAMER
			   Why not?  I figure Im 
			   going in for a cleaning 
			   tomorrow, I might as well 
			   load up on the fried 
			   stuff tonight...

					ARNIE
			   Good thinking, Bill.  
			   Have another drink.
				(whispering to Jack)
			   Hell be lucky if he 
			   lives through the 
			   night...

		Nick reaches into his pocket and pulls out a packet of 
		Dutch Masters cigars.  He shows them to Jack, Jack nods 
		politely.  Nick eagerly hands him one...

		Nick lights Jacks cigar, then his own...enjoying that 
		first puff...smiling at Jack...Jack dutifully takes a 
		puff of the cigar...nods back at Nick...but its an 
		effort...

		Evelyn Thompson approaches, a tray of MUSHROOM PUFFS in 
		hand...

					EVELYN
				(holding out a 
				 puff to Jack)
			   Finger food...?

					JACK
			   I dont think so, thank 
			   you...

					EVELYN
				(suggestively)
			   Cmon, as soon as I put 
			   them down, youre gonna 
			   grab a couple...you 
			   always do...

		Kate sees Evelyn and Jack from her position on the 
		other side of the room...Kate watches as...

		Evelyn holds the puff up to Jacks mouth, slowly 
		putting it near his lips...

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			   Let me.  Theyll melt in 
			   your mouth...

		He instinctively opens his mouth as Evelyn pushes the 
		treat inside...

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			   Good?

		On Jacks face...if freezer burn were a facial 
		expression, this would be it...

					JACK
				(forcing a smile) 
			   Theyre great!  Thank 
			   you!

		...Evelyn licks her fingers suggestively then hands 
		Jack the entire tray with a sexy smile...

		A raised eyebrow from Kate, still watching...

					EVELYN
			   Mushroom puffs arent the 
			   only thing I do well...

					JACK
			   Well do whatever it is 
			   you do well, and 
			   just...just do it.  
			   Excuse me...

		Evelyn nods as Jack walks toward the staircase...

		Kate follows Jack with her eyes as he climbs the 
		stairs...

    43	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE, DEN - NIGHT

		Jack is sitting on the arm of a couch filled with 
		guests coats, talking on a FOOTBALL SHAPED 
		telephone...the tray of mushroom puffs on the table...

					JACK
				(loudly, into phone)
			   ...what do you mean he 
			   wont come to the phone?!
				(standing, indignant)
			   Do you realize how much 
			   money Ive made for that 
			   sonuvabitch in the last 
			   eight years?!

		Click.  A dial tone.  Jack slams the phone down...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Damnit!

		He slams the phone again...and again...and again...

					KATE (O.S.)
			   Jack...?

		Jack turns, sees Kate standing in the doorway, watching 
		him take his frustrations out on the phone, concern on 
		her face.

					KATE
			   Are you sure youre 
			   okay...?

		A forced smile from Jack.

					JACK
			   Yes, Im fine.  Its just 
			   this god awful football 
			   phone!  Who has a phone 
			   like this anyway?!

					KATE
				(doubtful)  
			   Uh huh...

		Kate notices the tray of mushroom puffs on the table.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   You must really love 
			   Evelyns mushroom puffs, 
			   huh?
				(with a wink)
			   You know theyre not 
			   real...

		She turns and leaves...Jack looks at her, confused...

    44	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack comes down the stairs, a lost look in his eyes.  
		He looks across the room and sees...

		Kate, with a group of GUESTS, looking great in her 
		jeans and white blouse, the center of attention.

		Jack passes through the guests, people waving to him, 
		slapping him on the back as he approaches Kate...

		He catches Kates eye...she gives him a subtle smile.

					KATE
				(to guests)
			   ...then she asks me to 
			   put this sweater on.  
			   What choice do I have, 
			   right?

		Jack watches as Kate charms the crowd...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   But as Im slipping it on 
			   I notice shes misspelled 
			   the word lawyers.
				(laughing)
			   I had to go through the 
			   entire day wearing a hand 
			   embroidered sweater that 
			   said, Non-Profit Layers 
			   Do It For Free.

		The guests laugh again.  Even Jack finds himself 
		laughing, until...

					JACK
				(to Kate, off-hand)
			   So youre a lawyer...?

		A chuckle from the group.  Kates confused.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   A non-profit lawyer...

		People are starting to LAUGH.

					KATE
				(a little embarrassed)
			   Jack...

					JACK
			   Pro bono.  You dont get 
			   paid at all.  Nobody 
			   makes a dime.  Well, 
			   bravo...

		Blank stares from everyone, including Kate...

		CUT TO:

    45	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, FOYER - LATE NIGHT

		Kate and Jack walk in the front door...the dog greets 
		them happily, jumping up on Jack, a weary look on his 
		face.

					KATE
			   I better go wake my
			   mother...

		Kate grabs a leash off a hook and hands it to Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Here you go...

					JACK
			   Youre kidding me...

					KATE
			   Shes your dog, Jack.

					JACK
			   No, shes not.

					KATE
			   Fine, shes the kids 
			   dog.  Lets go wake Josh, 
			   see if he wants to walk 
			   her.

					JACK
			   But its twenty degrees 
			   outside...

					KATE
				(sympathetic)
			   Youre having a bad day, 
			   Ill go with 
			   you...actually, theres 
			   no way in hell youre 
			   gettin me back out 
			   there...

		Jack looks at the dogs face.  Lucy couldnt be more 
		excited.  Finally, Jack shakes his head and takes the 
		leash.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(heading up the 
				 stairs)
			   Make sure you reward her 
			   verbally when she does a 
			   number two...

		CUT TO:

    46	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE NIGHT

		The sound of CRICKETS.

		Jack, wearing a down jacket, is being dragged down the 
		street by Lucy, his breath condensing in the cold 
		winter air.  The dog sniffs at a hydrant and a couple 
		of garbage cans, but isnt doing her business.

					JACK
			   Figure it out...Im s
			   crewed...dont have to 
			   be a genius to figure 
			   that out...

		The dog stops, sniffing at a manicured lawn...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Lucy)
			   Its as good a place as 
			   any...

		But the dog keeps moving, pulling Jack with her.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   ...but obviously not up 
			   to your high standards...
				(to himself)
			   Okay...he said youre 
			   working on a new deal 
			   now...fine, youve done a 
			   thousand deals, whats 
			   the first thing you do?

		Lucys sniffing around someones Christmas display but 
		Jacks too wrapped up in his thought process to notice.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Triage.  Its your 
			   signature.  You survey 
			   the damage, find out 
			   everything you can, you 
			   probe, leave nothing to 
			   chance.  Im just gonna 
			   have to go detective.  
			   How did you get 
			   Mentadent?  You learned 
			   everything there was to 
			   know about toothpaste and 
			   then you pounced...

		Jack narrows his eyes, thinking about that deal...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats our play here...

		Resolute, Jack turns to the dog.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   If you could take a dump 
			   some time in this 
			   century, then we could go 
			   home where its warm...

		Jack looks around at the unfamiliar houses...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   That is if I can even 
			   remember how to get 
			   home...
				(to Lucy)
			   You remember, dont you 
			   girl?

		But the dog ignores him, dragging Jack along...

    47	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Kate is in bed, fast asleep.

		Jack walks into the room, his face still red from the 
		cold outside.  He looks over at Kate, sleeping happily.

		He takes off his shirt and khakis, laying them neatly 
		on the chair.  He looks over at the pair of flannel 
		pajamas folded on the dresser.  He shakes his head, 
		resigned, then dons the pajamas and climbs into bed...

    48	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

		Morning light streams into the room.  The clock reads, 
		7:14.

		Jack opens his eyes  a burst of light hitting them 
		from the window...like the morning light in his 
		Manhattan loft...

		He reaches across the bed...its empty...

		A smile of hope from Jack as he puts his head back on 
		the pillow...maybe it was only a day...Then...

		The sound of a baby CRYING from the next room...A 
		pained look on Jacks face as he realizes hes still in 
		Jersey.

		Now the baby is WAILING...Jack lies still a moment, 
		hoping itll stop...it doesnt.  Then, he hears the 
		sound of the SHOWER TURN ON in the bathroom.

		He gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom...

    49	INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

		The shower is running, a tape player is BLASTING Beast 
		of Burden.  Kate is in the shower SINGING LOUDLY with 
		the song...

					JACK
			   Hello?

		No answer...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(louder, over music)
			   Hello!

					KATE
				(singing)
			   ...my feet are hurtin...

					JACK
				(yelling)
			   HEY!

		Finally, the music is turned down and Kate pulls the 
		shower curtain open...

		Jack sees her naked body...raises an eyebrow...thats 
		something hes missed...then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Uh...that babys crying...

					KATE
				(unimpressed)
			   And...?

		...her expression makes Jack turn his gaze from her 
		naked body.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Dont give me that look, 
			   Jack, Tuesdays your day 
			   and you know it.  And try 
			   to get Josh to day care 
			   on time, okay?  He missed 
			   the macaroni painting 
			   last week...

		She closes the curtain and turns the radio back up.

		CUT TO:

    50	INT. JOSHS ROOM - MORNING

		Annies watching from a baby-size Laz-E-Boy lounger 
		as...

		Jack, in a robe, stands in front of a changing table, 
		Josh laying happily on his back, playing with a set of 
		plastic keys.

		Jack takes a fresh Huggies diaper and puts it next to 
		the baby.  He surveys Josh, scratching his chin and 
		rubbing his hands like Indiana Jones.  Josh playfully 
		grabs at Jacks nose.

		He looks over to Annie.  Shes still staring at him 
		like hes a Martian.  He looks at the instructions on 
		the box of Huggies.

					JACK
			   Pull tape...

		Jack searches the diaper for the tabs of tape, then 
		gingerly pulls them apart, releasing the diaper from 
		the babys bottom, and seeing whats inside.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Holy mother of god!

		Jack holds the diaper out away from him, searching for 
		a place to put it.  Annie points to a Diaper Genie by 
		the dresser.

		Jack throws the diaper in, then quickly replaces the 
		lid.  Annie points to the container of Baby Wipes.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   You must be kidding...

		Annie stares at him a beat.  Then...

					ANNIE
			   Youre not really our 
			   dad, are you?

		Jack turns to her.  Shes looking back at him with 
		complete earnestness.  They stare at each other another 
		moment.  Then...

					JACK
			   No, Im not.

		A look of curiosity from Annie.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   I work on Wall Street, 
			   you know with the big 
			   buildings...?

		No response from Annie...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   I live in an apartment 
			   house with a doorman, I 
			   can buy just about 
			   anything I want...

		Annie nods at Jack, still suspicious.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   This isnt my real life.  
			   Its just a glimpse...

					ANNIE
			   Wheres my real dad?

					JACK
			   I dont know...

		A concerned look on Annies face, Jacks petrified that 
		shes about to cry.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   But dont worry, he loves 
			   you and Im sure hell be 
			   back very soon...
				(to himself)
			   ...very, very soon...

		Annie approaches Jack, climbing up on a little chair 
		and tugging firmly at his hair.

					ANNIE
			   They did a pretty good 
			   job.

					JACK
			   Who did?

					ANNIE
			   The aliens...In the 
			   mother ship.  You look 
			   just like him.

					JACK
			   Uhh...thanks...slightly 
			   better looking though, 
			   right?

		Annies now stone faced, trying to decide about Jack.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Youre not going to start 
			   crying, are you?  Because 
			   Im not really sure I 
			   could deal with that 
			   right now.

		She thinks about it for a moment.

					ANNIE
			   Do you like kids?

					JACK
			   On a case by case 
			   basis...

					ANNIE
			   You know how to make 
			   chocolate milk?

					JACK
			   I think I could figure it 
			   out.

					ANNIE
			   You promise not to kidnap 
			   me and my brother and 
			   implant stuff in our brains?

					JACK
			   Sure.

		Beat.  Then...a smile from Annie.

					ANNIE
			   Welcome to earth.

    51	INT. MINI-VAN - MORNING

		Jacks driving, Annie buckled in the front seat...

		Josh, in the baby seat, looks like he was dressed by 
		monkeys  his shirt buttons are off by one, and theyre 
		clearly supposed to be in the back.

					ANNIE
			   Stop here...

		Jack stops the van outside the Playland Day Care 
		Center.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   This is day care.  Its 
			   where babies go when 
			   their parents are at 
			   work.

					JACK
			   Check...

		He gets out of the van...

    52	EXT. MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS

		...he pulls Josh out and walks quickly toward the 
		building, holding the baby away from his body.

		He gets to the door and holds Josh out to the DAY CARE 
		LADY.  She stares at Joshs outfit...

					JACK
			   Do I get a receipt or 
			   something...?

		The woman looks at Jack like hes crazy.

    53	EXT. YMCA - A FEW MINUTES LATER

		The mini-van pulls up to the drop-off point at this 
		suburban New Jersey Y.  Annie opens the door.

					ANNIE
			   I have winter camp until 
			   four, then ballet until 
			   five thirty.

					JACK
			   Five thirty.  Okay.

					ANNIE
			   Try not to be late 
			   because kids dont like 
			   to be the last one picked 
			   up.

					JACK
			   Got it.  Good tip.

					ANNIE
			   Bye...

		CHAPTER SEVEN - A TIRE SALESMAN

		Jack watches her as she runs toward the building.  
		Then...

					JACK
				(calling out window)
			   Hey!  Annie!

		Annie turns back toward him.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Where do I go now?

					ANNIE
			   Big Eds.

					JACK
			   Big Eds?  Big Eds 
			   Tires?
				(suspicious)
			   Why...?

					ANNIE
			   Thats where you work.

		A beat.  Then...

					JACK
			   You mean I sell tires...

		She shrugs her shoulders and walks off.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats what I do.  Im a 
			   tire salesman...

		CUT TO:

    54	INT. MINI-VAN - A LITTLE LATER

		Jacks driving down a busy commercial street when he 
		spots something a hundred yards down the road...

					JACK
			   Good Lord...

		...a huge, three-story-tall plastic likeness of Big Ed 
		Reynolds, ten gallon hat, lassoing a tire...

    55	EXT. BIG EDS TIRES - MOMENTS LATER

		Jack approaches Big Eds from the parking lot...slowly, 
		taking it all in...

		Its like a Pep Boys with a Texas theme.  A big retail 
		store for tires and auto parts, and a repair bay for 
		everything from alignments to brake jobs...

		Jack walks to the tire bay where HECTOR, 40s, a 
		Guatemalan mechanic in grease-stained coveralls, stands 
		with TOMMY the salesman.

					TOMMY
			   Hey Jack, you happen to 
			   know the stock number on 
			   those new Michelin X1's?

					JACK
			   Uh...lemme get back to 
			   you on that one...
				(looking at his 
				 name tag)
			   Tommy...

					HECTOR
				(to Tommy)
			   Thomas, why you bother 
			   Jack about that.  Look it 
			   up yourself...
				(to Jack)
			   Okay Jack, we talk 
			   later...

		Jack nods amiably then continues into the store...

    56	INT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		Jack walks in...looks around...the store is teeming 
		with activity, a post-holiday sale in progress...

		Big Ed, in his signature ten gallon hat, sees Jack from 
		behind the counter...

					BIG ED
			   Jack my boy!  You are 
			   looking mighty worse for 
			   the wear...Hey, guess who
			   I played bridge with two 
			   nights ago...?

		Jack stares blankly at Big Ed...

					BIG ED (CONTD) 
			   Hell, youll never 
			   guess.  One Sydney 
			   Potter.  Thats Sydney 
			   Potter, Chief Executive 
			   Officer of BuyRite 
			   Transport.  Only the 
			   third largest trucking 
			   company in the state.  I 
			   even let the sonuvabitch 
			   win, which wasnt easy 
			   because the guys been 
			   bashed in the head by 
			   Teamsters so many times 
			   his brains like 
			   porridge.  Anyhoo, hes 
			   looking for a new parts 
			   supplier... we can handle 
			   that kind of volume, 
			   right?

		Jack considers this briefly.

					JACK
			   Im gonna have to get 
			   back to you on that...Ed.

		Big Ed makes a gun gesture with his forefinger, winking 
		at Jack, then turns back to the activity at the counter 
		as...

		Jack spots KENNY, a very young sales associate, walking 
		by.  He reaches out and taps Kenny on the shoulder.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Do I have a private 
			   office somewhere in the 
			   building?

					KENNY
			   Uh...sure Jack...
				(nervously pointing)
			   Right back there...

					JACK
			   Thank you.

		Jack walks into the office with his name on the door...

    57	INT. JACKS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Theres no Stairmaster here, no leather sofa or 
		bar...its small, cramped and cluttered, the walls 
		littered with tire inventory and price lists...

		Jack takes a slow, sad lap around the office.

		He makes it to the small wooden desk at the far end of 
		the room and sits down behind it...

		On the desk are photos of Jack, Kate and the kids, a 
		plastic Michelin Man model, a tire-themed day calendar 
		and a small plastic figurine of a BOWLER, the word, 
		Bowlers Do It In An Alley embossed on its base...

		He surveys the desktop briefly, then opens the top 
		drawer, finding a personal checkbook and looking 
		inside...

		He sees the bottom line and winces, then puts it 
		back...

		Jack picks up the Bowlers Do It In An Alley figurine 
		and gives it a good look...

					JACK
			   Bowlers do it in an 
			   alley?...Non profit 
			   lawyers do it for free... 
			   what is it with these 
			   people?  Dont they 
			   realize this refers to 
			   sex?

		He replaces the figurine then opens the bottom drawer 
		where he spots a bottle of Glenfiddich.  He lifts it 
		out...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   At least you splurged on 
			   some decent scotch...

		He takes a paper cup and pours himself a shot.  He 
		drinks it down in one gulp and then crumples up the 
		cup, throwing it toward the NETS basketball 
		hoop/garbage can near the door.

		He misses...

		He looks more closely at the photographs...most are 
		family photos, a happy Jack with Kate, with Annie at 
		the pony rides, at Joshs birth...in every one of them, 
		Jack is smiling...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Jack in 
				 the photo)
			   What are you smiling 
			   about...?

		He turns his head...spots a small plaque on the wall 
		behind him.  It reads, Jack Campbell - E.F. Hutton #1 
		Junior Sales Associate, 1988.  Jack raises an 
		eyebrow...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Number one...not bad.

		He grabs it off the wall and looks at it more 
		carefully...

					JACK (CONTD)

			   1988...?  I was in London 
			   in 1988...

		Jacks jarred into reality...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Jack in the photo)
			   You never went to London...
				(picking up the photo)
			   ...you never got on that 
			   plane...

		He stays there a moment...in shock.  Then...

		The P.A. system comes to life...

					ESTELLE
				(over P.A.)
			   Jack to mag 
			   wheels...Jack, youre 
			   needed in mag wheels, 
			   customer waiting!

		CUT TO:

    58	INT. BIG EDS TIRES, MAIN FLOOR - MINUTES LATER

		Kenny leading Jack toward the Mag Wheels section.

					JACK
			   ...I was the number one 
			   junior sales associate at 
			   E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did 
			   you know that?

					KENNY
			   No, I didnt...thats 
			   great.

					JACK
			   Thats the kind of thing 
			   you can really build 
			   on...

					KENNY
			   Uh huh...

					JACK
			   I mean sales has always 
			   been a feeder for M and 
			   A, always...

		They approach Mag Wheels where TOMMY, a slick sales 
		associate, stands with a CUSTOMER looking at the 
		displays...

					KENNY
			   Here we are, mag wheels...
				(a little concerned)
			   Hey Jack, are you sure 
			   youre okay?

					JACK
			   Well, Im just a little 
			   confused right now about 
			   why I work here...

		Kenny looks at him nervously.

					KENNY
			   Uh...I just started here 
			   last Tuesday.

		Jack nods compassionately.  Kenny takes off leaving 
		Jack alone with his thoughts as Tommy approaches with 
		the customer.

					TOMMY
				(to the customer)
			   So youre all set on the 
			   Skip Shift eliminator and 
			   the Brembo rotors.  
			   Jacks our point man on 
			   alloy wheels...

					JACK
				(turning to Tommy)
			   Do you know why do I work 
			   here...?

					TOMMY
			   Because youre the best 
			   damn tire guy in the 
			   state of New Jersey...
				(proudly, to the 
				 customer)
			   Jack taught me everything 
			   I know about the 
			   business...

		The customer nods, impressed.

					JACK
			   I taught you the business?

		Another nod to the customer.

					TOMMY
			   And hes a crack-up.

					JACK
			   Everything I taught you.  
			   I want to hear it all, 
			   right now.

		Tommys confused.

					CUSTOMER
			   Hey, Im ready to buy 
			   here...

					JACK
				(to the customer)
			   What do you want?

					CUSTOMER
			   I want some alloy wheels.

		Jack grabs one of the alloy rims off the shelf, holding 
		it out to the customer.

					JACK
			   Here.  These are great.  
			   Youll need four.

		The customer takes the wheel from Jack, looks at it 
		confused...

					CUSTOMER
			   But I dont like these...

					JACK
			   Hey, you heard the guy, 
			   Im the best damn tire 
			   guy in the state of New 
			   Jersey.
				(turning to Tommy)
			   Everything.

					TOMMY
			   Okay...
				(hesitating)
			   Rule number one, the 
			   customer is always 
			   right...

		A satisfied smirk from the customer.

    59	INT. BIG EDS TIRES, JACKS OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

		Jack is behind his desk, his tie loosened, on the 
		phone...

					JACK
				(into phone)
			   ...I have no idea what 
			   our inventory level is, 
			   thats why Im asking 
			   you...

		A KNOCK at the door...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Look, just send us what 
			   you sent us last month, 
			   okay...?  And keep doing 
			   that until further 
			   notice...

		He hangs up the phone as the door opens.  Big Ed sticks 
		his head in...

					BIG ED
			   Got a minute, Jack?

					JACK
			   Ive got all the time in 
			   the world...

		Big Ed walks in, followed by SYDNEY POTTER, 60s, a 
		tough looking man...

					BIG ED
			   Jack, meet Sydney Potter, 
			   BuyRite Transport, one of 
			   Jerseys top 
			   businessmen...

		Potter extends a hand, Jack rises from his chair, 
		trying to place the name.  Then...

					JACK
			   ...and a helluva bridge 
			   player.  Eds told me a 
			   lot about you...

		They shake hands.  Potter nods his head at Jack, 
		immediately impressed.  Big Ed is beaming.

					POTTER
				(in a heavy Jersey 
				 accent)
			   Lucky in cards, lucky in 
			   business, lucky in love.  
			   My cup runneth over...
				(to Big Ed)
			   Hes a nice looking 
			   boy...

					BIG ED
			   My daughters no slouch 
			   either...

		A smile from Potter, then a serious look.

					POTTER
			   Lets cut to the chase, 
			   Jack.  Big Ed tells me 
			   youre the grease that 
			   makes the wheels turn 
			   around here.  I need a 
			   new parts supplier for my 
			   fleet.  You seem to have 
			   the parts.  That we 
			   know.  What we dont know 
			   is why the hell I should 
			   buy them from you.

		Potter stares Jack down.  But Jacks not about to be 
		intimidated by him.  He pauses, matching Potters 
		stare.  Then...

					JACK
			   I have no idea...

		A surprised look from Potter.  An anxious laugh from 
		Big Ed.

					BIG ED
				(nervous)
			   Cmon Jack...

					JACK
				(to Potter)
			   I mean it.  From what I 
			   can tell, were a mom and 
			   pop operation, were 
			   already over-extended in 
			   sales, and any price 
			   advantage we could offer 
			   would easily be matched 
			   by a larger supplier...

		Jack continues to stare down Potter.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   So like I said, I dont 
			   have any idea why you 
			   should buy your parts 
			   from us...

		The staring match continues.  Big Eds getting more 
		nervous.  Potters the first to blink.

					POTTER
			   Okay, you got my 
			   attention...

					JACK
			   Except for rule number 
			   one...

		Jack smiles.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   The customer is always 
			   right.  A cliché?  Sure. 
			   The difference is, we 
			   mean it.  Were small, we 
			   need our customers.  We 
			   cant afford to 
			   disappoint them, ever. 
			   Yeah, you could go to 
			   some leviathan supplier, 
			   probably save a few 
			   pennies on the price of 
			   oil filters, but with us 
			   you get more than a 
			   supplier, you get a 
			   bridge partner...

		A smile from Potter.  Jack gives Ed a wink.  Ed 
		watches, thrilled...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   You want to bid hearts, 
			   were right there with 
			   you.  You feel the need 
			   to redouble, youre not 
			   going to get any argument 
			   from us...

		Potter nods at Jack.  Jack moves in for the kill.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   The big guys may have the 
			   high cards, but you know 
			   as well as I do, Sydney, 
			   high cards dont always 
			   take the trick.

		Potter pauses a minute, then...

					POTTER
				(to Big Ed, 
				 re: Jack)
			   I like him...

		Big Ed smiles, letting out a relieved sigh.

					BIG ED
				(a wink to Jack)
			   Thats my boy...
				(an arm around Potter)
			   Cmon, lemme show you the 
			   rest of the ranch...

		Big Ed and Potter exit the office...

					BIG ED (CONTD)
				(turning back to Jack)
			   Nice shootin, Jack...

		...leaving Jack there with a satisfied smile on his 
		face.

    60	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

		Jack is in bed watching CNBC...On the TV a young woman 
		REPORTER at the anchors desk...

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   ...advancers led 
			   decliners by a nine to 
			   four ratio and the 
			   closing tick was a mildly 
			   bullish plus seventy 
			   six.  Much of the 
			   markets action today was 
			   fueled by the latest 
			   round of merger mania to 
			   hit Wall Street...

		The Global Health Systems and MedTech logos appear on a 
		graphic in the corner of the screen...

					CNBC REPORTER (CONTD, ON T.V.)
			   ...when Global Health 
			   Systems and MedTech 
			   Pharmaceutical announced 
			   their intentions to join 
			   forces in a massive one 
			   hundred and twenty two 
			   billion dollar stock swap 
			   deal.  Though neither 
			   side expressed 
			   significant regulatory 
			   concerns at the 
			   announcement press 
			   conference, it is 
			   believed that both the 
			   FDA and the FTC will be 
			   closely scrutinizing the 
			   marriage, the largest 
			   ever in the health care 
			   industry.  When asked 
			   about possible anti-
			   competitive implications, 
			   Global Chairman Bob 
			   Thomas referred reporters 
			   to P.K. Lassiter and 
			   Company President Alan 
			   Mintz, the original 
			   architect behind the 
			   deal...

		Jack stares in shock as the image changes to a super 
		confident looking Mintz shaking Bob Thomas hand at the 
		press conference.

					CNBC REPORTER (CONTD, ON T.V.)
			   Ironically, Mintz first 
			   met Thomas at a Lamaze 
			   class...

					JACK
			   A Lamaze class...!?

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   ...while coaching their 
			   pregnant wives, Mintz and T
			   homas struck up a 
			   dialogue about the need 
			   for consolidation in the 
			   rapidly growing health 
			   care industry and two 
			   months later, the deal 
			   with MedTech was born...

					JACK
			   What?!  Thats my deal?

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   In other business news, 
			   U.S. Labor Department 
			   officials announced today
			   that two hundred and 
			   seventy-five thousand new
			   jobs were created last 
			   month, twenty-five 
			   thousand less than 
			   economists were 
			   predicting, leading to a 
			   mild rally in the bond 
			   markets before midday.  
			   But as the trading 
			   session drew to a close, 
			   the profit takers stepped 
			   in and the long bond 
			   closed at ninety seven 
			   even, up only two ticks, 
			   the yield inching down to 
			   six point zero seven 
			   percent...

		Kate comes into the room from the hallway wearing only 
		Jacks NYU sweatshirt...

					KATE
			   The kids are asleep...

		She goes over to the window and draws the blinds.  Jack 
		looks up at her, nods, then goes back to the TV.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Jack.  I said the kids 
			   are asleep...

					JACK
				(distracted)
			   Well thats just 
			   great...those little 
			   monkeys can be a real 
			   handful...

		Kate shuts off the TV.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Hey!  I was watching 
			   that!

					KATE
			   I thought we had a deal 
			   about you watching CNBC 
			   in bed.

					JACK
			   Im working on a new deal 
			   now...

		Kate throws a Kate Bushs The Sensual World into the 
		CD player.

					KATE
			   Fine, but not tonight...

		She climbs onto the bed, a seductive look on her face.

					JACK
			   Wait a second.  You want 
			   me, dont you?

					KATE
			   That is the general idea, 
			   yes...

		Kate starts kissing him...but Jacks a little 
		uncomfortable with the sudden intimacy...he pulls back, 
		a little nervous.

					JACK
			   Shouldnt we grab some 
			   dinner first?  Maybe a 
			   bottle of wine...?

					KATE
			   Its ten thirty, Jack.  
			   By eleven youre gonna be 
			   sprawled out on the bed 
			   snoring your head off.  
			   We dont have time for 
			   wining and dining.

					JACK
			   Whatever you say...honey.

		She starts kissing him again...but this time he just 
		goes with it, and as her hands run through his hair 
		hes brought back to a different time and place...

		Jack momentarily pulls back and looks at her...its 
		like the first time hes really looked at her in eleven 
		years...


					JACK (CONTD)
			   God...youre beautiful...

		She smiles at him, almost uncomfortable with the 
		compliment...

					KATE
			   Thanks, Jack...

					JACK
			   No, Im serious...youre 
			   really stunning...

					KATE
			   This is good stuff, Jack, 
			   keep it coming...

					JACK
			   I mean back in college, 
			   you were a very pretty 
			   girl, theres no question 
			   about that.  But this...
				(lost in her)
			   ...youve really grown 
			   into a beautiful woman...

		Jack stares at her, entranced...Kate pulls back, 
		reacting to the intensity in his stare...

					KATE
			   How can you do that?

					JACK
				(nervous)
			   Do what?

					KATE
			   Look at me like you 
			   havent seen me every day 
			   for the last twelve 
			   years...

		Jack freezes.  Theres love in her eyes but its not 
		meant for him...

		She kisses him...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Dont move.

		She gets up off the bed and heads for the bathroom...

		He looks around...not sure what to do...Finally...

		He turns onto his side and closes his eyes...

		Kate emerges from the bathroom, she sees Jack on the 
		bed, hears his breathing heavy with sleep...

		At once charmed and disappointed, Kate sighs.  She 
		turns off the CD player and heads into bed.

		She pulls the covers up over Jack, shutting off the 
		light... She puts an arm around him, kissing him 
		sweetly on the neck...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   night, honey...

		Close in on Jacks face...turned away from Kate...he 
		opens his eyes...looks down at her arm...loneliness on 
		his face...

		CHAPTER EIGHT - THE MENS DEPARTMENT

		DISSOLVE TO:

    61	EXT. MALL - DAY

		Its mid-January and all signs of the Christmas season are 
		gone except for the snow on the ground in the busy parking 
		lot.

    62	INT. MACYS, MENS DEPT. - DAY

		Kate, pushing Josh in the stroller and holding Annies 
		hand, passing through the Mens Dept., Jack lagging 
		behind, a bevy of shopping bags in hand and a 
		beleaguered look on his face.

					KATE
				(back to Jack)
			Were almost done here...

					ANNIE
			Mary Janes, Mom.  You 
			promised.

					KATE
			Thats right.  Okay, 
			lets make a quick stop 
			at the kids shoe 
			department, pick up my 
			watch from the battery 
			place, then Ill run into 
			the linen store...

		An unhappy look on Jacks face.

					JACK
			Why dont we just go to 
			all the stores?!

		Kate looks back at Jack.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Every single store in 
			this godforsaken shopping 
			mall.  We can go to them 
			all.

		Kate gives him a look.  Then...

					KATE
			You know what, Jack?!  
			Ill go with the kids.  
			Why dont you just hang 
			out here in the mens 
			department... okay?

		Jack glances at the Mens Dept., sighs and gives Kate a 
		nod.  She takes off with the kids...and then he sees 
		it...

		...the Zegna section.  Hes drawn to the neat rows of 
		beautiful suits like a moth to the light...

		He approaches the rack, pulls out a dark green suit, 
		gently touching the soft wool.

					SALESMAN (O.S.)
			Its perfect for your 
			frame...

		Jack turns and sees a SALESMAN standing behind him.

					SALESMAN 
			Would you like to try it 
			on?

		CUT TO:

    63	INT. MACYS MENS DEPT. - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack, at a mirror wearing the Zegna suit.  It is 
		perfect for his frame.  The color is spectacular, the 
		line is dazzling.

		Jack looks in the mirror, shutting everything else 
		out... its like hes seeing his old self...

					KATE (O.S.)
			You look amazing in that 
			suit...

		Jack snaps out of his trance.  He sees Kate standing 
		behind him, Annie and Josh happily playing a few feet 
		away.
					KATE
			I mean...wow...off the 
			charts great.

					JACK
			Its an unbelievable 
			thing.  Wearing this suit 
			actually makes me feel 
			like a better person.
				(taking one final 
				 look)
			Im gonna buy it...

		Kate raises an eyebrow, then looks at the price tag.

					KATE
			$2,400?!  Are you out of 
			your mind?

					JACK
				(pointing to Annies 
				 new Mary Janes)
			She got those shoes...

					KATE
			Those shoes were twenty 
			five dollars.  Cmon, 
			take it off.  Well go to 
			the food court and get 
			one of those funnel cakes 
			you like.

		Jack looks at her...its a moment of decision.

					JACK
			No.

		Kate looks at Jack, a little surprised.

					KATE
			No?

					JACK
			Do you have any idea what 
			my life is like?

					KATE
			Excuse me?

					JACK
			I wake up in the morning 
			covered in dog saliva...I 
			drop the kids off, spend 
			eight hours selling tires 
			retail...retail, Kate.

		Kate just stands here, aghast...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I pick up the kids, walk
			the dog, which by the 
			way, carries the added 
			bonus of carting away her
			monstrous crap...I play 
			with the kids, take out 
			the garbage, get six 
			hours of sleep if Im 
			lucky, and then it starts 
			all over again...and why 
			is it that I always have 
			to drive everyone 
			everywhere?  I spend 
			practically my entire day 
			in that slow as hell 
			mini-van listening to 
			Raffi tapes and trying to 
			figure out how the cup 
			holders work...Im sick 
			of it.

					KATE
			Really.

					JACK
			Whats in it for me?  
			Where are my Mary Janes?

		Kate stares at him, shaking her head...

					KATE
			Its sad to hear your 
			life is such a 
			disappointment to you, 
			Jack.

					JACK
			I cant believe its not 
			a disappointment to you!
				(letting it all out)
			Jesus, Kate, I couldve 
			been a thousand times the 
			man I became.  How could 
			you do this to me?  How 
			could you let me give up 
			on my dreams like this?!

		Kate stares at him in disbelief.  Then...

					KATE
			Who are you?

		Kates words pierce Jack...he has to avert his eyes.

					JACK
				(lowering his voice)
			Look, Im sorry.  Im 
			sorry I was such a saint 
			before and Im such a 
			prick now.  Maybe Im 
			just not the same guy I 
			was when we got 
			married...

					KATE
			Maybe youre not.  The 
			Jack Campbell I married 
			wouldnt need a $2400 
			suit to make himself feel 
			better about his life, 
			but if thats what its 
			gonna take, then buy it.  
			Just buy the goddamn 
			suit ...we can take the 
			money out of the kids 
			college fund.

		They stare at each other for a moment...a stand-off...

					JACK
			Forget it...
				(taking off the 
				 jacket)
			Well get a funnel cake.  
			Itll be the highlight of 
			my week...

    64	EXT. NEW JERSEY ROAD - NIGHT

		The blue mini-van makes its way down this road...

    65	INT. MINI-VAN - NIGHT

		Theres an icy silence in the car...Jack is behind the 
		wheel, Kate next to him looking out the window, anger 
		on her face...
 
		CHAPTER NINE - REMINISCING

		Jack checks the rear-view mirror, sees Annie and Josh 
		in the back, both asleep...

					JACK
				(to Kate)
			Listen, Im sorry about 
			that back in the store.  
			I really dont want to 
			fight with you...

		Kate just keeps looking out the window.

					JACK (CONTD)
			But you must sometimes 
			wonder how we ended up 
			here.  I mean back in 
			college, did you see 
			us...
				(looking around)
			...here...?

		She turns to him.

					KATE
			Ill give you this, life 
			has thrown us a few 
			surprises...

		A glimmer in Jacks eye...

					JACK
			It really has, hasnt 
			it?  So if you had 
			to...what would you say 
			was the biggest surprise?

		She glances at the kids sleeping in the back.

					KATE
			Well...Annie for one.

					JACK
			Surprise.  Were 
			pregnant...
				(a laugh)
			Yeah...that mustve 
			been...I mean that was 
			very unexpected.  But 
			what are you gonna do, 
			right?

					KATE
			I think it worked out 
			okay, dont you?

					JACK
			Sure.  I really like 
			Annie.

					KATE
			Good, Jack.  Maybe well 
			keep her.

					JACK
			No, I love Annie.  We had 
			a lot of good times, 
			didnt we?

					KATE
			We were young...
				(a nostalgic smile)
			Remember that little 
			place on Charles Street 
			we used to go to?

					JACK
			Charles Street?  In the 
			Village?  When we were 
			living in Greenwich 
			Village...?
				(off her nod)
			Great times.  Whyd we 
			ever leave?

					KATE
			You cant really raise a 
			kid in an apartment in 
			the Village...

		Jack nods, starting to piece it together.

					KATE (CONTD)
			The trek out to the 
			hospital every day didnt 
			help either...
				(looking at him)
			You were great.  
			Surviving the heart 
			attack was one thing...

					JACK
			You had a heart attack?

					KATE
				(a laugh)
			Jack, stop that. I'm
			still mad at you...
				(a sigh)
			...who knows what 
			wouldve happened if you 
			hadnt stepped in at the 
			store.

					JACK
			Thats why I work for Big 
			Ed?

		A look from Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(recovering)
			I mean, thats why I work 
			for Big Ed...

		Jack looks out at the road a moment, piecing it all 
		together in his mind.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(almost to himself)
			So we had a baby, Big Ed 
			had a heart attack, we b
			ought that house, and 
			Ive been working for him 
			ever since...Sayonara, 
			Wall Street.

		Kate looks at him a little strangely.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(turning to her)
			Our life in a nutshell...

					KATE
			If you want to look at it 
			that way...

					JACK
			How would you look at it?

		She glances again at the kids in the back seat, then at 
		Jack.

					KATE
			A great success story...

		A smile from Jack.  He admires her outlook even if he 
		cant bring himself to share it.

		DISSOLVE TO:

    66	INT. BOWLING ALLEY - EVENING

		A crowded suburban New Jersey bowling alley...

		Jack stands at a lane holding a bowling ball, the 
		nickname The Hammer emblazoned over his bowling shirt 
		pocket...He approaches the line and throws the ball 
		down the lane...

		Its ugly...The ball caroms off the hardwood into the 
		gutter.

					JACK
			Damn...

					ARNIE
				(O.S., from behind)
			Jesus, Jack, this is a 
			league match, for gods 
			sake!

		Jack turns.  Arnie and the BOWLING TEAM are in the 
		scorekeeping area watching Jack make a mockery of the 
		sport.  Jack scowls.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Wheres your follow 
			through?  Wheres your 
			stance?

					JACK
			Hey, Im doing the best I 
			can...
				(under his breath)
			Id like to see you hit a 
			squash ball after 
			seventeen beers...

					ARNIE
			Youre right.  Why am I 
			so competitive!?  
			Compensation, I guess.  
			Look, just focus, Jack.  
			You can still pick up the 
			spare...

		Jack retrieves his ball, sets up, genuinely 
		concentrating...

					JACK
				(quietly, to 
				 himself)
			You are Jack Campbell.  
			Youre better than this 
			sport.  You shot the 
			rapids at Kenai.  You ran 
			with the bulls at 
			Pamplona.  You jumped out 
			of a plane over the 
			Mojave Desert, for 
			Christs sake.  You can 
			do this...

		Jack puts everything he has into the throw, heaving the 
		ball down the lane with as much grace and power as he 
		can muster...hitting the six pin and taking out four 
		others.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(screaming, excited)
			Yeah!!

		He turns, a fist pumped...But the guys could care 
		less...

					ARNIE
				(to TEAMMATE)
			Okay, Pete, youre up.

    67	INT. BOWLING ALLEY - LATE

		Jack walks out of the mens room, heading toward the 
		lounge.  He sees a familiar face walking toward him...a 
		woman in a sexy little bowling outfit, carrying a 
		bowling ball to a far lane.

					EVELYN
			Hi Jack...

		A moment of confusion as he tries to place the face.  
		Then...

					JACK
			Evelyn, right?

					EVELYN
			Very funny.  I saw you 
			out there on lane five.  
			What do you have the flu 
			or something?

					JACK
			Something like that.

					EVELYN
				(with a wink)
			Need a nurse?

					JACK
			Youre a nurse?

		Evelyn laughs.

					EVELYN
			If thats what you 
			want...

		She brushes past Jack, continuing to her lane...Jack 
		follows her with his eyes a moment, then...

					JACK
			Wait a second...

		She turns.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Are we...?

					EVELYN
			Are we what, Jack?

					JACK
			Is there something going 
			on between us?

		Evelyns surprised at Jacks directness.  She stands 
		there a beat, then walks back toward him.

					EVELYN
			Are we finally being 
			honest?

					JACK
			It would help me if we 
			were.

					EVELYN
			Okay, youre right, weve 
			been dancing around this 
			for years...

		Evelyn looks a little flush...she briefly fans her 
		face.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			God, my heart is racing.  
			Here goes...
				(a smile)
			When I get dressed for a 
			party and I know youre 
			going to be there... 
			well, lets just say I 
			dont go strapless 
			because my husband likes 
			it...

		An intrigued smile from Jack.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			Ive got six sets of snow 
			tires piled up in my 
			garage and I wont even 
			drive in the snow...And 
			our kids just happen to 
			be in the same ballet 
			class every year?

		She picks a piece of lint off his shirt.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			So, if youre asking me 
			whether Id like it to be 
			more, the answer is 
			yes...

		A look of surprise from Jack.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			...and Kate would never 
			have to know.

		Jack considers this for a moment.

					JACK
			Do I have your number?

		A wide smile from Evelyn.

					EVELYN
			Steves out of town with 
			the kids this week.  Why 
			dont you just stop by...

		She turns, leaving Jack standing there, watching her 
		sashay back to her lane.

    68	INT. BOWLING ALLEY, LOUNGE - SECONDS LATER

		Jack walks into the lounge, a little dazed.  He heads 
		over to Arnie whos having a beer at the bar.

					ARNIE
				(looking at Jack)
			Hey Jack, youre all 
			flush.  I guess that 
			seventy-one took a lot 
			outta you.

					JACK
				(sitting down)
			I just saw Evelyn 
			Thompson.

					ARNIE
			She is relentless.

					JACK
			She wants to have an 
			affair with me.

					ARNIE
			She said that?

					JACK
			Pretty much.

					ARNIE
			Oh yeah...
				(shaking his head)
			What is it about you?

					JACK
				(pushing over a 
				 napkin)
			So could you write down 
			her exact address?

					ARNIE
			Whoa...whoa...wait a 
			second, Jack.  Youre not 
			actually gonna cheat on 
			Kate?

					JACK
			It wouldnt really be 
			cheating...
				(off Arnies 
				 doubtful  look)
			Its complicated.

					ARNIE
			Look, maybe Im not as 
			good a consigliere as you 
			are but you have to trust 
			me on this one.  A little 
			flirtations harmless but 
			youre playing with fire 
			here.  The Fidelity Bank 
			and Trust is a tough 
			creditor.  You make a 
			deposit somewhere else, 
			they close your account 
			forever.

					JACK
			Im telling you, those 
			rules dont apply to me, 
			Arn.

					ARNIE
				(a chuckle)
			Screw the rules.  Im 
			talking about the choice.

		Jack looks at him curiously.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons 
			got no class.  She 
			doesnt marry Dr. Steve, 
			the womans living in a 
			trailer.

					JACK
			Hey, is that really 
			necessary?

					ARNIE
			All Im saying it there 
			isnt a guy in Union 
			County who wouldnt give 
			his left nut to be 
			married to Kate...

		Arnie takes one last swig of his beer and gets up...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Ill see ya later, 
			Jack...

		He leaves Jack alone, thinking...

		CHAPTER TEN - CAKE WARS

    69	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - NIGHT

		Jack walks into the house carrying his bowling bag.  He 
		dumps the bag in the coat closet and walks into the 
		kitchen where...

		Kate is at the counter, her back to him, poring over 
		some legal documents.

					KATE
				(not looking up)
			How was the game, honey?

					JACK
				(opening the fridge)
			Long, boring, and 
			generally pretty sad.  
			Arnie seemed to enjoy 
			it...
				(peering inside)
			Hey, wheres that chocolate 
			cake...?

		Kate turns around, revealing a huge hunk of chocolate 
		cake on a plate in front of her, a bite ready to go 
		into her mouth.

					KATE
				(with a smile)
			You mean this chocolate 
			cake?

					JACK
			Thats my piece.  I was 
			saving it because I got 
			nauseated from that store 
			bought chicken.

		Kate takes the bite, a little piece of icing sticks to 
		the side of her mouth.

					KATE
			Its good...

		Jack approaches the counter.

					JACK
			Gimme that cake.

		She takes another bite.

					KATE
			No way.

		He makes a grab for the plate but she holds it out 
		where he cant reach it.

					JACK
			Cmon.

					KATE
			Sorry, Jack.  Its too 
			important to me.

		They stare each other down a moment.  Then...

		He tries to swipe the plate.  Kate jumps out of her 
		chair, running out of the kitchen with the cake, 
		laughing...

		Jack takes off after her...chasing her through the 
		house... just about the catch up to her when...

		She darts up the stairs, still laughing...he follows 
		her...

					JACK
			I want that cake!

		...reaches up...grabs her shirt...pulls her down 
		playfully on top of him...

					KATE
				(laughing)
			You want the cake!?

					JACK
				(out of breath)
			I want it...

		She looks at him, then takes the whole piece in her 
		hand and smooshes it right in his mouth...

		Beat.  Then, Jack starts laughing...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Thank you...

					KATE
			Its good, right?

		He takes a big clump of it and smooshes it in her 
		mouth.

		They stay there a moment, lying on the stairs, feeding 
		each other cake, laughing.

		Jack leans back on the stairs.  He looks at Kates 
		face, practically covered in cake, smiling, and 
		realizes...

		...he hasnt laughed like this in thirteen years.  
		Then...

					JACK
			Are the kids asleep?

		A sexy smile from Kate...they start kissing 
		passionately right there on the steps...its heating 
		up...

					KATE
				(caught up in the 
				 moment)
			Say it, Jack...

					JACK
			What...?

					KATE
			Cmon, you know what I 
			like to hear...

					JACK
				(in the throes 
				 of passion)
			Yeah, baby, I know what 
			you like to hear...

					KATE
				(kissing him)
			Then say it...just say it 
			to me...!

					JACK
				(swept up in the 
				 moment)
			Oh yeah, youre a bad 
			girl, baby... You make me 
			so hot...Im gonna take 
			you to that special 
			place...

		Kate pulls away.

					KATE
			What...?

		Jack looks up at her, he can practically see the 
		passion drain from her face...

					JACK
			Not it...?

					KATE
			Nice, Jack.  Youre 
			sweeping me off my feet.

					JACK
			What? You make me hot...

		She gets up and heads up the steps, disappearing into 
		the bedroom...Jack shakes his head, frustrated.  Then, 
		he feels something licking at his hand...

		He looks down and sees Lucy standing next to him, 
		wagging her tail, looking up at Jack with an Ive 
		gotta go look on her face.  Jack heaves a sigh, 
		then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cmon, Lucy, maybe one of 
			us can get a little 
			relief tonight...

		He leads the dog toward the front door...

    70	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack is walking Lucy.  He passes a house that looks 
		familiar to him.  Then he sees it...

		...the name THOMPSON etched on the mailbox...

		Its the Thompson house, now sans the garish Christmas 
		decorations, a drying Christmas tree tied up on the 
		curb, ready to be picked up as garbage...

		Jack stops, pulling the dog back, looking up at the 
		house...

		He sees a light on in the upstairs bedroom...the faint 
		outline of a woman reading by the window...

		EVELYN THOMPSON...

		Jack looks around, sees the street is empty, then 
		nudges the dog, leading her up the path to the house.

		He gets to the front door...moves his hand up to the 
		doorbell...but its a tentative move...he keeps it 
		there a moment, perched at the button...but for some 
		reason he cant bring himself to push it...

		He looks down the street, toward his own house, then to 
		the window upstairs.  Finally, he turns...

					JACK
				(pulling the leash)
			Cmon, girl, lets go 
			home...

    71	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE FOYER - MINUTES LATER

		The front door opens and Jack walks in with Lucy on a 
		leash, his face red from the cold outside.

		He gives the dog a pat on the rump, then takes off his 
		coat, hanging it and the leash on a hook by the door...

		He walks through the quiet house, into the living room, 
		rubbing his hands together to warm them up.

		CHAPTER ELEVEN  HOME MOVIES

		He goes over to a glass bar stand and pours himself a 
		scotch, taking a sip, letting the alcohol warm him...

		He strolls through the room, looking at some of the 
		family photos framed and hanging on the wall, focusing 
		on his own face in the pictures, studying the 
		expressions...

		He moves to a pile of video tapes sitting on a shelf, 
		marked with titles like, Trip to Yosemite, 96" and 
		Joshs 1st Birthday.  He runs his fingers along the 
		tapes, stopping at one marked, Jack Singing.  His 
		eyes linger there a moment...

		He puts his drink down and pops the tape in the VCR...

		ON TV:

		Its a party for Kates birthday thrown at the Kramers 
		house...same crowd of people as the Christmas party, 
		cheesy Happy Birthday decorations.

		The image jerks up and down, surveying the crowd...

		Bill Kramer at the piano, playing some light cocktail 
		music ...Kate talking with a group of friends...

					ARNIE (O.S.)
			Jesus, Bill, this thing 
			is an antique.  Dont you 
			even have image 
			stabilization?

		Bill stops playing and looks up at Arnie.

					BILL KRAMER
			Four hundred bucks at Best 
			Buy, Arn.

		Then...Jack comes into frame, a confident smile on his 
		face.

					JACK
			And everyone knows image 
			stabilization is for the 
			weak...

		Jack is jarred by the image of himself on the video...

		Jack on TV...he smiles as Kate walks into frame, easily 
		putting an arm around Jack...

					ARNIE
			So Jack, its your wifes 
			birthday, got anything to 
			say to her?

					JACK
				(to Kate)
			Its your birthday?  
			Today?  Whats your 
			name?  Where were you 
			born?

					KATE
			Jack.

					JACK
			Wait a minute.  Youre my 
			wife?

		She slaps him playfully on the arm...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I do have one thing I 
			wanna say...

		Kate looks at him expectantly.  Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(singing to her)
			Oh those fingers in my 
			hair, that sly come 
			hither stare, strips my 
			conscience bare, its 
			witchcraft... 

		Jack doesnt have the greatest voice in the world but 
		hes not the least bit self-conscious...and Kate seems 
		to like it, theres a twinkle in her eye...some of the 
		guests focus their attention on Jack and Kate. 

		Jack winces, embarrassed, as he watches himself sing...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...and Ive got no 
			defense for it, that heat 
			is too intense for it, 
			what good would common 
			sense for it do...

		Bill Kramer still at the piano, chimes in with the 
		basic chords for Witchcract, sounding it out as he 
		goes along...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...Cause its 
			witchcraft, wicked 
			witchcraft...and although 
			I know its strictly 
			taboo...when you rouse 
			the need in me, my heart 
			says yes indeed in me, 
			proceed with what youre 
			leadin me to...

		The camera catches the reactions of guests in the 
		crowd... the women, smiles on their faces, wrapped up 
		in the romance of the moment.  Envy on the mens faces 
		as they watch Jack serenade his wife...

		A musical interlude from Bill as Jack takes off his 
		jacket...some HOOTS and HOLLERS from the crowd...Arnie 
		captures the image of Kate whistling at her husband...

		Arnie follows with the camera as Jack strolls in front 
		of the gathered guests... 

					JACK (CONTD)
			Its such an ancient 
			pitch, but one that Id 
			never switch, there aint 
			no nicer witch than 
			you...

		Jack watches himself move gracefully.  But its no 
		longer embarrassment on his face, its fascination...

		Back in the video, the camera catches Evelyn Thompson 
		watching longingly as Jack moves back toward 
		Kate...Evelyn cant take it anymore, she abruptly turns 
		and walks toward the kitchen...

		Jack raises an eyebrow...

		In the video...Jack approaches Kate, she couldnt have 
		a more delighted look on her face.  He picks up the 
		verse...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cause its witchcraft, 
			that koo koo 
			witchcraft...and although 
			I know its strictly 
			taboo...

		The camera pans across the crowd, even the men are 
		getting into it, focused on Jack as he sings lovingly, 
		unashamed, to his wife...Nick Careli mouths the words 
		along with Jack, almost as if hes studying him, 
		revering him...

		Jack watches the TV, seeing Nick do this...maybe he 
		underestimated his alter ego...

		On the video...Jack staring into Kates eyes...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...when you rouse the 
			need in me, my heart says 
			yes indeed to me, proceed 
			with what youre leadin 
			me to...

		Jack and Kate exchange a sexy smile...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Its such an ancient 
			pitch, but one that Id 
			never switch...

		Jack kisses her on the lips...HOOTS and HOLLERS from 
		the crowd.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cause theres no nicer 
			witch than you...

		Kate brushes a hand across Jacks face...

		Smash cut to Jack watching this...seeing the 
		connection, the heat between them...coveting it...

		Back to the video...the music building...the crowd 
		completely in the palm of Jacks hand...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...than you...

		The camera closes in on Jack and Kate as the music 
		builds to a crescendo...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...than you...

		A little musical flourish from Bill as the crowd breaks 
		out into huge CHEERS and APPLAUSE...

		Jack, watching this other version of himself in the video, 
		the center of attention, larger than life, focused on Kate...

		Back on video...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(speaking quietly 
				 to Kate)
			Happy Birthday 
			sweetheart...I love you.

		Kate leans over, giving Jack a deep kiss...OOHS and 
		AHHS from the crowd...but Jack and Kate are in their 
		own little world...

		Jack continues to watch himself on the video, his smile 
		fading, becoming a look of realization...then loss...

		A tear at the corner of his eye...

		The SOUND fades in Jacks head as the action in the 
		video continues...

		Hes left standing there...silent, still...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    72	INT. CAMPBELL MASTER BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

		Lucy licking Jacks face.  Jack pushes the dog 
		away...as...

		The ALARM RINGS.  Kate pushes the button to stop it.

					KATE
				(groggy)
			Time to get up, honey...

		Jack obliges without question, getting out of bed, 
		putting on a robe and slippers and exiting, still 
		practically half-asleep.

    73	INT. KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

		Jack walks into the kitchen.

		He turns on the Mr. Coffee, gets a bottle from the 
		fridge, throws it in the microwave, removes it, and 
		heads upstairs.

    74	INT. JOSHS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...into Joshs room.  Josh is wide awake, standing up 
		in his crib, like a prisoner in a cell.

		Jack gives him the bottle, pats his head perfunctorily, 
		and then walks out of the room...

		CHAPTER TWELVE - HAPPY ANNIVERSARY

    75	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...and back into the bedroom to find Kate, sitting on 
		the bed, a wrapped present in front of her and a wide 
		smile on her face.

		Jack stops, raising an eyebrow at the gift.  He looks 
		behind, as if to ask whether its for him, then back to 
		Kate.

					KATE
			Happy Anniversary, 
			honey...

		Terror on Jacks face.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(pushing the gift 
				 forward)
			Before you do whatever 
			crazy stunt youve got 
			planned I want you to 
			open mine...

		Jack musters up a smile, then approaches the gift.

					JACK
			Maybe I should wait...

					KATE
			No, open it...

		He hesitates, then begins unwrapping the package, 
		revealing...

		...a suit, similar in color and style to the Zegna 
		suit...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I found it at an outlet 
			store.  I know its a 
			knock-off, but I think 
			itll look great on 
			you...

					JACK
				(examining the label)
			Zeena...

		Jack is overcome with emotion...Yes, its a ZEENA, but 
		this is probably the nicest thing anyones ever done 
		for him...

					JACK (CONTD) 
				(tearing up)
			You really are 
			incredible...

					KATE
			Enjoy it, sweetheart...

		Jack looks at Kates expectant face, suddenly 
		remembering how truly screwed he is.

					JACK
			Youre probably expecting 
			something from me...

		Hes sweating bullets...watching as Kate gets a quizzical 
		look on her face...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Heres the thing.  I 
			really hadnt planned on 
			giving you your...uh... 
			anniversary gift until 
			tonight.
				(an uncomfortable 
				 smile)
			You know, anniversarys 
			good all day...

					KATE
			What are you talking 
			about?  You never wait 
			all day.  You can barely 
			wait until its light 
			out.

					JACK
			I know that, but...

		Beat.  Kate looks at him like shes looking into his 
		soul.

					KATE
			You forgot.

		Jack stands there, silent.

					KATE (CONTD)
			You actually forgot our 
			anniversary.

					JACK
			Ill fix it.  Ill go out 
			right now and get you 
			something.  Ill make it 
			right.

		That didnt help.

					KATE
				(holding back 
				 the tears)
			Jesus, Jack...Is this 
			where we are now?  Is 
			this our marriage?  
			Suddenly Im the wife who 
			has to drop hints two 
			weeks before her 
			anniversary so her 
			husband doesnt fuck it 
			up?

		Jack sees a tear run down her face...a pang of guilt on 
		his...

					JACK
			Please dont cry...

		Kate wipes the tear away but they just keep coming.

					KATE
				(shaking her head, 
				 crying)
			I dont want to be that, 
			Jack...

		Jack approaches her, holding out a hand but Kate pushes 
		it away, gets up and walks toward the bathroom...

		Jack is left standing alone, holding Kates gift...

		CUT TO:

    76	INT. FRONT PORCH - MINUTES LATER

		Jack emerges from the house, steps out onto the porch 
		for some air...

		He shakes his head, a mixture of frustration and self-
		pity on his face.

		He notices Annies bike leaning against the side of the 
		porch, and the bell that Cash gave him sitting on its 
		handle bar.

		He takes a step toward it, and gives the bell a gentle 
		RING ...he looks around, as if hes expecting someone 
		to appear ...but theres no one.  He RINGS the bell 
		again, louder this time, really trying to attract 
		someones attention.

					JACK
			Cmon...cmon...

		Nothing.  Finally, he lifts the bike up in the air, 
		RINGING the bell with everything hes got...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(shouting to the 
				 sky)
			Cmon, goddamnit, how was 
			I supposed to know the 
			date of their 
			anniversary!?  I never 
			married her!

		Pull back...Annie in the doorway...looking at him.

					ANNIE
				(slowly)
			Put the bicycle back on 
			the ground...

		Jack turns and sees her, gently lowering the bicycle.

    77	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

		Jack is mixing a glass of chocolate milk.  Annie, arms 
		folded, is waiting expectantly.  He finishes, sliding 
		the glass to her.

		She takes a long sip, puts the glass down, a chocolate 
		milk mustache on her lip.

					ANNIE
			Not bad...I shoulda 
			warned you.  Dad always 
			does something really 
			special for their 
			anniversary.

					JACK
			Like what?

					ANNIE
			One year he had a solar 
			system named after her...

					JACK
			Dont you think thats a 
			little gimmicky?

					ANNIE
			Mom liked it.

		Jack raises an eyebrow.

					JACK
			Maybe theres a jewelry 
			store back at the mall.  
			I could get her a pair of 
			earrings or something.

					ANNIE
			Thats good but...you did 
			forget the anniversary.

					JACK
			Right.  Thats a major 
			oversight...
				(thinking aloud)
			So if Im Kate...I cant 
			really afford the finer 
			things, my husbands 
			career is a crushing 
			disappointment to me, 
			Im trapped in suburbia...

		Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Did he ever take her to 
			the City?

		Annie smiles, impressed.

					ANNIE
			Youre really gettin the 
			hang of this.

		Suddenly, a look of confidence comes over Jacks face.  
		For the first time, he seems like a man in control.

    78	INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

		Annie is sitting on the bed watching her mother get 
		dressed.

		Kate, wearing a silky slip, walks out of her closet 
		carrying two dresses on hangers, a red one and a sexy 
		little black one.

		Kate holds out the two dresses to Annie.

					KATE
			Which do you think?

		Annie thinks about it for a moment, taking it very 
		seriously...

					ANNIE
			The black one...

		Kate nods.  Shes about to put it on when she looks at 
		Annie...

					KATE
			Fightings a part of it, 
			Annie.  You know that, 
			right?

					ANNIE
			Im not worried, Mom.  
			Hes still learning our 
			ways...

		Kate looks at her with a raised eyebrow, then nods.  
		Its true.  She puts down the dress and holds out a 
		hand to Annie.

					KATE
			Cmere.

		Kate leads her to the makeup table, then opens a 
		lipstick...

					ANNIE
				(excited)
			Really?

		Kate nods then applies some red lipstick to Annies 
		lips.

					KATE
			Now go like this...

		Kate rubs her lips together, showing Annie how to do 
		it.  Annie mimics her Mom, then Kate looks at her  
		Annies beaming.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Youre gonna break a lot 
			of hearts, you know.

		A smile from Annie...

		Pull back to reveal...Jack standing at the door, 
		watching ...appreciating the kind of mother Kate is...

    79   OMITTED

    80	EXT. LOIRE - NIGHT

		A small, elegant French restaurant hidden on a tree-
		lined lower Manhattan street.

    81	INT. LOIRE - SAME TIME

		Jack is wearing the suit Kate gave him.  Its not a 
		Zegna, but he looks pretty damn good.

		He leads Kate toward the cloak room at this intimate 
		restaurant...

		He helps her off with her coat.  Kates wearing the 
		sexy little black dress and we can immediately see its 
		effectiveness...

					JACK
			You look beautiful...

		A charmed smile from Kate as she hands Jack her coat.

		Jack hands the coats over to the COAT CHECK GIRL...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(instinctively)
			Thanks, Catherine...

		Jack fakes a SNEEZE, trying to cover up...Kate gives 
		him a pat on the back...

					KATE
			You okay?

		He takes Kate by the arm...

					JACK
			Fine...

		He leads her to the main room.

		She looks out at the room, elegant tables, French 
		country decor, a PIANIST playing Cole Porter...

					KATE
				(quietly to Jack)
			Jack...can we afford all 
			this?

					JACK
			Whats the difference?  
			Im taking my baby out 
			for our anniversary, damn 
			the costs...

					KATE
			How do you even know 
			about this place?

		Jacks caught for a moment.  Then...

					JACK
			Arnie...
				(insistent)
			Arnie.  Hell throw you a 
			curve ball once in a 
			while, thats for sure...

		Jack puts his arm around her and kisses her on the 
		cheek...

    82	INT. LOIRE - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack and Kate sit at a secluded table, a WAITER 
		standing next to them.  Jacks not even looking at the menu.

					JACK
			Well have the tureen of 
			quail breast with 
			shiitake mushrooms to 
			start, then the veal 
			medallions in raspberry 
			truffle sauce and the sea 
			scallops with pureed 
			artichoke hearts...sea 
			scallops, North of the 
			Caspian...

		Kate looks at Jack, a mixture of confusion and awe on 
		her face.

					WAITER
			Very good, sir.  And may 
			I say those are all 
			excellent selections.

					JACK
			You may...
				(perusing the 
				 wine list)
			Also, well have a bottle 
			of Lafite, 1982.

		Kate reaches over and pulls down the wine list, reading 
		it upside down.

					KATE
			Its five hundred and 
			fifty dollars, Jack!

		A wince from Jack...for a moment there it was almost 
		perfect.

					JACK
			Just a glass of red wine 
			for each of us...

		The waiter nods, then walks toward the kitchen...

					KATE
			You are so not off the 
			hook yet, slick.

					JACK
			But Im gettin close, right?

		A noncommittal nod from Kate.  Then Jack notices her 
		look over at the pianist, drawn in by the music.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You want to dance?

		A puzzled look from Kate.  Theres nobody else 
		dancing.  There isnt even much room to dance...

					KATE
			I dont think theres 
			dancing here, Jack.

		Jack gets up and holds out a hand.

					JACK
			Sure there is...

		Kate looks around again, then she smiles.

		Kate rises, taking his hand.  Jack takes her in his 
		arms, swaying slowly in the limited amount of space, 
		confident and self-assured.

		The pianist looks up, smiling, appreciating their role 
		in this romantic moment.

		Kate moves with Jack, following his lead comfortably.  
		They look good together...in sync with each other...

		People are watching them...some of the men are 
		impressed, others are scoffing, but the women are 
		clearly charmed...

					KATE
				(whispering to 
				 Jack)
			Pretty good for a tire 
			salesman from Jersey...

		Jack flashes her his most charming smile.

					JACK
			I have my moments...

		They continue to dance, in a world of their own...

    83	INT. LOIRE - LATE

		Jack and Kate at the table enjoying a gourmet meal.  
		Jack holds out a fork with a piece of veal for Kate.  
		She takes a bite.

					KATE
			Mmmm...
				(spearing a scallop)
			...here, try one of 
			these...

		Jack takes a scallop from Kates fork.

					JACK
				(savoring the scallop) 
			God I missed that 
			taste...

		Kate laughs.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Why are you laughing?

		Kate shoots him a look of curiosity.  Jack looks back 
		at her, sees the trust in her face...He puts down his 
		fork.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I need to tell you 
			something.

					KATE
			Okay...

					JACK
			I think it may help us 
			but theres a slight 
			chance it could make 
			things worse.

		She hears the seriousness in his voice.

					KATE
			Now Im worried...just 
			say it.  Whatever it is 
			well deal with it.

					JACK
			Are you sure?

		She nods.  Jack searches his mind for the right words.  
		Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I feel like Im living 
			someone elses life...

		Jack looks to her, expecting the worst.  But she just 
		nods reassuringly.  He continues...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I used to be so sure 
			about everything, you 
			know?  I knew exactly who 
			I was and what I wanted.  
			Then one morning I woke 
			up and suddenly it was 
			all different...

					KATE
			Worse, you mean...

					JACK
			No.  Well, maybe a few 
			things.  But mostly just 
			different...

		Jack lets out a small smile.  Now hes the one whos 
		reassuring Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I never used to be like 
			this, Kate.  I had it all 
			figured out.  No doubts, 
			no regrets.

					KATE
			And now...?

					JACK
			Now...I dont...

		He looks at her, staring into her eyes, almost 
		desperate for understanding.

					KATE
			Me neither.

		A raised eyebrow from Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I think its good to be a 
			little unsure about who 
			you are.  Its very 
			human.

					JACK
			But you always seem so 
			certain.

					KATE
			Cmon, Jack, you think 
			there arent mornings 
			when I wake up and wonder 
			what the hell Im doing 
			in New Jersey...

					JACK
			Thats a big one for me, 
			too.

					KATE
			My office is a dump, I 
			answer my own phone...and 
			youve seen my pay check.

					JACK
			Your pay check is a 
			disgrace to pay checks.

					KATE
			I mean yes, I help people 
			that need it...

					JACK
			I guess...some of them 
			are probably faking.

					KATE
				(a laugh, then...)
			God, sometimes I think it 
			would be so nice not to 
			have to stretch ground 
			beef or maybe drive a car 
			with a CD player...

		He smiles, right there with her.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Imagine having a life 
			where everything was 
			easy...where you asked 
			for things and people 
			just brought them to 
			you...

					JACK
			Its wonderful...

		Kate laughs, nodding.

		A pause, then...

					KATE
			I think about it, too, 
			Jack.  I do.  I think 
			about the kind of person 
			Id be if I hadnt 
			married you...

		Its as if shes inside his head.  They stay like this 
		for a moment, looking into each other.

					JACK
			And...?

		She stops a moment, considering.  Then...

					KATE
			And I realize Ive just 
			erased the things in my 
			life Im most sure 
			about.  You, the kids...

		Jack nods.

					JACK
			Good things...

					KATE
			What are you sure about?

		Jack looks into Kates eyes.

					JACK
			Im sure that right now 
			theres nowhere Id 
			rather be than here with 
			you...

		Kate smiles at Jack, a loving, secure smile.  Its been 
		a while.

		CUT TO:

    84	EXT. PENSION - NIGHT

		The mini-van parked outside a small brownstone right on 
		the square.  Its like something out of a Henry James 
		novel... charming, meticulously maintained, elegant...

    85	INT. PENSION, SUITE - A LITTLE LATER

		The door opens and Jack, carrying Kate in his arms, 
		enters...

		Jack puts Kate down and she takes in the room, antique 
		furniture...its like walking into another world...

					KATE
			This is so beautiful...

		Jack smiles as he opens a champagne bottle sitting on a 
		silver ice bucket...

					KATE (CONTD)
			You know champagne makes 
			me do crazy things.

					JACK
				(pouring)
			Ill just full yours up 
			to the top.
				(handing her a 
				 glass)
			Happy anniversary, 
			sweetheart.

		Kate smiles, clinking her glass with Jacks.

					KATE
			I dont know how you did 
			it, hoss, but you pulled 
			it off.

					JACK
			Im out of the doghouse?

					KATE
			Way out...

		Kate saunters into the bedroom, looking at the king-
		size poster bed, feeling the down quilt.  Jack follows 
		her...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(turning to him)
			You may even get lucky 
			tonight...

		Kate kisses him...when their lips separate, we can see 
		the powerful effect it has on him.

		Jack looks deep into her eyes, stroking her hair, lost 
		in her.

					JACK
			Youre so...beautiful...

					KATE
			I already told you you 
			were gonna get lucky, 
			Jack...

		They kiss again, a long soulful kiss.  Then...

		Jack pulls back, a look of realization on his face...

					JACK
			My god, all this time...I 
			never stopped loving 
			you...

					KATE
				(a wide smile) 
			Thats all I wanted to 
			hear...

		She kisses him, their bodies intertwined...hands 
		caressing ...more and more passionate...then reaches 
		behind her to the light.  The room goes dark...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    86	INT. PENSION, SUITE - MORNING

		Morning sun streams onto Jack and Kate in bed...

		Kate, in Jacks arms, her head on his chest, a 
		contented smile on her face...

		Jacks eyes open...adjust to the light.  He looks over 
		at Kate.

		Theres something different in his eyes...something 
		deeper.  Jack smiles...a broad, Im in love kind of 
		smile.

		Kate stirs, gently stroking Jacks chest.

					KATE
			Mmmm...Jack...

		Kate lifts her head, turning to face Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I feel like I should give 
			you money...

		Jack laughs.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I mean, my god, Jack you 
			were always good but 
			this...this was... like a 
			porno movie.

		Kate lays her head back on Jacks chest, looking at 
		Washington Square through the window.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I could stay here 
			forever...

					JACK
			I dont think Id fight 
			you on that one...

		Kate lifts her head and looks at him expectantly.  They 
		kiss.

    87	EXT. NEW JERSEY STREET - NIGHT

		The mini-van passes a sign that reads, Welcome to 
		Teaneck.

    88	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, VARIOUS - MORNING

		Annie walking through the downstairs of the house, 
		practicing her violin...its a noise bordering on 
		MUSIC, but not quite...

		She walks into the kitchen where...

		Jack stands at the counter in his robe, reading the 
		Newark Star Ledger and drinking a cup of coffee.

		He lowers the paper, watches Annie with a smile as she 
		strolls through the room playing her violin badly...he 
		goes back to his paper.

    89	INT. JACKS CLOSET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack, still singing, donning his Dockers and short-
		sleeve oxford...

   89A	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - MORNING

		The front door of the Campbell House...

		Jack emerges in his work clothes, putting his coat on, 
		a bagel in his mouth...

		He disappears from frame, the screen door closing 
		slowly behind him...

		In a moment...Kate appears at the door, a cup of coffee 
		in her hand...she follows Jack with her eyes as he 
		heads to the car.

		Then...a smile from Kate...

		In a moment...Jack returns to frame and heads straight 
		into Kates arms...

		...a passionate kiss as she leans against the door 
		post...

					KATE
			Have a good day...

		A smile from Jack as she pats him on the ass and sends 
		him on his way...

    90	EXT. BIG EDS - AFTERNOON

		Jack, pointing to a stack of radials, is standing with 
		a MAN (40s) wearing a pale blue leisure suit and a pair 
		of high top Nike Air Jordans.

					JACK
			For the money, theyre 
			hands down the best 
			radial we carry...

					MAN
				(thinking, then...)
			Okay, Ill take them...

					JACK
			You wont regret it...
				(shouting to Tommy)
			Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up 
			with four B.F. Goodrich 
			G-Force T/As...
				(looking the man 
				 over)
			...and give him ten 
			percent off for having 
			the best costume...

		Just then, a black ROLLS ROYCE SILVER SERAPH pulls into 
		the lot, its front left tire riding on the rim...

					ESTELLE (O.S.)
				(over P.A. system)
			Jack, Kate on line two!  
			Jack pick up two!

		Jack turns toward the door, but then looks curiously 
		back at the Rolls...something familiar about it...

		Then...Peter Lassiter gets out of the car...

					KENNY
				(walking out to Jack)
			Kates on two, Jack.
				(on seeing the Rolls)
			Nice ride...

					JACK
				(staring at Lassiter)
			If youre into that kind 
			of conspicuous 
			consumption...

					KENNY
			You want me to handle 
			him?  I think Im 
			ready...

					ESTELLE (O.S.)

					JACK
			Sure...be careful, he 
			looks like a tough 
			negotiator...

		Jack walks inside...

    91	INT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		...but hes still focused on Lassiter through the 
		window, cant take his eyes off him...

		He gets to the phone...sees the light for line two 
		blinking ...he looks back outside, sees Kenny approach 
		Lassiter...

		...back to the blinking phone light...he picks up the 
		phone...

		But cant bring himself to hit the blinking light.  
		Then...

					JACK
				(to Estelle, into 
				 intercom)
			Tell Kate Ill call her 
			back...

		INTERCUT WITH ESTELLE IN HER OFFICE

					ESTELLE 
				(into intercom)
			It sounded pretty 
			important.

					JACK
				(into intercom)
			Im with a customer.  
			Ill call her back.

		He takes his hand away from the phone and walks back 
		outside the store...

		CHAPTER THIRTEEN - PETER LASSITER

    92	EXT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		...towards Kenny and Lassiter.

					LASSITER
				(to Kenny)
			I seem to have had some 
			kind of blow out...

		Jack approaches, tapping Kenny on the shoulder.

					JACK
			Why dont you let me take 
			this one, Kenny?

					KENNY
			Okay, chief.

		Kenny nods then heads back inside...

					JACK
			Peter Lassiter...

					LASSITER
				(surprised)
			Do I know you?

					JACK
			Not exactly. Ive seen you 
			on CNBC.
				(with a smile)
			You look taller in real 
			life...

		CUT TO:

    93	INT. BIG EDS TIRED, JACKS OFFICE - LATE

		Jack leaning back in his chair, behind the desk of his 
		cluttered, cramped office.

					JACK
			...truth is, Mintz was so 
			busy timing his wifes 
			breathing he didnt see 
			that MedTech needed 
			Global more than the 
			other way around.  Ten 
			days, two weeks tops, 
			they wouldve approached 
			you with an offer, and 
			Id bet anything it 
			wouldve been thirty 
			billion, not twenty 
			nine...
				(a knowing smile)
			Problem was, Peter, you 
			had a pussycat running 
			the show. What you needed 
			was a rottweiler.

		Lassiter, sitting on the little chair across from Jack, 
		an intrigued look on his face...

					LASSITER
				(nodding)
			Well, Im impressed.

		A smile from Jack.

					LASSITER (CONTD)
			I really am...

		Jack savors the moment, until...

					LASSITER (CONTD)
			So, about my car...

		Hes jarred back to reality, a little crestfallen...

					JACK
			Sure. Were going to 
			have to special order 
			that tire. Itll be 
			ready in about two days.

		Lassiter nods, then takes a business card out of his 
		wallet.

					LASSITER
			This has my office address 
			on it...
				(thinking, then...)
			Why dont you drop it off 
			yourself?

		A smile from Jack.

		CUT TO:

    94	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, JACKS BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Kate, sound asleep in bed...

		Pan across to Jack, his eyes wide open, lost in 
		thought...

    95	INT. BIG EDS, JACKS OFFICE - DAY

		Jack wearing his Zeena suit, sitting behind his desk, 
		distracted, as he listens to HECTOR, 40s, the 
		GUATEMALEN MECHANIC.

					HECTOR
			...I say to her, Margarita, 
			we already have four kids, 
			why do we need more?

		Jack is shaking his leg anxiously under the desk as he 
		eyes the door...
					
					HECTOR (CONTD)
			But she say she want an 
			even number. I say four 
			is an even number! But 
			she say she want six.

		Jack checks his watch...

					HECTOR (CONTD)
			I tell her, Margarita, I 
			just got my green card, 
			I like to sit back and 
			rest a little bit...

					JACK
				(interrupting)
			Hector...do I usually 
			listen to your personal 
			problems?

					HECTOR 
			Sure, Jack, all the time...

		Jack nods, then...

					JACK
			Look, I have some business 
			that I have to take care 
			of in the city so Im 
			leaving early...
				(getting up)
			My advice to you...follow 
			your dreams.

		CUT TO:

    96	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - AFTERNOON

		Jack pulling up to the building in Lassiters Rolls...

		He gets out of the car, walks to the building, feeling 
		good, confident, stopping to gaze up at the 
		skyscraper...he breathes in deeply, then heads 
		inside...

    96A	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

		Jack enters, instinctively tossing the car keys to the 
		SECURITY GUARD...the guard looks at him like hes 
		crazy...

    97	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Lassiter walk together...

					LASSITER
			...were really more of a 
			boutique operation, as 
			you can see...

					JACK
			But youre not interested 
			in boutique dollars...
				(a smile)
			I get it...

		They walk into...

    98	INT. ALAN MINTZS OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Past the assistants desk...

					MINTZS ASSISTANT
				(seeing Lassiter)
			Hes expecting you, Mr. 
			Lassiter...

		Lassiter doesnt even slow down...

    99	INT. ALAN MINTZS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Its Jacks old office but you wouldnt know it from 
		the decor...lots of country pine, a fabric sofa, and a 
		play pen where the bar used to be.  Jack enters, 
		immediately struck by the difference...

					LASSITER
				(to Mintz)
			Alan, this is Jack 
			Campbell...the one I was 
			telling you about...

		Mintz, a confident look on his face, gets up from the 
		desk and goes to shake Jacks hand.

					ALAN
			Jack, of course.

		They shake hands.

					JACK
				(appropriately 
				 deferential)
			Mr. Mintz.

					ALAN
			Please, call me Alan. We 
			try to cultivate a casual 
			atmosphere around here...

					JACK
				(re: play pen)
			I can see that, Alan.

		A chuckle from Mintz.

					ALAN
			You have kids, Jack?

					JACK
				(hesitating, then...)
			Uh...actually, yes. Two...
			good ones.

		Another laugh from Mintz.

					ALAN
			Thats great...
				(gesturing to 
				 the sofa)
			Why dont you have a seat?

		Jack nods, sits down on the plush sofa, Mintz and 
		Lassiter take the chairs.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			So, Peter mentioned that 
			you were an avid CNBC 
			watcher but didnt say 
			whether you had any 
			actual Wall Street 
			experience?

		Jacks a little taken aback by the question, not 
		realizing he was walking into an interview...

		He crosses his legs, trying to get comfortable.

					JACK
			I was a sales associate, 
			at E.F. Hutton.

					ALAN
			A broker? Really. And now 
			youre in the tire 
			business?

					JACK
			Thats right. And auto 
			supply...

					ALAN
			Uh huh. The retail end, I 
			understand.

		Jack nods...

					JACK
			Uh...we actually get about 
			sixty percent of our 
			business from automotive 
			service.

					ALAN
			Mind if I ask what kind of 
			sales you did last year? 
			Ballpark...

					JACK
			We did one point seven 
			million in total revenue...

					ALAN
			Uh huh...one point seven.  
			And what do you project for 
			this year?

		Jack pauses, analyzing the situation...the patronizing 
		questions, the smirk on Mintzs face...


					ALAN (CONTD)
			Any thoughts at all on 
			that?

		As Jack stares into their faces, he realizes the extent 
		of his handicap...

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Jack?

		He stops, takes a moment, looking at Mintz and Lassiter 
		then ...a confident smile.

					JACK
			Well, Alan, I think were 
			gonna have a banner year.  
			Sales are up almost 
			twenty percent in the 
			first quarter and we just 
			landed a major trucking 
			company account.

					ALAN
			Really. So youre 
			projecting what, a tad 
			over two million?

		A gleam in Jacks eye.

					JACK
			Thats right. And that 
			would make us number one 
			in our market...
				(getting up)
			You mind if I stand?

		A raised eyebrow from Mintz.

		Mintz and Lassiter follow Jack with their eyes as he 
		crosses the room to the desk, pours himself a glass of 
		water...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Look, I know our paltry 
			little two million in 
			sales is about what you 
			spend on office supplies 
			in a year.  And I know 
			some regional trucking 
			company account is 
			nothing compared to a 
			sixty billion dollar 
			merger...

					ALAN
			Im not trying to knock 
			the tire business, Jack.

					JACK
				(a confident chuckle)
			Its okay, Alan. I get it. 
			Im in your shoes, Im 
			thinking exactly the same 
			thing...but heres the 
			thing. Business is 
			business.  Wall Street, 
			Main Street, its all 
			just a bunch of people 
			getting up in the morning, 
			trying to figure out how 
			the hell theyre gonna 
			send their kids to 
			college.  Its just 
			people...

		Jacks confidence is throwing Mintz off, but Lassiter 
		appears intrigued...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And I know people.

					ALAN
			Im sure you do...

					LASSITER
				(intervening)
			Lets let the man have 
			his say...

		Mintz covers his embarrassment with a smile...

					JACK
				(to Mintz)
			Take you, for instance...

					ALAN
				(defensive)
			What about me?

					JACK
			You drink about sixteen 
			Diet Cokes a day. Youre 
			an excellent father, but 
			you feel guilty about the 
			time you spend away from 
			home. You drink bourbon, 
			but you offer your 
			clients scotch...

		Jack looks around the office then back to Mintz.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And your wife decorated 
			this office...

		A laugh from Lassiter as Mintz sits there stewing, a 
		caught look on his face.

					LASSITER
			He certainly has your 
			number, Alan.

					JACK
				(turning to Lassiter)
			Youre a little tougher, 
			Peter.

		A raised eyebrow from Lassiter, but hes game...

					JACK (CONTD)
			For one thing, you like 
			expensive things.

					LASSITER
				(smiling proudly) 
			Thats easy. Youve seen 
			my car.

					JACK
				(a chuckle)
			Okay...you smoke Hoyo de 
			Monterreys. Youre a 
			scotch man, single malt, 
			not because its trendy 
			but because youve been 
			doing it for forty years, 
			and you stay with what 
			works. You have two great 
			loves in your life, your 
			horses and this company.  
			You wept openly the day 
			the Dow hit ten thousand...

		Lassiters impressed.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And youre a man who 
			prides himself on finding 
			talent in unusual 
			places...


					LASSITER
			Oh? And how would you 
						know that?

		Jack smiles.

					JACK
			Because Im here.

		On Lassiter...nodding his head. Mintz, a plastered-on 
		smile.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Im prepared to do 
			anything it takes to get 
			this job. Start anywhere 
			you need me to start.  
			Ill park cars if I 
			to...
				(into Lassiters 
				 eyes)
			The biggest part of 
			judging character is 
			knowing yourself. And I 
			know this, I can do this 
			job. Give me a chance, 
			Peter, I wont let you 
			down.

		Lassiter returns Jacks gaze with equal intensity. In a 
		moment, he turns to Mintz.

					LASSITER
				(to Mintz)
			Alan, why dont you show 
			Jack around a bit...

					ALAN
			Id love to.

		CUT TO:

    100	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Alan walking side by side down the hallway... 
		EMPLOYEES passing them by, greeting Mintz, Mintz waving 
		back...

					ALAN
				(pointing)
			...thats our war room.  
			We did seven major deals 
			last year, three of them 
			hostile.

					JACK
				(not particularly 
				 impressed)
			Seven.  Really.

		They turn a corner, coming into a deserted section of 
		the corridor.

		Mintz stops, turning to Jack.  Jack returns Mintzs 
		gaze with a quizzical look.

					ALAN
			Lets cut the shit, huh 
			Campbell? What, did you go 
			through his wallet or 
			something?

		Jacks a little taken aback.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			No matter. That circus 
			act back there may have 
			dazzled Lassiter 
			momentarily but it 
			doesnt do shit forme.  
			Even if you get this job, 
			which I highly doubt, let 
			me warn you, Lassiter 
			loses interest in his pet 
			projects very quickly. 
			Im in the big office 
			because Ive proved 
			myself to him year after 
			year and nobody is going 
			to come in here and start 
			turning the old mans 
			head. Especially not some 
			tire salesman from New 
			Jersey. So you watch 
			yourself and stay away 
			from Lassiter, and maybe, 
			just maybe, Ill keep you 
			on after he gets tired of 
			you. Do we understand 
			each other?

		Jack stands there, staring at Mintz, silent, 
		expressionless.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Do we?!

		Then, a broad smile from Jack.

					JACK
			God, you really are 
			different, arent you...
				(nodding)
			I mean...wow...I am 
			impressed.

		Now its Mintzs turn to look quizzical.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Good for you. Why shouldnt 
			you protect whats yours.

					ALAN
			I dont think youre hearing 
			me.

					JACK
			Oh, Im hearing you, Alan.  
			Thats not the problem.  
			The problem is that what 
			you think is yours, is 
			really mine.  And I dont 
			care how low on the totem 
			pole I start, I will get 
			it back...
				(poking him in 
				 the chest)
			So do yourself a favor and 
			dont get too attached to 
			that view because sometime 
			soon, maybe very soon, you
			and your French country 
			antiques, your chintz sofa, 
			and your little play pen 
			are gonna be moving out of 
			that office.

		Jack smiles at Alan one more time, then turns...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Oh, and by the way, you 
			try selling tires for a 
			living.  I promise you, 
			youd starve.

		Jack heads down the corridor, whistling a happy tune, 
		leaving Mintz standing there, bewildered.

		CHAPTER FOURTEEN - A PERFECT LIFE?

		CUT TO:

    101	INT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - DAY

		A double door opens and Jack leads Kate into this huge 
		duplex.  Kate looks around, taking the place in.

					JACK
			Welcome to Xanadu...

		The place is incredible...marble floors, architectural 
		lines, high tech fixtures, elegant modern furniture...
		its striking but not at all homey like the Jersey 
		house.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Pretty incredible, isnt 
			it?

					KATE
			Its like a museum.

		Jack nods.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(turning to Jack)
			So whats the big 
			surprise? You didnt 
			rent this place for 
			the weekend, did you?

					JACK
			Think bigger.

					KATE
			For the week?

		Jack chuckles.

					JACK
			This place is a perk, 
			Kate.

					KATE
			A perk for what?

					JACK
			A company called P.K. 
			Lassiter and Associates 
			Investment House uses it 
			to attract new 
			executives...

		Kates confused.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Youre talking to their 
			new Vice President of 
			Mergers and Acquisitions.

					KATE
			What are you talking 
			about, Jack?


					JACK
			Im going into arbitrage, 
			honey.  Turns out I have 
			a knack for it.  Ill be 
			making two hundred grand 
			a year plus a hefty bonus
			and thats just to 
			start.  And, we can live 
			in this apartment 
			practically rent free for 
			as long as we want.

		Jack measures her reaction. Its not good...

					JACK (CONTD)
			We can finally afford to 
			move back into the city.  
			In style.

		Kate just looks at him, in shock. Then...

					KATE
			Are you out of your mind?

					JACK
			I dont think so. This 
			is going to be a better 
			life for all of us, 
			honey.  Well put Annie 
			and Josh in private 
			schools...

					KATE
			Annie goes to a great 
			school.

					JACK
			Im talking about the 
			best schools in the 
			country here, Kate...

					KATE
			Jack, what could you 
			possibly be thinking?  
			What about my job?

					JACK
			This is New York City, 
			its like the needy 
			people capital of the 
			world.  Those Jersey 
			clients of yours arent a 
			tenth as pathetic as the 
			ones you could get 
			here...

					KATE
				(cutting him off)
			I cant believe you want 
			to move back into the 
			city.  I thought the 
			reason we left was 
			because we didnt want to 
			raise the kids here?

					JACK
			No, this is the center of 
			the universe.  If I were 
			living in Roman times, I 
			would live in Rome, where 
			else?  Today, America is 
			the Roman Empire and New 
			York is Rome itself. 
			John Lennon.

					KATE
				(cutting him off) 
			Jack.

		Jacks starting to struggle...

					JACK
			Look, Im detecting a 
			kind of funky tension 
			here...We dont have to 
			live in this apartment. 
			I dont need this...Ill 
			commute...Ill drive to 
			work...

		Jacks back on his heels...seeing his dream picked 
		apart...

					KATE
			In traffic?  Its over an 
			hour each way?  Thats 
			almost three hours a 
			day.  When are you going 
			to see the kids?

		Hes frustrated...he pauses a moment to gather 
		himself. Then...

					JACK
			Kate. Youre not 
			understanding me. Im 
			talking about a great 
			life.  A perfect life.  
			Everything we pictured 
			when we were young. The 
			whole package. You said 
			it yourself, life has 
			thrown us surprises, and 
			so we made sacrifices.  
			But now I can finally get 
			us back on track...

		A sad chuckle from Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I can do that.  I want to 
			do that.  For all of us.  
			I need to do that as a 
			man...
				(imploring her)
			Think about it.  No more 
			lousy restaurants, no 
			more clipping coupons, no 
			more shoveling snow...

					KATE
			Then get a goddamn snow 
			blower!

		Jacks taken aback by the intensity of her tone.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Dont get a new career 
			without even telling me.  
			Dont take Annie out of a 
			school she loves.  Dont 
			move us out of a house 
			weve become a family 
			in...

		Kate stands there, wounded...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(quietly)
			Dont do that...

					JACK
			Look, youre making this 
			into something its not. 
			This isnt a referendum 
			on our lives, Kate. Its 
			a step forward...
				(appealing to her)
			Dont you see?  Im 
			talking about us finally 
			having a life other 
			people envy.

		Silence.  Kate looks him in the eye  a deep, piercing 
		look...

					KATE
			They already do envy us, 
			Jack...

		Kate picks up her bag and walks out of the apartment.

    102  OMITTED

    103	INT. ANNIES ROOM - NIGHT

		Annie is in a nightgown, practicing her violin. Jack 
		walks in.

		Its all he can do to hold back cringing at the missed 
		notes. Annie finishes the piece, lowering the bow.

					JACK
			Very nice. What is it?

					ANNIE
			Mary Had A Little Lamb.

					JACK
			Ah. A classic...

		Annie starts PLAYING again as Jack looks at the 
		dresser. She has 20 or so family photos lined up and 
		down its sides...

		Jack studies them...in every one Jacks face is totally 
		contented.  Jack studies them, looking at his own face.

		Annie lowers the bow, watching him...

		Jack turns to her.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Please dont stop...

		She smiles, then starts PLAYING again.  He turns back 
		to the pictures...

    104	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, DEN - LATE

		Jack...standing in front of the desk, nursing a drink.

		He looks at Lassiters business card, sitting on the 
		surface of the desk...

		He gazes around the room...his eyes coming to rest on a 
		bookshelf...a book...

		He moves toward it...looking at its spine...its a 
		tattered copy of Vonneguts Cats Cradle.  He pulls 
		it off the shelf, theres something inside...a 
		bookmark...

		...a PAN AM ticket jacket sleeve...

		...inside...a boarding pass...From: London/Heathrow, 
		To: New York/JFK, 10/4/87.

		He looks at it...somethings not right...

					JACK
			From London to New York...?
				(looking up)
			I came back...

		Then...a NOISE...

		Jack turns and sees Kate walking into the doorway, 
		standing there...She sees Jack holding the Pan Am 
		ticket sleeve.

					KATE
			Our finest moment, 
			right...

		A quizzical look from Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			When you got on that 
			plane I was sure it was 
			over.  I left the airport 
			afraid Id never see you 
			again.  And then you 
			showed up the very next 
			day...
				(a wistful smile)
			That was a good 
			surprise...

		She continues into the room, leaning against a 
		bookshelf.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I think about you on that 
			plane, about what must 
			have been going through 
			your mind...you sitting 
			there imagining our life 
			together, our life 
			apart...I think about the 
			decision you made...

		Jack watches her as she lets out a small sigh.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Maybe I was being naive 
			but I believed wed grow 
			old together in this 
			house.  That wed spend 
			holidays here, have g
			randchildren visit us 
			here.  I had this image 
			of us all grey and 
			wrinkly, me working in 
			the garden, you 
			repainting the deck...

		Kate smiles gently as she pictures this.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Things change, right?  
			People change...
				(pausing)
			If you need this, Jack, I 
			mean really need this, I 
			will take these children 
			from a life they love, 
			and take myself from the 
			only home weve ever 
			shared, and move wherever 
			you need to go.  Ill do 
			that because I love 
			you...

		The words are like a warm embrace for Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I love you, Jack. And  
			thats more important to 
			me than our address...

		Kate smiles lovingly at Jack...she walks over to him, 
		kisses him gently on the forehead.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I choose us.

		She turns and heads out of the room, leaving him there, 
		the boarding pass still in hand, staring lovingly at 
		her as she goes...

    105	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks into the room...

		The lights are off, Kate already in bed sleeping.

		He undresses for bed, unable to take his eyes off Kate.

		Finally, he lifts the covers and climbs into bed next 
		to her, moving closer to her, putting an arm around 
		her, drawing her in...

		In her sleep, Kate nestles in Jacks embrace.  He 
		savors the feeling, then closes his eyes as...

		They lay there...side by side...together...a single 
		person.

		DISSOLVE TO:

    106	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

		The morning light streams into the room.  Kate opens 
		her eyes.  Jacks not in bed.  A look of curiosity.

		Then, she hears LAUGHTER from outside.

		She goes over to the window...opens the blinds... 
		revealing...

		Jack in the backyard, LAUGHING with joy, playing in the 
		snow with Annie and Josh.

		Kate watches...a satisfied smile sweeping across her 
		face...

    107	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BACKYARD - SAME TIME

		...Jack reaches out and snags Annie...she CACKLES in 
		delight...

		The three of them fall over onto the soft white snow...

		The laughter from the kids is uncontrollable, Jacks 
		joy is just as palpable...

		Finally, Annie stops laughing and grabs Jack around the 
		neck, hugging his tight.

					ANNIE
				(whispering in 
				 Jacks ear)
			I knew youd come back...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    108	INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

		Jack walks over to a utility shelf, fishing around 
		until he finds a bag of rock salt...he grabs it, sees 
		its empty...

		And then he hears it...the sound of a BICYCLE BELL 
		RINGING, echoing through the room.

		A shudder passes through his body...

		He turns and sees Annie at the open garage door, 
		sitting on her bike, ringing the BELL.

		Its an eerie moment for Jack...

					JACK
			What are you doing?

					ANNIE
				(a curious look)
			Ringing my bell...

		On Jacks anxious face...

		CHAPTER FIFTEEN  SAYING GOODBYE

    110	INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

		On Jack...crouched down in an aisle of this local 
		convenience store...checking out the bags of rock 
		salt...

		He looks at the price tag on one of the bags...

					JACK
			Four ninety nine?! Its just 
			salt for gods sake...

		On the entrance to the store...the door opens, a YOUNG 
		GIRL, 17, enters, an average suburban teenager...

		She glances at a fashion magazine, picks up a package 
		of gum...

		From the POV of the cashier, we see the girl approach 
		the counter...

		On Jack, crouched down in the aisle. He grabs a bag of 
		salt from the shelf, when...

					CASH (O.S.)
			Thatll be sixty five cents, 
			little angel...

		Jack registers the voice...he rises slowly, looking 
		over to the front counter...where he sees...

		Cash, dressed in a typical chain convenience store 
		uniform, ringing up the teenager...

		An excited smile from Jack at the sight of Cash...

					JACK
			You...!

		Then...the color drains from Jacks face...

					JACK (CONTD)
			What are you doing here...

		Jack moves toward Cash at the counter...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Youre not sending me 
			back...

		The girl eyes Jack curiously, then removes a dollar 
		bill from her pocket and slides it across the counter 
		to Cash...

					CASH
			Jack, its good to see 
			you...

		Cash reaches into the register, taking out change for 
		ten dollars...he hands the girl $9.35...

					CASH (CONTD)
				(to the girl)
			Thank you darlin...

		The girl looks at the money, realizing that Cash has 
		given her the wrong change...

					CASH (CONTD)
				(back to Jack, 
				 seeing the
				 rock salt)
			What do you got there, 
			rock salt?  Look at you, 
			all domestic and shit...
			You really figured some 
			things out, huh?

		The girl looks at Cash talking to Jack...

					JACK
			Im not going back...

		The girl hesitates...Cash turns to her...

					CASH 
				(to the girl)
			Everything okay...?

		She looks at him, a moment of decision, then...

					TEENAGE GIRL
			Yeah...fine.

					JACK
				(raising his voice)
			Hey! Did you hear me...?!

		Cash ignores Jack, watching the girl as she heads to 
		the door, hesitates a moment, then walks out...

		A look of disappointment on Cashs face as he reaches 
		into his pocket, pulling out a little notebook...

		Cash looks at Jack.

					CASH 
				(making a note 
				 in his book)

			That was a character issue...
				(shaking his head)
			...and for nine dollars?  
			Thats just sad...

					JACK
			Hey, Im talking to you!  
			I am not going back, do you 
			understand...?!

		Cash looks at him, compassion on his face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You cant do this. You 
			cant keep coming in and 
			out of peoples lives, 
			messing things up...

					CASH
			Cmon, Jack...

		Jack throws six bucks on the counter...

					JACK
			Ive got kids, Im going 
			home...

					CASH
			You know what the word 
			glimpse means, J? Its 
			by nature an impermanent 
			thing.

		Jack walks determinedly toward the exit. He stops and 
		turns at the door...

					JACK
				(pointing at 
				 Cash)
			Im staying.

		Cash follows him with his eyes, a proud look on Cashs 
		face as Jack leaves...

    111	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, JOSHS ROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks to Josh.  Hes sleeping soundly.

		Jack gently kisses Josh on the head, careful not to 
		wake him.

    112	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, ANNIES ROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack is standing over Annie, kissing her on the cheek.

					ANNIE
				(stirring, groggy)
			Is it morning yet?

					JACK
			No, honey. Go back to 
			sleep.

		She closes her eyes as Jack stands there for a moment 
		looking at her, sadness all over his face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Take care of yourself,
			Annie.  Im going back to 
			the mother ship...

		Finally, he turns to go...

    113	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		The clock reads, 11:17.  Kate is already in bed as 
		Jack walks in.

					KATE
				(looking up from 
				 her book)
			Hey...

		Jack approaches her, sitting on the bed...

					JACK
			These last weeks, Kate, I 
			know that Ive done 
			some...some unusual 
			things.

		Kate nods.

					KATE
			Its been interesting, 
			thats for sure.

					JACK
			But Ive done some good 
			things too, havent I?

					KATE
			Youve been Jack 
			Campbell.  And thats 
			always a good thing...

		She kisses him on the cheek.

		He takes her arms in his hands and looks her in the 
		eyes.

					JACK
			I need you to remember 
			me, Kate.  How I am right 
			now, right this very 
			moment.  I need you to 
			put that image in your 
			heart and keep it with 
			you, no matter what 
			happens.

					KATE
			Are you okay, Jack?

					JACK
			Please, just promise me 
			youll do that. You have 
			to promise, Kate. 
			Because if you dont, 
			then its like it never 
			happened and I dont 
			think I could live with 
			that.

		Shes a bit confused but she couldnt be more in love 
		with him.

					KATE
			I promise, Jack...

					JACK
			Promise me again...

					KATE
			I promise. Come to bed, 
			honey.

		Jack stands up, heading toward the door.

					JACK
			Soon...

    114	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE NIGHT

		Snow begins to fall...

		Jack with Lucy on a leash, walking side by side, his 
		mind elsewhere...

		Lucy leads him around a corner...to a large open 
		field...

		Lucy stops.  She looks back at Jack, then out to the 
		open field.

		Jack removes the leash. The dog bounds happily out 
		into the field, looking for just the right spot.

		Jack puts his hands in his coat pocket...pulls out a 
		half-eaten roll of PEPPERMINT LIFESAVERS, puts one in 
		his mouth...

		He looks up at the sky, snow gently falling onto his 
		face. Its cold, but its beautiful...peaceful and 
		still...the air clean and crisp...

		He breathes in the fresh air, the Lifesaver dissolving 
		in his mouth, watching the dog...

    115	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		The room is dark...

		Jack enters, sees Kate sleeping soundly in bed.

		He sits down in a chair and watches Kate asleep, a sad 
		look in his eyes...

		As he continues to watch her, to listen to her, his own 
		eyelids appear to grow heavy...

		He tries to fight the sleep...opening his eyes...
		focusing on her...but its no use...

		Finally, he closes his eyes...falling into a deep 
		sleep...

		CHAPTER SIXTEEN  THE OLD LIFE

		DISSOLVE TO:

    116	INT. JACKS APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING

		A PHONE RINGING

		Jack, flat on his back in bed...Light streams onto 
		his face ...he stirs...

		THE PHONE STILL RINGING...

		Jack reaches over to Kates side...theres no one 
		there.

		Pull back to reveal...his old Manhattan apartment... 
		his old dressy clothes strewn on the floor...

		Jack, sleep still in his eyes, reaches over...hes not 
		wearing any pajamas...picks up the phone...

					JACK
				(groggy, dazed)
			Yeah...okay, send her 
			up...

		He drops the phone...turns back over...lets his eyes 
		stay closed for another moment...then...

		His eyes open...

		He looks around...sees his shirtless torso...then his 
		old apartment...tailored clothes on the floor.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(sadly)
			Damnit.

		Jack looks at the clock, 9:23 a.m.  He gets out of 
		bed, throwing on pants and a pair of shoes, and leaves 
		the room...

    117	INT. JACKS APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack walks to the door just as...

		The doorbell RINGS.  He stops, then cautiously opens 
		the door, seeing...

		PAULA, wearing a long overcoat and a wide smile on her 
		face.

					PAULA
			Waiting for me by the door, 
			huh?

		Jack looks at her.

					JACK
			Paula...

		Paula opens her coat  the only thing she has on 
		underneath is a sexy little teddy.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(momentarily 
				  distracted)
			Thats totally see through...

					PAULA
				(smiling)
			Merry Christmas...

					JACK
				(confused)
			Christmas?  It cant be 
			Christmas...

		Jack stares at her, totally confused...

					PAULA
				(lasciviously)
			Its whatever you want it 
			to be, Jack...

		Jack grabs a leather jacket then walks right by a 
		shocked Paula and heads out the door, practically 
		running down the corridor.

					PAULA (CONTD)			
			Jack?...Jack!

		CUT TO:

    118	EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari speeds down the bridge, toward Jersey...

    119	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari pulls up in the driveway and he hops 
		out. He races to the front door, POUNDING on it...

		A MAN in a Van Heusen shirt and Hagar slacks answers.  
		Jack stares at him in shock.

					MAN
			Can I help you?

					JACK
			Is Kate here? Does Kate live 
			here?!

					MAN
			Kate? No, theres no one here 
			named Kate.  Is that good 
			enough for you?

		Jack starts rapping his head against the door post, 
		much to the shock of the guy standing there.

					JACK
			Damn...damn...damn...

					MAN
			Hey, are you okay?

					JACK
			No...Im not...

					MAN
			Is there anything I can do 
			for you?

		Jack shakes his head mournfully.

					MAN (CONTD)
			Hey, my wifes in the kitchen.  
			You got a cigarette?

					JACK
			Im sorry, no...

		Jack walks off, beleaguered...

    120	EXT. ARNIES HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

		Jacks car drives by as Arnie carries a bicycle box out
		to the garbage.  The car screeches to a halt in front 
		of the driveway.

					ARNIE
				(shouting at Jack)
			Hey, you cant park that 
			thing here.

					JACK
				(out the window)
			Its me, Jack...

					ARNIE
			I dont care if youre Tim 
			Allen with your fancy car 
			and all your tools, you 
			still cant park here.

					JACK
			Tell me you recognize me, 
			Arnie.  Please...

					ARNIE
			Howd you know my name?

					JACK
			We bowl together. Were 
			bowlers ...we won a 
			championship...were winners.

					ARNIE
			I never won anything in 
			bowling.

		Arnie peers at Jack through the window.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Wait a second...
				(thinking)
			Jack...Jack...

					JACK
			Yes...Jack Campbell...

					ARNIE
			Of course. Jack Campbell. I 
			went to high school with
			you...you played baseball, 
			right?
				(at the Ferrari)
			Youre doing well...

					JACK
				(remembering)
			Yes, thats it...yes, we 
			went to high school together.

					ARNIE
			You never really talked to 
			me.  I wanted to talk to 
			you, man...

					JACK
			Yeah...I guess I just 
			wanted you to know, we 
			couldve been really good 
			friends...

    120A	INT. FERRARI - DAY

		Jack driving...a CELL PHONE RINGS.

		A curious look on Jacks face, its been a while since 
		hes heard that sound.

					JACK
				(answering phone) 
			Hello?

					ADELLE (O.S.)
			Hey Santa, where are you?  
			Everybodys here.

					JACK
			Adelle?

					ADELLE (O.S.)
			You were supposed to be here 
			half an hour ago...the 
			emergency strategy session?  
			Your trip to Aspen? Theyre 
			all panicked here...

		Silence from Jack...

					ADELLE (CONTD, O.S.)
			Jack...? Are you going through 
			the tunnel?

		Finally, Jack shakes his head, defeated.

					JACK
			Ill be there in twenty 
			minutes...

		CUT TO:

    121	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM - NOON TIME

		Its a beehive of activity...

		Jacks TEAM, anxiously going over reports and flow 
		charts, working the phones, drinking coffee...

		Jack enters, still reeling from his experience, taking 
		a moment to observe the action...

		Mintz spots him...

					ALAN
				(into phone)
			Thank god, Jacks here. Ill 
			call you right back...

		He hangs up the phone as all eyes in the room turn to 
		Jack, immediately fixating on how disheveled he looks.

					ALAN (CONTD)
				(approaching)
			Jack, are you okay?

					JACK
				(in a daze)
			Whats going on here?

					ALAN
			Its not good.  Bob Thomas 
			has secretly been talking to 
			a European drug company.  
			Were not sure which one, 
			Julias on it right now.  
			Word is theyre willing to 
			let him buy a minority stake 
			and keep running the entire 
			company.  The Global people 
			are up in arms.  They say 
			we shouldve been prepared 
			for this.  Were in trouble 
			here, Jack...

		Jack looks at Alan for a minute.

					JACK
			You know something, Alan.  
			Theres a much more assertive 
			person somewhere inside of 
			you...

		Alan looks at him, confused.

					ALAN
			Excuse me?

					JACK
			But I think I like you better 
			this way...

					ALAN
			Is this another one of those 
			Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?

		A sad laugh from Jack.

					JACK
			No.

					ALAN
			So what are we gonna do, 
			Jack?

		Jack wallows for another moment in his own sadness...

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Jack...?		 

		Jack snaps out of it, turning to Alan and the rest of 
		the group...

					JACK
			Ill tell you exactly what 
			were going to do.  Youre
			going to do whatever you 
			have to do to find out which 
			European company hes been 
			talking to.  Then Im going 
			to clean myself up, fly to 
			Aspen, and drink egg nog 
			with Bob Thomas.  His wife 
			and kids will be playing in 
			the background while I spend 
			Christmas day convincing him 
			that the European company is 
			the devil and Global is the 
			answer to his prayers, after 
			all...
				(growing wistful)
			Then Im going to spend four 
			hours skiing. Alone. On 
			Christmas day. Completely 
			and utterly alone. Im going 
			to do that because that is 
			my life, that is whats 
			real, and there is nothing 
			I can do to change that...

		Jack leaves the office to the shocked stares of his 
		team.

    122	EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

		Jacks limo makes its way downtown.

    123	INT. LIMO - SAME TIME

		Jack in the back seat of the limo, sadly looking out 
		the window, watching the buildings pass by...

		He turns away, looks at the phone...haltingly picks it 
		up...

					JACK
				(dialing 411)
			For Manhattan...Kate 
			Reynolds...I need an address 
			too...

		Jack jots something down on a business card.  Then he 
		hangs up the phone, thinks a moment, looks out the 
		window, then turns to the driver...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Make a right here...

					DRIVER
			But the airports the other
			way...

					JACK
			Were not going to the 
			airport...

		CUT TO:

		123A	EXT. KATES BUILDING - DAY

		Jacks limo pulls up outside this house on Washington 
		Mews...

		Jack gets out...

    124	INT. EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

		Jack stands outside an apartment door.  He hears The 
		Clashs London Calling BLARING from inside.

		He rings the bell...the volume of the music gets 
		lower...

		Kates assistant, LORI, 20s, opens the door...Jack 
		exchanges a curious look with her.

					LORI
			Are you from the shipping 
			company?

					JACK
			Im Jack Campbell...Im an 
			old... friend of Kates.  
			I just called.

		The woman looks at him, then walks back inside...

					LORI (O.S.)
			Kate! Some guys here!

		Beat. Jack waits anxiously at the door. Then...

					KATE (O.S)
				(to Lori)
			Did you call the airline 
			like I asked?!

		Jacks eyes come alive as Kate appears wearing jeans 
		and a white blouse...except for her hair, she looks the 
		same.

					JACK
			Kate...

					KATE
			Jack...God, its been so 
			long...You look...

		She searches for a kind word, but he looks terrible.

					JACK
			You look great.

					KATE
			Its good to see you...

		She looks at him another moment, then turns...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(yelling inside)
			Lori! Wheres that box?!

		Kate walks inside, Jack follows her in sheepishly.

		125	INT. KATES APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack accidentally knocks into a stack of boxes, 
		sending a GLASS CANDY DISH CRASHING to the floor, 
		SHATTERING it...

					JACK
				(bending down)
			I'm sorry...

					KATE
			Dont worry about it, Jack...

		Jack looks up at...a beehive of activity  Lori on the 
		phone, boxes stacked everywhere, TWO MOVERS packing 
		up...

					JACK
			Whats going on?

					KATE
				(searching around)
			Im moving to Paris...it was 
			right here...
				(to Lori)
			Its a box marked Jack.  I 
			put it in the stack for the 
			Salvation Army...

					JACK
			Paris?

					LORI
				(to Kate, with 
				 attitude)
			Do you want me to look for 
			the box or call the airline?

					KATE
			Hey, kind of under a little 
			pressure here.

					LORI
			Hey, kind of giving up 
			Christmas day for my ex-boss 
			here.

		Jack watches this back and forth.

					KATE
			You didnt seem to mind 
			offering to help me on 
			Christmas day when you were 
			unwrapping that Prada bag 
			I gave you.

					LORI
			Maybe its by the wardrobe 
			boxes...

		Kate heads over to some tall wardrobe boxes.

					JACK
			Youre moving...

					KATE
			Uh huh. To Paris. My firm 
			has an office there and 
			Im going to be heading 
			it up.

					JACK
				(stunned)
			To Paris. Paris, France.

					KATE
				(searching the 
				 boxes)
			Thats the one...

					JACK
			So youre not at a non-
			profit firm?

					KATE
				(a chuckle)
			Not with what they pay me...

					JACK
			Youre not married, are 
			you?

					KATE
			No, Jack, I never got 
			married. You?

					JACK
			Not exactly...
				(looking around)
			Can we just take a minute 
			here?  Maybe get a cup of 
			coffee or something...?

					LORI
				(yelling)
			Ill go for a cup of coffee!

					KATE
			Yes!

		A relieved smile from Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I found it!

					LORI
			Congratulations. The La 
			Guardia flights canceled 
			but I got you out of 
			Kennedy on United at nine.  
			Am I good or what?

		Jacks smile disappears as Kate hands him a sealed box 
		marked, Jack...

					KATE
			Here you go.  Its just 
			some old things of yours...

		Jack stands here, looking at the box, then at Kate...

					JACK
			Do you ever think about us, 
			Kate?  About what might 
			have happened...?

		A bemused LAUGH from Kate.  Then she sees hes not 
		laughing...

					KATE
			Youre serious...

		A nod from Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			Ill tell you what, Jack, 
			if youre ever in Paris, 
			look me up. Maybe well 
			go for that cup of coffee.

		One of the movers passes by Jack carrying a box...

		Jack looks at Kate, flush with the realization that 
		this isnt the same woman he knew thirteen years 
		ago, or left yesterday.

					JACK
			Sure. Goodbye, Kate.

		He leaves...

		CUT TO:

		126	INT. JACKS APARTMENT - EVENING

		A scratchy Zeppelin album, the song All Of My Love, 
		fills the room. Jack, a fifth of Bushmills by his 
		side, goes through the box Kate gave him.

		He removes a worn leather jacket, feeling the soft 
		material, then a Mondale for President button, which 
		Jack smiles upon seeing, a couple Neil Young concert
		ticket stubs...

		He puts the leather jacket on, then sticks the Mondale 
		button on the lapel.  He digs back into the box, 
		finding...

		A messy, dog-eared copy of Cats Cradle...not the one 
		Kate gave him at the airport, the one she replaced...

		Jack looks at it for a moment...lost in his sadness... 
		then...

		He looks over at the clock, it reads, 8:29.

		CHAPTER SEVENTEEN  ONE LAST TRY

		CUT TO:

	127	EXT. VAN WYCK EXPRESSWAY - NIGHT

		Jack in his Ferrari, racing down the highway at 120 
		MPH...

		He looks at the clock, it reads, 8:46. He opens up 
		the throttle...

	128	EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, UNITED TERMINAL - MINUTES LATER

		Snow is falling as Jacks car races up to the terminal 
		then stops. He jumps out. An AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD 
		sees him...

					AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD
			Hey, you cant leave that 
			there!

		Jack runs into the terminal, ignoring the guard...

	129	INT. UNITED TERMINAL - SECONDS LATER

		Jack looking at the board. The nine oclock to Paris - 
		Gate 8A. Jack sprints toward the gate...

	130	INT. UNITED TERMINAL, GATE AREA - SECONDS LATER

		...and gets there just as the flight is boarding.
		Jack looks through the crowd, spotting Kate near the 
		front of the line, about to hand her ticket to the gate 
		attendant.

		He pushes through the throng of people, drawing some 
		annoyed stares, finally making his way over to Kate.

					JACK
				(calling out)
			Kate!

		Kate turns and sees Jack, a look of puzzlement on her 
		face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You cant go!

					KATE
			Jesus, Jack...

					JACK
			Dont get on that plane!

					KATE
			Jack.

					JACK
			Please. Lets just go have 
			a cup of coffee. Thats all 
			Im asking for. Im sure 
			theres another flight to 
			Paris tonight.

					KATE
			What do you want from me? 
			You want me to tell you 
			everything that happened 
			was okay?

		Jack just stands there, unsure...

					KATE (CONTD)
			Well it is. Yes, I was 
			heartbroken ...But I got 
			over it. I moved on. 
			People change, Jack. I 
			changed. I dont know 
			why you suddenly feel the 
			need to revisit that time 
			in our lives but I assure 
			you, its over...

		Kate turns her back to Jack, leaving him standing 
		there...

		He watches her walk to the podium, realizing shes 
		right...

		He sees Kate reach the podium...hand her ticket to the 
		attendant...

		Finally, a look of determination crosses his face...

					JACK
				(at Kate)
			We have a house in Jersey!

		Kate turns to him with a look that could kill.

					KATE
			Dont do this, Jack...
			But he continues...

					JACK
			We have two kids, Annie and 
			Josh...

		...Kate looks at him, half-mortified, half-
		interested...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...Annies not much of a 
			violin player but she 
			tries really hard. Shes a 
			little precocious but thats 
			only because she says whats 
			on her mind. And when she 
			smiles...

		Jack shakes his head, remembering, fighting back the 
		tears...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And Josh...he has your eyes. 
			He doesnt say much but we 
			know hes smart...
				(lost in the memory)
			...hes always got his eyes 
			open, always watching us...
			sometimes you can look at 
			him and just know that hes 
			learning something new...
			its like witnessing a 
			miracle...

		Kates expression has sifted from annoyance to 
		curiosity.

					JACK (CONTD)
			...the house is a mess, but 
			its ours...
				(chuckling)
			...well, after a hundred 
			twenty two more payments 
			it will be...

		Jack begins walking slowly toward Kate...the world of 
		the airport going on around him, Jack not caring...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And you...youre a non-
			profit lawyer. Thats right, 
			completely non-profit. But 
			that doesnt seem to bother 
			you...

		Kate raises an eyebrow. Its something shes thought 
		about.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And were in love. After 
			thirteen years of marriage 
			were still unbelievably 
			in love...
				(with a chuckle)
			You wont even let me touch 
			you until Ive said it...

		Jack gets closer and closer...Kates spellbound now... 
		imagining the picture Jacks painting...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...I sing to you...not all 
			the time but definitely on 
			special occasions...

		Jack walks into a piece of carry-on luggage sitting by a 
		row of passengers...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(off hand, to passenger)
			Excuse me...
				(to Kate)
			We made a lot of sacrifices, 
			dealt with our share of 
			surprises, but we stayed 
			together...

		Jacks nearly there...

					JACK (CONTD)
			You see, youre a better 
			person than I am...

		Not in this life, and Kate knows it...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...and it made me a better 
			person to be around you...

		Kate is perfectly still, Jacks words echoing in her 
		ears.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Maybe it was all a 
			dream. Maybe I went to 
			bed one lonely night in 
			December and imagined it 
			all. But I swear, 
			nothings ever felt more 
			real to me...

		Hes right in front of her. She cant take her eyes 
		off him.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And if you get on that 
			plane right now, itll 
			disappear forever.

		Silence. Jack and Kate in their own little 
		world...airport business going on around them...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I know we can both go on 
			with our lives. And wed 
			both be fine. But Ive 
			seen what we can be like 
			together...And I choose 
			us...

		Jacks words resonate in her ears. He gently touches a 
		hand to her arm...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Please, Kate, one cup of 
			coffee. You can always go 
			to Paris. Just please, not 
			tonight...

		She stands there, frozen, staring into Jacks eyes, 
		searching for the answer.

					KATE
			Okay, Jack...

		DISSOLVE TO:

	131	INT. AIRPORT - LATE NIGHT

		Jack and Kate, framed in the window of a nearly empty 
		airport coffee shop...through the window, we see snow 
		falling outside.

		From a distance we see them...TALKING and LAUGHING over 
		a cup of coffee...

		FADE OUT.
