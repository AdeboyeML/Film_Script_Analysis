          1   EXT. HALFWAY HOUSE PORCH. DAY                               1

          
              KYM, a darkly beautiful girl in her early 20's, is smoking
              furiously on the porch of an URBAN HALFWAY HOUSE. She glances
              impatiently at her watch and presses her ear to her cell
              phone. As she exhales, WE HEAR the rumble of thunder.

          
              Irritated, she crams her cell phone into her bag.
              ROSA a halfway house staff nurse is patiently handling
              WALTER, an irate patient who is screeching...

                                  WALTER
                        I want my fucking Zippo now!
              Walter starts yanking at his hair.

          

                                  ROSA
                        Walter, that is a behavior...

                                  WALTER
                            (raking his nails against
                             his forearm)
                        Fuck you!

                                  ROSA
                        And you are making a choice.
              Her cell phone rings...

          

                                  ROSA
                            (to Walter)
                        Hold on...Hello?

                                  WALTER
                        God!

                                  KYM
                        Don't you get it yet, Waldo? She's
                        making a choice not to give you
                        your lighter because you'll torch
                        the Self-Help library again.

          

                                  WALTER
                        I'm Walter. Kill anybody recently?
                        Run anybody over with a fucking
                        car?

          
              Kym grinds her cigarette under her heel and blows smoke but
              gives no signal that she's heard anything. She yanks her cell
              phone out of her bag as...

          
              A tan Mercedes STATION WAGON pulls up in front of the House.

          

          

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                      ROSA
                               (to Kym)
                           That them?

                                     KYM
                           Yes. Finally.

          
              Rosa takes two of Kym's several bags. They are oddly matched.
              A Coach tote, a fake Prada, a Gristedes bag, and a World
              Wildlife Fund tote bag.

          

                                     WALTER
                           You're not letting her get behind
                           the wheel are you? Are you?

                                     ROSA
                           Walter, you are only responsible
                           for yourself. (To Kym) This is all
                           your stuff?

                                     KYM
                           You know you never gave me your
                           cell number.

                                     ROSA
                               (sotto)
                           It was a mistake. I'm lucky I
                           didn't get fired. We've discussed
                           this. (She offers her hand) Good
                           luck.

          
              Kym doesn't appear to have heard her but she shakes the hand
              barely... so very, very faintly.
              Kym's dad, PAUL BUCHMAN, a tired, prosperous man in his late
              50's steps around the car and trots up the porch steps. He is
              wearing a big smile and his glasses are foggy. They hug. Kym
              talks rapidly over his shoulder...

          

                                     KYM
                           Oh my god. Here you are. I thought
                           you were going to abandon me in
                           rehab. It's 12:30. You guys are
                           half an hour late. I've been
                           standing here with these lunatics.
                           You look so great.
              Paul offers his hand to Rosa.

          

                                     PAUL

                           I'm Rosa. We met last time you came
                           up.

                           Of course, of course.

                           everybody?
              CAROL, a handsome woman in her 40's, waves from the car.

          

                                     KYM
                               (loudly)
                           Hey Carol. How are ya?

                                        CAROL
                           Hello Kym.

                           So where's Rachel? Carol, where's
                           Rachel?
              Kym slides into the back seat as Paul loads the car.

                                     CAROL
                           Getting everything ready at the
                           house.

                           There is so much going on at the
                           house I can't tell you. You know
                           your sister's doing all of it
                           herself.

                                     KYM

                           My sister is bending the

                           No wedding planners or anything
                           like that. Just her and Sidney and
                           a lot of their friends. She is so
                           thrilled you're here. Is that

          2   EXT./INT. TRANSITIONAL SHOTS. DAY                             2
              The station wagon travels through a constantly changing
              series of environments as they journey out of New York City
              on their drive to suburban Connecticut.

          
              Right away though, Kym lights up a cigarette and Paul and
              Carol crank their windows.

                           helpers staying at the house?
                           Because after eight months of
                           constantly revolving cell mates and

                           been staying in your old room. But
                           she can move, I guess.

                           high school? She never did put that

                           for her.

                                     KYM
                           No offense, Dad, but you never
                           thought that was a problem for her.

                           They never get it together. There

                           hospital and you could never get
                           into the bathroom. They would cry
                           at the chocolate pudding and one of

              several late model cars parked in the driveway of the
              SPRAWLING, SHINGLED HOUSE. Young people crawling everywhere
              in the midst of WEDDING PREPARATION, wrapping garlands and
              hanging paper lanterns. A LITTLE GIRL tosses rose petals in

              Kym slams open the master bedroom door and finds her older
              sister, RACHEL, trying on her wedding dress with the help of
              her best friend EMMA. Radiant and sexy, Rachel glows like an
              angel in her creamy white and gold sari. Emma has pins in her
              mouth and a tape measure around her neck.

              Rachel and Kym squeal and embrace. Rachel is slightly awkward
              as Emma frantically tries to keep the billowing fabric from
              combustion.

                           In her fantasy, she was wearing her
                           hair up and very serious,
                           responsible eyeglasses, because she
                           was a world renowned judge at the
                           Winter Olympics for Men's Figure
                           Skating. And Elvis Stoyko was
                           skating in the finals to "Could It
                           Be Magic" for the gold medal. And
                           just when Barry Manilow is singing
                           "Now/ Now/ Now and hold on fast..."
                           there's this electric connection
                           between them and he stops in the

                           his spangly Neil Diamond shirt open

                           he reaches for her hand... and

               Kym stops a baby-faced NURSE.

          

                                   KYM
                         Hi. I'm here to pee in a cup.

          

                                   NURSE
                             (over her shoulder)
                         She needs to pee in a cup.
                             (back to Kym)
                         Someone will be right with you.

          

                                   KYM
                         Okay. I'm trying to get to a
                         meeting.

                                   NURSE
                         The meetings are over in the other
                         building.

                                   KYM
                         I know that.

                         Have a seat.
               Several people are waiting in chairs. They look at Kym.

               A DIFFERENT NURSE is waiting by the sinks examining her teeth
               in the mirror. Kym bangs open the door of her stall with her
               foot. The door swings back and Kym spills her sample all over
               herself.

          

                                   KYM

               As she runs up the OUTSIDE STAIRCASE Kym wipes at her shirt
               with a wet paper towel. She yanks open the door and a bird
               poops on her.

                                   KYM

               Narcotics Anonymous Meeting. Chairs, light. An ATTRACTIVE GUY
               is sharing. Kym slams in, frazzled and late. A few people
               look at her as she grabs a folding chair from a stack leaning
               against the wall and the other chairs slide to the floor with
               a huge clatter.

                         broke.
               The room breaks up. Kym struggles to rearrange the fallen
               chairs. She is pissed.

                                   ATTRACTIVE GUY

               Sweaty and fed up with Carol's bike, Kym cycles into the
               Buchman driveway. Paul has been watching for her out the
               kitchen window while doing dishes. He waves and yells to his
               wife.

          

                                   PAUL

                         I made you a sandwich, sweetheart!
                         Meatloaf!

          
               Kym's shoulders slump.

          
               Watching from an upstairs window, Rachel observes Kym wheel
               the bike up the driveway and Paul hurrying from the kitchen
               to meet her, carrying a meat loaf sandwich and a glass of
               milk. There is an awkward exchange of items. Paul hugs and
               mushes Kym and kisses her on the forehead.
               Rachel opens the window, calls down.

               Fiancee SIDNEY, sexy, compact, thirties, and best man KIERAN,
               are stringing lights all over the house and yard. Kieran is
               on a ladder. He is the same ATTRACTIVE GUY from the meeting.
               Sidney is completely wrapped, chest to knees, in twinkly
               white lights and he unspools himself as needed. Rachel
               arrives with Kym who is holding the aircraft carrier sized
               meatloaf sandwich that's oozing lettuce and ketchup and the
               enormous glass of milk. She holds them both like they're
               suspended in formaldehyde. Emma is working on her tan.

               Kym and Kieran, having SEX in the cavernous basement. It
               runs practically the length of the house and there are nooks
               and caves everywhere. An ancient sofa, riddled with
               cigarette burns, some futons, dragged down and thrown
               haphazardly in corners, Unicorn posters hideously and
               pornographically defaced, and squat jars of ancient household
               products (Oil of Olay, self tanner) filled with cigarette
               butts offer proof of years of inhabitation.

                            I think I heard that was the plan.

               A LAVISH BOLLYWOOD SOUNDTRACK PLAYS as Emma wraps Kym in
               lilac fabric for her sari-esque bridesmaid's dress. Kym
               examines herself in the mirrors of the private salon. The
               girls look like jewels against the lush fabrics, pillows and
               curtains. Rachel sits at a vanity trying on dangling earrings
               and shakes her head gently, the gems glimmer and sparkle.

                                   RACHEL
                         Isn't the lilac fabulous? You look
                         like a freesia.

                             (to Rachel)
                         I love the grey.

          

                                   EMMA
                         We're all wearing lilac.

                                   KYM
                             (heedless, grabbing the
                              grey fabric)
                         Look at this. I love this. It's
                         like a cloud.

          
               Emma looks at Rachel.

                                   KYM
                         You guys know how I am. I never
                         wear lilac.

                                   EMMA
                         It's good to have a principle.
               Kym ignores her.

                                   RACHEL
                         You wore a lilac sweater with a cat
                         face on it on the cover of
                         Seventeen Magazine when I was at
                         Fat Camp.

                                   KYM
                         Sure, but I got paid for that and I
                         was on horse tranquilizers. So why
                         aren't I the Maid of Honor? Why is
                         Emma the Maid of Honor?

          

                                    RACHEL

                            I wasn't entirely sure when you
                            were coming or even if you'd make
                            it.

          
               Kym looks sharply at her.

                            I wasn't sure if you'd have time
                            for a fitting.

                            Bullshit. It's a sari. You take a
                            bolt of cloth and wrap it around
                            you. Jesus Christ I've been home
                            one day and I can't get a straight
                            answer out of anybody.

                            I'm talking about Dad offering me
                            food every ten seconds...

                            No. He has to know where I am and
                            what I'm doing all the time because
                            he has never resolved his own trust
                            issues.

          26   INT. UKRAINIAN MUSEUM DINING HALL. NIGHT.                    26
               THE DINNER-- The forty-odd guests are now seated in an
               adjoining room at LONG TABLES laden with a GORGEOUS INDIAN
               FEAST. Yellow rice, red curry, vivid green and orange
               vegetable dishes, pink shrimp. Huge plates of Dosa and
               Brinjal. Candles flicker in lanterns shaped like lotuses.
               PHOTOGENICALLY STYLISH YOUNG SERVERS dressed elegantly in
               black and white hover around the family and friends as
               everybody makes total pigs of themselves.
               The INDIAN FEAST contrasts agreeably with the Ukrainian
               visuals. EVOCATIVE BOLLYWOOD MUSIC PROVIDES THE SOUNDTRACK.
               Kym, wandering on along the table like a nomad, wedges
               herself between Sidney and Rachel. Emma grabs an empty wine
               glass before Kym knocks it over.

          

                                      KYM
                            I don't know anybody at what's
                            obviously the loser end of the
                            table. Can I have your Chana
                            Masala?

          
               Without waiting for a response, Kym dives in with her naan.

          

                                      RACHEL
                            You've known most of those people
                            since the eighth grade. You always
                            pretend you don't know people.

                            Where's Mom? Where's our mother?
                            How could she not be here already?
                            I haven't even seen her since I've
                            been home.

                            She called a few times. She's
                            "running a little late but should
                            be here soon."

               She tries to catch a piece of Fish Tikka in her mouth and
               misses.

                            No thanks. Is there any krill?

          
               Emma blinks.

                            Just kidding.

                            I can't believe Mom would be late
                            for my release back into the wild.

                            And here I was thinking tonight was
                            about Rachel!

                            Rach, I forgot to tell you, Carol
                            got the helium tanks.

                            Aren't there some rules about
                            helium tanks?

                            She wouldn't have any idea what to
                            do with a helium tank.

                            Only on public property. I think.

                            Was. For about five minutes.

                            I help Sidney out with the business

                            Here's Mom.
               The girls clamber up. Kym brushes curry off Rachel's shirt.
               ABBY, the girl's mom, and ANDREW, her husband, enter the
               dining room. Abby is a beautiful, wise woman in her fifties.
               Elegant, ladylike and graceful.
               Andrew looks foxy in his Abby-selected Armani, but he has the
               shoulders and knuckles of a heavyweight. As the girls
               approach, Abby acknowledges Paul across the room but makes no
               move to go beyond an exchange of long distance little waves
               and tight smiles.

                                      ABBY
                                (to Rachel, embracing)
                            Hello, darling.

          
               A big hug. She turns to Kym.

               They embrace. Abby steps back but keeps her hands on Kym's
               shoulders.

          

                                      ABBY
                            You look beautiful.

                            Nonsense. You girls.

                                      ANDREW
                            Hiya Kym. You look great! Hey
                            Rachel!

          
               He kisses Kym on the cheek. Rachel gives him a big hug.

          

                                      RACHEL
                            Mom, where have you been? Is
                            everything okay?

          

                                      KYM
                            Wow. We were wondering if you got
                            the dates scrambled.

          
               Abby steps towards her daughters, taking them in.

                                      ABBY
                            Yes, everything is absolutely fine
                            now.

          

                                      KYM
                            Thank god. What a relief! Now the
                            party can really get started.

          
               Abby and Rachel look quickly at Kym.

          27   INT. UKRAINIAN MUSEUM DINING HALL. NIGHT. LATER.             27
               Kieran is making a toast. Dinner is mostly over. Waiters are
               discreetly clearing plates, etc. from the table, pouring more
               drinks.

                            I've known Sidney most of my life.
                            He personifies many of life's
                            grandest cliches, even as he
                            breathes fresh life into most of
                            them. He has never, ever "ceased to
                            amaze me," and only in the best of
                            ways. The magnitude of his artistry
                            and his business acumen are matters
                            of public record and delight. He's
                            been a great friend "through thick
                            and thin," and sometimes it's
                            gotten very, very thin -- but he
                            "stood by me" at all times, so it
                            is my privilege and honor to stand
                            by him on this profound occasion...
               TIME CUT -- Emma rises and bangs her glass with her spoon. It
               shatters.

                            Of course. I'd like to make a toast
                            to the happy couple because I want
                            to come visit them in Hawaii.

                            Well I would like to share with
                            everyone that Miss Rachel-before
                            she got her license or even had any
                            idea how to drive- out maneuvered
                            an irate, screaming cab driver
                            across 96th street to the East
                            river, handily avoiding two EMT

                            applying Cocofudge Lip Gloss in the
                            rearview mirror.

                            went out with him. Twice.

                            talked him down from his Middle

                            ended up using his radio thing to
                            call his dispatcher and recommend

                            So I spent a lot of time calling up

                            and apologizing to them for
                            bouncing a check or passing out in
                            the bathtub and flooding their

                            desperately trying to forget. I had
                            to call this one girl who was, I
                            think, fourteen, but I couldn't
                            talk to her because her Mom took
                            out a restraining order.

               Rachel, Sidney, Kieran, and Emma struggle in with several
               elaborately wrapped wedding gifts and leftovers from the
               rehearsal dinner, which they pile on the dining room table.

                            revolved around her disease,

                            Please. That's hardly news. You may
                            not know this...sure you do...the
                            only way to engage Dad in any
                            meaningful communication is to
                            start the conversation with your
                            name. "Have you heard from Kym?
                            How's Kym?" It resuscitates him. It
                            jars him into the moment. Like an
                            alarm.

                            That's unfair, Rachel. And
                            completely untrue.

                            lost the car again." "Dad, you're
                            never going to believe this, but
                            that check you sent me never showed
                            up and my landlord hates me." "Dad,
                            can somebody meet me downstairs
                            with cab fare and you're never

                            aged. I mean it.
                                (To Paul) )
                            Would you mind if I went to bed,
                            darling?

          

                                      PAUL
                                (kissing her again)
                            Of course not. I'll be up, Carol.
                            I'm just going to load the
                            dishwasher.

               Sidney intones the opening bars to Paul's heroic "DISHWASHER
               THEME". Paul raises the Cautionary Finger in Sidney's
               direction. Sidney stops with the music.

                            Let me help, it'll be quicker.

          
               Now the Cautionary Finger is levelled at Carol.

                                      PAUL
                            Don't mess with the King.

                                         CAROL
                            Okay,okay.
               Hands in the air, Carol leaves the room.

                            guys. Good night everybody.
               Kieran lays a manly, buddy hug on Sidney.

          

                                      KIERAN
                            Congratulations, man.

          

                                      SIDNEY
                            Thanks, my friend.

          
               Kieran leaves. Now it's just Rachel, Paul and Sidney. Paul is
               beaming like a klieg light.

                                      RACHEL
                            I've never been so tired in my
                            life.

          
               Paul gives Rachel a kiss on the cheek and mushes her face
               some more.

                            I hope it's okay, I told Mom at
                            dinner. About the baby.

                            Of course, lamb chop. I'm so happy!
                            I'm going to be a grandpa!

               Sidney mushes Paul and they attempt a hug and laugh and then
               they really hug.

                            I wish Ethan were here.

          31   INT. BASEMENT. NIGHT.                                        31
               Kieran and Kym lie entangled in the basement, sharing a
               cigarette, disheveled. The floor of this entire section of
               the basement is now covered with all of the carefully
               arranged mattresses and futons that were stacked down here
               before. All of Kym's mismatched bags have been moved down
               here too. There's a little lamp there now as well but it's
               not on. Only one of the small, cobwebby windows casts a
               dappled light onto the scene.

                                      KYM
                            That was such a set-up.

                                      KIERAN
                            She probably didn't realize she was
                            doing it.

                                      KYM
                            Ha! She's such an operator. Now I'm
                            the bad guy again. Or still.

                                      KIERAN
                            They're lucky to have you.

                                      KYM
                            Thank you! Otherwise they'd have to
                            pay attention to their own
                            suspicious lives. Nobody actually
                            wants me to actually change, you
                            know. What would they obsess about?
                            I'm like a blessing.

                            intervention. On graph paper. He

                            friend of mine actually rang the
                            door once and tells my mother, "Kym
                            is sitting in her apartment? With
                            the shades drawn? Doing all this
                            heroin and cocaine? And I think
                            she's going to, like, die?" And Mom
                            smiles and says "Thank you" like he
                            was speaking in Sanskrit.

                            You can't actually speak in
                            Sanskrit.

                            Exactly! I nodded out into the
                            poached salmon at Dad's wedding two
                            years ago and he told Carol he
                            thought it was jet lag.

                            I did that in soup once. It made

               loyal companion -- the secret hide-and-seek rooms, the
               mattress room, the scary little side rooms, etc...

                            to be providing the flowers. You
                            know how much that means to me.
                            They're going to be exquisite!

                            Yes, I'm sure, and that's so great
                            and so you, but you can do whatever
                            else you want, you know. I'd love
                            it.

                            Thank you, my sweetheart. I just
                            know I'd be one of those wedding
                            mothers who goes completely insane
                            about the hors d'oeuvres. Andrew
                            says I shouldn't be allowed near a

          36   EXT./INT. SCOTTY'S JAMAICAN RESTAURANT. DAY.              36

          
               A neighborhood place, but on the other side of the parkway
               from the Buchmans' neighborhood. Friendly, bustling, kids on
               bikes and skateboards, etc. Large windows offer a view of a
               stop sign, Fanny's Beauty Salon, Soul to Soul Liquor, a
               barber shop, etc.

               The restaurant is fluorescently lit, with a Jamaican flag on
               the wall and photos of Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, and Bob
               Marley. There is a counter at the front where you place your
               order and pick up your food. There is a Foosball table, and a
               pinball machine.

          
               Kym and Kieran are playing Foosball at the ancient table
               where someone has painted Jamaican jerseys on all the
               players. They are both viciously competitive and genuinely
               irritated with each other.

                            fiend but I love my horse. I don't

                            I've been clean almost seven years.
                            You could just ask, you know. Your

                            either. She's incredibly cryptic.

                            He had thrown away his shoes- and I
                            was like "Mom's going to kill me"
                            because I had no idea where his
                            shoes were- but he was so happy
                            about it. And he had his red socks
                            and he was running around kicking
                            up the leaves. You know in movies
                            where they show a person's high or
                            whatever and the camera careens all
                            around? It was like that. But fun.
                            You know. We were having so much
                            fun. We were leaping around in huge
                            piles of leaves. He buried me. I
                            buried him in a big pile. I was on
                            baby sitting detail. He was
                            pretending he was a train. So he
                            was charging through the leaf pile,
                            making tracks, you know? I was the
                            caboose. And he kept going "Coal,
                            caboose! Coal caboose!" So it's
                            time to go and we're driving home
                            and he's in his car seat still
                            demanding coal, and I couldn't
                            focus and I drove off the bridge.
                            The car went into the lake. I
                            couldn't get him out of his car
                            seat. He drowned.

               TIME CUT--
               Sidney has his sleeves up and starts to load.

                            Are you comfortable with that, sir?
                            I could spot you thirty seconds.

                            You young people should all go fuck

                            lies in lid placement.

                            Inverting the lids and stacking
                            them in the upper level is really
                            for amateurs. It's passe.

               With a flourish, Sidney presents a beautifully stacked
               dishwasher. Paul pats his shoulder somberly.

                            Clean out this machine please, boy.
                            So I can break out the whup-ass.

          
               Screaming all around. Kym jumps up and down with her arms on
               Rachel's shoulders. Rachel glances at her sister, laughing.

               A SWEET MONTAGE.

          
               Paul is loading the dishwasher like a champ.
               Carol and Emma are smiling and giggling.

          
               Kieran has his eye on the clock.
               Sidney trash talks from the sidelines.

                            senile dementia is an obsessive
                            need to organize.

                            I find it touching but ultimately
                            sad when the warriors of yesteryear
                            are reluctant to lay down their
                            plastic containers from Zabar's and
                            retire gracefully.

               Kym yanks open a cupboard and passes a handful of dishes to
               Paul. He begins to load them.

          

               CLOSE ON PAUL
               He has a bowl in his hands. We see the bowl is a plastic
               child's bowl with Engines and Cabooses all over it. Paul
               turns the bowl around in his hands like a steering wheel.

          
               It dawns on Kym that she's handed her father Ethan's bowl.
               She is stricken.
               Paul looks to Carol. He seems bewildered. The kitchen falls
               silent and Carol takes Ethan's bowl and places it in the
               sink, out of sight. She leads Paul gently out of the kitchen.

               She turns and leaves the kitchen. Sidney follows her. Emma
               and Norman Sklear step out onto the porch.
               Kieran takes the Ethan bowl from the sink and puts it quietly
               back in the cupboard and shuts the door. Kym doesn't know
               what to do.

               tries to light a cigarette.

                         ceremony. It's a way of honoring
                         Ethan, Ethan's... spirit, you know?
                         It will look really nice too,
                         mainly. Millions of little candles
                         all over the place, and one huge
                         rice paper candle - representing
                         Ethan - glowing near the couple.

               Kym and Rachel have foils in their hair, situated a few

                            brave. The way your uncle abused
                            you and your sister, and how it led
                            to your sister's anorexia, and how
                            you stayed up nights when she was
                            down to fifty pounds holding a
                            mirror to her face to make sure she
                            was breathing. I'll never forget

               Rachel's stylist is removing her foils while Rachel chokes on
               her Diet Pepsi and it comes out her nose. Kym looks nervous.

                            inspirational that you could be
                            there for her during your own
                            incredible ordeal. I thank God that
                            you came in here today. I never
                            thought I'd ever have the chance to
                            thank you. It was your strength
                            that gave me the courage to
                            confront my own abuse and help me
                            turn my life around.
               Rachel slams down her magazine and leaves the salon. Kym runs
               after her. Both girls have foils in their hair.

                            Why in god's name would you say
                            something like that?

                            It was anonymous! It seemed like a
                            good idea at the time.
               The three on the couch are stunned for a moment.

                            Dad, look at me. I'm right here.
                            I'm telling you that after Ethan
                            died I wanted her to get better or
                            just die...

                            Nice, Rachel. Thank you.

                            ...And Dad, she was lying and she
                            didn't give a shit about the rest
                            of us. Recovery can't work if you
                            lie. She knows that. I was
                            worthless to her. We all meant
                            nothing to her.

                            You're not worthless. You're my
                            sister. I love you guys. I need you
                            guys, but you don't get to sit
                            around for the rest of my life
                            deciding what I'm supposed to be
                            like. You weren't there. You
                            weren't inside my head when I was
                            fucked up and your certainly not
                            there now. You haven't got a clue
                            what I feel.

                            Kym, you took Ethan for granted.
                            You were high for his life. You
                            were not present for his life. You
                            were high. He was like a pet to
                            you. You drove him off the bridge.
                            And now he's dead.

                            all the love I'm allowed for this
                            lifetime because I killed our

                         Hello Abby. It's Paul.

          
               INTERCUT the conversation:

          

                                   ABBY
                         Hello Paul.

          

                                   PAUL
                         Is Kym with you?

                                   ABBY
                         No. Why? Did she go somewhere?

                                   PAUL
                         She left the house about an hour
                         ago.

                         Oh, dear. The night before her
                         wedding? What was it about?

                                   PAUL
                         Look, Abby, it doesn't matter. She
                         left the house. She took the car.

                            For god's sake Abby! I'm trying to
                            figure out where she went before I
                            call the police!

                            Well, last time you called the
                            police looking for her she was
                            upstairs, asleep in the guest room.

                            She wasn't asleep, she was
                            unconscious! And I'm glad I called
                            the police because it took twenty
                            minutes to wake her up and at least
                            something was being done!

               the dinner in front of them...even Emma appears to have given
               up. She is drinking a lot of wine. Paul returns to the table.

                         Abby hasn't heard from her.

          
               Rachel stabs her dessert with her fork. Her head is on
               Sidney's shoulder, she looks pale and exhausted.

          

                                   CAROL
                         She must feel awful.

                             (gently)
                         Excuse me, but when you're trying
                         to get better there's a lot of
                         pressure in rehabs... when someone
                         isn't ready to take responsibility
                         they create something, like an
                         Uncle Stan, to take responsibility
                         until they're ready.

                                   PAUL
                             (hollow)
                         Well, she's always been creative.

                                   CAROL
                         I just wish we knew where she was.

                                   SIDNEY
                         Paul, Would you like me to go out
                         and look for her?
               Rachel takes Sidney's hand.

          

                                   CAROL
                         You're getting married tomorrow. A
                         hundred people will be here.

                         where she might have gone?
               Everybody looks at Kieran. No one responds. The phone rings.
               Carol goes to get it. Everybody waits.

                                   CAROL
                         It's the caterer.

               Kieran, looking drawn under the fluorescent lights, stands
               inside the Jamaican restaurant staring out at the night.

          
               THROUGH THE WINDOW a beat up WHITE HONDA tears ass right
               through the stop sign and screeches on up the road. Kieran

          53   INT. ABBY'S/ANDREW'S HOUSE. NIGHT.                           53
               Abby is in her kitchen preparing tea, dressed in loose-
               fitting yoga-style PJs, hair still wet from her bath. A door
               opens behind her and Kym emerges from the bathroom rubbing
               her hands over her face.

          

                                       KYM
                            Ahhh....

          

                                      ABBY
                            You should call your father.

          
               The air seems to go out of Kym for a moment.

                                      KYM
                            In a minute. I need a glass of
                            water.

                                      ABBY
                            I've made some tea.

          
               Abby picks up the tray, leading the way from the kitchen into
               the living room. Trailing behind her, Kym looks around her
               mother's unfamiliar house -- the spaciousness and stark
               modernity of Andrew's house stand in marked contrast to the
               rampant folksy-ness of the Buchman house.

               Abby places the tea service on a low table in front of a
               sprawling sofa in the stone-walled living room.

          

                                      ABBY
                            Here darling. Sit down. You look
                            upset.

          
               Kym sits, pours and sips. Abby remains standing and tightens
               the belt of her bathrobe.

          

                                      KYM
                            When will Andrew be back?

                            Not too late. He's at a dinner.

          
               Beat.

                                      ABBY
                            I spoke to grandma today. She sends
                            her love. Is everything all right
                            with the wedding?

          

                                      KYM
                            Yes.

          

                                      ABBY

                            the trains on it by accident.

          
               Kym begins to weep. Abby remains still. Kym's weeping becomes
               louder and louder. She is having trouble breathing.
               Just as Abby reaches out to touch her...

          

                                      KYM
                            Why did you leave me in charge of
                            him?

                            I was a crazy drug addict. I stole
                            from you. I lied to your face. I
                            weighed six pounds and my hair was
                            falling out. I spent every dinner
                            in the bathroom.

                            You were sick.

                            there weren't any clues. I stayed
                            in my room for days. I passed out
                            all the time. Where were you, Mom!
                            What were you thinking? Why did you
                            leave me? Why did you leave me in
                            charge of him?
               Abby closes her fists and beats Kym with all her strength.

                            You weren't supposed to kill him!
               Kym curls up protectively and Abby suddenly stops.

               Abby swings at Kym again and connects.
               Kym punches Abby right back -- twice -- now she is on her
               feet.
               Both women stop, terrified, and look at each other.

          
               Kym moves toward her mother.

               mother's house.

               Windshield wipers. It's not raining. A curve in the road,
               squealing around it. The road forks twenty yards ahead, woods
               in between. Left or right? Kym drives straight ahead,
               careening off the road, smashing down a couple of saplings,
               losing speed, right fender smashing into a big rock --
               AIRBAGS blast up into Kym's face -- airbag deflates, Kym's
               head falls forward, bangs against the steering wheel. A tiny
               moan. That's it.

               concealed by undergrowth and trees in the foreground. There
               is no movement in the car. A Volvo station wagon drives by,

                            I'd hold both of them in the pool
                            and they'd take turns biting my
                            nose. Ethan never did that. He
                            preferred pinkies. Or knuckles...

          
               Sidney and Kieran chuckle appreciatively. Paul joins the
               laughter, pours some more wine.

               Rachel and Emma are curled up in the middle of the bed, spoon-
               style, with clothes still on. Emma is behind Rachel, lost to
               the world, gently snoring. Rachel's eyes are wide open.
               Carol swings the door cautiously open and peers inside.
               Rachel and Carol look at each other for a long time. Carol
               withdraws, closing the door behind her.

               The station wagon seen just as before. A couple of joggers
               lope by on the road.

          

          

          

          

          62   EXT/INT. STATION WAGON. MORNING.                             62
               Kym jolts awake as a STAMFORD POLICEMAN raps on her closed
               window. She is a mess. A black eye. A split, bloody lip. A
               gash across her forehead.

          
               The cop is simultaneously gesturing for her to roll her
               window down and speaking into his radio.

          
               Kym tries to start the car. No luck.

          
               The cop bangs on the window.
               Kym leans her head against the steering wheel. The horn
               starts blowing.

          
               The joggers, a couple of early dogwalkers, and a couple of
               kids on bikes are gathered by the roadside, whispering and
               watching.

          

                                                                                     78.

               NOW -- The cop is studying Kym's license and registration.
               NOW -- An AMBULANCE has arrived. Red lights flashing.

          
               The crowd of onlookers has swelled considerably.

          
               NOW -- The cop gives a clearly upset Kym a Breathalyzer test
               as PARAMEDICS wrap a pressure cuff around her arm -- she
               exhales into the Breathalyzer tube, her eyes darting between
               the cop, the cracked windshield of the car and the gawking
               crowd up on the road.

          
               TIME CUT -- The paramedic holds Kym firmly by the chin
               and peers deeply into her right eye. The other paramedic
               blots at Kym's swollen lip with a gauze and hands her an ice
               pack.

          
               TIME CUT -- The cop gives Kym her license and hands her
               an official looking form, which she stuffs in her shoulder
               bag.

          

          64   EXT. THE BUCHMAN HOUSE. DAY.                                 64

                                                                                   
               A truck towing the beat-up station wagon comes to a halt in
               the street in front of the Buchman house. Kym steps down from       
               the passenger seat, ignoring whatever the driver just said in       
               parting.                                                            
               The house is festooned with peonies and lights and WORKERS          
               hurrying about. Everything looks absolutely beautiful.              
               CATERERS are running from their vans into the house with            
               armloads of food, drinks, etc. Abby's flowers are being             
               unloaded from another van. Decorative chandeliers are being         
               carried inside.                                                     
               VALETS are setting up their car-parking operation (a                
               decorated picnic table) at the foot of the driveway.                

          
               Kym squares her shoulders and begins her long walk up to the        
               Buchman house, back into the chaos.                                 
               A CUTE VALET passes Kym on the lawn, carrying two paper cups        
               of coffee, dressed in an Indian military tunic. He takes in         
               Kym's disheveled and bruised appearance.

                            You hit Mom? You hit our mother?

          
               Kym looks completely desperate. She nods. Rachel's face
               contorts with rage as she steps forward and slams the bedroom
               door in Kym's face.
               Kym winces.

          
               Beat.

          

                                         KYM
                            Okay.

          
               Rachel yanks the door open again.

          

          68   INT. MASTER BATHROOM. DAY.                                  68

          
               Rachel has run a bath for her sister. She has removed her
               sari but not her earrings.

          
               Kym is in the bath. Her body is bruised and purple.

          

          

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

               Rachel dabs gently at Kym's face with a washcloth while Kym
               scrubs at her nails with a brush.

          
               She glides the soapy washcloth over Kym's back. She notices
               the word ethan inscribed within the design of the rose and
               thorns image tattooed on Kym's left shoulder.

          
               Rachel rinses shampoo and leaves and dirt out of her sister's
               hair while Kym brushes her teeth.

          
               Rachel dabs makeup on Kym's chin as Kym's hands tremble with
               the mascara.

               Back in her wedding Sari, Rachel wraps Kym in her
               bridesmaid's gown and puts some Lilies of the Valley in her
               hair.

               Kym nods.

               THE CEREMONY -- Guests, some standing, some in white chairs.
               The living room is festooned with wall to wall flowers. A
               canopy of cherry blossoms leads from the living room terrace
               to the opened living room doors. Sidney, looking stunning in
               a dove grey Nehru suit and a lavender pocket square, waits at
               the altar with groomsmen Kieran, Norman Sklear, and Cousin
               Joseph (now wearing full dress U.S. Army uniform)... and
               officiating JUDGE CASTLE.

          
               SFX: LIVE MUSIC -- "Here Comes The Bride" on distant electric
               guitar and drums plus foreground violin and gently chanted
               "Rachel's" and "Sidney's" by the assembled friends.
               Emma's smiling face fills the frame as the ceremony begins.

               Kym in her dress with her striped hair, split lip and black
               eye, trying to find her game face. The wedding guests are
               slack-jawed. Mrs. Williams (Sidney's mom) looks like she's
               passing a stone.

          
               Abby stands quietly with Andrew in the first row. She looks
               composed and lovely and has the tiniest hint of a bruise on
               her chin.
               The procession reaches the altar and the wedding party turns
               to face Rachel and Paul.
               Paul is beaming, walking his beautiful daughter from the side
               of the house and across the terrace to the living room. She
               glows in her white and gold Sari.

          
               They reach the altar of blossoms. Rachel kisses her dad's
               cheek and he hugs her. Things are set up so that Rachel and
               Sidney stand just inside the living room, facing the
               beautiful backyard.
               Kym reaches for Rachel's bouquet but Rachel has handed it to
               Emma by reflex. Kym tries to cover her gesture.
               Rachel and Sidney join hands.

                            Exactly.
               Everybody cracks up, especially Kym. She laughs a beat longer
               than anybody else.

               Rachel and Sidney are saying their vows.

                            I always just wanted to hear music,
                            and when I met you I heard you. You
                            are the most beautiful thing I've
                            ever heard. Thanks for marrying me.

               Rachel is crying. Sidney takes his pocket square and
               carefully dries her tears.

          
               Abby is drying her own eyes.

                                                                                 
               Rachel makes her own declaration to Sidney.
               Norman Sklear hands Sidney an acoustic guitar and Sidney
               strums it and plucks a delicate melody.

               Rachel -- have even changed into Bermudas and sweatshirts for

               A MULTI-TIERED WEDDING CAKE, WEDGEWOOD BLUE, IN THE SHAPE OF

               AN ELEPHANT, WITH TWO TINY PLASTIC ASTRONAUTS SITTING ON TOP.

          
               Rachel and Sidney are cutting the cake.

                                      SIDNEY
                            Is this mocha? Or chocolate?
               He samples the frosting.

                                      MRS. WILLIAMS
                            Baby Boy, let them take the

                                         SIDNEY
                            Okay, Mom.

                                      RACHEL
                            Yeah, Baby Boy.
               Rachel licks the frosting off Sidney's finger then gives his
               mom a big wholesome smile.

          
               Mrs. Williams shakes her head but she's okay with this.

                            Can we all do this together?

          
               Reshuffling as Sidney, his parents, Kayra, and Rachel, Paul,
               Carol and Kym each place a hand on the silver cake knife.

                            Mom.

          
               With nowhere else to stand, Abby lays her fingers lightly on
               Kym's wrist. Emma's AUNT JOYCE, a cool professional photog,

               SNAPS THE PICTURE.

                            them always invite us for dinner
                            because my new wife can't boil

               Rachel suddenly stands on a chair and bangs on a glass with a
               spoon.

               She drags Paul to the temporary poolside patio dance floor.       
               Paul is a fantastic dancer! Sidney drags his dad to the dance
               floor. He's dramatic and weird! Abby smiles politely at Kym

               The tent is fairly packed now with about 60-SOME ODD PEOPLE.
               Everybody is getting along fine. With a single dramatic
               gesture, Norman Sklear silences the band. Upon Norman's
               instructions, the drummer works his cymbals in such a way
               that the party-goers realize that something big is about to
               happen. Norman Sklear now gestures for complete silence and
               he gets it.
               Rachel and Emma grin madly at each other.

               Rachel leaps from her chair into Sidney's arms and he gives

               enjoying the carnival. Paul gives a little shimmy.
               Abby and Andrew are huddled together at a table, talking
               intensely. It's like they are blind to the spectacle.
               Kieran offers his hand to Kym. She leaps up, spilling her
               flowers. Kieran pulls her to the middle of the crowd. They
               circle each other. They come together almost violently and
               dance like there's no tomorrow. Kym's head is thrown back.
               Shoulders heaving, Kieran swings her around by the waist.

               HUGE WHOOPS AND HOLLERS!!!

          

                                                                 CUT TO:

          

          76   EXT. BUCHMAN BACKYARD. NIGHT.                               76

          
               The exotic tent looks beautiful out there in the sprawling
               backyard, reflections of the POOL LIGHTS shimmering off its
               sides. The whole backyard is enchanted -- with magically
               deployed twinkle lights, Japanese lanterns and other special
               lighting effects adding to the aura...

          
               "Rachel Loves Sidney" is being played in a mellow, super-
               romantic trumpet solo mode now by Christian Scott.

          
               An assorted bunch of guests have relocated to the poolside
               patio in their finery. The oxygen guy and his matronly wife
               are seated on a transplanted living room couch, talking
               intently to a be-feathered headdressed Dancer.
               Norman Sklear and Emma are sharing a stylish, quietly
               triumphant slow dance, whispering punctuated by gusts of
               laughter. Angela Paylin is out there too.
               Little kids are running around the lawn and a few are playing
               with OLIVE the Dog.
               Kym kneels at the far corner of the swimming pool, unnoticed
               by anyone. A wooden serving tray floats on the surface of the
               water, supporting a candle wrapped in rice paper. A couple of
               smaller candles surround the slightly larger one. Kym lights
               the candles, extinguishes the match, gently slides the
               illuminated tray out towards the center of the pool, watches.
               Kym rises and walks towards the house, looking for something.

                                      NEIGHBORHOOD GIRL
                                (to Kym)
                            I can do a handstand!

          
               She executes a truly terrible handstand.

                                      KYM
                            That sucked.

          
               The girl throws a rebellious dance move in Kym's direction.

                                      KYM
                            Ouch.
               The girl laughs and runs off.

          

                                                                                  90A.

               Kym crosses the back terrace and enters the living room
               through the flower bedecked canopy....

          

          

          

          

                                                                 (CONTINUED)

               where she finds Rachel and Sidney slow dancing alone and
               dreamy in the center of the darkened room, the walls still
               covered with the ceremonial flowers. A single candle flickers
               nearby.

          
               The dancers are oblivious to Kym's presence.

                            Hi. Where's Mom?

          
               Rachel has her head on Sidney's shoulder, her eyes closed.

          

                                      RACHEL
                            Taking a break.

                            How can you take a break from your
                            own daughter's wedding?

                                      RACHEL
                            Mom doesn't actually participate in
                            things.

                            And anyway, she hasn't even done
                            anything all day.

                                      RACHEL
                            I was thinking about getting her a
                            cat. Cats are really annoying. At
                            some point you have to deal with
                            them, right? Or they starve to
                            death and piss on your sheets.

                                      KYM
                            It's so nice here.
               Suddenly Kieran sweeps into the room.

          

                                      KIERAN
                            You can run but you can't hide!
               Kym shrieks as Kieran grabs her and plants a wet one on her,
               dipping her to the floor. They careen into Sidney and Rachel.
               Sidney grabs Rachel and starts molesting her.

          

                                      RACHEL

                            Stop! Stop you fiend!
               Rachel and Sidney fall to the floor writhing, sounding way
               too amorous. Then:

               The ceiling light flicks on overhead and Abby enters the
               living room. Blinking against the light, Rachel struggles to
               her feet smoothing her dress.

                            a marvelous time. Those dancers
                            were so beautiful. But weddings are
                            really for young people.

               Kym sees Abby and Andrew crossing the front porch through the
               window.

                            I can't find my cigarettes.

          
               Kym moves quickly from the room.

               Kym is heading for the front door, when Paul breaks away from
               a group of guests having coffee in the dining room and nabs
               her, pulling her into a conversation with a WEDDING GUEST.

                            Kymmie. Speak of the devil. You
                            remember Susanna Galeano.

                            Hi Kym.

          
               Kym is looking out the dining room window between Paul and
               Susanna -- she spots Abby and Andrew walking down the
               driveway towards the VALETS at the street.

                                      PAUL
                            Susanna has a public relations firm
                            and she just lost one of her
                            assistants.

                                      SUSANNA
                            Weddings. They're an epidemic. Your
                            father gave me my start about a
                            hundred years ago.

                                      PAUL
                            No, no. Hardly. Well...

                                      SUSANNA
                            We could definitely use an extra
                            body right about now. Have you ever
                            thought about Public Relations?

          

                                      KYM
                            The public is kind of afraid of me.

          
               Susanna and Paul laugh.

                                      PAUL
                            The firm is opening an office right
                            here in town, just in time for the
                            holidays. You could stay right
                            here.

          

                                      SUSANNA
                            Have you ever thought about P.R.
                            Kym?

                                      PAUL
                            Logistically it's just a dream. You
                            could stay in your old room. I
                            could chauffeur you around. You
                            wouldn't have to worry about rent.

          

          

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                            Have you already talked to Carol
                            about me staying here?

                                      PAUL
                            Of course. She's fine about it. You
                            could stay in your old room.

          

                                      SUSANNA
                            Why don't you give me a call on
                            Monday, okay?
               She hands Kym a business card and kisses Paul on the cheek.

          

                                      SUSANNA
                            Goodbye Paul. It was just
                            beautiful. Bye Kym.
               She leaves.

                                      PAUL
                            Suzy's first rate. P.R. can be
                            fascinating.

                            You always said it was stupid.

                            I meant stupid. Do you want me to
                            hold that for you? You've got no
                            pockets.

                                      KYM
                            I've got it. Thanks, Dad. I'll be
                            right back.

               At the edge of the porch Kym sees Abby standing in the
               moonlight at the front of the driveway with Andrew, waiting
               for their car. Kym pauses.
               Abby turns her head slightly in Kym's direction.

          
               Kym, in the half dark, watches her mother.

          
               Abby does not move a muscle.

          
               Kym steps off the porch.
               The valet pulls up in the car, jumps out.

          

          

          

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

               Abby fixes her gaze on Andrew as he opens the door for her.

          
               They drive off.

               The Absolute End of a Wedding. The place is a gorgeous mess
               of wedding detritus.

          
               The tent looks so lonely. A weary caterer packs away his
               trays.

          
               Kieran is talking and smoking with Sidney at the end of the
               lawn.

               A freshly scrubbed Kym, in her own clothes, takes a moment in
               Ethan's room. She collects a few snapshots of her sister and
               brother and stuffs them in her shoulder bag.

               As Kym approaches the stairs, Emma staggers into the hallway,
               bleary-eyed. She is in her underwear, heading for the
               bathroom. She stops at the sight of Kym. They stare at each
               other. Emma gives a tiny wave. Kym responds, heads down the
               stairs.

               Kym slipping quietly downstairs. She moves to collect her
               weird mish-mash of bags waiting by the door.

          
               Kieran is there.

               Kym looks back in through the window, sees her father awake,
               in his robe, tired, gamely tidying.

               A `98 maroon CAMRY is idling in the circular driveway out
               front, exhaust vaporizing against the chilly morning air. A
               cute two-year-old girl is visible in a carseat and Rosa, the
               staff nurse from Kym's halfway house, is at the wheel. The
               car radio plays quietly as Kym opens the passenger door,
               wiggling her finger at the little girl.
               Like a ghost, Rachel appears on the porch.

          
               Kym jumps a little.

          
               The sisters lock eyes.
               Kym looks pained. Paul is still moving around in there. She
               wants to go.
               Rachel floats down the porch stairs and joins her sister at
               the car.
               She takes in Rosa who meets Rachel's look with a nod.

          

                                      ROSA
                         Hi.

                         Will you tell Dad?

          
               Rachel nods. Kym is crying.

                                   KYM
                         I love your baby!

                         Me too.

          
               Rachel hugs her sister fiercely.
               Kym gets into the passenger seat but leaves the car door
               open.

          
               Rachel smiles her huge, luminous smile.
               Kym shuts the car door and rolls down the window.

          

                                      KYM
                                (quietly)

                                                                   (CONTINUED)

               Rachel mouths "Bye" and gives a little wave.

          
               The car pulls out of the driveway, Carol watching it go from
               the dining room window.

          

                                          THE END
