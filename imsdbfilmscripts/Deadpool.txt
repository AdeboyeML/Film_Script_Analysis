    OVER BLACK. Low volume, through a tinny speaker, JUICE
    NEWTON'S `ANGEL OF THE MORNING.'

                                                          FADE UP ON:

1   EXT./INT.   TAXI CAB - MORNING                                        1

    DEADPOOL, in full DRESS REDS and MASK, quietly FIDGETS in the
    BACK SEAT of a TAXI CAB as it proceeds along a CITY FREEWAY.

    Deadpool adjusts the two KATANAS strapped to his back. Rolls
    the WINDOWS up, down, up. Tries futilely to untwist the
    seatbelt, then LUNGES forward, locking it up. Rifles through
    a tourist booklet and tears out a HAUNTED SEGWAY TOUR coupon.
    The CABBIE, young, thin, brown, glances back and forth from
    the rear view to the road to the rear view.

                          DEADPOOL
                Kinda lonesome back here.

    CUT TO: DEADPOOL, WEDGING himself through the opening
    between the back seat and front. His two katanas don't
    cooperate, catching on the Plexiglas, stalling him mid-torso.

                          DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                Little help?

    The cabbie grabs Deadpool's hand and pulls him through to the
    front. Deadpool's head rests upside down on the bench seat
    as he maneuvers his legs through. The cabbie turns the
    helping hand into a HANDSHAKE, then turns down the Juice.

                            CABBIE
                Dopinder.

                    (still upside-down)
                Pool. Deadpool.

    Dopinder is remarkably UNAFFECTED by the lunatic in his cab.

                          DOPINDER
                Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?

                          DEADPOOL
                It's like Christmas Day, Dopinder. Been
                waiting one thousand eight hundred twenty-
                two days, three hours...

    DEADPOOL turns himself RIGHT-SIDE-UP in the front seat. He
    is YOKED to the gills and ARMED to the teeth. TWIN KATANAS.
    TWIN DESERT EAGLE .50 CALIBER PISTOLS.

    Deadpool grabs Dopinder's OPEN BAG of CORN NUTS. Dopinder
    isn't quick enough to stop him. Deadpool gazes out the
    window onto the city - a teeming, sooty urban sprawl that
    looks almost... pre-post-apocalyptic.

    Deadpool turns up his MASK. Dopinder catches a GLIMPSE of
    the bottom of a SCARRED face. And quickly looks AWAY.
    Deadpool eats the CORN NUTS. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. Points.

                             DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                 Nice.

    Dopinder eyes his DAFFODIL DAYDREAM AIR FRESHENER and takes a
    deep breath through his nose.

                           DOPINDER
                 Smells good, no?

                           DEADPOOL
                 Not the Daffodil Daydream.      The girl.

    A PICTURE of a young INDIAN WOMAN is taped to the dash.

                           DOPINDER
                 Ah yes. Gita. She is quite lovely. She
                 was supposed to make me a very agreeable
                 wife. Mom and Dad chose her rather
                 excellently. But Gita's heart has been
                 stolen by my cousin Bandhu. Bandhu is as
                 dishonorable as he is attractive.

                           DEADPOOL
                 Dopinder, I'm starting to think I'm in
                 this cab for a reason.

                           DOPINDER
                 Because you hailed it?

                           DEADPOOL
                 No, my slender brown friend... to give
                 you one crucial piece of advice: Love...
                 is a beautiful thing. When it finds you,
                 the whole world smells like Daffodil
                 Daydream.

    Deadpool's own heartbreak is palpable.        He takes another
    deep, cleansing BREATH.

                          DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                So hold onto love tight. Go at Bandhu
                hard. Get Gita back. Or else... the
                whole world will taste like Mama June
                after hot yoga.

                          DOPINDER
                And how does Ms. Mama June taste?

                          DEADPOOL
                Like two hobos making love under a
                drizzle of Limburger- I could go all day
                like this. Point is, bad.

    Deadpool chucks the bag of Corn Nuts into the back seat and
    pulls out his PISTOLS. He starts CHAMBERING shells into two
    magazines.

    Suddenly, he frantically pats himself down, like a Hollywood
    agent who can't find his phone.

                          DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                Shiiiit. My extra mags! I usually leave
                them right by the door so I'll trip over
                them! Someone must've moved them...

2   INT.   DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY                                          2

    A blind late-70's AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in a purple floral
    dress enters the front door, falls as she trips over an `I
    *HEART* HELLO KITTY' DUFFEL BAG of AMMUNITION, PICKS it UP,
    and CARRIES it OFF.

                          DEADPOOL
                No time. Not today.

                Ten, eleven, twelve... or bust.

                Right here!

    The cab SCREECHES to a stop on the shoulder of the highest
    FREEWAY in a massive INTERCHANGE of freeways. Dopinder halts
    the meter and hands Deadpool his CARD.

                            DOPINDER
                My card.    That's $27.50.

                           DEADPOOL
                 Oooo. I never carry a wallet when I'm
                 working. Ruins the lines of my suit.
                 How 'bout a crisp high five?

    Dopinder stares as he and Deadpool slap skin.        Deadpool GETS
    OUT of the cab.

                           DOPINDER
                 Be sure to... ask for me again?

                 And a convivial... Tuesday in April to

    Deadpool closes the door with a flourish.         Boom.

4   EXT./INT.    `THE RAFT' PRISON - MORNING                             4

    A bone-white ISLAND PRISON, affectionately nicknamed `The
    Raft,' looms ominously in a CITY HARBOR.

    Etched in helvetica into the prison wall: `No punishment has
    ever possessed enough power of deterrence to prevent the
    commission of crimes.' - Hannah Arendt. Below it, GRAFFITIED
    in RED SPRAY PAINT: `Until NOW'

    The prison's FRONT DOORS OPEN, and out steps a handcuffed
    PRISONER, 30's, ORANGE JUMPSUIT, broad shoulders, whip-smart,
    tightly coiled, with cool, dead-blue eyes. BURLY GUARDS
    guide him across a CAUSEWAY toward a CONVOY of Escalades and
    Ducatis on shore.

    The middle Escalade's door opens.       The prisoner stops.   The
    guards unlock his CUFFS.

                 You're someone else's problem now.

    convoy.

5   EXT.   FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY                                       5

    DEADPOOL sits on the edge of the highest freeway on the
    overpass, legs dangling over the side like Huck Finn.

                         DEADPOOL
               Can I get some fries with that shake-
               shake boobie? If looks could kill you
               would be an uzi.

    Deadpool is using some broken CRAYONS to draw something on a
    scrap of paper. REVERSE ANGLE to REVEAL a childish drawing
    of Deadpool SHOOTING another man in the head, brains blowing
    out.

    The victim's thought bubble reads: `OUCHIE!!!'       Even through
    the mask, Deadpool looks pleased by this.

    He turns to CAMERA:

               Oh, hello, Deadpool here. You may be

    AJAX, 30's, dead-blue eyes, broad shoulders, whip-smart,
    tightly coiled stands at ease on a cracked and blistered
    tarmac. Behind him, a HEAVILY ARMED CONVOY OF DUCATIS and
    ESCALADES. FOUR LARGE ALUMINUM CARGO CRATES sit beside him.

    A SERBIAN WARLORD, mid-50's, sharply dressed, armored
    BRIEFCASE in hand, climbs out. He is surrounded by ARMED
    GUARDS.

    The Warlord places the BRIEFCASE on the FOREMOST CRATE. Ajax
    pops the case... to find STACKS upon STACKS of THOUSAND
    DOLLAR BILLS. Satisfied, he closes the briefcase and hands
    it to one of his men.

    Both sets of armed thugs shift to ready positions.

    Ajax smiles calmly, but his free hand DARTS OUT and CASUALLY
    LIFTS the warlord into the air by the THROAT. Fingers find
    triggers on both sides.

                 following month. Say, ten percent off
                 for the inconvenience?

    The Warlord manages to nod in acquiescence.       Ajax smiles
    again, lowers him gasping to the ground.

    From BEHIND, the Escalade BUCKS and BOUNCES down the road on
    its suspension, almost CARTOON-LIKE.

    A brutal punch spins Deadpool UPSIDE-DOWN, and he rolls with
    it, uses his FEET to BREAK the man's NECK. The other man
    stomps on his head, then drags him up and SMUSHES Deadpool's
    face into the seat's premium trim.

    Deadpool HURLS the man through THROUGH the TAILGATE WINDOW.

    The man clutches the TAILGATE, DRAGGED behind the S.U.V.
    Deadpool sticks his head between the two guys in FRONT.

                 Ow.   Ow.   Ow. Ow. Ow.

    Deadpool squirms away and WRESTLES VIOLENTLY with the guy in
    the PASSENGER SEAT.

    He GRABS the PASSENGER SEAT-BELT, TIES it around the guy's
    ANKLE, and KICKS him out the PASSENGER SIDE DOOR. The guy's
    HEAD and SHOULDERS SMACK pavement, where he's DRAGGED
    mercilessly by his ANKLE - a modern COWBOY whose boot just
    got stuck in his horse's STIRRUP.

    Deadpool grabs the driver by the HAIR on the BACK of his HEAD
    and BANGS his FOREHEAD into:

    The horn. HONK. HONK. The stereo. Every time the driver's
    forehead SMACKS the face of the stereo, the RADIO STATION
    CHANGES:

    MARIACHI. DR. DREW. MONSTER TRUCK COMMERCIAL ('SUNDAY,
    SUNDAY, SUNDAY!'). One more SMACK to get us back to
    MARIACHI.

    Deadpool looks in the REAR VIEW MIRROR to see the man in back
    CRAWL up the tailgate.

    Deadpool PUSHES in the Cadillac's CIGARETTE LIGHTER.

    Back to the DRIVER. Deadpool BASHES his face into the
    DRIVER's SIDE WINDOW. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.

    We're now OUTSIDE the Escalade, seeing the driver's
    expression take on a ridiculous silly-putty-esque grimace of
    pain every time it's MUSHED into the glass.

    The man in back scrambles forward. The CIGARETTE LIGHTER
    POPS OUT. Deadpool YANKS the EMERGENCY BRAKE. The man in
    back LAUNCHES forward and SMACKS the DASHBOARD.

    Deadpool STABS the now ORANGE-HOT lighter into the man's
    forehead, burning the COIL PATTERN into his skin. The man
    SCREAMS.

    his hand over it.

      The man hollers in muffled agony. A MOTORCYCLE has pulled
      AHEAD of the ESCALADE and now sits, STOPPED, in its path.

      The helmeted RIDER OPENS FIRE with a SUB-MACHINE GUN.

      Deadpool has one hand grasped on the back of the driver's
      neck, still mashing his face into the window glass, and the
      OTHER hand still clamped over the second man's mouth. He
      plants both FEET on the steering wheel and `drives,' spinning
      the wheel, sending the S.U.V. into...

      ...a ROLL.    The Escalade goes ENDO, SOMERSAULTING WILDLY.

      Suddenly, the ACTION BEGINS TO SLOW...

      The motorcycle RIDER tries to bail out. NO LUCK. The
      tumbling Escalade PLOWS RIGHT INTO him AND his bike.

      Parts scatter off the motorcycle, including its CHAIN. The
      RIDER continues to SQUEEZE off ROUNDS as he goes FLYING.

      Inside the Escalade, Deadpool goes SPIN-CYCLE. The DRIVER
      flies through the sunroof, tearing out its remaining glass.
      BLOOD spatters. The other man spits out the glowing
      CIGARETTE LIGHTER. The guy whose ankle is still tangled in
      the seat-belt FLAILS through the air like a rag-doll, AHAB
      tied to MOBY DICK.

      The action CONTINUES to SLOW... until it FREEZES.

      The camera swoops in to Deadpool's face, upside down.

      HE TURNS HIS HEAD TO CAMERA FOR THE FIRST TIME, BREAKING THE
      FOURTH WALL, THE ONLY THING IN THE SCENE THAT'S MOVING:

                              DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                   Shit.   Did I leave the stove on?

      We RAMP back UP to FULL SPEED. The S.U.V. CARTWHEELS. The
      guy's ankle untangles from the seat-belt. He FLIES high
      toward a big HIGHWAY EXIT SIGN and... SPLAT... out of frame.

      The RIDER's NECK is SLICED by the flying MOTORCYCLE CHAIN.

      The DRIVER is half-way out the SUNROOF when the S.U.V. rolls
      over him. SQUISH.

      The man who ate the CIGARETTE LIGHTER now eats pavement.

      A BUNCH of MEN PILE OUT, each one carrying a BEASTLY GUN and
      POINTING it STRAIGHT at the disabled S.U.V.

      The last noise is made by one final dislodged HUBCAP, which
      rattles in little circles until it lies FLAT on the freeway.

      TWO SILENT BEATS. Then we hear the soft, ELECTRIC BUZZ of

    distance to this guy through a WITHERING BARRAGE of fire.

    The SLUG has LODGED partway in his FOREHEAD, having lost just
    enough momentum that it didn't make it all the way through.

    The thug sneers, plucks out the slug, wipes away some blood,
    and rolls up his SLEEVES.

                  Heya, Wade!

     We hear a STAB and a SCREAM.

     Wade winces as he continues on to the BAR, claims a STOOL and
     waves over the lone bartender - WEASEL, early 20's, geeky,
     glasses. Think Tom Cruise in `Cocktail.' Then think the
     opposite.

                            WEASEL
                  Wade Wilson, Patron Saint of the Pitiful.

                  The drink, moose-knuckle.     But first...

     Wade digs in a pocket, slaps the YELLOW `HIT' CARD, the one
     with the CYPRESS TREE, on the bar.

     Weasel goes to the register. Scans the card. Peels off
     three ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. Lays them out like a bank
     teller. Wade PUSHES the MONEY AWAY...

     Weasel puts the finishing touches on the drink, pushes it
     across the bar to Wade.

     A burst of laughter turns Wade's attention to BUCK, a BAD-ASS
     in a snakeskin jacket, has a crowd gathered round him, mid-
     story. He too is holding a YELLOW CARD with SIM and CYPRESS
     TREE.

               fooled by your tits. But the moustache?!

     The crowd CRACKS UP.

     Wade pulls out Gavin Merchant's wallet and teases out a
     TWENTY. He grabs a passing waitress, tucks the bill in her
     shirt pocket and sets the blowjob on her tray.

                         WADE
               Kelly, you mind taking this over to Buck?

               Little foreplay.

     Weasel follows Wade's gaze to the end of the bar, where a
     chuckling BOOTHE wraps a bandage around the guy's bloody
     hand.

     Wade finally turns around to watch. BUCK finishes off
     Boothe... then pours the BLOW-JOB on top of him.

     WEASEL grabs a hand mirror, hops over the bar, and crosses to
     Boothe. All the PATRONS fall HUSH as WEASEL holds the mirror
     to Boothe's mouth. Boothe's BREATH FOGS it up.

     the richest treasure.

     Wade turns to look at Vanessa, who's also staring at the boy.

     Even though Vanessa is healthy, she, too, looks sick. No
     makeup. Dirty hair. Dark circles under her eyes. When she
     looks at Wade, it's clear she, not he, most needs comfort.

     Wade pulls Vanessa close and strokes her hair with a
     trembling hand. Abe disappears. Wade watches with a newly
     dark look of suspicion.
                                                                      46.

25   INT.   OPERATING ROOM - DAY - PAST                                     25

     ABE lies shirtless on an UNSANITARY operating table, a tray
     of RUSTY surgical KNIVES nearby.

     A MAN with a pock-marked face stands over him in a white lab
     coat with blue-stitched cursive writing: `Dr. Delgado.'

                          DOCTOR
                Buenos días, Señor Abe.

     `Doctor' Delgado pokes and prods with his fingers, as if
     Abe's mid-section is Play-Doh.

                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                Voy a llegar dentro de tu cuerpo.

                             ABE
                I'm sorry.     No hablo español, doc.

     The doctor's other hand dips below the table, comes up
     dripping with something bloody. He kneeds at wrinkled skin
     smearing the CHICKEN BLOOD across Abe's flesh.

                          DOCTOR
                De que se cure! Señor Abe, you are
                cured.

     The doctor holds SMELLING SALTS under Abe's nose. His closed
     eyes jerk open to see the doctor's gloved hand CLUTCHING a
     huge, bloody `TUMOR.'

     Abe pushes himself up, peers down at his bloody abdomen with
     awe. The doctor wipes the blood away and helps him up.

                          ABE
                    (tearing up)
                Thank you. I owe you my life.

     As Abe shuffles out, the doctor turns away to dump the
     `tumor' in the trash and wash his bloody hands in a basin.

                          DOCTOR
                    (over his shoulder)

     standing in the OPEN DOOR of the room, looking DANGEROUS.

                  So sorry, you surprise me. How...
                  long... you standing there, Señor?

     Wade walks slowly TOWARD the doctor, who steps out nervously
     from BEHIND his table. The two stand face-to-face. Wade
     smiles... angles his foot UNDER the OPERATING TABLE...

     ...and uses it to SLIDE something out from underneath the
     table: a BUCKET of BLOODY CHICKEN GIZZARDS that double as
     removed `tumors.' Wade's RAGE seems to grow by the INSTANT.

                            WADE
                  Long enough...

     Delgado senses he is suddenly in danger, picks up a rusty
     SCALPEL from his tray. Wade moves toward him. Delgado
     LUNGES, He STABS WADE in the shoulder, then RUNS.

     Wade TACKLES him. In Wade's weakened state, the fight
     becomes an intense STRUGGLE. The two FALL and WRESTLE. The
     BUCKET of GIZZARDS overturns. They roll around in slop.

     The doctor squirms out of Wade's grasp and crawls into the
     hallway. Wade wriggles after him, tugging at his ankle.

     The MUZAC still plays. VANESSA smiles warmly/sadly at the
     little BOY, who is unwrapping his CHUPACHUP.

     Suddenly... a SCREAM and cries for help in Spanish. The
     NURSE and an ALARMED VANESSA rush toward the shouting.

     At last, WADE's fury has overcome his physical weakness. He
     straddles the DOCTOR's CHEST. His expression is that of a
     man who's LOSING his SHIT.

     Wade RAISES THE SCALPEL, SLASHES at the doctor's throat, then
     STABS him in the heart. The doctor writhes, spasms, gurgles,
     and falls still.

     Chest heaving, Wade raises his head to see... at the FAR END
     of the HALL:

     VANESSA - frozen, TERRIFIED. A blood-soaked Wade locks eyes
     with her and swims back up into SANITY... `What have I done?'
     This is a horrific glimpse into Wade's murderous past...

     ...and the look on Vanessa's face is one of HORROR and PAIN.

     Awash in shame, Wade staggers to his feet, slips on chicken
     blood, and LUNGES in the other direction. He hits the door
     at the end of the hall at a RUN.

28   STAB!                                                                  28

     her... he melts into the busy street.

                  Some kind of anger can't be managed.

                  dismembered! That said... when it comes
                  time to licking wounds... there's no
                  place like home, and I share that home
                  with someone you met, the old blind lady
                  from the laundromat, Al. She's like
                  Robin to my Batman. Except she's old.

     WADE, ghastly, nearing death, lies BACK onto a STRETCHER,
     covered only by a FLIMSY HOSPITAL GOWN. He's being wheeled
     down a dim corridor by two tough-looking ORDERLIES.

     In one hand, he holds the recruiter's crumpled BUSINESS CARD.
     In the other, he clutches the limited edition VOLTRON RING,

     They turn a corner and push through a pair of double doors
     into a cavernous room. Wade looks around, full of hope for a
     new life. Immediately, every single thing he sees/hears
     begins to erode his confidence. The RECRUITER stands just
     inside the doors, smiling.

     The `Workshop,' as this old warehouse is affectionately
     called, has been converted into a working LABORATORY.

     Wade is wheeled through a vast room containing rows of
     individual `tents,' each containing a SUBJECT. Wade's eyes
     DART to helpless SILHOUETTES.

     We hear WHISPERS, WHIMPERS, MOANS.

     A FELLOW PATIENT, a pathetic, terrified little man named
     CUNNINGHAM, is wheeled past Wade, restrained on another
     STRETCHER. Cunningham briefly locks eyes with Wade, but
     quickly moves on by.

     Wade can't help but be alarmed by the TERROR in Cunningham's
     eyes.

     The tents are illuminated by BLINDING overhead lights.             Wade
     spies GRUESOMELY INTIMIDATING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.

     Wade is wheeled into the tent that's his new home. The
     FIGURE who was pushing Wade DUMPS him onto a CHROME OPERATING
     TABLE and roughly STRAPS him down.

     Wade DOUBLE-TAKES at the sight of the figure above him:
     ANGEL DUST - thirties, female, tall, sexy, athletic - an
     Amazonian warrior in another age.

     Angel Dust wheels over a high-tech I.V. DRIP, complete with
     glass cylindrical tanks housing a glowing, viscous LIQUID.

     Then she roughly straps Wade's NECK to the table. Wade
     nearly GASPS, the color now officially drained from his face.

     table 45 degrees, then readies a holographic monitor.

               The Workshop is not a government program.

      Night.   Eerily DARK, SILENT.

      An extreme CLOSE-UP of Wade's hand, nails clenched into the
      surface of whatever he's lying on. Is his skin... actually
      BUBBLING?

      Two MEN enter the tent and stand over the PUNCH-BOWL.

      CLICK. One of the men turns on a surgical light overhead,
      revealing himself to be a KINDLY-looking DOCTOR, avuncular,
      thick glasses. Next to him is an ORDERLY. The doctor peers
      through the Punch-Bowl's lid. He is SURPRISED by what he
      sees. He nods to the orderly: `Go on, hurry.'

      The orderly quickly unlocks and unlatches the lid, then
      swings it OPEN. Air RUSHES INTO the PUNCH-BOWL. The orderly
      steps away, leaving the doctor alone in the room.

      WADE, hidden in darkness, gasps as though surfacing after
      being held underwater.

      The doctor casts a SHADOW over WADE's face inside.         The
      doctor is FASCINATED, ENLIVENED.

                           DOCTOR
                 Mr. Wilson... these results are
                 remarkable.

      Wade takes deep LUNGS-FUL of AIR.

      Wade grows choked up. The doctor is taken with empathy and
      affection. He tenderly brushes the hair off Wade's forehead,
      of which the camera catches the tiniest glimpse. Wade's skin
      is not RIGHT somehow.

                             DOCTOR

      The doctor slowly exits.     Wade lies there.    Actually relaxes.

                teach you than to close this lid... and
                keep torturing you stupid.

      Ajax SLAMS the lid shut, LATCHES and LOCKS it. The hissing
      resumes. Wade's eyes grow wide. He starts to slip-slide
      toward absolute ANGUISH.

      reveal he's looking at his REFLECTION in the Plexiglas lid,
      checking for stuff between his teeth.

      through the glass lid, which has been newly ILLUMINATED by
      the surgical light above...

      ...and then RACKS FOCUS to WADE's REFLECTED FACE. Covered
      with HORRIFIC SCARS. Wade is no longer a handsome young man.
      He is a monster. Which is perfectly visible to him one foot

       Back in the PRESENT, we find ourselves in a huge SCRAP-YARD,
       where various ships, planes, etc. are sold for scrap iron.

       Among various vehicles is an OLD, BATTERED COMBAT CARRIER,
       long given up for dead.

       A heavy truck navigates through the heaps of scrap-metal and
       grinds to a stop in front of the carrier.

       Two heavyset MEN climb down and head toward the back of the
       truck, heave the heavy door open.

       AJAX and ANGEL DUST stand just inside, boxes and gear piled
       up behind them. They hop down as four more rough-looking men
       pile out behind them.

       Angel Dust drags out a WOODEN CRATE. The planks crunch as
       she digs her fingers into the wood and heaves it up on one
       burly shoulder as if it weighed no more than a sack of flour.
       Heavy AMMO peeks through.

                   Better to be the hunter than the hunted.

       Ajax and Angel Dust walk across the muddy yard toward a
       service elevator bolted to the rusting hulk of the carrier.

                 turned me into this freak... the one I've
                 been waiting five years for... slipped
                 through my arms today. Arm.

       Deadpool holds up his previously severed arm, which now has
       a little tweenage ARM emerging off it. Yes. Deadpool can
       GROW BACK LIMBS.

                 anyone else. So yeah, things are pretty
                 fucking scrumptious.

       the back of Blind Al's head... FARTS.

       Wade looks stunned as he struggles to process all this
       information. Ajax smiles down.

                    where's the fun in that?

       Wade says nothing, hating him but wanting to believe.

                    I'm going to close this lid again.     Maybe
                    you no longer need it. But I do.

       For a long moment, Wade stares intensely at Ajax and sees...
       nothing, a black hole of empathy. And he knows this is a man
       who will never stop hurting him.

       ***NOTE: We will not be reshooting the rest of the scene
       below with the exception of the final shot.****

       So he turns his gaze to the ceiling and WITHDRAWS into
       himself... the one place the cruelty can no longer reach him.

       Angel Dust enters, chewing on her usual matchstick.

     As Angel Dust EXITS the tent, she reaches to her mouth for
     her matchstick... only it's not there. She frowns, fishes
     another match from her pocket, and tucks it between her lips.

     Ajax finishes strapping Wade back down and goes to close the
     lid.

                  Sorry, Francis. But my lips are sealed.

     And then we're inside the punch bowl with Wade as the oxygen

     he was HIDING a SINGLE MATCHSTICK, clenched carefully - dryly

     He inhales... then SPITS OUT the match into his waiting PALM.
     Finally, he STRIKES it against the side of the Punch Bowl.

     Wade aims the now FLAMING match toward the tiny HOLE through

     A beat. Then the TANK EXPLODES.

     unbridled FEROCITY, is WADE.

     Wade brings the oxygen tank down like a LUMBERJACK'S AXE.
     Ajax BLOCKS it, but is driven to his KNEES.

     Wade's eyes are lit with fire. DOWN the tank COMES, again
     and AGAIN. Ajax takes his own fire extinguisher to the CHIN.
     Then catches a BLOW from the oxygen TANK to his TEMPLE.

     The extinguisher goes FLYING. Wade swings the OXYGEN TANK

     the OXYGEN TANK, GRAPPLING with every ounce of strength.

     Wade sweeps Ajax's feet and he topples over backwards, Wade
     on top of him. Wade lifts the heavy tank and slams it into
     his face. Once. Twice. Three times. CRACK.

     Wade drops Ajax and SPRINTS to Cunningham, starts dragging at
     the WRECKAGE trapping him, when... SLICE! A long piece of
     sheared REBAR THRUSTS CLEAN THROUGH his CHEST from BEHIND.
     The force sends the spear DEEP into the wooden floor beams,
     pinning Wade like an insect in an entomologist's display.

       An FBI-STYLE `ORGANIZATIONAL CHART' has been pinned on Wade's
       CORKBOARD in the lair. A `pyramid' of baddies are linked by
       strings. Each baddie is depicted not by a photograph, but a

       Second from the top is the RECRUITER.

       DEADPOOL questions a bleeding thug, more bodies scattered
       across a floor littered with broken furniture behind him.

       Another thug rushes in and smashes a pool cue over Deadpool's
       skull. Deadpool snatches the broken shaft of wood and PUNCHES
       it into the thugs belly.

       A third thug staggers to his feet, pulls a pistol, fires
       multiple shots point blank. Deadpool staggers back, blood
       blossoming across his white suit.

       In a BOXING RING at the center of the room two WOMEN pound
       each other surrounded by a scrum of a CROWD. Deadpool spies
       his mark in a dirty white suit pressed in tight ringside.

       Deadpool pulls his mask down, wades into the crowd, throwing
       men aside, PLOWING toward his target.

44A    INT./EXT.   MONTAGE - DAY/NIGHT - PAST                                 44A

       A highly pleased DEADPOOL holds up the-soon-to-become-famous
       MASK for the first time, ushering in... a MONTAGE:

       WADE, at SISTER MARGARET's, receives a YELLOW CARD with a
       Cypress Tree from WEASEL.

       He turns a LUCHA LIBRE mask INSIDE OUT to reveal the classic
       DEADPOOL MASK we all know and love. Puts it on. Then
       dresses - piece-by-piece - in the RED UNIFORM we've come to
       know and love. And at last, UNSHEATHES A KATANA. The sword
       TWIRLS, SLASHES, LUNGES into shadow. A HANDKERCHIEF WIPES
       BLOOD from the BLADE. The katana gets SHEATHED again.

       The same yellow card is now RECEIVED and PUNCHED by Weasel.
       Wade is paid in TWENTY DOLLAR BILLS. WHIP CREAM froths onto
       a shot glass. A BLOW-JOB is TOSSED BACK.

       Meanwhile, VANESSA plays SKEE-BALL wistfully by herself at
       the ARCADE:

       SKEE-BALLS roll into HOLES. LIGHTS FLASH. TICKETS CHURN
       OUT. VANESSA catches a reflection of someone STARING at her
       from across the lobby. When she spins around, the culprit is
       GONE. Vanessa SHIVERS... but it's a warm shiver, somehow.

       A HEAP of TICKETS slides across the prize counter. A big
       STUFFED ANIMAL slides into Vanessa's arms. Vanessa tosses it
       into an empty CLOSET inside her and Wade's former APARTMENT.
       Then stares out the SPIDER-WEB CRACK in the window.

       Back at DEADPOOL's LAIR, Deadpool places various suspicious
       accoutrements on the NORNAS COFFEE TABLE: an 8x11 framed
       photo of VANESSA. A BOTTLE of JERGENS. A BOX of KLEENEX.
       His BELT. His powder-blue CROCS. Deadpool kicks back on the
       FUTON. Smiles under his mask.

       CUT TO: BLIND AL, building yet another shelving unit,
       looking up with a grossed-out frown: `Am I hearing what I
       think I'm hearing?'

       Next, DEADPOOL finishes plastering hundreds of ADVENT
       CALENDARS he's purchased onto one WALL of his LAIR.

      When the wall is covered, he carefully pins the FIRST
      ornament onto the FIRST tree on the FIRST calendar.

      And at last, his MASK comes OFF and his HEAD hits the PILLOW.

      Instantly, the montage CRANKS UP its SPEED, with quicker and
      quicker EDITS.

      The visual totems that have just been introduced begin to FLY
      by... shorthand for the passage of time:

      Yellow cards are given, received, punched.

      Blades are unsheathed, sheathed, cleaned.

      Whip cream sprayed.     Drinks consumed.

      Skee-balls rolled into holes. Tickets won. Prizes earned.
      Tossed onto a EVER-GROWING PILE in the closet. VANESSA
      staring out her window.

      Jergens pumped. Kleenexes pulled.       Crocs discarded.      BLIND
      AL's ears plugged.

      Ornaments are pinned to calendars.      Lords a-leap.      Swans a-
      swim. Maids a-milk.

      Mask comes off.    Head hits pillow.    Mask pulls on.

      The images fly by FASTER... FASTER... FASTER.

      Whip cream. Skee-balls.     Crocs.    Ornaments.   Weasel.
      Deadpool. Vanessa. Al.

      `I NEED A HERO' plays faster and faster, too - higher and
      higher, like a record on too many RPMs.

      The effect is rhythmic... hypnotic...

      ...until finally, the montage REACHES a CRESCENDO.

      And then BOOM!    Ratchets back to REGULAR SPEED:

      `CHRISTMAS MORNING' has arrived. All the calendars but one
      are now fully studded with decorations. DEADPOOL plucks out
      one last STAR to pin atop the final TREE.

      Only it's not a star at all, it's AJAX's MUG SHOT clipped out
      from the old NEWSPAPER.

      With great satisfaction, Deadpool pins the faded photo to the
      last treetop. The music dies, and Deadpool turns to camera.

     This is as cool as Deadpool has ever looked. Muscles
     sprouting muscles. Katanas gleaming. Then, at the height of
     his coolness, Deadpool STOPS, sensing something amiss.

     DMX cuts out. REGULAR SPEED RESUMES as Deadpool looks down
     to spy his FLY DOWN. He ZIPS it UP, embarrassed.

     DOPINDER drives, head bobbing to a Bhangra Beat, HELLO KITTY
     DUFFEL still sitting in the passenger WHEEL WELL.

     On cue, Dopinder's CELL PHONE RINGS. Dopinder reaches for
     it, then fumbles it away. The phone falls to the floorboard.

     Dopinder looks ahead, sees the approaching traffic light is
     green, ducks down to make a grab, but when he returns his
     eyes to the road, the light is now red.

     Dopinder slams on his brakes. SCREECH! He manages to avoid
     the car in front. BAM! The taxi is REAR-ENDED, its TRUNK
     SMASHED like an accordion. We hear a HOLLER from inside.

     DMX KICKS IN AGAIN.      Deadpool strides forward in SLO-MO.

     As they near the carrier a dozen armed and armored MERCS
     suddenly rise from behind the piles of scrap metal before
     them. Assault weapons raised, ready to fire.

     The trio stops, Colossus stepping in front of NTW, sheltering
     her behind his armored body.

     Angel Dust LEAPS outward, falls like a stone, HITS the ground
     with a THUNDEROUS impact. The dust clears. She strides over
     the broken ground, smiling, READY for a scrap.

                             DEADPOOL

     BOOM! Without stopping Angel Dust throws a RIGHT HOOK from
     her HEELS. The punch CONNECTS with COLOSSUS's JAW. He goes
     flying, SCRAPING SPARKS ACROSS CONCRETE.

     NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD steps forward on Deadpool's right.

     NTW chews her gum. Once. Twice. Then runs TOWARD Angel
     Dust, LOWERS her SHOULDER, and EXPLODES UP toward her with a
     WICKEDLY THUNDEROUS BANG of ENERGY and SOUND.

     Yes, Negasonic Teenage Warhead is exactly that - a living,
     breathing WARHEAD - like her own personal CANNONBALL.

     It's Angel Dust's turn to go flying backward, smashing into -
     and completely trashing - a heavy metal shipping container.

     Deadpool is already moving as the Mercs OPEN FIRE, full-auto.
     Deadpool grabs the still-woozy NTW and runs to the nearby
     cover of metal scrap, keeping between her and the gunfire.

     Colossus, now back on his feet, strides purposely forward.
     Bullets ping harmlessly off his metal skin. Angel Dust
     charges forward, snarling.

     shaking force. The sheer power of Angel Dust's momentum
     slams them backwards into-and through-a huge pile of scrap.

     up boot knife out, arm whipping forward-

     The nearest merc's head snaps back as the knife buries itself
     to the hilt in his eye socket.

     Deadpool sprints forward, zig-zagging, leaping, spinning as
     he closes the distance to the mercs. He's moving too fast
     for their guns to track. Bullets chew up the ground behind.

     Deadpool reaches the first pile of twisted metal, slides
     under, comes up behind two mercs taking shelter there. The
     first man turns, gun barrel swinging `round. Deadpool ducks,
     sweeps his legs, grabs his gun as he goes down.

     Deadpool rolls over him, firing BACKWARD into the man's face
     while spinning up to smash his boot into the face of the
     second merc. He slides past, firing a burst backward into
     the merc's neck as he falls.

     Seconds later he's leaping OVER the heads of the next pair of
     mercs. They turn to fire up at him - too slow. He fires
     short, controlled bursts down into their upturned faces.
     BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

     Deadpool lands, tosses the empty smoking gun.          Then slowly,

     of steel. THRUST! SLICE! IMPALE! COMPLETE MAYHEM.

     Another trio of mercs rush around the corner, opening fire as
     they see their comrades fall. DEADPOOL runs toward them,
     flips and dodges like a whirling dervish, bringing GUARDS
     down in surgical, artistic fashion, as if where he's killing
     them means as much to him as how.

     Two men converge    on Deadpool. He JUMPS. Mid-air, he flips
     his TWO KATANAS,    GRIPS them upside-down like ICE PICKS, and
     STABS down in an    arc to either side, SKEWERING two men
     through the TOPS    of their HELMETS.

     Deadpool SPRINTS back toward cover, weaving, leaping, zig-
     zagging to avoid being hit. He dives behind some wreckage as
     more gunfire pings off the metal.

     DEADPOOL, pokes his head up, drawing a withering barrage of
     fire from the mercs above.

     Deadpool nods, then sprints toward her, springs high, flips,
     and lands on his back, spread eagled on the wing.

                         DEADPOOL
               Light the candle...

     NTW nonchalantly SPITS out her GUM, crouches, and... EXPLODES
     UPWARD. The wing LAUNCHES up in a shallow PARABOLA, Deadpool
     CLINGING for dear life on TOP.

     Four MERCS continue firing down as the wing soars up.

     The WING SMASHES into them.    All four go FLYING.       Two end up
     DEAD under the wing.

     AJAX is thrown backward.

     One MERC lands, stunned, close to the edge.     A LONG BEAT.

     AJAX rises to his feet.

     Then DEADPOOL pulls himself UP over the edge of the carrier
     and ROLLS onto the deck. He looks like he's been through a
     meat grinder - limping, scorched, bloody.

     Deadpool staggers to his feet.    The last injured MERC lamely
     tries to GRAB his ANKLE.

                         DEADPOOL
               Your plan to trip me to death?      Has
               failed.

     Deadpool nonchalantly STABS him through the back of the neck
     like a butterfly on a display, then turns to face Ajax.

     Twenty meters away, AJAX leans casually against... what else?
     THE PUNCH-BOWL. VANESSA is STRAPPED inside, lid open.

                  You two have a lot to work out. Take a
                  deep breath. Wait. Wrong choice...

     Ajax quickly CLOSES the LID and hits a SWITCH.         Vanessa
     starts taking short, desperate GASPS.

                            AJAX (CONT'D)

                  I hope they blocked pain to your every
                  last nerve. `Cause I'm'a go looking.

     Ajax squats down and picks up TWO STEEL-HAFTED FIRE-FIGHTING
     AXES, each with an ULTRA-SHARP BLADE on one side of its head
     and an EQUALLY SHARP CLAW on the other.

     Deadpool raises a KATANA and HURLS it NOT at Ajax, but the
     PUNCH-BOWL. The blade PENETRATES the PLEXI and tears into
     the RESTRAINT holding Vanessa's RIGHT WRIST, partly FRAYING
     it. AIR seeps through the CRACK. Vanessa catches a tiny
     BREATH. She TUGS on the frayed RESTRAINT.

                            AJAX
                  I hear you grow back parts. When I get

     A big BOOMING sound from below and then the deck of the

     A battered NTW RACES toward Angel Dust. Angel Dust swings
     the wing, but NTW BASEBALL SLIDES UNDER it and EXPLODES up
     into her chin.

     Angel Dust is lifted off her feet into the side of the
     carrier, BUCKLING some of its supports. NTW rolls aside.

     AJAX TAKES a MIGHTY, ROARING SWING with an AXE.

                Yowww!

     STEEL SINGS as AXE and KATANA meet again and again.        THRUSTS.
     PARRIES. SPARKS FLY!

     THUNK! Deadpool's BLADE passes through Ajax's THIGH and pins
     him to a piece of wreckage.

     CRACK!   Ajax tags Deadpool's head with the FLAT of an axe.

     SNAP! Ajax BREAKS the sword's blade with an AXE, not feeling
     anything as he slides his leg off the sword.

     GASP! VANESSA grits her teeth, pulls against the restraints.
     The thick nylon begins to tear as she saws it against the
     katana blade.

     CLANG! AJAX wields both axes in a red blur of painted steel.
     Deadpool snatches up a piece of rusted RAILING from the deck,
     barely blocks Ajax's windmilling swings.

     Finally, Ajax smashes the length of rusty metal from
     Deadpool's hands with one axe, while the sharp CLAW END of
     the other buries itself in Deadpool's FOREARM. Deadpool
     hollers.

     Deadpool's red suit has torn away, and the SKULL of his
     TATTOO bleeds from a HOLE in its FOREHEAD.

     Deadpool GRITS his TEETH and YANKS the AXE from Ajax's grasp.
     A spinning KICK sends the second axe flying after the first.

     Now they're completely unarmed.

     Inspired, VANESSA strains against the torn nylon. RRRRIPPP!
     Her right wrist TEARS FREE. She uses her freed hand to start
     unlatching her other restraints.

     DEADPOOL throws short, blinding PUNCHES - rat-a-tat-tat -

     AJAX snarls, drives a SHOULDER into Deadpool, then MOUNTS him
     and BLUDGEONS his face with HAMMER-LIKE FISTS.

     DEADPOOL is starting to LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS when he turns his
     head to one side and spies the PUNCH-BOWL.

     VANESSA pushes against the sealed door of the punchbowl with
     all her might. With a squeal of metal the latch breaks, the
     twisted metal flying off the lid as it slams open.

     Vanessa grabs the KATANA, jerks it free with another mighty
     effort. Then slides down the containers toward AJAX. With a
     fierce scream, she PLUNGES the blade into his KIDNEY. The
     blade punches through the other side but Ajax feels no pain,
     YANKS out the katana, and THROWS Vanessa aside violently.

     But it's all the opportunity Deadpool needs. He SURGES with
     energy and throws an THUNDEROUS UPPERCUT, BLASTING Ajax off.

     the blows, but her adrenaline and rage SURGE. She grabs NTW

     shuddering, groaning of metal the whole carrier begins to
     tilt.

     Loose wreckage begins to slide and tumble past. A shipping
     container barrels towards them and Deadpool kicks Ajax
     backwards, right into its path. SLAM! It plows into him and
     carries him with it as it disappears over the side.

     Deadpool scrambles and claws up the tilting floor and grabs
     hold of Vanessa.

     Deadpool looks around frantically...

     Deadpool grabs the side as it slides past and throws VANESSA
     inside and SHUTS the LID for protection...

     They slam into the twisted metal railings at the bottom of
     the deck and hang there. Deadpool swings by one hand and
     stares at the scrapyard below. Huge chunks of metal slide
     and smash past to tumble to the ground a hundred feet below.

     Ajax shakes off the cobwebs and examines the paper; it's
     Deadpool's CRAYON DRAWING of Ajax getting his brains blown
     out. Ajax actually LAUGHS.

               scientist type? You want the guy behind

                number 1! The guy behind the guy, Dr.
                Killebrew, off scot-free.

     A SILHOUETTED FIGURE approaches the bed of the nervous
     volunteer, who smiles weakly.

                          VOLUNTEER
                Can you make me better?

     REVERSE ANGLE to reveal whom he's talking to: the PUDGY,
     KINDLY-LOOKING DOCTOR WHO STROKED WADE'S HEAD IN THE
     WORKSHOP. He smiles, pats the volunteer's wrist.

                          DR. KILLEBREW
                Better than better.

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                But let's look on the bright side.

                You smell what I smell? I mean besides
                stale popcorn and my post-fight man-funk?

     Dr. Killebrew holds up a syringe with a glint in his eye.

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                Sequel. Maybe even one of those ensemble
                team movies...

75   EXT.   SCRAPYARD - RUBBLE PILE - DAY                            75

     DEADPOOL and Vanessa MAKE OUT LIKE CRAZY, LONG AND HARD. We
     slowly PULL BACK until they look SMALL against the toppled
     hulk of the COMBAT CARRIER.

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                So, `til next time, this is your friendly
                neighborhood pool guy saying... I'm never
                gonna dance again... the way I danced
                with you.

V76   INT.   SUBURBAN HOME - DAY - POST CREDIT SEQUENCE                 V76

      A hallway of a suburban home.    DEADPOOL enters in a maroon
      and gray striped robe.

                           DEADPOOL
                     (short version)
                 You're still here? It's over! Go home.
                 Wait... you expected a tease for Deadpool
                 2?! Sorry, we're low on dough. But if
                 you can keep a secret, I can tell you
                 who's gonna be in it. Cable! Someone
                 suggested Mel Gibson for the role, buuuut-
                 I was thinking Liam Neeson. Only
                 problem, Liam likes to get paid. And
                 more for Liam means less for me. Maybe
                 we'll crowdfund the shit. Just you and
                 me, kids. Shalom!

                 Wait... you expected a tease for Deadpool
                 2?! Maybe a little Samuel L. Jackson?
                 Sorry, that budget went to Weasel's
                 Ketamine habit. But if you can keep a
                 secret, I can tell you who's gonna be in
                 it. Cable! You're allowed to show your
                 pleasure. I'd love Liam Neeson for the
                 role, but Liam likes to get paid. And
                 more for Liam means less for me. So we'd
                 best crowdfund the shit. Depending on
                 your level of giving, you could receive a
                 Colossus-brand desktop steel-ball
                 clacker, a Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson real
                 doll, or four minutes alone in a room
