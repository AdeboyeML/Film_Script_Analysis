           He is 20, normal looking, not too nebbish, punkish, bookish,

           There's an old joke. It comes from "The
           Iliad," but I think it was popularized by
           Oscar Wilde. It goes like this:
           ...A bear's taking a shit, like, out in the
           woods one day. And he sees this rabbit,
           also taking a shit. The rabbit, wait, I
           mean, the bear, he's shitting up a storm,
           cuz he's been eating Mexican. The
           wiping's taking forever, and his shit
           keeps sticking to his fur. Wait, what
           happens next? Oh, right-- he asks the
           rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping. The
           rabbit says no, shit just slides right
           off him. So the bear picks the rabbit up
           and wipes his ass with him.
           (pause, as if for applause)
           Well, I never said it was a good joke.
           And see, that makes it perfect, because
           it's pretty much the story of my life.
                         
           We can now see that he's perched on a stool, wearing a REM t-

           Growing up, my parents were huge Woody
           Allen fans. Still are. Personally, I hate
           him. Same thing with the Beatles, such a
           part of my background that I must have
           been about 16 by the time I realized how
           useless it was to rebel by ignoring the
           Beatles or any other cultural artifact of
           their generation. Even if I did spend my
           childhood hearing my father go on and on
           about how, like, Nirvana would never mean
           anything because they're not the Beatles,
           blah-blah. I don't know, this is all
           starting to sound a little bit too
           angsty, you know, and that's about the
           last thing I'm going for here... Shit, I
           really got off track there, didn't I?

           Anyway, like the Beatles thing­ and this

           Oh yeah. This wasn't the first time I saw
           Annie Hall, but it was the first time I
           actually appreciated it. I was flipping
           channels on a Saturday afternoon, and
           there it was, and I was stunned to find I
           loved it, more stunned to find that my

           Oh God, high school. I hated this place.
           I was a Junior when I gave up trying to

           There was something in Annie Hall I
           identified with. Maybe it was the style
           of humor, or the defeatist attitude, I
           don't know. All I know is, I kept going
           back. Different people are inspired by
           different things, and my source of
           inspiration became a 20-year-old movie
           about a failed relationship.

           going to college was not an option. Of
           course, I brought Annie with me. Good

           A typically lame college party, still early in the night. The
           furniture is "student budget modern" type. A jazz record

           The problem is, every crazy theory
           explains something. I took a class last
           semester with a professor who claimed
           that the planet is being destroyed by
           white, male, meat-eating capitalists.

           But she had a theory that explained how:
           apparently racism, sexism, socialism,
           environmentalism, and vegetarianism are
           all inherently linked. I brought a Big
           Mac to the first class, and I thought I
           was going to be the victim of a vegan-
           socialist uprising.

           You don't get it, I can't do my show if I

           At one point you dialed a phone sex line.

           Yeah, it's like, for four dollars a
           minute, you should talk about whatever
           you want. You know the country's in
           trouble when a phone sex operator thinks
           talking politics is beneath her.

           Perhaps she'd been screwed by

           Check it. Jen traded shifts and got out
           of work, so she went to the lab to
           surprise Sam. He wasn't there, and
           then Tommy gave away that he was here.

           This is ridiculous. What other art form

           I, uh, I mean, the truth is, it's not a

           mean, he doesn't talk about it.

           Listen, Amanda. Scott likes you as much
           as we all do, so it doesn't leave much
           room for discussion. We mostly only talk

          Amanda takes the negatives, opens the door to a closet, hangs
          them from a clothespin, and leaves. Max takes his, selects a
          clothespin, and knocks several others to the floor. He tries
          to pick them up, and manages to step on them.

           things like "I love that you're my
           boyfriend," ya know? But usually when
           we're in bed or something. But this time

           watching TV.

          Or Prince, cuz, like, Prince's name was a
          squiggly-thing. But Mike wanted something
          powerful, meaningful, and above all,
          something you could type. Therefore,
          "Ampersand." It's already on the keyboard

           You have to keep yourself open to
           possibilities in life. I'm the first one
           in my family to go to college. Sometimes
           I can't believe I'm here, at a semi-
           prestigious university getting a halfway-
           decent education-- this has always been
           my dream. How did you end up here?

           I know what you mean, financial aid is a
           bitch. And the university experience
           itself is kind of disappointing. All
           those rich students with no idea how
           lucky they are. But I don't think about
           them. I think about me, I think about
           where I want to be someday: a world
           traveler, running some huge company, or,
           you know, doing some fantastically
           important work. And when the day comes
           that I can relax, I'm going to charter a
           boat, sail around the world, and see the
           Seven Wonders.

           didn't fit in. Like, she never just lets
           things be. She always has to know exactly
           what I'm thinking. It was sort of cute

           Who is he with? He never calls me

           I know something's going on. I'm such a

           I guess so. You know, we should try to be
           more exciting. Like the other day, I
           waited until the last minute before
           returning a video. And next time, I swear

           Not if you count this huge purse she had.
           She was rummaging through it and finally
           had to dump the thing out. I swear, I'm
           surprised Kennedy's brain didn't fall out
           of that thing. Anyway, it made me think
           of Annie Hall.
