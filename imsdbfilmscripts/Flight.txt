          EXT. SOMEWHAT SEEDY TWO-STORY HOTEL IN ATLANTA -- PRE-DAWN
                         
          It's still more night than day as we look down on the HOTEL
          ATLANTA. The lit sign for the HOTEL ATLANTA may be the only
          source of light as we hear a metallic rattle.
                         
                         
          EXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- SECOND FLOOR -- PRE-DAWN
                         
          We follow the metallic rattle to a door. The rattling stops
          and we watch the knob slowly turn.
                         
          Tight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces "hope."
          We pull back to find that both arms are employed in the
          pulling of what looks like a large suitcase.
                         
          NICOLE MAGGEN, a beautiful but tired woman, finishes pulling
          the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded-up massage
          table out of the motel room. With her bra in one hand and
          the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior
          2nd floor hallway of the motel, she assesses her situation.
                         
          She digs in her purse, lights a cigarette and continues
          digging in her purse. She finds a beat-up candy tin. She
          opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt
          foils, heroin foils, looking for residue. Nothing.
                         
          She now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made. She
          flips open her cheap phone and makes a call...she thinks
          better of it and hangs up.

          Toyota Tercel and slams it shut.

          We hear the electronic ring of her cheap cell phone on
          "speaker phone" mode. The phone rests on the passenger seat.
          We pull up to find NICOLE slumped with her head resting on
          the steering wheel. She is exhausted and irritated...
                         
                          NICOLE

           don't pick up...
           2.
                         
          A MAN answers with music in the background..."Yo.." NICOLE
          quickly picks up the phone.
                         
                          NICOLE (CONT'D)
           It's Nic, do you have any? Good
           morning to you too. You're what?
           Well, where are you guys shooting
           today? Where? Text me the
           address. You have some...Okay.
                         
          She hangs up the phone and catching herself in the rearview
          she tries to smile.

          The sun would be rising if the sky wasn't swirling with grey
          clouds. We see the American Suites Hotel and recognize it as
          a decent commuters' hotel near the airport in Orlando. The
          sound of a clock radio breaks the calm of our picture.

          Through the clock radio we loudly hear two morning drive-time
          radio personalities spewing nonsensical patter...
                         
          An attractive YOUNG WOMAN wrestles free of the covers and
          gets out of bed. She crosses naked through the room as a
          cell phone starts ringing.
                         
          Back to the bed as WHIP WHITAKER rises into frame and
          inhabits the room like a lazy ape at the zoo. WHIP wears his
          40 some years of life experience like a medal. Smoke hangs
          in the air and empty beers, a pint of vodka and two empty
          carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as WHIP
          snatches up his phone and answers...
                         
                          VOICE
           For the love of Christ! Look...just
           hold...HOLD ON.
                         
          He aggressively drains the last four inches of beer from a
          clear bottle and cracks the last fresh one that bobs in the
          hotel ice bucket.
                         
          The naked, YOUNG WOMAN bends over to pick up her clothes.
                         
          We witness her ass as a tanned glass vase with a perfect
          crack down the middle. Whip smiles, taking it all in...
           3.
                         
                          WHIP
           (into the phone)
           I've been up since the crack 'a
           dawn. What check? Tuition? How
           much does it cost to go there?
                         
          The YOUNG WOMAN has re-lit the last half of a joint and is
          puffing it to life as WHIP is beckoning with his large hands.
                         
          The YOUNG WOMAN, looking more like a stripper by the second,
          hands the joint to WHIP who takes a masterful drag. WHIP
          shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on
          the phone. He exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone.
                         
                          WHIP (CONT'D)
           NO! NO! NO! You decided he needed
           private school...lemme talk to
           Knuckles. He's not? Tell'em the
           phone works both ways. Oh he's my
           son because you need a tuition
           check...that's great Deana. I'm
           glad you tracked me down in Orlando
           at 7 in the fucking morning to
           shake me down for money. Does he
           even like the fucking school? No
           I've never seen it. Yeah I wonder
           why not too. I gotta 9 o'clock
           flight, sit tight 'till I get back
           to Atlanta. How am I a liar?
           What? No, I'll call you.
                         
          WHIP hangs up and continues to make quick work of the last
          beer as he stares through his thoughts and out the window.
                         
                          YOUNG WOMAN
           Was that your wife?
                         
                          WHIP
           That was my ex-wife. But you
           Trina, you could be my second or
           third wife if you'd just C'mere.
                         
          The YOUNG WOMAN we now know as TRINA smiles seductively...
                         
                          TRINA
           Whip, don't even joke about that.
           Our flight's at 9, let's hit it.
                         
          TRINA is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a
          white blouse as she hands WHIP his pants. WHIP can't help
          but pat that perfect ass as TRINA tries to skip away.
                         
          ON THE RADIO We hear the opening bars of a familiar rock
          anthem...JOE COCKER's "I'm Feeling Alright"
           4.

           headed. I shoulda ate somethin'.
                         
          WHIP leans over the motel table, picks up a soda straw that's
          been cut in half. He efficiently sniffs up a line of coke.
                         
                         
          INT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES HOTEL-ORLANDO-HALLWAY-MORNING
                         
          WHIP wears his pilot Blues and carries his hat as he strides
          confidently down the hallway. JOE COCKER continues to wail,
          perfectly narrating the hero's swagger that WHIP maintains
          while passing bad light fixtures and ornate wall paper.

          WHIP leans against the landing gear of the JACKSON-RIDGEFIELD
          88 PASSENGER JET -- He takes a swig from a small bottle of
          mouthwash -- gargles, then spits the green foam on the
          tarmac. WHIP wipes fatigue from his face as he stashes the
          mouthwash in his pocket, then quickly completes his visual
          walk around. He looks at the sky again as he steps on to the
          jet way ladder. His foot slips, sending his shoe SPLASHING in
          to a puddle.
                         
                          WHIP
           Son of a bitch!
                         
          Whip shakes the rain out of his shoe as he continues up the
          stairs.

          HARLING hands WHIP a pack of smokes from his pocket. He also
          pulls out a carton of smokes from his backpack.

          WHIP wakes up in a cold sweat. He is breathing heavy as he
          scans the room. LIGHTENING FLASHES from outside the window.
          Thunder RUMBLES.
                         
          WHIP looks to the night stand where we see a pack of nicotine
          gum has been chewed through. WHIP uses his hands to get to
          the edge of the bed. He roots through the duffle bag that
          HARLING left and finds a pack of smokes and a Bic lighter
          still in its package.
                         
          Determined to smoke, WHIP eyes a WHEEL CHAIR that has been
          placed next to his bed. Leaning against the wheelchair is a
          medical cane.

          Wearing his Happi Coat (or robe), WHIP limps in to the empty
          hallway with the use of his cane. He checks the quiet
          corridor as he begins his quest...

          The door swings open, and no one appears to be on the other
          side. Now WHIP fights to push the heavy door open again to
          slip through. A hand grabs the door and holds it. WHIP
          walks into the sanctity of the stairwell.

          WHIP empties his pockets onto the desk top. His keys, wallet
          and his cell phone are placed next to an old rotary phone
          attached to an old answering machine. WHIP plugs in his cell
          phone charge, dials in for his messages and puts it in
          "speaker mode" as we hear...

          WHIP again deletes the message and decides to just shut the
          phone down. He continues to empty his pockets. In his jacket
          pocket he finds a prescription bottle of pain pills.
                         
          WHIP holds it up, opens it and pours a few out in his hand.

          WHIP goes to the collection of liquor bottles next to the
          sink that act as a makeshift bar. He picks up a bottle of
          vodka. He unscrews the cap and sniffs the contents. He
          slowly tips the bottle and pours it into the sink.
                         
          Whip opens the refrigerator and removes an assortment of
          beers. He pops them open and pours them in the sink. The
          faucet running to offset the pungent smell.

          A cigarette dangles from WHIP's mouth as he ferrets around
          the room, showing the focus and determination of a serial
          killer cleaning his kill site. He finds rolling papers,
          roaches, more liquor and weed -- he reaches into the Shell
          Bag that's hanging next to the shotgun rack and finds another
          "pint."

          Whip opens the freezer to put in his frozen dinner and his
          "packet of veal" and finds another fifth of vodka.
                         
          He pours the vodka in the sink and tosses the bottle into the
          trash -- which is piled high with empties.
                         
          Through the kitchen window, Whip sees the farm's old
          weathered barn. Whip furrows his brow.

          WHIP slides open the heavy barn doors to reveal -- A VINTAGE
          CESSNA 172 -- covered in dust and bird shit from the years of
          stagnant storage.
                         
          WHIP lights a smoke as he marvels at the little piece of
          aviation history resting in his barn.

          Whip walks past the plane and starts to examine the large,
          two-story, open-ceilinged barn that is junked full of farm
          equipment and old furniture. He finds...
                         
          A WALL OF PHOTOS -- WHIP WITH HIS FATHER NEXT TO A PLANE.
          HIS GRANDFATHER, FATHER and WHIP pose next to the barn.
                         
          A CROP DUSTER acts as the background for a picture with a 15
          year old WHIP and his father next to a small plane.
           65.
                         
           A series of pictures feature the PLANE in flight and SHOTS
           TAKEN FROM THE PLANE, aerials of the farm, etc.
                         
           WHIP holds the framed shot of he and his dad as he walks back
           to the plane, resting his arm on the wing.
                         
           WHIP pulls himself from the wall of photos and stares at his
           stuff. We recognize what must be the stuff he took from his
           house after his divorce. We see bikes, weights and fishing
           gear.
                         
           Whip rummages through a box of things packed from his home
           office. Trophies, sports memorabilia, citations -- A PHOTO OF
           HE AND HIS WIFE from happier times. THEIR WEDDING PHOTO.
                         
           Now Whip comes upon A FRAMED BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO of he and
           Charlie in their younger, Navy days -- wearing flight suits
           and standing on a carrier flight deck in front of an F-14
           Tomcat. Big smiles, full of hotshot pilot swagger.
                         
           WHIP puts the photo back and spots his golf bag. He roots
           out a pint of cheap vodka from the inner pocket.
                         
           Next he finds a fifth of bourbon in his bicycle saddle bag.
                         
           He goes to the workbench and removes a couple of bottles from
           the paint shelf.

           empty liquor bottles to his garbage cans. He tosses the bag
           of empties in a can. His work done, WHIP lights a smoke and
           stares at the empty fields that run forever as does the
           landscape of his mind. He quietly tries to grasp the horror
           he endured and the reality of his survival.

           Many hours have passed since the
           footage you just watched but the
           crash site remains active as
           investigators work through the
           night. Using flood lights and
           miners' caps, teams continue to
           comb the crash field looking for
           the answers to the hard questions
           as to what brought down SouthJet's
           flight 227. Those answers remain
           in darkness as do the broken pieces
           of the aircraft. Hopefully
           sunlight will bring answers. For
           now this is Kent Johnson reporting.

           WHIP's been awake for hours as he sits at the foot of the
           bed. Whip's wearing a long sleeve tee shirt and sweat pants
           and no shoes. He looks at NICOLE -- sleeping angelically on
           her side of the bed. Whip watches her sleep for a long
           moment, until...
                         
          80 He hears something. He gets up and goes to the window. It's a

           car pulling up the driveway.

           WHIP casts a strange figure with his bare chest, boxers and
           brandishing a shotgun. They stare at each other.
                         
                          HUGH

           C'mon in. I'll shoot you inside.
                         
           HUGH walks closer to the porch. WHIP questions him.

           Your voice mail is full and you
           never answer your cell phone. I
           called your cell 10 times.

          EXT. CRASH SITE -- OBSERVATION SCAFFOLDING -- DAY
                         
          WHIP joins HUGH on a rectangular platform on top of a two-
          story scaffolding frame. The platform provides a perfect
          view of flight 227's final resting area. We see the awesome
          devastation that 50 tons of metal flying at 140 miles an hour
          can do to a hillside.
                         
                          HUGH
           You can see the initial impact
           sheared the right wing clean off.
           If only the left wing had come off
           at impact, I think everyone would
           have walked off that plane.
                         
                          WHIP

                          HUGH
           It snapped but stayed connected to
           the airframe. So it whipped back
           towards the plane, hit the fuselage
           in front of the tail. If you were
           sitting in the last 6 or 7 rows on
           the left side, it was like being
           hit by a train.
                         
                          WHIP
           I drank a lot the night before that
           flight. I drank that morning too
           and I used coke to straighten up.

           here every day and have a mass 30
           minutes prior to the crash. And
           then they sit in silent prayer for
           10 minutes at 9:42...which is when
           you went down.

           (feels eyes of disbelief)
           It was done incompetently. The
           last time the toxicology equipment
           they used was calibrated was in
           June of 2009, which is 18 months
           past code. Their log that should
           clearly state who labeled the blood
           vials and when, is very incomplete.
           And they aren't sure who stored
           them. They used a preservative in
           the vials that has in some cases
           caused blood to ferment and
           register higher in an alcohol test.
           That's what I've done so far. I
           can handle this.

           couch. A large bottle of vodka appears empty amidst many
           dead beers and an ashtray that overflows.
                         
           WHIP moves in drunken slow motion as he attempts to free a
           cigarette from the pack and light it. He freezes at one
           point and places his hands straight out in front of himself,
           a strange, involuntary, drunken reset. His stare is a 1000
           miles offshore; he is anywhere but on this planet. Oblivion.

           as if he is smoking. He freezes and then steps forward and
           trips in to the coffee table. Whip falls to the ground.
                         
           NICOLE checks WHIP's face to see his eyes partially opened

           a blanket that she covers WHIP with. She also places a
           pillow under his head making sure that his head is titled to
           the side so he doesn't choke.

           the bedroom window. He looks out to see NICOLE sitting on a

           WHIP in a dark suit walks amidst mourners who file out of the
           church. The center of attention is a large, distraught woman
           in her 60's being consoled by what appears to be her son and
           his wife. The WOMAN wears a pin that holds a photo of TRINA.
                         
           WHIP stands at the bottom of the steps, watching folks,
           looking for someone. Suddenly, a 9 year-old BOY stands in
           front of him. The BOY locks eyes with him.
                         
                          BOY

           WHIP looks up to see MARGARET THOMASON walking towards him.
           She has her left arm in a sling underneath her jacket. We
           can see a bandage along her hairline. WHIP smiles, obviously
           uncomfortable. MARGARET hugs him.

           fall apart, huh Margaret? I'm just
           trying to get it straight. You

           severe, but as far as the flight

                          NICOLE
           You're serious?
                         
                          WHIP
           We'll leave in the morning...we'll
           just go. Start over.
                         
          NICOLE realizes he's serious as he opens another beer.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Whip, we can't.
                         
                          WHIP
           It's a beautiful beach, it's
           paradise.
                         
                          NICOLE
           I'm worried about you.
                         
                          WHIP
           (laughs a bit lit)
           I'm fine thanks.
                         
                          NICOLE
           No you're not, you're really not.
           You need help, Whip. I think you
           need rehab.
                         
                          WHIP
           You go to a couple of AA meetings
           and all of a sudden you think
           you're Jesus Christ? Worry about
           yourself.
                         
                          NICOLE
           We're the same Whip, you and me,
           we're the same-
                         
                          WHIP
                          WE'RE NOT-
                         
                          NICOLE
                          WE ARE-
           108.
                         
                          WHIP
           I didn't suck dick to get high.
           And don't give me a whole...
                         
                          NICOLE
           Never Whip, I never in my life-
                         
                          WHIP
           Your mom died and dad drank and
           bullshit, bullshit, bullshit --
                         
                          NICOLE
           Stop. Please stop.
                         
                          WHIP
           Is that why you shot dope?
                         
                          NICOLE
           That's not fair-
                         
                          WHIP
           Well there's a lot of people out
           there who lost their mom who've
           never had a drink in their life.
                         
                          NICOLE
           You're sick, Whip.
                         
          NICOLE walks away, leaving WHIP with his plane and his dream
          of freedom. WHIP calls after her.
                         
                          WHIP
           I choose to drink.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Do you? You choose it? I don't
           see a lot of choice goin' on.
                         
                          WHIP
           I choose to drink! And I blame it
           on me. I'm happy to. I've got an
           ex-wife and a son I don't see.
           Why? Because I choose to drink!
                         
                         
          INT. WHITAKER FARM -- WHIP'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
                         
          We follow WHIP as he enters the house and approaches the
          doorway of the bedroom. WHIP sees NICOLE sitting on the bed.
          She quickly tucks her cell phone away as WHIP holds up his
          hand to signal a truce.
           109.
                         
                          WHIP
           Alright look, I was loaded when I
           crashed that plane. With this
           investigation going on, I don't
           know what's gonna happen. Come to
           Jamaica with me.
                         
                          NICOLE
           Whip. I'm afraid I'll use again.
                         
                          WHIP
           Come with me. I need help, I do.
                         
                          NICOLE
           I'd love for you to get help, Whip.
                         
                          WHIP
           When we get to Jamaica we can go to
           the local hospital. I'll do it for
           you. Anything you want.
                         
          NICOLE looks at the sincere love in his eyes.
                         
                          NICOLE
           I don't wanna use again. I can't.
           I won't make it back.
                         
                          WHIP
           I'll be sober. I won't force you
           to stay. I promise if you don't
           like it or if I don't clean up?
           You can leave.
                         
          This is the most sincere plea she's ever heard.
                         
                          WHIP (CONT'D)
           It's so beautiful there. We'll
           leave before noon. I'm a great
           pilot. You'll get to see so much.
                         
          WHIP wraps his arms around her. We stay on NICOLE's face as
          he holds her tighter and tighter.
                         
                         
          INT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN -- EARLY MORNING
                         
          NICOLE is dressed and sitting at the kitchen table. Past
          NICOLE we can see WHIP lying in bed.
                         
          She has all her possessions in a crate and a duffel bag at
          her feet. She finishes a handwritten note and places it
          down. NICOLE picks up the note and begins to reread it.
           110.
                         
          She hears a car in the driveway -- she picks up her stuff and
          takes one last look at the sleeping WHIP. She leaves,
          careful not to make a sound.
                         
                         
          EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- FRONT DOOR -- EARLY MORNING
                         
          NICOLE quietly exits the house, carrying a crate of her
          stuff. She has a duffel bag of clothes over her shoulder as
          she makes her way to SHEILA's car that we see parked at the
          top of the driveway, far from the house.
                         
                         
          INT. WHITAKER RANCH -- BEDROOM -- LATER SAME DAY
                         
          WHIP stirs, wakes up and looks around. WHIP walks around
          looking for NICOLE. He finds the note and reads it. The
          reality of her disappearance sets in and he moves to the
          window and stares out at the barn.
                         
          WHIP returns his look inside the house and he sees the big
          book of AA on the table near where the letter was left. WHIP
          picks it up and throws it across the room. He then grabs the
          back of a chair and tosses it against the wall.
                         
          After wiping photos off of the wall he picks up an empty beer
          bottle and fires the bottle at a shelf on the opposite wall.
          The bottle explodes and WHIP stops as he realizes he came
          within an inch of shattering a framed photo of he and his
          son.
                         
          We hear the antiquated ring of the OLD HOUSE PHONE. WHIP
          relaxes his shoulders as the ringing phone distracts him.
                         
          Whip is now drawing heavy breaths as the ringing phone is
          answered by the old machine...
                         
                         
                         
           WHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE
           You've reached the Whitaker Crop
           Dusting Company, flying lessons and
           plane rides. Please leave a message
           and it will be returned. Thank
           you.
                         
          The beep concludes...
                         
                          CHARLIE
           (speaking to voice mail)
           Hey Whip, if you're there
           pickup...I got some good news...
                         
          WHIP snatches the phone of the hook.
           111.
                         
                          WHIP
           Yeah, I'm here. What's goin' on?
                         
          104 WHIP listens as CHARLIE talks... 104
                         
                         
           EXT. NTSB HANGAR -- RAINING -- DAY
                         
           WHIP sits in his car. Rain pounds the windshield as we watch
           him expertly add vodka to a half-full bottle of orange juice.
           WHIP gives the bottle a shake before taking a long drink.
                         
           WHIP takes another drink before re-capping the bottle and
           stowing it in the glove box. WHIP gets out and we watch him
           walk in the rain towards the door of the hangar. A SECURITY
           GUARD meets him and takes him inside.
                         
                         
           INT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY
                         
           WHIP is now alone in the huge, brightly lit hangar. He sees
           the plane.
                         
           The JR-88 has all of its pieces laying as close together as
           possible. Like the skeleton of a T-Rex in a museum. The
           sight is awesome, breathtaking. WHIP walks closer to the
           twisted wreck and stops. WHIP is overwhelmed by the sight
           and as he is about to leave...
                         
           CHARLIE steps out of the passenger door and calls down to
           WHIP.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Here's our guy. C'mon.
                         
           WHIP walks towards a ramp that leads up to the hole in the
           plane where the door used to be. CHARLIE stands at the top
           of the ramp. Suddenly HUGH steps out of the plane...
                         
                          HUGH
           Captain Whitaker, we've won.
                         
           WHIP doesn't move as HUGH starts down the ramp.
                         
                          HUGH (CONT'D)
           This is what we call in my
           profession a "walk over."
                         
                          CHARLIE
           They've scheduled the hearing. It's
           in 10 days.
                         
           CHARLIE and HUGH reach the bottom of the ramp.
           112.
                         
                          HUGH
           But these hearings can be tough.
           You just need to stay sharp and on
           course and answer the questions
           correctly. It's no longer a
           question of your condition but the
           condition of the plane.
                         
          This picks directly at the scab of WHIP's guilt.
                         
                          HUGH (CONT'D)
           I've had an "Act of God"
           successfully added to the list of
           probable causes.
                         
                          WHIP
           Look, it's simple. I flew a broken
           plane.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You got it. That's right.
                         
                          WHIP
           And what about my toxicology
           report?
                         
                          HUGH
           (trying to stay calm)
           I killed it. They have no physical
           proof that you were intoxicated on
           that plane. And no eye witness
           claims. But there's a problem.
                         
          This stops WHIP cold.
                         
                          HUGH (CONT'D)
           Because of the turbulence at the
           beginning of the flight and then
           the crash, there was never any
           drink service on the flight. But,
           they found two little vodka bottles
           in the galley trash bin. There was
           no physical evidence found on the
           bottles, no DNA, no finger prints.
           But both the bottles were uncapped
           and empty. The only people who had
           access to those bottles and could
           have drank them were the flight
           crew. Margaret, Evans and Camelia
           Satou all had clean tox reports.
           That leaves you and Trina Marquez.
                         
          They let that land. WHIP nods.
           113.
                         
                          WHIP
           Okay. I see...where this is going.
           That's funny that they found two
           bottles.
                         
                          HUGH
           Why?
                         
                          WHIP
           Because I drank three. One's
           missing.
                         
          HUGH explodes in frustration.
                         
                          HUGH LANG

                          WHIP
           Now is a time for grieving and
           taking care of those injured.
           Thank you. I appreciate your
           interest in me but I ask that you
           leave my family in peace.

           A reasonable request from a quiet,

           Cale Rawson talks with aviation
           experts to see if the tragedy of

          We boom down to find WHIP who looks drained as he sits on
          CHARLIE's couch in the fastidiously neat office. WHIP holds
          an unlit smoke.
                         
          The WOODEN POCKET DOORS SLIDE OPEN and CHARLIE's WIFE

                          WHIP
           Hey, Charlie. Thank you. Amanda
           was so nice to let me in. It's
           just...I couldn't find a safe
           place.
                         
          AMANDA slides the door shut as CHARLIE throws his bag and his
          coat down with gusto. He reaches up and pushes a button on
          the TV and it goes off.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           What the hell is wrong with you? I
           spoke to Hugh, he told me that you
           went to your ex-wife's house?
           Drunk as a skunk and the news crews
           showed up?

           And the police escorted you out?
                         
                          WHIP
           I think it's okay. I've been
           watching and I think it's okay.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Hugh checked every media outlet
           that covered it and it looks like
           we're good. You come off fine.

                          CHARLIE
           No Whip. No deals. Look at you.
           I have no idea what you're gonna do
           or say, ever. You're all over the
           place. I was the one guy in your
           court. I was your apologist, your
           defender. But not anymore.

                          CHARLIE
           You're about to be questioned by a
           Federal Agency about piloting an
           airliner drunk...an airliner that
           crashed. And you continue to drink
           and stumble around. What kind of
           crazy do you have to be to do that?
           I'm scared of you.
                         
                          WHIP

                          WHIP
           This whole thing has just been so
           heavy, it's killing me. Tell Hugh,
           I can do it. Look, I really wanna
           fly again, get back to my life and
           be done with all this shit.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           This hearing is 10 days away. Hugh
           busted his ass to try to get you
           excused, but there's no way. You
           have to appear.
                         
                          WHIP
           Let me stay here. They have my
           houses all staked out now. Let me
           stay here until the hearing,
           Charlie. I won't leave the house.
                         
           CHARLIE takes a long look at his old, troubled friend.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You can't drink here, Whip. You
           can't drink in my house. Can you
           do that?
                         
                          WHIP
           I won't drink.
                         
          118 CHARLIE nods, hoping that WHIP can deliver on that promise 118

          We watch a can of Coca Cola swing in WHIP's hand. We pull
          out to find WHIP walking with CHARLIE down a hallway of THE
          ST. JEROME HOTEL. Time has passed as WHIP looks the best
          we've ever seen him look. He is well rested, well dressed
          and carrying a suit in a wardrobe bag.
                         
          As we approach the open door to a guest room, HUGH pops out.
          A plain clothes SECURITY GUARD follows HUGH out of the room
          and stands behind him.
                         
                          HUGH
           You look great, Whip. I mean that.
                         
                          WHIP

          CHARLIE addresses the SECURITY GUARD.

           staying here tonight. Any problems
           he'll handle it.

                          HUGH
           Well, Whip we just wanted to make
           this as easy for you as possible.
                         
          WHIP puts his wardrobe bag down on the bed.

           Just get a good night's rest.
           Relax, order up a steak, get a
           movie.
                         
          WHIP is checking his phone. HUGH gestures to CHARLIE for him
          to leave so they can be alone.
                         
                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
           Okay, cowboy, I'm out. The hearing
           starts at 10, so we should plan on

                          WHIP
           Wait, Charlie, thanks for letting

           I'm very blessed.
                         
          CHARLIE leaves and HUGH joins WHIP at the window. HUGH hands
          WHIP a thick folder.
                         
                          HUGH LANG
           I made you a copy of my entire file
           on you and the investigation. I
           also tried to anticipate what you
           might be asked under oath and I
           wrote out some non-damaging
           responses. It's all in there;
           photos, testimony, interviews...I
           called Ellen Block let her know
           that you're here and all tucked in.
                         
                          WHIP
           So does she have the knife out for
           me?
                         
                          HUGH LANG
           Remember she's limited in what she
           can ask you. You're not on trial
           but you are under oath. She's
           probably not happy that I killed
           the tox report, but you'll be fine.
                         
          WHIP laughs a little.
           124.
                         
           HUGH LANG (CONT'D)
           I'll see you in the morning.
                         
          The two respectfully nod. HUGH leaves and the door shuts
          behind him. WHIP puts the folder on the table and steps to
          the mini-bar. He bends down and opens the fridge...
                         
          WHIP sees the fridge is overly stocked with soda and juices.
          Every soft drink you can imagine. No booze, anywhere. WHIP
          chuckles about the alcohol removal as he grabs a coke.
                         
          WHIP unbuttons his shirt and pulls it out of his waist line.
                         
                         
          INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER
                         
          Whip sits on the edge of the bed eating a room service steak.
          The File Folder sits on the table.
                         
          WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER
                         
          Now in his undershirt and shorts, Whip lies propped up on the
          bed watching television. The File Folder now rests on the
          bed.
                         
          WHIP'S BATHROOM -- LATER
                         
          Whip is meticulously shaving. He stares a long while at the
          disposable razor as the water runs over its blade. After a
          moment he goes back to shaving.
                         
          WHIP'S ROOM -- MUCH LATER
                         
          Whip sits at the small table looking through the file. He
          leafs through photos, with no recognizable emotion. He looks
          to the clock radio -- 12:37.
                         
          WHIP'S ROOM -- BATHROOM -- LATER AGAIN
                         
          We hear the shower running and steam fogs the mirrors.
                         
          WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER THAN THAT
                         
          WHIP wears boxers and a tee shirt with a towel around his
          neck. He looks to the clock -- 2:07
                         
          WE WATCH HIS SUIT BE PULLED FROM THE WARDROBE BAG.
                         
          WHIP lays the suit out neatly on the couch, separating the
          shirt which he hangs from a light fixture to relax any
          creases.
                         
          WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER YET AGAIN
           125.
                         
          The room is dark. A soft wind RATTLES the window sash.
          WHIP lies on the bed. He sighs, sleep is alluding him and
          the anxiety of tomorrow's events on no sleep has his head
          spinning. He hears a metallic click. He stays quiet to
          listen for it...there it is again. An annoying click.
                         
          The clock reads "3:43"--
                         
          He sits up and switches on the LIGHT. He rubs his eyes and
          goes to the table and sees the file folder laying there. As
          he is about to pick it up he hears the metallic click again.
          He goes to investigate.
                         
                         
          HOTEL ROOM CONNECTING DOOR -- SAME TIME
                         
          The connecting door is unlocked. WHIP arrives and waits. He
          now watches as the connecting lock-bolt CLICKS against the
          frame -- the door swinging in a draft. He looks up to see
          the culprit -- a heating vent. WHIP flips the vent closed.
                         
                         
                         
          Whip now pushes the door with his finger, opening it a few
          inches. Nothing. Darkness.
                         
                          WHIP
           Hello? Anyone?
                         
          Whip enters.
                         
                         
          INT. CONNECTING HOTEL ROOM -- SAME
                         
          The room is vacant. The bed is made. The drapes are pulled
          open.
                         
          WHIP walks quietly on the carpet towards the window. The
          night is clear. Quiet. Whip takes in the city lights.
                         
          WHIP'S POV --
                         
          Among the glass and steel office buildings, Whip spots a

          Whip looks at the church, deep in thought.
                         
          Then suddenly...
                         
          We HEAR A HUM. THE GENTLE HUM OF AN ELECTRIC MOTOR.
                         
          WHIP turns from the window and scans the room...
                         
          It's the MINI-BAR refrigerator -- HUMMING to life.
           126.
                         
          Whip stares at the gleaming black box. The WHIR of the motor
          seems to get LOUDER. Calling Whip. Beckoning him...
                         
          Whip looks at the fridge. His face is blank, His eyes tell us
          nothing. Then...
                         
          Whip steps toward the box.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE MINI-BAR. Whip swings open the door.
                         
          WHOOSH -- OUR DARK SCREEN LIGHTS.

          jewels in a chest.
                         
          WHIP stares at the "glimmering gems" for a long, long time --
          vodka, gin, wine, bourbon. The bottles SHIMMER -- AMBER,
          CRYSTAL, EMERALD, RUBY.
                         
          WHIP reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle -- he gently
          pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the
          fridge. He holds up the mini vodka and considers it.
                         
          Now Whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the White
          Whiskey. He looks at the bottle once more, then slowly twists
          the tiny cap back on.
                         
          With a look of solemn resignation, Whip places the frosted
          mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away.
                         
          WE STAY CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE. The CAMERA FOCUSES on the small
          bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side
          -- ever so slowly, slowly. Then suddenly...

          looks slept in and the room service dinner tray rests
          politely on the dining table but WHIP is nowhere to be found.

          HARLING stops grinding, opens the lid and pours out a nice
          smooth pile of coke. He begins a masterful ballet of cocaine
          manipulation.

          HARLING uses the credit card to groom the coke into neat
          piles and lines. He has a system.

          Using the mirror as a tray, HARLING holds the rolled up 20
          dollar bill just above the line of coke. WHIP slowly manages
          to place his face in position to ingest the coke. It's tense
          as his head wobbles. He finally zeroes in and snorts the
          first line. HARLING quickly switches nostrils. WHIP sniffs
          the other side.

          HUGH hands HARLING the cigarette with a slightly hollowed out
          tip. HARLING leans over the coke with the cigarette in his
          mouth and hoovers up a small pile, sucking the coke through
          the cigarette.
           133.
                         
          HARLING sits up, careful to keep the cocaine in the end of
          the cigarette. He tips it up and lights it.

          WHIP's head levels a look to Harling with a smile that leads
          us to believe that he is actually making a rally.

          HARLING takes a puff and holds it as he extends the cocaine
          cigarette to WHIP. WHIP is more nimble now as he cocks his
          head in acceptance of the cigarette. WHIP takes a drag and
          holds it.

           just before we see WHIP step out of the hotel room and begin
           a relatively steady strut down the hallway. Deja Vu.
           Sunglasses on, WHIP is backed by HUGH and CHARLIE who flank
           him from a few steps behind. Further back we can see that
           OFFICER EDWARDS also exits the room wearing latex gloves,
           carrying a large plastic garbage bag that obviously holds any
           evidence of the debauched night or the morning's

           We watch as a small trickle of blood escapes from WHIP's left
           nostril. HUGH pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, hands it
           to WHIP.

           blood on the cloth and tilts his head back.
           135.
                         
          We now see that there is a mirrored ceiling to the elevator.
          WHIP tries to study his reflection in the ceiling as he holds
          the hankie to his nose. WHIP begins to wobble and CHARLIE
          helps him regain his balance.

          that hangs above the proceedings. A large drop down screen

           morning.
           136.

                          ELLEN BLOCK
           What was captured on that video is
           that the aircraft was in a
           relatively stable glide just prior
           to the moment of impact.
           However, according to the data we
           retrieved from the cockpit data
           recorders, at exactly 9:34, after
           flying 27 minutes without incident,
           the transponder recorded a loss in
           altitude in excess of 4800 feet per
           minute in what is considered a
           "full pitch nose down" attitude.
           Then at 9:42, according to the data
           recorders, a decision was made to
           invert the aircraft. The NTSB has
           created animated simulation that I
           would like to play at this point.
                         
          ELLEN points to the screen...
                         
          An NTSB animation shows the plane pitching down and we follow
          it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the
          real audio of the flight crew.
                         
          The animation has a split screen that also shows the
          instruments and printed text of what's being said.
                         
          We hear..."What's your son's name?" "Why?" "The black box"
          "I love you, Trevor. Be a good boy, Mommy loves you." "What
          are we doing?! Why would I trim down?!" "We're gonna roll
          it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control."
                         
          That last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops
          and the lights come back up. We return to the hearing in
          progress.
                         
           ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
           That audio is tragic and
           compelling. I chose to play that
           part of the cockpit recording to
           highlight a key moment aboard
           flight 227, wherein you say "We're
           gonna roll it, here we go, I've got
           control." You made a very
           conscious decision to invert the
           airplane, to roll the plane upside
           down. Is that correct?
           137.
                         
                          WHIP
           I'm not sure it was conscious. It
           was more of an instinct.
                         
                          ELLEN BLOCK
           What led to that decision?

          there but it may start to fail him soon.

           Let me quote from an investigative
           summary..."From 9:34 until 9:42 the
           events on the aircraft are"...again
           I quote, "bold and remarkable"...

           Whitaker arrested the descent and

           enabling him to glide the aircraft
           away from any populated areas and
           allowing him to execute a forced
           landing in an open field.

          WHIP looks ashen as the booze and chemicals are still
          coursing through his exhausted frame.

                          WHIP
           There was some convective activity
           in the area. However, my first
           officer and I discussed the
           conditions on the field and
           determined that we were safely
           within our visibility and crosswind
           minimums.
                         
                          ELLEN BLOCK
           Yes, first officer Evans' testimony
           confirms the same.
                         
          WHIP goes quiet as ELLEN BLOCK looks at him over her glasses,
          seeing if he has any reaction. WHIP smiles.
                         
           ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
           I want to show you something.
                         
          HUGH is frozen in a steely gaze; CHARLIE seems to hold his
          breath.
                         
           ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
           Nothing's happening.
                         
          ELLEN points her remote at the projector but it doesn't work.
                         
           ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
           This remote is not working.
           Apologies. I can do it manually.
                         
          She shrugs and heads down onto the stage closer to WHIP where
          she can advance the slides by touching the projector.
                         
          We now see a screen where a slide is showing a long metal
          screw the size of a trombone.
                         
           ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
           This is the jackscrew on the tail
           assembly which articulates the
           horizontal stabilizer--also known
           as the elevator. As you can see,
           the threads on this screw are
           almost entirely gone. "
           139.
                         
           Substandard thread life" is how we
           reported it. This part was
           suggested as a maintenance
           replacement in January of 2010. It
           was never replaced.
                         
           This had 1200 additional hours of
           flight on it. It finally failed.
                         
          AN ANIMATION SHOWS THE TAIL ASSEMBLY.
                         
          We watch the elevator acting as a wing on the tail that goes
          up or down and makes a plane get lift or descend.
                         
           ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
           Our investigators have concluded
           that the jackscrew snapped and the
           elevator was frozen in a fixed
           position, locking the elevator in a
           down position which forced the
           plane into a dive. The loss of the
           elevator was, and I quote our
           report, a "catastrophic event, from
           which recovery was improbable and
           stable flight impossible."
                         
          Everyone goes quiet as those words resonate. ELLEN's tone
          changes as she understands how hard this is for some people
          to hear as they think of their loved ones spending their last
          living minutes on this earth in sheer terror.
                         
          It is deathly quiet in the ballroom. Even the PRESS are
          silent.
                         
           ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
           Again I quote..."From 9:34 until
           9:42 the piloting decisions made by
           Captain Whitaker were bold and
           remarkable. The fact that Captain
           Whitaker commanded that the
           aircraft stay inverted while
           descending to an extremely low
           altitude shows a miraculous
           intuition that in this instance
           saved 96 lives."
                         
          A genuine applause spreads from the hearing room. ELLEN
          BLOCK allows this moment to happen.
                         
          WHIP is fading, dazed and uncomfortable with the unexpected
          adulation. He stands up.
                         
                          WHIP
           I appreciate that.
           140.
                         
          The room gets quiet as WHIP's demeanor seems terse.
                         
          WHIP stares at ELLEN, white with sweat and chemicals. We see
          HUGH grind his jaw as this line of questioning has him on
          tilt.
                         
                          ELLEN BLOCK
           Mr. Whitaker, I want to talk about

           Captain Whitaker, for the record I

           Due to the severe turbulence during
           the early part of the flight, you
           asked the flight crew to suspend

          CHARLIE rockets out of his chair.

          Now CHARLIE returns to his chair to find that HUGH is gone.
          CHARLIE looks around for HUGH, no sign. He's vanished.

           Mr. Whitaker, in light of that
           remark, would you like to
           readdress...
                         
                          WHIP
           You don't have to readdress

           On the three nights before the
           accident, October 11th-
                         
                          WHIP
           On October 11th, 12th and 13th and
           14th I was intoxicated. I drank
           alcohol on all of those days. I
           drank to excess.
                         
          Chaos erupts further as REPORTERS outnumber SECURITY. Flash
          bulbs pop repeatedly and large lights are aimed at the fracas
          on stage as video is taken of the bizarre melee.
                         
                          ELLEN BLOCK
           Mr. Whitaker, on the morning of
                          OCTOBER-
                         
                          WHIP
           I was drunk. I'm drunk right now,
           Miss Block...I'm drunk right...
           (Whip finally breaks down)
           I'm drunk now, because...
           Because I'm an alcoholic.
                         
          We have pushed into a tight shot on WHIP's face as the sound
          in the room fades away. We stay tight on WHIP's face as he
          lets the moments unfold.
                         
          Suddenly the noise cuts to silence. WHIP is looking at the
          assembly. WHIP wipes tears from his eyes. We hear WHIP's
          voice as the dialogue pre-laps the image of his face.
                         
                         
           WHIP (V.O.)
           That was it...I was done. It's as
           if I'd hit my life long limit for
           lies.
                         
          A new angle shows WHIP speaking these words...
           146.
                         
                          WHIP
           I could not tell one more lie. And
           maybe I'm a sucker. Because if I
           had just told one more lie? I could
           have walked away from that whole
           mess and kept my wings and my false
           sense of pride and most importantly
           I would have avoided being locked
           up here with all of you nice folks
           for the last 13 months.
                         
          We hear laughter as we pull out from WHIP to realize that he
          is in fact wearing a white penal jumpsuit and leading an AA
          meeting in a Federal Prison.
                         
                          WHIP (CONT'D)
           It looks like I will serve every
           day of the remaining 4 plus years
           of my sentence. And that's fair.
           I betrayed the public trust. I
           did. That's what the judge
           explained to me. I had betrayed
           the public trust. The FAA took my
           license. And that's fair. The
           chances of me flying again are slim
           to none. And I accept that.
                         
                         
          INT. MCRAE FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- GEORGIA -- DAY
                         
          A large room houses an AA meeting for about 50 inmates
          wearing white jumpsuits. WHIP continues his story.
                         
                          WHIP
           I've had time to think about all of
           it. Doing a lot of writing. I've
           written letters to each of the
           families that lost loved ones on my
           flight. Some were able to hear my
           apology, some never will.
           I've also apologized to all the
           people who tried to help me along
           the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't
           listen, like my wife, I mean my ex
           wife...
           (he gets emotional)
           ...and my son. Again, some were
           able to forgive me...some never
           will.
                          (COLLECTS HIMSELF)
           But at least I'm sober, and I'm
           grateful for that.
                         
          Whip gives it to us straight...
           147.
                         
                          WHIP (CONT'D)
           And this is gonna sound really
           stupid coming from a man who's in
           prison...but for the first time in
           my life...I'm free.
                         
          We hold close on WHIP's face as we hear the metallic clang of
          prison doors shutting. On the sound we cut to...
                         
                         
          INT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- CELL -- DAY
                         
          We pan across the concrete cell wall, looking at a small,
          personal photo collage. We see a photo of NICOLE and SHEILA
          and a few other AA FOLKS surrounding WHIP who sits in front
          of a birthday cake in the common room of the prison. We see
          a photo of WHIP's DAD as an airman. We ultimately land on a
          photo of NICOLE. We recognize it as the photo WHIP took on
          the porch of the Whitaker Farm.
                         
          We pan down to find WHIP writing in a journal. A GUARD comes
          to the front of his cell.
                         
                          GUARD
           Whitaker, you got a visitor.
                         
          WHIP looks at the GUARD and nods before taking a last glance
          at the photo of NICOLE.

          WHIP sits at a lone picnic table in a fence-enclosed
          courtyard. He checks his watch and looks up.
                         
          WHIP stands and walks towards us, towards his visitor. As he
          gets closer we see a smile break across his face. A smile we
          haven't seen since he first saw NICOLE. We reverse to see...
                         
          WILL -- WHIP's 17 year old son stands next to a GUARD.

           surprise. I haven't seen you-
                         
          WHIP chokes up. WILL nods. It's intense. WHIP motions to
          the table and they both sit. WILL pulls out a notebook.
                         
                          WILL

           Yeah. Of course.

           Good question.
                         
          WHIP smiles...a great, familiar question. He begins to
          alternately laugh and sob as there is great relief in the
          promise of a connection with his son.
