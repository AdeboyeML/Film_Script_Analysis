OVER BLACK:
The sound of HELICOPTER ROTORS slicing through the air.
                      STYLES (O.S.)
          Jesus, God. . .
FADE IN ON:
An ARMY HELICOPTER as it soars over the thick LOUISIANA BAYOU.
Lush and green only a day ago, the foliage below has been
ripped to shreds. The kind of damage that can only be done
by nature.
SUPERIMPOSE:, FEBRUARY 2 - 0630 HOURS - 32 KILOMETERS NORTH
OF FORT MCKINLEY, LOUISIANA
INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISE
Sitting next to the PILOT is COLONEL WILLIAM STYLES. Mid-
40's, normally gruff, but completely cowed by the damage
below. The PILOT, unfazed.
                      PILOT
          Hurricane Beth, huh? Had    an ex-wife
          named Beth, this is pretty   much par
          for the course. This area    got the
          worst of it, I hope these   guys are
          all intact-
                      STYLES
          That's enough, Lieutenant.
SOMEONE'S P.O.V. - RUNNING through the underbrush - ducking
branches, pushing through bushes, splashing through streams.
LABORED BREATHING wheezes over the sound track. We're headed
for a CLEARING...
INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISE
The Pilot pushes his stick forward, descending to tree level.
                      PILOT
          Coming up on the pick-up.
EXT. CLEARING -- DAWN
TWO MEN emerge from the underbrush at a run. The BIGGER MAN
carrying the wounded SMALLER MAN over his shoulder. Both in
ragged army cadet fatigues - ripped, muddy, and bloody.
The Bigger Man lowers the Smaller Man to the ground and
unshoulders his M-16. Face panicked.
The sound of the HELICOPTER approaching...

                                                            2.
INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISE

The unmistakable SOUND OF GUNFIRE from below.

                      PILOT
          Holy shit, that's live fire!

As the Helicopter comes over the clearing, Styles and the
Pilot squint down through the windscreen to see the Two Men,
huddled together as BULLET HITS kick up DUST around them!

                      STYLES
          Who's shooting at them-

The Bigger Man raising his own his weapon and RETURNING FIRE.
The Smaller Man frantically waving the Helicopter down...

                         PILOT
          I can't see-

Below, the Bigger Man still shooting and then he lowers his
rifle and there's only SILENCE. No return fire.

And then Styles sees why. A THIRD MAN. Lying by the
treeline. Chest torn open by gunfire. Obviously dead. His
clothes - the same fatigues the first two men are wearing.

                      STYLES
          That was one of their own, he just
          Shot one of their own men-

                      PILOT
          Who was trying to shoot them-

                      STYLES
          Get us on the ground!

EXT. CLEARING -- SUNRISE

As the Helicopter comes in for a landing, the Bigger Man
kneels next to the Smaller Man, who bleeds from a bullet
wound to the arm.  His face, pale, sweating. The Bigger Man
wipes the Smaller Man's brow and speaks softly and seriously.

                      BIGGER MAN
          Are you ready for this?

The Smaller Man nods.

INT. ROADHOUSE -- MORNING

A full on shit-kicking dive.     Nearly empty, given the hour.
A TELEVISION plays the morning    news over the bar.  Only two
inhabitants - one a BARTENDER,    the other the lone CUSTOMER,
smoking and picking at a plate    of criminally runny eggs.

                                                           3.
                      HARDY
          Tell the truth, Vic. You made these
          with a blender, right?
He grins and we get our first good look at
TOM HARDY - Three day stubble, dark rings around his eyes,
but a with strong jaw and steady voice. Not your average
barfly. Somebody who maybe used to be somebody.
                      BARTENDER
          Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't
          make no damn difference to me.
                      HARDY
          You know that was like a quadruple
          negative?
The Bartender takes the plate away from him.
                      HARDY
          Can I at least have a drink?
                      BARTENDER
          It's ten thirty in the morning.
                      HARDY
          Yeah, if you've slept.
                      BARTENDER
          You know the law - no liquor before
          noon. Could lose my license.
                      HARDY
          Don't you mean "don't need no liquor
          license not taken away from me"?
The Bartender smiles.
                      BARTENDER
          Hurricane kept you up, too?
                      HARDY
          Yeah, and I could've used the sleep.
          I'm supposed to meet people here
          tonight, try and get some work going.
He stops, his attention suddenly on the TV.    A NEWSCASTER:
                      NEWSCASTER
          ...is expected to announce the grand
          jury indictments in the Guissepe
          Torres police corruption case as
          early as tomorrow afternoon.
          Speculations abound that up to ten
          former homicide detectives could be
          named in the proceedings-

                                                           4.
The Bartender turns the TV off hastily.   Embarrassed:
                      BARTENDER
          Sorry.
Hardy just looks away. The Bartender puts an empty glass
down and fills it to the lip with bourbon.
Hardy nods a "thank you" and reaches for the glass when the
PAGER on his hip goes off. He checks the number.
                      HARDY
          Bill Styles...
                      BARTENDER
          Who?
                      HARDY
          Old friend. Haven't talked to him
          in- 911. Can I use your phone?
The Bartender hands him a cordless and Hardy dials.
                      HARDY
          Hey, Bill, it's Tom. Long time no.
          . . whoa, whoa, slow down. Yeah...
          yeah, of course I'll come. An hour.
He hangs up and hands the phone back to the Bartender.
                      BARTENDER
          What was that?
Hardy, obviously shaken by the call.
                      HARDY
          I gotta go out to McKinley.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- MORNING
Establishing. A sprawling five square mile compound nestled
in the Louisiana backwoods. Also damaged by the Hurricane.
HELICOPTERS loaded with emergency supplies land and take
off, REPAIR CREWS work feverishly on damaged buildings, all
while CADET PLATOONS complete morning drills around them.
This is still a boot camp after all.
SUPERIMPOSE: 1130 HOURS - FORT MCKINLEY BASIC TRAINING CENTER
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- MAIN GATE -- MORNING
Styles stands waiting nervously just beyond the CHECKPOINT
with WARRANT OFFICER JULIA OSBORNE - early 30's, attractive,
close cropped hair and icy eyes. In the middle of protesting.

                                                          5.
                      OSBORNE
          This is totally unnecessary-
                      STYLES
          He asked to see a policeman, we're
          getting him a policeman .
                      OSBORNE
          But this guy you called, he's not
          even Army-
                      STYLES
          He's former Army and the best I've
          ever seen in a room. Besides, he
          knows the territory, we did Basic
          together here.
              (off her look)
          You've had three hours with Dunbar
          and haven't gotten a peep, we need
          to take a different tack.
                      OSBORNE
          He's not Army, it's not official-
                      STYLES
          Then it's unofficial.
He takes a hit from an ASTHMA INHALER, as a '71 PONTIAC GTO
drives through the gate and pulls up. Hardy emerges.
                      OSBORNE
              (re: his appearance)
          Doesn't get any unofficialer than
          that...
The two old friends embrace.
                         HARDY
          How are you?
                       STYLES
          Been better.
              (pause)
          I read about what's been happening
          With you... I should have called-
                      HARDY
          What kind of trouble are you in?
Styles looks at the ground.      Momentarily flustered.
                         HARDY
          That bad?
                      STYLES
          Would I have called you if it wasn't?
          If there was any other way-

                                                       6.
                      HARDY
          Tell me what I can do.
                      OSBORNE
          You can get us some answers.
Hardy takes off his sunglasses, noticing her.
                      STYLES
          This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne,
          The closest thing we have to an in-
          House investigator.
                      HARDY
          And here you are going out of house.
          How's that make you feel, Jules?
                      OSBORNE
          Hostile and uncooperative.
                       HARDY
          Fantastic.   You want to tell me what's
          going on?
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS MORNING
Hardy follows Styles and Osborne. They pass SOLDIERS
replacing broken windows and sweeping up glass.
                      STYLES
          The official term for it is
          "Clusterfuck" . By the time Beth hit
          us, I'd canceled all off base
          exercises save one - a six man cadet
          team and their Drill out in the bush.
          We're missing three and the Sergeant.
          The cadets are in their eighth week
          of the cycle, nobody here knows much
          about them, up to and including their
          names. But the Sergeant...
                      HARDY
          It's not West, is it?    Tell me it's
          not West.
Styles' look tells him it is.
                       HARDY
          Ah, Christ
                      OSBORNE
          You knew Sergeant West?
                      HARDY
          He was our Drill here.    Man's older
          than sand.

                                                   7.
                      STYLES
          A few years ago, the Army picked our
          good buddy as their go to non-com to
          trot out to the press to talk about
          the kinder, gentler military. He
          even did the standard video greeting
          played to all incoming Basic cadets
          across the country.
                      HARDY
          Well, he's a good soldier.
Osborne nods, agreeing.
                      HARDY
          I didn't mean that as a compliment.
                      OSBORNE
          Sergeant West's served for twenty-
          Three years. He's the public face
          of the modern Army.
                      HARDY
          And you notice I'm not in the Army
          anymore.
They round a corner.
                      STYLES
          The exercise was one of his Section
          Eight "private sessions". Left around
          2100 yesterday and were scheduled
          for pick up at 0630 this morning.
                      HARDY
          And the problem is you only got three.
                      STYLES
          No, the problem is one's dead, one's
          got a bullet in his arm, and one
          won't talk. The one who won't talk
          was trading live fire with the dead
          one as we reached the pick-up.
                      HARDY
          I'm assuming that's what made him
          the dead one?
                      STYLES
          Cadet Roberto R. Nunez.   Killed right
          in front of me.
                      OSBORNE
          Search parties for the others are
          fanning out in a ten click radius
          from the pickup. If they're hurt
          and we can get to them in time...

                                                          8.
                      STYLES
          I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets
          we retrieved are to be flown to D.C.
          On a transport leaving here at 1700-
                      HARDY
          Which gives us about five hours.
          Why'd you call me?
                      STYLES
          The guy in interrogation said he'd
          only talk to a cop.
                      HARDY
          And I'm the closest thing to it,
          right?
Styles stops, turning to his friend.
                      STYLES
          Tom, bottom line: I let those kids
          go out there. If JAG shows up and I
          don't have any answers for them, my
          career is finished-
                      HARDY
          I'm not gonna let that happen.
Styles exhales, relieved.
                      STYLES
          Thank you. Osborne will brief you
          on the cadets. And Tom?
              (half-smile)
          It really is good to see you.
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- OSBORNE'S OFFICE -- MORNING
Osborne and Hardy enter, stepping over broken glass and
hurricane debris. Hardy looks around.
                      HARDY
          Gotta be honest, I love what you've
          Done with the place-
                      OSBORNE
          You and the Colonel go back.
                      HARDY
          He got me through Basic and a lot of
          other stuff. I owe him.
                      OSBORNE
          You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading
          about in the papers, right? New
          Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes
          from Guissepe Torres.

                                                           9.
                      HARDY
          It was for suspicion of bribery,
          it's really all in the wording-
                      OSBORNE
          Wording and your friendship with the
          Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable
          having you involved in this.
                      HARDY
          Subtlety really isn't one of you
          finer points, is it, Osborne?
Osborne opens her mouth to reply but Hardy cuts her off.
                      HARDY
          Three things. First - You don't
          have a choice. Second- I've never
          taken a bribe in my life. And Third -
          I'm still a little drunk from last
          night, so if I skip over the witty
          banter and move forward to straight
          hitting on you, try not to take
          offense. Tell me about the two guys.
                      OSBORNE
          Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe,
          so all we have are their dogtags.
          Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall-
                       HARDY
          Levi?   Who names their kid Levi-
                      OSB0RNE
          Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
                      HARDY
          Christ... Remind me to thank Bill
          for mentioning that on the phone-
                      OSBORNE
          Kendall Junior is still  in surgery,
          so he won't be available  to answer
          for his name or anything  else for
          another hour - the cadet  we're talking
          to first is Dunbar.
                      HARDY
          He's in interrogation?
                       OSBORNE
          Yes.
                       HARDY
          Move him.

                                                        10.
                         OSBORNE
          Why?
                      HARDY
          Because interrogation rooms look
          suspiciously like interrogation rooms,
          which doesn't exactly put people at
          ease. Is he cute?
                         OSBORNE
          Excuse me?
                      HARDY
          Is Dunbar cute?
                       OSBORNE
              (pissed)
          That is the most unprofessional-
                      HARDY
          Is he handsome, self assured, carry
          himself well, does he look you in
          the eyes or down at the floor, does
          he have good bones, suggesting good
          breeding, does he slouch or sit up
          straight - these are important
          questions, as they reveal a great
          deal about this man's character so
          please get over yourself for two and
          a half seconds and tell me is he
          cute?
Osborne stares at him.    She finally nods.
                      HARDY
          Thank you. At some point in there
          I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do,
          go at him with everything you got.
                      OSBORNE
          Good cop/bad cop?
                      HARDY
          Something like that.
She starts to go make preparations.
                       HARDY
          Oh, and Osborne? You have any donuts
          around here?
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR -- MORNING
As two M.P.'s escort RAYMOND DUNBAR (the "Bigger Man") into

                                                            11.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING
A small cluttered room with the shades drawn. A folding
table has been set up in the middle of it with a chair on
each side. Dunbar takes a seat in the far chair. Takes in
his surroundings as the MP's leave, locking the door.
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR - MORNING
Hardy and Osborne head towards the Coffee Room.
                      OSBORNE
          I questioned him for three hours and
          he didn't make a sound. You don't
          have a badge, he won't talk to you.
                      HARDY,
          Ten bucks says I have him talking in
          under three minutes.
Osborne starts the timer on her digital watch.
                        OSBORNE
          Go.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING
Dunbar looks up as they enter.    Hardy smiles, cheerily.
                      HARDY
          Cadet Dunbar, good morning! I'm Tom
          Hardy and I believe you've already
          met Officer Osborne. I understand
          you had a rough time of it last night?
No response.    Hardy takes a seat across from the cadet.
                      HARDY
          Not talking, huh? You probably just
          want to get some food and some sleep.
          They feed you yet?
No response.    Hardy reaches into his pocket.   Pulls out a
DONUT.
Dunbar eyes it, wary but definitely wanting it.
                      HARDY
          Go on. You can eat in front of
          someone and still not talk to them -
          my parents did it for years.
Dunbar grabs the donut, wolfing it down.
                      HARDY
          Want another one?
No response.    Osborne looks to her watch - it's been a minute.

                                                           12.
                      HARDY
          Maybe later. Ray, let me say this
          up front - I'm not a cop.
Dunbar turns away, no longer interested.   Hardy continues:
                      HARDY
          I used to be, but that's beside the
          point. Who I am doesn't really
          matter; what matters is that right
          now, you're in a shitload of trouble.
          You understand that, right?
No response.
                      HARDY
          Now, I don't know if you did what
          you did in self defense and frankly
          I don't really care. I'm just doing
          a favor for Colonel Styles because
          he wants to know if anyone else who's
          still out there is in need of
          assistance. To be honest with you,
          though, I don't care about that
          either.
Dunbar looks up at this, surprised.
                      HARDY
          I don't know those guys, you do.
          They die, to me, it's like seeing a
          couple people died in a fire on the
          news - tragic, but it doesn't affect
          me. The only thing I care about is
          I agreed to do a favor for a friend
          and try and talk to you till your
          transpo shows up. You like baseball?
No response.   Osborne looks at her watch - two minutes.
                      HARDY
          I could talk baseball for   days.
          Batting averages, ERA's, I   got
          statistics in my brain, I   don't know
          how I remember them. It's    freaky.
          You wanna talk baseball?
Dunbar, completely confused.
                      HARDY
          Come on Ray, we're gonna be here
          five hours, we gotta talk about
          something. So who do you like?
A long silence and then:

                                                        13.
                      DUNBAR
          I don't like baseball.
Hardy grins as Osborne stops her watch at 2:41.
                      HARDY
          Why not?
                      DUNBAR
          I asked for a policeman.
                      HARDY
          You're under military arrest, it's
          not gonna happen. What's wrong with
          baseball?
                      DUNBAR
          It's... too slow.
                      HARDY
          Well, it's a game of anticipation,
          that's the beauty.
                      DUNBAR
          I just don't like it.
                      HARDY
          What do you like then?
As they continue, we TRACK under the table to reveal a HIDDEN
MICROPHONE...
INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- MORNING
Styles and an M.P. listening to the Coffee Room conversation.
DUNBAR'S VOICE, over the speaker:
                      DUNBAR (O.S.)
          I don't know... I like the Army.
                      HARDY (O.S.)
          C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army
          during Basic. I'll tell you straight,
          I hated it here.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING
                      DUNBAR
          You did Basic here?
                      HARDY
          Fifteen years ago under Sergeant
          West. Piece of work, that guy. I
          remember, he used to have these two
          silver .45's with ivory handles and
          if you weren't quick enough, he'd
                      (MORE)

                                                              14.
                         HARDY (CONT'D)
             knock you on the head with one of
             them. He still carry those guns?
He Dunbar nods.
                         HARDY
             I was also his " knife dummy" .
                 (to Osborne)
             See, West used to say he could slit
             a man from stem to sternum in three
             seconds. He'd use this length of
             pipe to demonstrate and if you were
             the knife dummy, you'd spend all day
             getting a pipe rammed into your balls
             if you weren't fast enough to defend
             yourself. That was a loooong day.
Hardy laughs at the memory and turns back to Dunbar.
                         HARDY
             Incidentally, Ray, I promised them
             I'd ask where West and the others
             are. Can we get to them?
He looks to the floor.
                         DUNBAR
             There's no need...
                         HARDY
             They're dead, aren't they?
Dunbar looks back up at Hardy.
                         DUNBAR
             Yeah.
INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- MORNING
Styles lowers his head at this.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING
                         HARDY
             You kill them?
No answer.    Hardy rubs his nose.   Osborne steps forward.
                         OSBORNE
             The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez,
             You're a murderer-
                         HARDY
             See, Ray, this is what we call "good
             cop, bad cop".
                 (MORE)

                                                        15.
                       HARDY
          She shouts, I stand up for you, you're
          grateful, a bond of trust is
          established.
Osborne, stunned by this.
                      HARDY
          But I don't want to play games.
          That's why you're not in an
          interrogation room, with one of those
          two way mirrors - everyone knows
          those things are two way, right?
Dunbar looks at him good nods slowly.
                      HARDY
          Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you
          another donut and you think about
          whether you want to talk more, okay?
                      DUNBAR
          Okay.
Hardy smiles at him, gets up, and leaves.
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR -- MORNING
Osborne follows him out into the hall where Styles waits.
                      OSBORNE
          Baseball?
                      HARDY
          Believe somebody owes me ten dollars-
                      OSBORNE
          You made me look like an idiot-
                      HARDY
          Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the
          object of the interrogation is to
          make you look good- Everyone knows
          good cop, bad cop - by admitting it
          I appeared trustworthy.
                      STYLES
          You think he did it?
                      OSBORNE
          No-
                      HARDY
          Yes-
They stop, looking at each other.

                                                          16.
                      STYLES
          You've got four hours and forty-five
          minutes to find out.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING

Hardy returns, another donut in hand, Osborne behind him.

                      HARDY
          Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?

                      DUNBAR
          I'm not telling you what happened.

                      HARDY
          Okay... but I would like to know
          about the other cadets. What they
          were like - nice guys? Dunbar takes
          a deep breath.

                      DUNBAR
          Some.

                      HARDY
          Tell me about them.

As Dunbar begins to talk, we FLASHBACK...

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO

Row upon row of freshly shaven headed CADETS stand at
attention. Their first day of boot camp.

                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          First day was when I met Pike.    Sarge
          hated him from the beginning.

A man with a face of granite strides up and down the lines.

Two ivory handled pistols on his hips. His lifeless cobalt
blue eyes take in the Cadets. This is SERGEANT WEST.

                      WEST
          You motherfuckers have just made the
          worst mistake of your lives! You
          have chosen to join my Army! This
          Army is my mother, my father, and my
          little virgin sister and I will not
          allow anyone or anything that is not
          up to my standards near her pretty
          little virgin cooze, do you understand
          me - give me a sir, yes, sir!

                      THE CADETS
          Sir, yes, sir!

                                                         17.
                      WEST
          Those who I deem unworthy to pass
          through this camp will quit, and
          those who refuse to quit I will kill.
          You ever hear of a training accident -
          Give me a sir, yes, sir!
                      THE CADETS
          Sir, yes, sir!
                      WEST
          In my time I have killed sixteen men
          for the good of my country, sixteen
          men whose entrance into this Army I
          could not condone, as it would weaken
          the fabric of this nation's defense!
          This base suffers an average of three
          training accidents a year, unfortunate
          incidents that I will not hesitate
          to repeat if you cross me, understand -
          Give me a sir, yes, sir!
                      THE CADETS
          Sir, yes, sir!
                      WEST
          So forget what you've seen on Sixty
          fucking Minutes about the kinder,
          gentler military - you will either
          succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
He walks over to a tall black cadet in the front row.   PIKE.
                      WEST
          My power here is absolute, isn't
          that right, nigger?
                      PIKE
          Sir, yes, sir!
West hauls off and SLAPS Pike across the face!
                      WEST
          I hail from Biloxi, Mississippi where
          we string greasy coon necks up from
          tree branches when the mood strikes
          us you have a problem with that?
                      PIKE
          Sir, no, sir!
West grabs Pike by the neck, CHOKING HIM. The others Cadets
GASP. Pike goes down on his knees, the loss of air is so
great. He reaches up automatically to try and save himself...

                                                          18.
                      WEST
          What the fuck is this? You lay a
          hand on me while I'm trying to do my
          duty and rid the world of you?
He KICKS PIKE IN THE BALLS and releases him. Pike goes fetal
on the ground, VOMITING, as West stands over him, screaming.
                      WEST
          Get the fuck up, you're still in
          formation, get the fuck up!
Pike somehow gets to his feet, vomit streaking his clothes.
                       WEST
          What the fuck have you done to that
          uniform, take it off, take it off,
          take it off!
Pike, still gasping, can't move fast enough.    West slaps him
again and tears the man's shirt off.
                      WEST
          Get those fucking pants off, I want
          you buck ass naked, you don't deserve
          to wear these beautiful United States
          Army issue clothes!
Pike struggles off the rest of his clothes until he is NAKED.
West turns and spies Dunbar in the line.
                      WEST
          Cadet, what's your name!
                      DUNBAR
          Sir, Dunbar, sir!
                      WEST
          You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
                      DUNBAR
          Sir, yes, sir!
West draws one of his PISTOLS and gives it to him.
                      WEST
          Dunbar you are to stand here and
          guard this nigger for the next twenty-
          four hours! He is not to be given
          food, water, or clothes! If he so
          much as moves, you are to blow his
          nigger brains out, is that clear?
                      DUNBAR
          Sir, yes, sir!

                                                           19.
                      WEST
          The rest of you, fallout for
          physicals!
The rest of the Cadets fallout, following West away to one
of the buildings, leaving Dunbar and Pike.
One with a gun, the other naked.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Fifteen guys quit that day.    But not
          Pike.
EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING
The CADETS, navigating a log spanned over a PIT OF MUD.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Time went on and the Sarge started
          singling people out.
One of the Cadets, a small man named ANDERSON, falls from
the log. Screaming, West dives into the pit and pulls
Anderson out, knocking him on the head with a pistol.
EXT. TARMAC -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- AFTERNOON
Anderson stands naked, his arms straining to hold up,TWO
PAINT CANS perpendicular to his body as West berates him.
                      DUNBAR
          He'd zero in on a fella and ride him
          till he quit.
EXT. MAIN GATE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- NIGHT
Anderson, now in civilian clothes, gets into a TAXI.   Quit.
EXT. FIRING RANGE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING
West, screaming at a weasely looking cadet named CHILDS.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Those who wouldn't quit, he'd put in
          what he called Section Eight.
INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- NIGHT
A horribly dilapidated quarters. Four cadets, Dunbar, Pike,
Childs, and MUELLER sleep in rickety bunks.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Washout rejects, guys he said were ,
          "dumbfucks too stupid to know they
          were dead". He separated us from
          the rest. We slept alone...

                                                          20.
INT. MESS HALL -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING
The same four Cadets, eating ON THE FLOOR as the other members
of the Cadet Corps chow at tables.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          . . .ate alone.. .
EXT. REGULAR BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- EVENING
The four Cadets fallout on a run shirtless, with heavy packs
and rifles held over their heads as the rest of the Cadet
Corps files into their barracks for sleep.
                      DUNBAR ( V. O . )
          ...and trained long after the other
          guys got to turn in.
EXT. PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING
The Cadet Corps, mustered. West zeroes in on NUNEZ (the
"dead one"), whose t-shirt has a spot on it.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Fellas lived in daily fear of being
          Sectioned and with good reason, too.
West pulls Nunez out of line by his ear and kicks him over
towards a separate muster of our Four Section Eighters.
                      DUNBAR
          They figured we were the boys who'd
          meet with a "training accident" .
Nunez takes a place among them.   Looking absolutely terrified.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
Osborne leans forward.
                       OSBORNE
          Are you saying Sergeant West tried
          to kill you?
                      DUNBAR
          No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit.
          Making it through was kind of an
          honor. Some of the other guys on
          the base told us that if you could
          hack Section Eight, Command would
          consider you at the top of the class.
                      HARDY
          That's not exactly true...
              (off their looks)
          I'm living proof. How did you get
          Sectioned, Ray?

                                                        21.
Dunbar gives a look that almost resembles a smile.
                      DUNBAR
          That first night with Pike. I made
          the mistake of letting him sit down
          at around 0300.
                      OSBORNE
          Tell us about the other guys, the
          ones West weeded out.
                      DUNBAR
          There were six of us...
EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE.-- ONE WEEK AGO -- EVENING
The six members of Section Eight on a forced run through the
rain. We focus in each face as Dunbar describes them. First
up is MUELLER a tall Aryan looking blonde with a square jaw.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Mueller was from Tulsa, a real good
          ol' boy type. One of those "his
          Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull
          Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was
          gonna take away his scatter gun" .
          He idolized West.
Muller, grinning, as West kicks his ass to pick up the pace.
Next to him is NUNEZ, a strapping hulk of a manchild.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big
          fella from New Mexico. After he got
          Sectioned he just followed Mueller
          around like a lap dog. He wasn't
          mean like Mueller, though, didn't
          have it in him.
Next to Nunez is CHILDS, small and weasely with feral eyes.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          But Childs did. Didn't talk to
          anyone, but you got this feeling
          something was wrong with him, like
          real wrong. Type of guy you felt
          uncomfortable going to sleep near.
Behind Childs runs Pike.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Pike I told you about. He took the
          brunt of it from Mueller and West.
          Once they found it out he was a
          convict they were merciless.
                      (MORE)

                                                           22.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          He'd been busted for Auto Theft,
          judge gave him the option of jailor
          the Army. He made the wrong choice.
Next to Pike, Dunbar and KENDALL run side by side.   Kendall
is short like Childs, but also weak. Wheezing.
                      DUNBAR
          Finally Kendall and me. Kendall was
          a smart guy, we got along okay.
          Pike and I tried to help him, but...
Kendall falters and Pike stops to try and help him up. West
smacks the him away, practically kicking Kendall to his feet.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          He was sickly. Had that shaking
          thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
                       OSBORNE (V.O.)
          Epilepsy.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Yeah. Spent half his time in the
          infirmary. Only reason he enlisted
          was his father. West didn't section
          him till last week.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                      HARDY
          And those were the guys who went on
          the exercise with you?
                       DUN BAR
          Yeah.   And that's all I'm saying.
Hardy leans back in his chair.
                      HARDY
          You smoke, Ray?
                      DUNBAR
          This is one of those interrogation
          tricks, isn't it? You don't give me
          a cigarette till I tell you more.
                      HARDY
          No, actually, I just left mine in
          the car and was hoping you had some.
Dunbar studies him for a moment and then pulls a pack of
Dorals from his pocket and puts them on the table.
                       HARDY
          My brand.   Must be my lucky day.

                                                         23.
He takes one and lights it.      Dunbar does the same.
                      HARDY
          Let me ask you one thing. You seem
          like a good guy, Ray. You carried
          Kendall wounded to the pickup. So
          what I don't get is what you did to
          make Nunez want to kill you?
Dunbar just looks at the ground. A KNOCK at the door.    Hardy
and Osborne turn to see an M.P. stick his head in.
                         M. P.
          Sirs?
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- MORNING
Hardy and Osborne emerge to find Styles waiting for them.
                      HARDY
          He's not done by a longshot, I can
          get more out of him-
                         STYLES
          He can wait.     Kendall's out of
          surgery.
EXT. ARMY JEEP (MOVING) -- MORNING
Hardy and Osborne sit in the back of the open car as it
rumbles across the grounds, headed towards the Base Hospital.
They sit in silence until:
                      HARDY
          Why'd you join the army?
Osborne looks at him, annoyed.
                      OSBORNE
          You really want to make banal chit-
          Chat like that now?
                      HARDY
          You're right. We should sit in
          silence.
                      OSBORNE
          We're in the middle of a murder case-
                      HARDY
          Best time for banal chit-chat.
He slips something into his pocket.
                      OSBORNE
          What is that?

                                                    24.
                      HARDY
          Microrecorder for Kendall - didn't
          have- time to wire his room. Now
          tell me why you joined the army or
          I'll jab this pen through your neck.
Osborne smiles in spite of, herself.
                      OSBORNE
          Typical army brat story. Dad was
          noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was
          never any real doubt of joining up.
                      HARDY
          You had a mobile of bayonets above
          your crib.
                      OSBORNE
          Something like that.     You?
                      HARDY
          I lost a bet.
Osborne laughs.
                      OSBORNE
          You're kidding.
                      HARDY
          Yeah. That's just the story I tell
          the girls to get them into bed.
          Truth is... I don't know. The whole
          honor and duty thing. Make a
          difference in the world, crap like
          that. Didn't really work out.
Osborne studies him.
                         OSBORNE
          I bet    that's the second story you
          tell    the girls to get them into bed,
          after    you make them laugh with the
          first    one.
Hardy just smiles.
                      OSBORNE
          This is the straight hitting on me
          you were talking about, isn't it?
                      HARDY
          The very same.
                      OSBORNE
          You do understand that there's
          absolutely no way I could ever be
          attracted to you, right?

                                                        25.
                      HARDY
          I plan to grow on you.
                      OSBORNE
          You're off to a late start.
                        HARDY
          So noted.
They pass an OVERTURNED CLIMBING TOWER.
                      HARDY
          You guys really got the shit kicked
          out of you here.
                      OSBORNE
          Imagine what it must have been like
          for them out there. What do you
          think of Dunbar?
                      HARDY
          He's telling the truth, up to a point.
                        OSBORNE
          What point?
Hardy doesn't respond, instead looking out as they pass the
SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS.
                      OSBORNE
          Something wrong?
                      HARDY
          Being back here. Gives me the
          willies.
                      OSBORNE
          Not the happiest of memories?
FLASHCUT TO - FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. A bunch of young Cadets,
Hardy and Styles among them, doing forced push-ups by the
barracks in the rain as West randomly berates and KICKS THEM.
BACK TO HARDY - As he looks away and shakes it off.
                        HARDY
          No.
INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- RECOVERY UNIT -- DAY
A NURSE leads Hardy and Osborne down a spotless white hall.
                      NURSE
          Normally we wouldn't let anyone see
          him this soon, but Colonel Styles
          said it was urgent-

                                                         26.
                      HARDY
          It is.
                      OSBORNE
          Remember, he's the son of a Senator,
          so go easy. Kid gloves.
                      HARDY
          Got it.
INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- KENDALL'S ROOM -- DAY
Kendall lies in a bed, a network of tubes in his arm.   He is
awake but pale, still weak. He studies his visitors.
                      KENDALL
          You... I've seen you around the Base.
          But you...
              (POINTING TO HARDY)
          You're not Army, are you?
                      HARDY
          Coast Guard, special detective detail.
          We feel this incident may have put
          the beaches of Florida at risk.
Kendall's laugh turns into a cough.   Placing Hardy.
                      KENDALL
          That's it. You're that policeman
          with friends in low places. Tell
          me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these
          days? Those racketeering indictments
          must have really been a downer-
                      HARDY
          Levi, you got about four hours before
          armed men show up here, put you on a
          plane to Washington, and lock you in
          a very small dark room.  I suggest
          you talk to us.
Kendall smiles again, not losing any of his cool.
                      KENDALL
          I've done nothing wrong.
              (gestures to his wound)
          I'm the victim here.
                      HARDY
          But not the only victim, right?
                      KENDALL
          My, my, my, how did things turn so
          hostile so quickly? If I didn't
          know better, I'd say you two were
          out to get me.

                                                          27.
                      OSBORNE
          We just want-
                      KENDALL
          What, "The Truth"? Please. There
          are degrees of truth, officer, always
          degrees. Things are not what they
          seem.
Hardy stares at him for a moment and then gets up to leave.
                      HARDY
          It's too early in the day for me to
          give a shit about some pissant cadet's
          bad version of "intrigue". You want
          to talk to us, send word over to the
          brig. Let's go.
Nonplussed, Osborne follows.    Hardy turns back at the door.
                      HARDY
          You're working too hard, Levi. I
          can tell cause you're sweating. And
          you're sweating cause you have no
          idea what Dunbar's already told us.
INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- CORRIDORS -- DAY
Hardy and Osborne walk to the NURSE'S STATION.
                      OSBORNE
          That was kid gloves?
                      HARDY
          Have no fear, Osborne, we have not
          yet begun to fight.
He pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it.
                      OSBORNE
          But we have to question him-
              (noticing)
          Thought you didn't have cigarettes-
                       HARDY
          I lied.   Wait for it...
Osborne just stares at him, not knowing what to say next.
The PHONE at the Nurse's Station rings and a NURSE answers.
Listens for a moment, hangs up, and turns to them.
                      NURSE
          Cadet Kendall-
                      HARDY
          We're on our way.

                                                        28.
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
Hardy and Osborne sit across from Kendall's bed.
                      HARDY
          Sergeant West is dead isn't he?
Kendall nods.
                      HARDY
          And the other three Cadets?
Kendall hesitates, then nods again.
                      HARDY
          Feel free to elaborate .
Kendall takes a breath and begins, all trace of bravado gone.
                      KENDALL
          My father is a powerful man. Over
          the years he's used that power to
          protect me, in one form or another,
          from certain... unpleasantries.
              (deep breath)
          I am a homosexual.
                      HARDY
          Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
                      KENDALL
          He is not, shall we say, wild about
          the idea. He has asked me on numerous
          occasions to be more discreet about
          my proclivities, and I have done my
          best to oblige him. However, in the
          last four weeks, I began a
          relationship with another cadet.
          What do you think of that?
                      HARDY
          I think you just blew "Don't Ask,
          Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
                      KENDALL
          The Sergeant discovered this
          relationship and wanted me expelled.
          My father interceded, so instead,
          West Sectioned me and made sure every
          other cadet knew that I was gay.
                      OSBORNE
          He couldn't kick you out so he wanted
          you to quit on your own.
                      KENDALL
          He wanted more than that.

                                                        29.
                      HARDY
          More intrigue, Levi?

Kendall stares at them, dead serious.

                      KENDALL
          Yes.

INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- LAST NIGHT

The six Cadets asleep, all except Kendall, who stares up at
the patchwork ceiling.

                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          It was the regular Tuesday night
          drill. He'd let us sleep for an
          hour and then wake us up, drag us
          out to the bayou, and work us all
          night, separate from the others.
          The door SLAMS OPEN, revealing West.

                      WEST
          Get up, get up, get up! We're going
          on a little night hike, boys - muster
          in five on the south tarmac!

He leaves as the Sectioners rise, groaning.

                      PIKE
          Hurricane's due after midnight and
          we're still going out?

                      MUELLER
          Toughens us up, Pike.    You don't
          like it, quit.

Pike pulls on his pants and shoots him the finger.

                      KENDALL
          Maybe we shouldn't go.

                      MUELLER
          The faggot speaks.

                      KENDALL
          You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?

                      MUELLER
              (mocking gay lisp)
          You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?

Mueller and Childs laugh, but Nunez looks concerned.

                      NUNEZ
          You really heard this?

                                                          30.
                      PIKE
          You know Popham, works in the kitchen?
          He told me it was on the radio.
He stops, listening.    They all hear the WIND, HOWLING outside.
                      KENDALL
          We should tell him we're not going.
                      MUELLER
          Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir,
          we don't feel like going out - we
          don't want to get rained on." He'll
          kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
He pulls on his rain poncho and is out the door, Nunez right
behind him. The others, getting ready, all except Kendall.
Dunbar comes over and puts a hand on his shoulder.
                        DUNBAR
          He's right.    We don't have a choice.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- TARMAC -- LAST NIGHT
The six cadets, mustered in front of West and a TRANSPORT
CHOPPER. West hands out M-16's, sidearms, and grenades while
yelling above the wind.
                      WEST
          A rifle, a pistol, and three
          phosphorous grenades to a man! This
          is live fire, so keep those safetied
          until we touch down; I don't want
          anyone shooting their dick off!
Some chuckling.
                      WEST
          Some of you may have heard there's a
          hurricane coming! American soldiers
          do not wait for good weather - they
          do not wait for a bright sunshiney
          day to do their duty! An American
          Soldier learns to operate in the
          worst conditions and turn said
          conditions into an advantage against
          their enemy! Anyone who thinks these
          conditions are too harsh, feel free
          to lay down and die, you get me?
                      THE CADETS
          Sir, yes, sir!
                      WEST
          LZ is two clicks North of a cabin,
          you are to split into teams of two
                      (MORE)

                                                          31.
                      WEST (CONT'D)
          and work your way through your
          designated area blasting as many
          targets as you can find! Each area
          has twenty targets, first team to
          take all twenty and find the cabin
          wins! Teams are as follows - Dunbar
          and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall
          and Childs!
Mueller groans.
                      WEST
          I will be in the areas monitoring
          your progress and if I see anyone
          drag ass I will personally slit you
          stem to sternum and leave you for
          dead! Fall out!
The Cadets board the Transport Chopper. Kendall gets on
last, passing West who leans in and whispers to him:
                      WEST
          You're gonna die tonight, faggot.
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
Osborne looks up.
                      OSBORNE
          He said what?
                      KENDALL
          "You're gonna die tonight, faggot" .
          Clear as day.
                      OSBORNE
          No one else heard it?
                      KENDALL
          He whispered it in my ear.
Hardy scratches his temple.
                      HARDY
          Levi, I don't know   if you're familiar
          with investigative   work, but we have
          this little thing   called "motive"
          and you just gave   yourself one.
                      KENDALL
          You said you wanted to know what
          happened- I'm telling you the truth.
                      HARDY
          What happened to "degrees"?

                                                           32.
                      KENDALL
          Didn't kill him-
                      HARDY
          Then who did?
INT. ARMY TRANSPORT HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- LAST NIGHT
On Kendall, sitting among the Sectioners in silence.
terrified he looks like he's about to throw up.
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          I wanted to tell someone what he'd
          said, but I couldn't. Mueller would
          just laugh. Nunez and Childs wouldn't
          care. Pike and Dunbar were okay,
          but... When West outed me, he isolated
          me. An outcast among outcasts. And
          I'd just been told tonight was the
          night I'd die.
The Chopper touches down on the edge of the BAYOU. The door
rumbles open as West points out different team directions in
the blackness.
                      WEST
          First team, second team, third team,
          go, go, go!
The click of rifles being unsafetied as the cadets pour out
of the helicopter.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
We track with Kendall and Childs as they head away from the
Landing Zoe, rifles up, heads down, side by side. Moving
the brush quickly and quietly, eyes scanning for targets.
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          I knew Childs a little, we worked at
          the PX together.
The wind is picking up and it's started to RAIN.   Their
ponchos flap loudly against the elements.
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          I started getting it in my head that
          maybe West had paid him, maybe he
          was the one who was supposed to give
          me a training accident-
The ROAR of GUNFIRE!  Kendall turns  towards it,  SCREAMING
for a moment... Until he sees Childs  lower his  smoking rifle,
a SHREDDED TARGET on a tree in front  of them.   He looks down,
noticing has his own weapon TRAINED  ON CHILDS.  ..
Childs steps forward, knocking Kendall's rifle away.

                                                           33.
                      CHILDS
          Don't you ever point a gun at me!

                      KENDALL
          I'm- I'm sorry. . .

Kendall, terrified. Shaking. A beat. Childs picks up the
rifle from the ground and hands it back to him.

                      CHILDS
          Come on, let's move.

VARIOUS SHOTS -- Kendall and Childs, moving through the bayou,
Childs taking out targets. It's raining harder now.

                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          All I could think of was West, out
          there somewhere in the dark. Maybe
          watching the others, maybe watching
          me. And waiting to make his move.

Childs speaks, and Kendall almost jumps out of his skin.

                      CHILDS
          Christ, am I alone in this world?
          Shoot something-

A SOUND from the left. Kendall panics, pivots, and FIRES...
Into DARKNESS. No target, no West, no nothing. Kendall,
really freaked out now.

                      CHILDS
          A target, Kendall, cap a fucking
          target. What's wrong with you?

                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          I thought I was gonna have an attack.
          Go into a fit and bite off my own
          tongue in the middle of the bayou.
          Childs could tell I wasn't right.

                      CHILDS
          Just safety your shit and get behind
          me, okay? I'll take care of this.

Kendall nods and lets Childs walk ahead. Staring at Childs'
back as they move on. On Kendall's face, thinking...

                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          Maybe it was a trick. Maybe this
          was when they'd get me, when I felt
          safest.

CLOSE. ON KENDALL'S FINGER - Clicking off the safety again.
Moving towards the trigger...

                                                             34.
                         KENDALL (V.O.)
            But if I struck first and took out
            Childs, then maybe I could make it
            out alive...
Kendall raises the rifle.    Sights Childs' back.      A moment
of utter silence and then...
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                        KENDALL
            Maybe I shouldn't tell you that.
            Maybe I should tell you I wasn't
            scared at all. But I was...
                (long pause)
            Enough to almost kill him.
                        HARDY
            But you didn't.
                          KENDALL
            No.    Poetic justice, though.
                             OSBORNE
            Why?
No reply.   Hardy smiles, understanding.
                        HARDY
            Because Childs is the one who shot
            you.
Osborne looks up, surprised.           Kendall nods.
                        KENDALL
            But that came later.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
As Kendall safeties his rifle and lowers it... The SOUND of
a tremendous EXPLOSION comes from their right! Kendall and
Childs knocked off their feet as the sky momentarily LIGHTS
UP with the blast as a MAN SCREAMS!
                             CHILDS
            Over there!
Childs points to the right, where the dim shine of PHOSPHOROUS
can be seen through the trees. He drags Kendall to his feet
and the two take off running towards it.
Kendall panting and scared, ducking branches and leaping
ditches as the two sprint towards the dying glow.
                             CHILDS
            Hello!    HEL-

                                                           35.
The sound of GUNFIRE!   Childs TACKLES Kendall...
                        CHILDS
          GET DOWN!
They hit the deck, face down in mud. It takes them a second
to realize the shots are not directed at them.
                      CHILDS
          Fuck, what the fuck is going on-
                      KENDALL
          What do we do?
                      CHILDS
          Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
He trails off. The gunfire and screaming have stopped.
Silence now, save for the wind and rain.
                      KENDALL
          Don't want to go-
                        CHILDS
          Fine.
Childs rises and heads towards where the sounds were.
Kendall, lying in the rain and mud, shivering.    Alone.   After
a moment he gets up and follows.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED,-- LAST NIGHT
The SCORCHED GROUND and TREES smolder under the rainfall.
Kendall finds Childs, standing down by the creek.
Something lies by his feet.
                        KENDALL
          What's-
He stops, seeing.
                      KENDALL
          Oh, Jesus.. .
WEST. Literally spread out on the ground, dead. Eyes open,
face half blackened, he has been ripped in two at the torso.
A horrifying sight. Kendall stumbles back from it.
                      KENDALL
          Did- Did you-
                       CHILDS
          It was the grenade you fucking idiot.
          Look at him!

                                                          36.
Kendall can't.   He sits, sobbing.   Part horror, part relief.
                      CHILDS
          This isn't our area.   Whose area is
          This-
                      MUELLER
          Can anybody hear me!
Childs pivots at the sound of Mueller coming over the ridge.
                      MUELLER
          Hey, I-
              (seeing it)
          Holy fuck. .,. holy fuck, what the
          fuck did you guys do?
                      CHILDS
          We found him like this-
Mueller raises his rifle at the weeping Kendall.
                      MUELLER
          You killed him you fucking faggot-
                      CHILDS
          We found him like this! Kendall was
          with me the whole- Listen to me!
Mueller, finally seeming to understand.    Lowering the gun.
                      MUELLER
          Jesus, Jesus fucking Christ...
Muttering to himself, walking in circles.
                      CHILDS
          Where's Pike?
No response.
                      CHILDS
          Mueller, where's Pike?
Mueller looks up.
                      MUELLER
          We got- I don't know, we got separated
                      CHILDS
          Before or after the explosion?
              (no response)
          Mueller-
                      MUELLER
          I don't know!

                                                        37.
                      KENDALL
          How can you not know-
Mueller comes at him, screaming:
                      MUELLER
          Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot,
          You just shut the FUCK UP-
                        CHILDS
          HEY!
Mueller stops, eyes crazed. Childs looks to the sky, which
is becoming worse by the second.
                      CHILDS
          We have to get out of this.    To find
          the cabin.
He helps Kendall to his feet.
                      KENDALL
          What about Pike?
                      CHILDS
          Maybe he'll be there.    Either way,
          we have to go.
Kendall nods, slowly.   The two start up the hill.
                      MUELLER
          Shouldn't we- I mean, we shouldn't
          just leave him here.
He points down to West's body.    Childs looks at it.
                      CHILDS
          You can carry him if you want.
He and Kendall continue on. Mueller lingers a moment longer
and then turns, following them up the hill.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
Kendall, Childs, and Mueller make their way through the bush.
The WIND and RAIN have conspired into a FULL BLOWN HURRICANE.
The three men are practically stumbling now, leaning in
against it to stay on their feet. Kendall spies something
through the maelstrom. It looks like WET WOOD. He points:
                        KENDALL
          There!
THE CABIN -- Wooden, one story, and large, it resembles a
solidly built shack. It is being thrashed by the storm.

                                                          38.
The trio stumble towards the front door...
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
Obviously abandoned. Bare of any furniture save for two
wooden chairs next to an empty fireplace.
DUNBAR and NUNEZ shout in surprise as the three men
practically collapse into the cabin. Dunbar runs to bolt
the door against the elements as Nunez helps them up.
                      NUNEZ
          What happened to you-
                      MUELLER
          What happened to you?
                      DUNBAR
          We finished the course and came here,
          Then heard an explosion-
              (to Mueller)
          Where's Pike?
                      CHILDS
          We don't know. West is dead.
Silence. Dunbar and Nunez stare at him.    Mueller jerks a
hand towards Kendall and Childs.
                      MUELLER
          They found him. Poor fucker was
          Practically blown in half-
                      KENDALL
          Poor fucker my ass...
                      MUELLER
          You better watch it, faggot, I'm not
          Sure you and Childs didn't do him-
                      CHILDS
          What about you, wandering around
          Alone? At least we have an alibi-
                      DUNBAR
          What do you mean, alone?
                      MUELLER
          Pike and I got separated-
                      KENDALL
          Yeah and he doesn't know when-
                      MUELLER
          I remember now, it was before the
          Explosion-

                                                         39.
                      KENDALL
          Oh, you remember now-
                      MUELLER
          I'm about two seconds away from seeing
          If fairies really can fly-
                      NUNEZ
          What about Pike?
Mueller stops, as the others turn towards the big man.
Silence. They realize what the question means.
                      DUNBAR
          He wouldn't kill anybody. . .
                      MUELLER
          Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict.
          You know how much he hated West-
                      DUNBAR
          I hated West, Childs hated West,
          everyone with a goddamn brain hated
          West but that doesn't mean we killed
          him!
                      NUNEZ
          What if it wasn't one of us?    What
          if it was a local-
                      KENDALL
          He was blown up by a phosphorous
          grenade, they don't exactly sell
          those at 7-11.
                      MUELLER
          Look, here are the facts - Roberto
          was with Dunbar, Queen Kendall was
          with Childs, and Pike's the only one
          not here. He did it!
The others nod, becoming convinced.
                      CHILDS
          He is the only one unaccounted for.
                      KENDALL
          Maybe he's dead too.    Maybe you killed
          Them both, Mueller-
                      DUNBAR
          Shut up.
              (to Mueller)
          Let me see your grenades.
                      MUELLER
          Why?

                                                             40.
                      DUNBAR
          We were each given three so whoever
          killed West will be missing one.
Mueller angrily digs into his sack and pulls out his grenades.
                          MUELLER
          See?   Three.     Now can we please-
He stops. Hearing a SOUND outside.        Through the wind and
rain, FOOTSTEPS on the porch.
They all turn to the door.       Waiting...
The DOOR SWINGS OPEN.. Pike.       Covered in BLOOD.
                          PIKE
          Hey, guys.
They stare at him as he calmly closes the door and walks
over to the empty FIREPLACE. Finally:
                      DUNBAR
          Whose blood is that, Jay?       West's.
                      PIKE
          Any kindling for afire?
He looks around for kindling.       A beat.
                      DUNBAR
          What do you mean, West's?
                      PIKE
          I mean I killed him.
              (pause)
          Isn't that what we all wanted?
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                      HARDY
          He admitted it.
                      KENDALL
          Right in front of us. Mueller went
          after him but we held him back.
          Pike surrendered and volunteered to
          be tied up. So we roped him to a
          chair and tried to ride out the storm.
                      OSBORNE
          Why would he just surrender?
Kendall turns to her and smiles.
                      KENDALL
          Because he had a plan.

                                                        41.
INT. CABIN -- LIVING ROOM -- LAST NIGHT
Pike, tied to a chair by the fireplace while the others look
for, food in the KITCHEN. Alone, Kendall walks past Pike:
                      PIKE
          Hey, Kendall, talk to you for a sec?
Kendall looks around - there seems no harm in it.
                      PIKE
          You hated West as much as I did.
          I'm not saying what I did was right,
          but you can't tell me you're not
          glad the motherfucker's dead.
Kendall says nothing. Pike looks around, makes sure no one
is listening and then whispers:
                      PIKE
          The thing is, we've got a real
          opportunity here. You turn me in
          Tomorrow and we're both fucked-
                      KENOALL
          What are you talking about?
                      PIKE
          A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge
          get fragged on a training exercise?
          The press'll crucify you and your
          father. His career will be over and
          it'll be your fault. But we do this
          different and you come out a hero.
On Kendall, thinking about it.    A beat.
                        KENOALL
          How?
                        PIKE
          Mueller.    He's as bad as West and we
          both know   it. Now I can't do it,
          cause I'm   tied up, but we get the
          others to   go along-
                      KENDALL
          Don't think I want to hear this-
                      PIKE
          Someone else can do the deed, it
          doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez
          too, he's got a tendency to follow
          Mueller, but the rest of us can come
          out ahead - the guys who took out
          their Sergeant's killers!
                      (MORE)

                                                        42.
                        PIKE (CONT'D)
          We'll   move the bodies out to the
          creek   and say we came over the hill
          right   as they fragged West, all we
          gotta   do is tell the story right.
Kendall stares at him.   Disgusted.
                      KENDALL
          You're sick, Pike.
He turns and walks away.   Pike watches him go.
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          Later on I.saw him talking to Dunbar.
          They had been close. I was in another
          room when it happened.
INT. CABIN -- KITCHEN LAST NIGHT
Kendall, looking through the empty cabinets for food when
A GUNSHOT -- From the living room. As Kendall bolts towards
the noise, the air is filled with the sounds of SCREAMING
and SHOOTING! He pushes through the door...
INT. CABIN -- LIVING ROOM -- LAST NIGHT
Kendall, coming through the door as we SLO-MO...
Mueller, sprawled out on the floor, dead... Pike, tied to
the chair, bullethole in his forehead... Nunez, wounded,
stumbling out the front door into the hurricane...
And a badly wounded Childs, pistol out, TURNING towards the
SOUND OF THE DOOR and FIRING...
Kendall's arm, HIT with a SLUG, and he starts to go down...
FREEZE-FRAME -- On Kendall's form, falling.
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          I don't think he meant to do it. It
          was just reflex - he'd already been
          gutshot. I must have passed out
          cause next thing I knew...
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- DAWN
The sounds of RUNNING  and HEAVY BREATHING. Kendall's eyes
flutter open. He's on   Dunbar's back, being carried through
the woods. The sound   of GUNFIRE and a TREE BRANCH SHATTERS
next to them. Someone   is chasing them. Trying to kill them.
Nunez.

                                                        43.
Dunbar bobs and weaves as another volley of bullets comes
from behind and we can now hear ROTOR BLADES APPROACHING...
EXT. CLEARING -- DAWN
As Dunbar bursts into the sunlight, carrying Kendall.
The entire thing dreamlike, what we saw at the opening, but
from KENDALL'S VIEWPOINT -- the helicopter overhead, Nunez
behind, Dunbar turning and shooting, NUNEZ GOING DOWN...
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                       KENDALL
           And that's it.
Hardy is silent.    Staring at him.
                       OSBORNE
           Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
                       KENDALL
           Because he'd shot Mueller.
                       OSBORNE
           But you didn't see it, right?
                       KENDALL
           Like I said, I was in the kitchen.
           When I came out, Mueller and Pike
           were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit
           and Dunbar was gone.
                       HARDY
           Why did he come back for you?
                       KENDALL
           I honestly don't know. Maybe to
           have someone to cover for him. And
           I wish I could, but there's no doubt
           in my mind he killed those men.
Silence.   Kendall's got nothing more to say.
                       HARDY
           Okay. I think that's it.     He rises
           and walks to the door.
                        KENDALL
           Mr. Hardy?
Hardy turns back.
                       KENDALL
           What did Dunbar tell you?

                                                        44.
Hardy smiles and pushes out the door...

EXT. STYLES' OFFICE -- DAY

Hardy and Osborne stand before the Colonel, filling him in.

                      HARDY
          Pike killed West, Dunbar killed
          Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.

                      STYLES
          Who killed Pike?

                      HARDY
          Someone must have got a shot off.
          He wasn't exactly a moving target.

Styles turns to Osborne.

                      STYLES
          What do you think?

                      OSBORNE
          It's too neat.

                      HARDY
          "Too neat." How long have you been
          an investigator?

                      OSBORNE
          I don't think that has anything to
          do with-

                      HARDY
          That means under a year. Let me
          explain what ten years of police
          work has taught me - murder is basic.
          There are no conspiracies, no grand
          mysteries, and no evil puppet masters
          behind it all, pulling the strings;
          murder is shitty people doing a shitty
          thing to other shitty people - it
          doesn't always make sense but it's
          always neat. Dunbar's our guy.

Osborne struggles to put it into words.

                      OSBORNE
          I just... He came back for Kendall.
          I don't think he's capable of murder.

                      HARDY
          Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.

Osborne turns, making her case to Styles.

                                                 45.
                      OSBORNE
          Look, all we've got is what Kendall
          says, and he didn't actually witness
          any deaths except Nunez. He found
          West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but
          just their bodies - he didn't see
          any crime committed.
                      HARDY
          Well, I'm sure if he'd known this
          was all going to happen he'd have
          Tried harder to witness it for you-
                      STYLES
          West's body isn't in the creek bed.
They stop arguing, turning to look at him.
                      STYLES
          We've already been over the terrain
          twice. Nothing.
                      HARDY
          There was a hurricane, Bill, the
          wind probably moved it.
                      STYLES
          Habeas Corpus - you have to have a
          body to have a crime.
                      HARDY
          Okay, then let's widen the search
          'to include the endzone in Giants
          Stadium and the trunk of my car-
                      STYLES
          Without the body we have no physical
          proof. We need a confession.
                      HARDY
          From Dunbar? I hate to break this
          to you, but I don't think he's gonna
          be all that psyched to put himself
          in for the death penalty.
                      STYLES
          Nevertheless-
                      HARDY
          Nevertheless what'? Kendall will
          testify and that'll be enough.
                        STYLES
          Not for me.
A beat. Almost accusingly:

                                                   46.
                      HARDY
          You mean not enough to save you.
                      STYLES
          JAG gets here in three hours.   Try
          for the confession.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- DAY
Dunbar looks up as Hardy and Osborne enter.
                      HARDY
              (cheerfully)
          Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with
          your buddy. Kendall - seems you
          killed three people!
                      DUNBAR
          That son of a bitch.
                      HARDY
          That'd be my reaction too-
                         DUNBAR
          He's lying.
                      HARDY
          Well, why didn't you say so? We'll
          Just drop all your charges, then-
                         DUNBAR
          I'm serious-
Hardy leans across the table.
                      HARDY
          Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you
          got exactly zero truck with us; right
          now we'd take the word of a crackhead
          over yours, so if you've got something
          to say, say it.
                      DUNBAR
          Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
                      OSBORNE
          He said he worked there-
                      DUNBAR
          No, did he tell you about it?   About
          the business Childs ran?
                      OSBORNE
          What business?

                                                        47.
                      DUNBAR
          Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a
          lot easier when you don't feel pain-
                      HARDY
          So Childs made some side money, so
          what? People are dead, Ray, and the
          only one we have to blame is you-
                      DUNBAR
          Didn't shoot West-
                      HARDY
          Yeah, we know, Pike did.
Dunbar stares at him.
                      DUNBAR
          You think you know everything, don't
          you? You haven't even scratched the
          surface.
Hardy leans across the table, looks Dunbar dead in the eye.
                      HARDY
          I know enough to know you got two
          choices - you can sign a confession,
          in which case you'll probably spend
          the rest of your life in a military
          prison, or you can tell us to fuck
          off, in which case you'll probably
          get the gas chamber.
              (smiling)
          Am I scratching your surface yet?
Dunbar stares at him for a moment and then LAUNCHES HIMSELF
at Hardy, SCREAMING. Tackles him to the floor, CHOKING HIM...
Osborne, pulling her sidearm, and PISTOL WHIPPING Dunbar in
the head! Dunbar goes sprawling off Hardy as M.P.'s rush
into the room, RESTRAINING him.
Hardy gets up, gasping, and stumbles to the door.
                         OSBORNE
          Hardy!
But he's already gone.
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- DAY
Hardy, walking angrily towards the front entrance, wheezing
and massaging his neck. Osborne, runninq to catch up.
                      HARDY
          Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?

                                                          48.
                      OSBORNE
          I don't know.

Styles appears at the end of the hall.

                      STYLES
          Tom, where are you going-

                      HARDY
          Home, I'm done.

                      STYLES
          What about the confession?

Hardy stares at him. ..

                      HARDY
          You want a confession? Why don't
          you confess, Bill: people are dead
          and you don't give a shit about it!
          Only reason you called me is to
          protect your fucking job, you know
          this is your fault-

                      STYLES
          What the hell are you talking about-

                      HARDY
          I'm talking about West! We had him,
          Bill, we were there. You're the
          fucking Base Commander, you knew
          what he did to Cadets and you let
          him go on the way he always he has-
          Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a
          legend-

                      HARDY
          You knew what he was capable of and
          you just stood by. It was just a
          matter of time till somebody fragged
          his ass, and you know what? He
          deserved it. There's your confession.

He pushes past a shocked Styles and walks out the door.

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- DAY

Hardy storms across the grass.   Osborne, still following.

                      OSBORNE
          Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just
          leave-

                      HARDY
          Watch me.

                                                   49.
                       OSBORNE
           You said you owed Styles and now
           you're gonna turn your back on him?
Hardy whirls on her.
                       HARDY
           West was a monster! Fifteen years
           ago, I was here, I was Section Eight,
           I was Pike. Fuck being the knife
           dummy- that thing he did, stripping
           Pike down, making him stand outside
           all night? He did that every year,
           he did that to me. Fifteen years
           ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm
           supposed to care that somebody offed
           him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
                       OSBORNE
           You did more than try. You cracked
           Dunbar in less than three minutes,
           as an investigator you're phenomenal-
                       HARDY
           Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
A beat.   Osborne shakes her head.
                       OSBORNE
           I was starting to believe you, you
           know? That you weren't who everyone
           Said. I guess I was wrong-
                       HARDY
           Oh, spare me the reverse psychology
           bullshit! This isn't my "great second
           chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks
           I'm a piece of shit cop who took
           money and nothing is going to change
           that. Nobody will ever know what
           happens here-
                       OSBORNE
           But you will.
Hardy stares at her.
                       HARDY
           Why do you care?
                       OSBORNE
           Because it's my job. Because people
           are dead. Because of the whole honor
           and duty thing, make a difference in
           the world, crap like that.
               (pause)
           We can do this, Hardy.

                                                      50.
Hardy looks at the ground.
                      OSBORNE
          Two and a half hours. That's all
          I'm asking. Two and a half hours to
          maybe get the truth. Silence.
Hardy looks back up at her.     Speaking softly:
                      HARDY
          I didn't shoot West...
                       OSBORNE
          What?
                      HARDY
          Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot
          West. West wasn't shot, Kendall
          said he was blown apart by a
          phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never
          saw the body.
They stare at each other for a moment...
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- DAY
Hardy and Osborne enter to find Dunbar in SHACKLES.
                       DUNBAR
          Apologize-
                      HARDY
          You saw West's body.
                       DUNBAR
          Of course-
                       OSBORNE
          Where?
                      DUNBAR
          The creek bed-
                      HARDY
          And he'd been shot.
                       DUNBAR
          Yeah-
                      OSBORNE
          What about the phosphorous grenade?
                      DUNBAR
          One went off, yeah, but it didn't
          Touch him- I thought you knew this-

                                                         51.
                      HARDY
          Tell it to me.
INT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT
Dunbar and Nunez RUNNING towards the glow of phosphorous and
sound of GUNFIRE. They come over the hill to see Childs and
Kendall, standing over WEST'S BODY. Dunbar stops, shocked.
                      DUNBAR
          Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the
          fuck did you guys do?
                      CHILDS
          We found him like this...
Dunbar edges closer, looking at West.   With BULLET HOLES.
His chest, riddled.
                      KENDALL
          Somebody emptied a full clip into
          him-
                      HARDY (V.O.}
          Stop.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                      HARDY
          Kendall told us Mueller was the one
          who found them with West's body.
                      DUNBAR
          He's lying, then. We didn't see
          Mueller till we got to the cabin.
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
Dunbar, Kendall, Childs, and Nunez push through the door to
find Mueller in his undershirt, a FIRE burning in the hearth.
                      MUELLER
          Jesus, what happened?
                      DUNBAR
              (breathing hard)
          West...he's dead.
                      OSBORNE (V.O.}
          Back up.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                      OSBORNE
          Mueller was alone in the cabin?

                                                        52.
                       DUNBAR
          Yeah.

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

                      MUE:LLER
          Pike and I got separated... then I
          heard gunfire. Close.

                       DUNBAR
          So did we.   Why didn't you come?

Mueller looks down, scared.

                      MUELLER
          I was afraid... Mueller voice FADES
          OUT as he continues to talk.

                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          I didn't buy it. But Mueller had
          all three of his grenades.

Mueller shows his three grenades to the others.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

                      OSBORNE
          At least you and Kendall agree on
          that.

                      HARDY
          What happened next?     Dunbar shudders.

                      DUNBAR
          Pike came back.

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

Pike, staggering in through the door. The others get up
from where they are sitting - it's been awhile since they
arrived. Pike shouts at Mueller:

                      PIKE
          What the fuck happened to you-

                      MUELLER
          What the fuck happened to you? One
          minute you're next to me and the
          next you're gone and the sky lights
          up like fucking Christmas-

                      DUNBAR
          Where have you been, Jay?

                                                            53.
                       PIKE
           Wandering through a hurricane trying
           to find this place. It's gettin'
           bad out there-
               (looking around)
           Where's West?
                       CHILDS
           Yeah, right. . .
                        DUNBAR
           Shut up.
               (to Pike)
           West's dead.
A beat.
                       PIKE
           What?
Silence.   All of them staring at Pike.
                       DUNBAR
           Where have you been, Jay?
Pike, suddenly understanding.      Fear creeping into his face.
                       PIKE
           Oh, no. . . no, fuck that-
He moves to the door, but. . .
                       NUNEZ
           Hey!
Nunez, with his PISTOL out.      Trained on Pike.
                       PIKE
           Roberto, what the fuck?
                       DUNBAR
           We just want to check your pack-
                       PIKE
           Why?
                       MUELLER
           Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade
           first-
                       PIKE
           Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone
           turns up dead, you just look for the
           Darkest face in the crowd-
                       DUNBAR
           You know it's not like that-

                                                         54.
                          PIKE
            Do I?
The CLICK as Nunez pulls back the pistol's hammer.
                        NUNEZ
            Let him check your pack.
Pike stares at them and then throws his pack down, angrily.
Dunbar goes to it, opens it, and reaches in. Pulls his hand
out. Only TWO GRENADES. Looks at Pike. Sadly.
                          DUNBAR
            Tie him up.
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
Later. The fury of the storm has increased. Kendall, Childs,
Nunez, and Mueller, in the KITCHEN looking for food.
IN THE LIVING ROOM
Pike, tied to the chair. Dunbar sitting in a corner,
listening to the hurricane rage outside. Pike watches him.
                        PIKE
            Just like the first day, huh?    You
            standing guard on me.
A CREAKING as the cabin SHIFTS on it's foundation.   Dunbar
looks up at the roof, scared. It holds.
                        PIKE
            This place ain't gonna hold much
            longer.
Dunbar doesn't reply. Still staring nervously at the roof.
Pike looks to make sure the others out of earshot, then:
                        PIKE
            You and me are friends, right?
No reply.
                          PIKE
            Right?
                          DUNBAR
            Yeah...
Pike takes a deep breath.
                        PIKE
            You gotta untie me.
                (off Dunbar's look)
            I didn't do this thing, Ray.

                                                    55.
                      DUNBAR
          You hated West more than any of us.
                      PIKE
          Maybe, but that don't make me a killer-
                      DUNBAR
          You're the only one missing a grenade.
                      PIKE
          Which anyone coulda taken out of my
          gear on the chopper. Were you
          watching your pack on the ride in?
Dunbar starts to get up.
                      PIKE
          Ray, this is my life    here. I ain't
          gonna pretend I'm not    happy West is
          gone, but you know I    couldn't have
          done this. It's not     in me.
                      DUNBAR
          If not you, then who?
                         PIKE
          Mueller.
                         DUNBAR
          Oh, come on-
                      PIKE
          We're sweeping our area and suddenly
          he's gone. Couple minutes later,
          phosphorous grenade pops off about a
          third of a click away-
                      DUNBAR
          That's exactly what he says about
          you.
                       PIKE
          Who you gonna trust, Ray?    Him or
          your friend?
Dunbar stares at him.
                      DUNBAR
          You hated West, Mueller loved him-
                      PIKE
          Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX
          Scam, Mueller was in on it-
                         DUNBAR
          Bullshit.

                                                          56.
                      PIKE
          Look in my pack.
                       DUNBAR
          Why?
                       PIKE
          Just look.   Little pocket.
Dunbar walks over to Pike's pack and unzips it.    Checks the
little pocket. Pulls out a VIAL and a SYRINGE.
                      PIKE
          Combat grade morphine.    Mueller sold
          it to me. .
                      DUNBAR
          You're lying-
                      PIKE
          Pull up my sleeve.    Right arm.
Dunbar does to reveal a cluster of TRACK MARKS.
                      PIKE
          That look like a lie to you? I been
          using solid for the last eight weeks.
Dunbar sits down.   Not knowing what to say.
                      PIKE
          After that first night on the parade
          Grounds with you, I was bad -
          Exposure, malnutrition, the works.
          I needed something to keep me from
          crashing. Mueller found me.
INT. CADET SHOWERS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO
Empty except for Pike. He sits, nude, curled up on the tile,
as the nozzles blast STEAMING WATER down onto his shivering
form. FOOTSTEPS approaching. Mueller. He leans down next
to Pike, speaking to him. Kindly.
                      PIKE (V.O.)
          He said he knew guy who had an in at
          the PX, could hook me up. This is
          before I knew what a dick he was.
As Mueller produces a SYRINGE from his pocket...
INT. BASE PX -- BACKROOM -- SIX WEEKS AGO
A covert meeting among stacks of supplies. Childs stands
with Mueller, talking to a gaunt Pike. Behind Pike are a
group of other SICKLY LOOKING CADETS, all jonesing.

                                                        57.
                       PIKE
           Later on Childs got assigned there,
           started running the shit out to every
           cadet who needed it. But I was our
           class's first customer.. .
Pike hands the smiling Mueller a WAD OF CASH...
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
Dunbar staring open mouthed at Pike.    Shocked.
                       DUNBAR
           Why... why didn't you tell me?
                        PIKE
           Becoming a morphine addict during
           Basic ain't exactly something you
           want to broadcast. Only Mueller and
           Childs know.
A beat.   Dunbar gets to his feet.
                       DUNBAR
           That still doesn't mean you didn't
           kill him.
                       PIKE
           You saw West, right?   How was he
           killed?
                       DUNBAR
           Full clip to the body-
                       PIKE
           From up close or far away?
                       DUNBAR
           His chest was hamburger-
                       PIKE
           That's close range. You go full
           auto on a guy from close range, you're
           gonna be swimming in blood. Look at
           my uniform. Nothing.
Dunbar looks.   Not a speck of blood on it.
                       PIKE
           And where's Mueller's? When I came
           in, he was only wearing a t-shirt.
Dunbar looks over to fireplace, where ashes are smoldering...
FLASHCUT TO - When Dunbar first entered the Cabin: Mueller,
standing there in a T-SHIRT, a FIRE burning in the hearth.

                                                           58.
                      PIKE
          Way I figure it, West must have found
          out about their little business and
          was gonna bust them, so they decided
          to get rid of him first...
                         DUNBAR
              (softly)
          They?
                      PIKE
          Mueller and Childs. One of them
          must've taken the grenade from my
          pack on the chopper...
INT. TRANSPORT HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
The Sectioners sit, stonefaced, staring out the window.
CLOSE ON - Mueller's hand as it snakes into Pike's pack and
extracts a phosphorous grenade.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
Mueller and Pike, twenty feet apart, scouring the brush for
targets. Mueller looks to Pike and then slips away...
                      PIKE (V.O.)
          Then Mueller ditches me during the
          exercise and heads for the creek.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED,-- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
Mueller stands on the hill and pulls the grenades pin, tossing
it down the embankment. ..
                      PIKE (V.O.)
          He blows the grenade to frame me and
          gets West to come running... .
The grenade BLOWS, setting the entire area AGLOW...
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
Kendall and Childs, turning towards the sound...
Note: Each shot of Kendall and Childs in this sequence should
correspond exactly to Kendall's Flashback.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- NIGHT
West emerges from the bush at a sprint.
                      WEST
          What the fuck is going on?!
Mueller runs down the embankment toward him.

                                                          59.
                      MUELLER
          Don't know, sir, I-
Six feet away from West, Mueller suddenly raises his rifle
and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
Kendall and Childs, running in the direction of the grenade...
                       PIKE
          Childs' job is easy, he only has to
          delay Kendall long enough for Mueller
          to get away.
Suddenly MACHINE GUNFIRE shatters the night!
                      CHILDS
          GET DOWN!
He tackles Kendall into the mud.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
Mueller, smoking rifle in hand, uniform covered in blood
stands over WEST'S DEAD BODY. He turns and runs off INTO
THE BRUSH. A moment later, Childs and Kendall come into
view at the top of the embankment...
                      PIKE (V.O.)
          Now all Mueller has to do is get rid
          of the evidence...
INT. CABIN -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
Mueller, still covered in blood, enters the dark cabin. He
strips of his shirt and throws it in the fireplace. Striking
a match, igniting the bloody rag... .
                      PIKE (V.O.)
          And wait for everyone else to arrive.
Mueller, watching the evidence burn...
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
Pike sighs, finished with his story.
                      DUNBAR
          I... I don't know...
                      PIKE
          What don't you know?
                      DUNBAR
          This is a lot of information to be
          Getting... I have to think-

                                                          60.
The hurricane outside GROWING LOUDER as the Cabin ROCKS again.
The sound of WOOD SNAPPING. Pike stares up at the roof.
                      PIKE
          There's no time to think, Ray, we
          gotta get out of here! You untie
          me, we grab the guns, get Kendall
          and Nunez, and make a run for it-
                      DUNBAR
          No... no, we can just wait till we
          get back and then tell the M.P.'s-
                      PIKE
          We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a
          black face, a criminal record, and
          over a hundred other cadets who'll
          testify how much I hated West - my
          court martial will take six minutes.
          It's either me or them, Ray, and you
          gotta decide right now.
The cabin SHIFTS again.     Dunbar stares at him.
                       PIKE
          Untie me.
Dunbar doesn't move.
                      PIKE
          Untie me, Ray.
A long beat.   The two men stare at each other.
And then Dunbar pulls his knife from his boot and leans down
to cut Pike's bonds.
                      PIKE
          Thank God. . .
                      MUELLER (O.S.)
          What the fuck are you doing?
Dunbar freezes.   Caught.
He looks to the open kitchen door where Mueller stands.
                      MUELLER
          Guys, get out here!
The others enter the room. Dunbar, kneeling there, knife
inches away from severing Pike's ropes.
                      PIKE
          This place is going, Mueller.     We
          gotta move-

                                                        61.
                      MUELLER
          Shut the fuck up.
              (to the others)
          He was gonna cut him loose.
The others stare at Dunbar.
                        NUNEZ
          Why?
                      PIKE
          Cause I didn't do it.
Childs motions to Dunbar.
                      CHILDS
          Get away from there.
He's serious.    Dunbar moves away from Pike.
                      MUELLER
          We all know what you did, Pike. I
          don't know what kind of nigger voodoo
          You been working in here, but-
                      PIKE
          Where's your shirt, Mueller?
                      MUELLER
          Used it to start the fire-
                      PIKE
          Still got mine on, not a speck of
          blood on it. Not a bad trick for a
          murderer- you said you burned yours?
The others begin to look at Mueller with new eyes.
                      MUELLER
          Was freezing from the hurricane-
                      KENDALL
          So you took off your shirt?
                      MUELLER
          To start a fire, goddammit!
              (pointing to Pike)
          What about him, huh? Maybe he offed
          the Sarge and changed shirts, brought
          an extra one in his pack. Y'ever
          think of that? Go ahead, cut him
          loose! First chance he gets, he'll
          waste the rest of us, that's how
          they work-
The hurricane, reaching FEVER PITCH outside as WATER begins
leaking in through the roof.

                                                   62.
                      PIKE
          Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of
          Here-
                      MUELLER
          We're not going anywhere.
PIKE TURNS TO MUELLER:
                      PIKE
          Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place
          you under military arrest for the
          Murder of Sergeant Nathan West-
                      MUELLER
          The fuck are you talking about-
                      PIKE
          You are to be stripped of all weapons
          And placed under guard-
                         MUELLER
          Bullshit-
                      PIKE
          Until we return to base, and
          ballistics can match your weapon to
          the slugs in Sergeant West's body-
                         MUELLER
          Shut up!
Mueller pulls his SIDEARM and POINTS IT AT PIKE.
                      KENDALL
          Mueller, what the fuck-
                      DUNBAR
          Don't do this-
Pike, EYES LOCKED with Mueller.    Continuing:
                      PIKE
          A test will no doubt link you to the
          Killing-
                         DUNBAR
          Put it down!
                      MUELLER
          Tell him to shut up-
                      PIKE
          -failure to comply with this arrest
          is a court martialable offense in
          and of itself-

                                                             63.
                      KENDALL
          Pike, please-
                      PIKE
          Although that won't matter much when
          Coupled with the murder charge-
                      MUELLER
          SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU FUCKING NIGGER-
Pike leans forward.
                      PIKE
          You stupid white trash motherfucker,
          I saw you do it-
And Mueller FIRES.
Pike's head SNAPS BACK.
The gunshot, DEAFENING.    Then, for an eternity, SILENCE.
Nobody moves.   Nobody breathes.   As if time has stopped.
                      KENDALL
          Oh.. . my God...
Mueller lowers his arm, the pistol clattering to the floor.
His face, as shocked as the others.
                      MUELLER
          He wouldn't... stop talking...
He takes a step forward towards Pike.    A hole in the middle
of the black man's forehead.
                       DUNBAR
              (softly)
          So you killed him?
                        MUELLER
          I. . .
Almost mechanically, Dunbar begins to reach for his own gun...
The unmistakable sound of a two rifles' magazines being RACKED
simultaneously. Dunbar turns to see Childs and Nunez, their
M-16's in hand. Levelled at him.
                      CHILDS
          Get that hand away.
Dunbar does.    Looks to Nunez.
                        DUNBAR
          You too?

                                                           64.
                      CHILDS
          We can still come out of this okay.
          Pike got free, he got a gun, he came
          after us. That's the story.
Mueller collapses on the ground.   Head in hands.
                      MUELLER
          West was one thing, but this-
                      CHILDS
          Shut up, Mueller.
                      KENDALL
          You framed-him...
                      CHILDS
          None of that matters now. We got
          two dead bodies and a story that
          explains them. You're either with
          us, or against us - which is it?
Dunbar and Kendall, looking at each other. It's clear what
the wrong answer will mean. A long beat, until
                      KENDALL
          Okay-
He is cut off as the WIND outside ROARS - the HURRICANE
mounting to it's FULL FORCE - and the WINDOWS BLOW INWARDS,
showering Childs, Mueller, and Nunez with glass!
Dunbar's hand flies to his pistol, PULLING IT...
Mueller, SCREAMING, trying to claw the glass from his EYES...
Childs, seeing Dunbar move, PULLS THE TRIGGER. .. .
And the cabin is filled with the THUNDER OF GUNFIRE as Kendall
goes down, clutching his ARM...
DUNBAR FIRES, hitting Childs directly in the chest...
Childs, still shooting, falls back, his random spray of
bullets PUNCHING INTO MUELLER who jerks like a marionette...
Nunez, drawing a bead on Dunbar, about to shoot, when...
A great CRESCENDO of WOOD SPLINTERING and SUPPORTS BUCKLING
overtakes them and the CABIN'S ROOF COMES DOWN ON THEIR HEADS.
EXT. DEMOLISHED CABIN -- FIRST LIGHT
Hours later. The rain has lessened and the Hurricane has
begun to lift as Dunbar pulls himself from the debris.
Hearing a FAINT CRY from his left.

                                                        65.
Kendall.   Half conscious, his arm, bloody.
Dunbar slings the man across his shoulders as the rising sun
begins to peak through the clouds overhead.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- SUNRISE
Dunbar, carrying Kendall towards the clearing when GUNFIRE
comes from behind. He turns to look...
Nunez. The only other survivor from the Cabin. A hundred
yards back, rifle in hand, coming after them with a vengeance.
Dunbar, sprinting towards the clearing, bullets at his heels
and as he bursts from the tree line he looks up to see a
HELICOPTER OVERHEAD
                       DUNBAR (V.O.)
           And then I killed the last of them.
FLASHCUT TO - Nunez, chest blown open, going down...
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
And we're back to the interrogation. Dunbar, stubbing out a
cigarette and looking up at Hardy and Osborne.
                       DUNBAR
           Can I have some coffee?
Osborne blinks, like a trance has been broken.
                       OSBORNE
           Yeah... yeah, sure.
She goes over to the machine and pours a cup.
                       HARDY
           You shot Childs and Nunez.
                       DUNBAR
           They would have killed us both. You
           want me to write a confession, I'll
           write a confession.
                       HARDY
           You saved Kendall's life-
                       DUNBAR
           But not Pike's.
Osborne hands him the coffee.
                       OSBORNE
           Why didn't you tell us all this in
           the first place?

                                                         66.
                      DUNBAR
          Would you have believed me?
Their faces say "no".   Osborne spreads a MAP out on the table.
                      OSBORNE
          Where's the cabin?
                      DUNBAR
          Don't know on a map. West told us
          it was there, we just found it.
          Maybe the hurricane took it away.
                      HARDY
          Raymond, for you to have any chance
          of coming out of this, we need to
          locate the other bodies and examine
          them to corroborate your testimony.
          Otherwise this is just another story-
                      DUNBAR
          Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for
          college money. I didn't ask for any
          of this - I tried to do the right
          thing out there and people got killed.
          You say finding those bodies'll help
          me, then go find them. I don't want
          to die.
EXT. FOR MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- DAY
Hardy and Osborne, walking and talking.
                      OSBORNE
          Talk it through: Childs, Mueller,
          and Nunez know they're going out on
          the regular Tuesday Night drill,
          hurricane or ho hurricane, so they
          plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
                      HARDY
          And they're smart about it. They
          know when you commit a crime you
          know is going to be investigated,
          you need a fall guy and for that to
          work, you have to have a witness.
                        OSBORNE
          Dunbar.
                      HARDY
          Exactly, someone who's not involved,
          who's word can't be questioned. You
          only let them see what you want them
          to see, you make them believe, so
          when the time comes, they've totally
          bought into your version of events.

                                                        67.
                      OSBORNE
          They believe the innocent are guilty
          and the guilty are innocent.
                      HARDY
          And if they're asked, that's what
          they'll tell the, world.
                       OSBORNE
          So it's a good plan but it goes wrong;
          Mueller flips out and shoots their
          fall guy, which means they have to
          bring Dunbar and Kendall into the
          Cover story-
                      HARDY
          Kendall maybe would have agreed, but
          The hurricane buttfucks the cabin-
                      OSBORNE
          Buttfucks the cabin?
                      HARDY
          And all hell breaks loose. A lot of
          Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys
          and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
                      OSBORNE
          So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall
          out from under a house, does the
          Senator's son try and get us to put
          his savior in the gas chamber?
                      HARDY
          That bugs you too?
                        OSBORNE
          Little bit.
                      HARDY
          Let's go talk to Bill...
INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- DAY
Hardy and Osborne stand in front of an agitated Styles. He
tries to take a hit off his asthma inhaler and gets nothing.
Frustrated, he tosses it away.
                      STYLES
          Fucking asthma... This whole thing's
          driving it nuts.
A beat.
                      HARDY
          What I said before-

                                                             68.
                      STYLES
          Was dead right. You think Dunbar's
          on the level?
                        HARDY
          Yeah.
                      STYLES
          Does Osborne agree?
                      OSBORNE
          Yes, sir, I do.
Hardy lays a piece of paper on Styles' desk.
                      HARDY
          Dunbar's confession. It should be
          enough to get you out of trouble.
Styles looks at it and then slowly up to Hardy.
                      STYLES
          You want Kendall, don't you?
                      OSBORNE
          He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You
          don't do that if you're not involved.
Hardy nods, agreeing.   Styles stares at them.
                      STYLES
          You both know if you do this, if you
          go after a Senator's son and you're
          wrong... it's not just me in the hot
          seat anymore.
                        OSBORNE
          We know.
                      STYLES
              (to Hardy)
          I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
                        HARDY
          We know.
Styles nods and looks to his desk.      Almost to himself:
                      STYLES
          You don't get to be a Colonel without
          compromising. Without getting out
          of the way of the bigger dogs. You
          politic, play it safe, think of the
          career first. And when things get
          dirty, you just look the other way...
He looks back up at Hardy.      His eyes, steeled.

                                                          69.
                      STYLES
          Four of my men are dead. You think
          Kendall had something to do with it,
          then you go get the son of a bitch.

INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

Kendall lies in his bed, looking worse than before.   Hardy
and Osborne enter.

                      OSBORNE
          Pike never confessed.

                      KENDALL
          We've been making progress, I see.

Osborne looks to her watch.   Kendall notices.

                      KENDALL
          Running out of time, are we? Tick-
          Tock, tick-tock, how long till your
          witnesses fly the coop?

                      OSBORNE
          Fifty minutes.

                      KENDALL
          Not much time to solve the crime.
          Tell me, detective, how did it feel
          taking blood money from Guissepe
          Torres? Did it weigh on your
          conscience or did you just not think
          about it?

                      HARDY
          You tried to pin three stone murders
          on Dunbar-

                      KENDALL
          How many murders did you cover up?
          One? Five? Maybe an even ten.

                      HARDY
              (to Osborne)
          Can I go to jail for punching a guy
          who's been shot?

Kendall begins coughing.

                      KENDALL
          I think they're giving me the wrong
          medicine. This isn't a very good
          Hospital, you know-

Hardy sighs and goes to the sink to get him some water.

                                                        70.
                      KENDALL
          Epileptic attacks are murder on your
          system. Rattle your internal organs
          like a paint mixer.
                      HARDY
          My heart weeps.
He returns with a GLASS OF WATER and hands it to Kendall.
                      OSBORNE
          Pike never confessed.
                      KENDALL
          No, but it got you interested, didn't
          it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray
          to tell you terribly sordid tales
          about drugs and creek beds and dead
          little sergeants who stuck their
          noses where they didn't belong.
                      HARDY
          Is it the truth?
                      KENDALL
          There's that word again.
              (smiling)
          As I told you, I wasn't in the room
          when everyone started shooting.
                      OSBORNE
          Dunbar says you were.
                      KENDALL
          Then he's mistaken. You know, I
          really don't think my father would
          approve of this line of questioning-
                      HARDY
          Why did you tell us he shot everybody,
          Levi? You put him in for three
          murders, the man saved your life-
                      KENDALL
          So I should stay silent about his
          misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran
          in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller
          were dead, and Dunbar was running
          out the door with the smoking gun-
                      HARDY
          Dunbar was running out the door?
          Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was
          confused, because I thought you said
          Nunez was running out the door.

                                                           71.
                       KENDALL
          No.   I said Dunbar.
                      HARDY
          Huh. You know, I really thought you
          said Nunez. I thought you said
          "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta
          check the tape on that.
              (off Kendall's look)
          Oh, yeah we taped the last interview.
          This one too. Cause it'd be a real
          break for us to catch you in a lie.
Silence. They wait for Kendall's reaction. He looks
momentarily flustered by this... and then he smiles.
                      KENDALL
          I believe your next line is "What
          are you trying to hide?"
                       HARDY
          Well?
                      KENDALL
          Sorry to disappoint. I'm on
          painkillers for the injury - they
          cloud the mind. You're right, it
          was Nunez. Any more questions?
Hardy doesn't know what to say.   That was his ace card.
                      KENDALL
          Don't get me wrong, Mueller and Childs
          were quite the pair, the type of
          guys you didn't feel comfortable
          going to sleep around. Completely
          capable of murder. But as I said, I
          didn't hear the exchange before the
          shooting. I wasn't in the room.
Osborne furrows her brow at this as Hardy continues.
                      HARDY
          Dunbar will testify that you were.
                      KENDALL
          Then we'll leave it up to the courts -
          His word against mine. What does
          his father do again? Steelworker?
              (smiling)
          Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice
          will be served. In any case, my
          father will definitely want to talk
          to you about all these questions,
          these accusations on his son. He's
          quite protective.

                                                             72.
Osborne turns to Hardy.
                         OSBORNE
             I need to talk to you outside.
EXT. BASE HOSPITAL -- CORRIDOR -- DAY
Osborne and Hardy, exiting the room.      Whispering:
                         HARDY
             We're fucked, I know-
                         OSBORNE
             They got their stories straight.
                           HARDY
             What?
                         OSBORNE
             What Kendall said - "the type of
             guys you don't feel comfortable going
             to sleep around." That's what Dunbar
             said about Childs to the letter.
                         HARDY
             Are you sure?
                           OSBORNE
             Positive.    Hardy, they planned this.
She grins.    He grins back.
                         OSBORNE
             Not bad for hostile and uncooperative,
             eh?
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
Hardy and Osborne reenter, smiling.      Kendall chuckles.
                         HARDY
             Something funny, Levi?
                         KENDALL
             I was just thinking of what's going
             to happen to your careers when my
             father gets through with you.
Hardy pulls the out MICRORECORDER and hands it to Osborne.
                         HARDY
             Why don't you talk to Levi off the
             record for a second?
                           OSBORNE
             Good idea.

                                                         73.
Smiling, she stops the tape.    Then turns to Kendall.

                      OSBORNE
          You and Dunbar got your stories
          straight. Little details, little
          inconsistencies, designed to bounce
          us back from one of you to the other,
          asking questions, killing time, until
          the transport arrives and whisks you
          away to where Senator Daddy can
          protect you. You think you're just
          going to slide out of this? You're
          an accessory to murder, Levi, you're
          Going to jail-

                      KENDALL
          You can't threaten me-

                       HARDY
          Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber
          if he's not-

                      KENDALL
          Didn't do anything-

Osborne laughs.

                       OSBORNE
          It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going
          to find those bodies and when we do,
          I'm going to make sure one of them
          has a bullet in them that matches
          your weapon-

                      KENDALL
          What?

                      HARDY
          That's a fantastic idea-

                      OSBORNE
          See, I just take your gun to the
          morgue and fire it into one of their
          skulls; then I call every newspaper
          in the country with the story about
          how Senator Kendall's gay son went
          nuts on a training mission-

                      KENDALL
              (beginning to panic)
          It won't work-

                      OSBORNE
          It will and you know why?
              (MORE)

                                                        74.
                       OSBORNE
           Because you're not a person anymore,
           you're a cadet in the United States
           Army; you have no identity, no Miranda
           warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna
           throw you to the wolves, and unlike
           you I'm gonna get away with it,
           because you're pissing me off!
She finishes, breathing hard. Kendall, totally cowed. Hardy,
trying to suppress a smile. Osborne rises for the door.
                       OSBORNE
           Enjoy your flight to Washington-
                        KENDALL
           Wait-
                        OSBORNE
           What.
Silence.   Kendall takes a deep breath.
                       KENDALL
           Dunbar's telling the truth.
                       OSBORNE
           Wrong answer-
                       KENDALL
           We did get our stories straight, but
           not because we killed anyone.
               (pause)
           It was because I threatened him.
                        HARDY
           Why?
                       KENDALL
           Because of what I saw.
               (pause)
           Who really killed West.
Osborne holds up the microrecorder and starts the tape again.
                       OSBORNE
           Who killed Sergeant West?
Kendall stares at the recorder.   A long pause.
                        OSBORNE
           Who, Levi-
                        KENDALL
           Childs.

                                                           75.
                      HARDY
          How do you know?
                      KENDALL
          Because I was standing next to him.
He pauses, taking a shaky sip of water.
                      KENDALL
          I was in on the PX thing. He and
          Mueller and me, we were making
          thousands. West found out. Childs
          said we were just gonna scare him -
          Use my Dad's clout. I had this whole
          speech prepared about how if he ratted
          us, his career was over. We met him
          in the creek bed but before I said
          anything...
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT
West stands in front of Childs and Kendall, facing them.
Kendall opens his mouth to speak, but Childs steps forward
and raises his rifle, FIRING...
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                      KENDALL
          I swear, I didn't know he was gonna
          do it. After, he told me we were
          gonna pin it on Pike, one of our
          biggest customers.
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
As they TIE PIKE to the, chair.
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          Nobody'd believe the word of a black
          junkie ex-con against ours.
Childs gives Kendall a look that says "Stay quiet".
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          He told me I'd better keep quiet, or
          I'd end up the same as West.
Pan over to Dunbar, who binds his friend, sadly.
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          Dunbar didn't know anything about
          any of it. Everything he told you
          was true, except after...

                                                       76.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
Dunbar pulls Kendall from the cabin's wreckage. As Kendall
begins to talk to him, Dunbar's eyes widen in shock. ..
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          I told him what had really happened
          to West. Told him to keep quiet
          about it or I'd destroy him. Because
          if it came out that I was involved
          with the whole PX scam, my father
          would be finished.
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                      KENDALL
          I scared Dunbar into silence.  He's
          been trying to cover for me the whole
          time. We got here, you came to  see
          me... I didn't know if I could trust
          him with that kind of secret-
                      OSBORNE
          So you framed him. The same way
          Childs was going to frame Pike.
Kendall nods.   Crying a little.
                      HARDY
          Little advice, Levi, next time you
          frame a guy, pick someone who can't
          defend themselves.
Kendall says nothing.
                      OSBORNE
          What happened with Nunez?
                      KENDALL
          He came after us. And I told Dunbar
          he had to kill him...
EXT. CLEARING -- EARLIER THAT MORNING
The helicopter, hovering overhead. Dunbar, carrying Kendall,
spinning his rifle to face Nunez, sixty yards away. Dunbar
hesitates before firing, not wanting to...
                        KENDALL
          Do it!
Dunbar's rifle ERUPTS...
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                        KENDALL
          And he did.

                                                          77.
Kendall finishes, wiping his face.    Osborne turns to Hardy.
                      OSBORNE
          That's how you do good cop/bad cop.
Hardy smiles and gets up.   Walking slowly to Kendall's bed.
                      HARDY
          Childs did it, huh?
Kendall nods, still a little teary.
                      HARDY
          First Pike, then Mueller, now Childs?
          When are we getting to the others?
          When are we gonna hear about Nunez?
FLASHCUT TO - NUNEZ, in the creek bed, SHOOTING WEST.
                        HARDY
          Or Dunbar?
FLASHCUT TO - Now DUNBAR, SHOOTING WEST.
                      HARDY
          Or you, Levi? When is it finally
          going to come out that you were the
          one who killed him?
FLASHCUT TO - KENDALL, SHOOTING WEST.
                        KENDALL
          I didn't-
                      HARDY
          But you can't prove it! You can't
          prove anything until we find the
          bodies!
Kendall, crying harder now, beginning to shake.
                      HARDY
          You lied to us, Levi, you're going
          to the gas chamber unless you tell
          us where to find them!
                      KENDALL
          I don't know-
                      HARDY
          Where are they!
                        KENDALL
          Maybe-
                        HARDY
          MAYBE WHAT-

                                                        78.
                      KENDALL
          MAYBE HE-

And then. His mouth SLAMS SHUT. Teeth cracking together
over and over again like a metronome on speed, and his body
JERKS HORRIBLY, going horizontal, SHAKING VIOLENTLY!

Osborne, leaping to her feet.

                      OSBORNE
          Get something between his teeth!

Hardy grabs a fork from the bedside table and tries to shove
it into Kendall's chattering mouth. His teeth, CLAMPING
DOWN on the metal and Hardy's hand, drawing blood.

                      HARDY
          Shit!

The Nurse bursts into the room.

                      NURSE
          What is-

                      OSBORNE
          He's an epileptic!

The Nurse runs to the bed, pushing Hardy aside. As more
MEDICAL PERSONNEL runs into the room, they usher Hardy and
Osborne to the door.

                      DOCTOR
          You're going to have to wait outside-

                      OSBORNE
          He's a witness!

                      DOCTOR
          It doesn't matter, outside-

                      KENDALL
          F-F-F-F-F-F-Fuh-

Osborne tries to move to him, but the Doctor blocks her path.

                      OSBORNE
          He's trying to say something-

                      DOCTOR
          Out, NOW.

                      KENDALL
          Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-

Osborne knocks the Doctor down and runs to Kendall's side.

                                                            79.
                        DOCTOR
           SECURITY!
Kendall looks up, focusing on Osborne, a slight moment of
clarity in his eyes.
                       KENDALL
           Fuh-Fucking Pike.
And relapses into ANOTHER FIT as SECURITY GUARDS drag Hardy
and Osborne from the room.
INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- WAITING ROOM -- DAY
Later.   Hardy and Osborne sit in silence, eyes downcast.
Waiting. Hardy pulls his last cigarette from the pack, lights
it, crumples the pack and tosses it into a garbage can.
                       HARDY
           I pushed him too hard.
                       OSBORNE
           You couldn't have known-
                       HARDY
           Yeah, I could've.      Should've.
                       OSBORNE
           You wanted to get the truth.
                       HARDY
           No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate
           him. For what he did to Dunbar.
           For fucking over the little guy.
                       OSBORNE
           You mean the falsely accused?
Hardy looks up at her and nods.
                       OSBORNE
           You wanted to break him.
                        HARDY
           Yeah.
                        OSBORNE
           So did I.
She looks back to the floor. Hardy takes a drag from the
cigarette, and then tosses that away too.
The door opens and Styles walks into the room.    Somber.
                        STYLES
           It's over.   Time of death was 4:42.
                        (MORE)

                                                         80.
                      STYLES (CONT'D)
          JAG's been notified and I called the
          Senator myself. My report will
          reflect that his medical condition
          made this unavoidable... you two had
          no culpability in the matter.
                      HARDY
          That's horseshit and you know it.
                     STYLES
          Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll
          carry it.
He sighs and takes a seat next to them.
                      STYLES
          We found the cabin. Demolished,
          like they said. No bodies. Hurricane
          like that coulda scooped 'em up,
          dropped them down two counties over.
          We'll find them.
Hardy says nothing.
                      STYLES
          You think you could explain all this
          to me?
                      HARDY
          I wouldn't know where to start.
              (pause)
          I guess it was about one man framing
          another. He thought if the other
          guy got blamed, people would over
          look his own wrong doings.
Styles nods, understanding.
                      OSBORNE
          What happens to Dunbar now?
                      STYLES
          Gets on his plane in ten minutes,
          which means you two are done.
          You'll understand if I don't walk
          you out.
Hardy gets up to go and then stops.   Realizing something.
                      HARDY
          They're taking your command, aren't
          they?
                      STYLES
          The Senator...
He points to Kendall's hospital room.

                                                          81.
                      HARDY
          I'm sorry, Bill.
                      STYLES
          Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal
          with the West's of the world.
                      HARDY
          You're a good soldier, Bill.
                      STYLES
          I thought you said that wasn't a
          compliment.
Hardy smiles.
                      HARDY
          This time it is.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EVENING
The sun, beginning to dip in the sky, as Hardy and Osborne
exit the hospital.
                      OSBORNE
          Your car's in the motor pool.     I'll
          walk you over.
They walk in silence, for a bit.
                         OSBORNE
          So what now?
                      HARDY
          Now I go home, get drunk, and try
          and forget this ever happened.
                      OSBORNE
          Think it'll work?
                         HARDY
          Nah.
They pass a GROUP OF CADETS doing drills.    Hardy, watching
them. Almost looking wistful.
                      OSBORNE
          You know, you never told me why you
          left the army.
                      HARDY
          It dawned on me one day that we were
          supposed to be a nation founded on
          the principle of questioning
          authority... and all I did here was
          follow orders. It didn't add up.

                                                        82.
                      HARDY [CONT'D)
          Plus, I got kicked out.
                      OSBORNE
          For what?
                      HARDY
          That's gonna stay my secret.
INT. MOTOR POOL -- EVENING
Hardy and Osborne make their way towards Hardy's car.
                      OSBORNE
          We were close to something with
          Kendall.
                      HARDY
          Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near.
Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.
                       (pause)
          I haven't by any chance grown on
          you, have I?
                      OSBORNE
          No.
                      HARDY
          Good, just making sure.
Osborne turns to the DUTY SERGEANT.
                      OSBORNE
          We're going need a vehicle release.
The Sergeant nods, walking up with a clipboard.
                      SERGEANT
          Sign here and here.
              (recognizing them)
          Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on
          that whole hulabaloo from last night?
                      OSBORNE
          Yeah.
                      SERGEANT
          Terrible tragedy. One of those
          Section Eight boys worked in here.
          Pike. Heard he got out okay.
Hardy signs the clipboard and hands it back.
                      HARDY
          Hate to be the bearer of bad news,
          Sergeant, but he didn't make it.

                                                        83.
The Sergeant scratches his head.
                      SERGEANT
          Funny. I swear I saw them bring him
          and the smaller guy in this morning.
                      OSBORNE
          No, no that was Cadet Dunbar-
                       SERGEANT
          You mean Ray Dunbar?     Well, that
          ain't right.
                      HARDY
          Why not?
                      SERGEANT
          I saw 'em get off the chopper.     White
          guys, right? Two
                      OSBORNE
          So?
                      SERGEANT
          Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
Hardy and Osborne stare at him.    Shocked
A beat.
                      SERGEANT
          Did I say something wrong-
                      HARDY
              (to Osborne)
          What runway's that transport leaving
          from?
                      OSBORNE
          Four-
                      HARDY
          Get in.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EVENING
CADETS SCATTER as Hardy's car ROARS OUT OF THE MOTOR POOL,
PEELING across the grass towards the far side of the base!
Hardy, white knuckling the wheel, doing his best to steer
around anyone who can't get out of the way in time.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY RUNWAY FOUR -- EVENING
A Large TRANSPORT PLANE sits on the runway waiting as three
M.P.'s and a JAG LAWYER lead Dunbar/Pike (who, for purposes
0£ continuity, we will continue to call DUNBAR) out to it.

                                                           84.
The SQUEAL OF TIRES as Hardy's car SLIDES around the corner
of the nearest building and SCREECHES to a halt by the plane.
Hardy and Osborne, leaping out, running towards Dunbar and
the M.P.s.
                      OSBORNE
          We need to talk to him-
                      JAG LAWYER
          Sorry, Officer, we have a schedule
          To keep-
                      OSBORNE
          We need to talk to him now.
Hardy grabs Dunbar by the arm.
                      HARDY
          We're not finished yet-
                      DUNBAR
          You wanna bet?
                      JAG LAWYER
          M.P.'s, escort this man off the base!
                      DUNBAR
              (smiling)
          Sorry, detectives.     Time's up.
As the M.P.'s grab Hardy, dragging him away. Osborne, trying
to stop them. Dunbar, climbing the stairs onto the plane...
Osborne pulls her SIDEARM, levelling it at him as Hardy yells:
                      HARDY
          James Randall Pike, COME ON DOWN!
Dunbar stops at the hatchway. Slowly turning back to them.
Seeing the gun. The M.P.'s release Hardy. Nobody moves.
                      OSBORNE
          Let's go have a talk.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- EVENING
Hardy and Osborne roughly lead Dunbar into the room, the JAG
Lawyer trailing behind, shouting:
                      JAG LAWYER
          This is your entire career here-
                      OSBORNE
          Fuck off.
She slams the door and BARRICADES it.    Turns to Hardy.

                                                           85.
                      OSBORNE
          We got maybe three minutes till they
          break it down.

                      HARDY
          Right back where we started.

                      DUNBAR
          You want to talk about baseball now?

Hardy practically throws Dunbar into a chair.

                      HARDY
          No more games, right, Pike?    It was
          you who West singled out...

FLASHCUT TO - WEST on the parade grounds, now strangling
DUNBAR on the first day...

                      HARDY
          You who got hooked by Mueller's
          morphine...

FLASHCUT TO - Now DUNBAR in the showers as MUELLER hands him
a syringe...

                      HARDY
          You who did it all.

Hardy steps forward and RIPS OPEN Dunbar's right sleeve,
revealing the TRACK MARKS.

                      HARDY
          You wanted revenge on West, revenge
          on them all, so you killed them.

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

Dunbar standing in the Cabin; Mueller, Childs, and Pike,
dead at his feet.

                      HARDY (V.O.)
          But that wasn't enough. You needed
          a new identity, because no one was
          going to believe James Randall Pike,
          convicted felon, had acted so nobly
          in the face of danger - you needed a
          name people could trust, one that
          hadn't been to jail, one that hadn't
          publicly been West's bitch boy.

He stares down at the bodies in the cabin, his eyes focusing
on the black man's uniform. The name on it reads - "DUNBAR".

As he reaches for it...

                                                        86.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING
                      OSBORNE
          You kept Kendall alive to corroborate
          your story and he did it all they
          way up to the end. You even gave
          him his own motive in case we decided
          to burn him, too.
                      DUNBAR
          Can't do that now, though, can you?
                      HARDY
          You walked into the army a convicted
          felon with a sentence of five years
          in a uniform and were going walk out
          eight weeks later with a different
          name, a clean record, and an honorable
          discharge - a guy who did "everything
          he could" to save his friends.
Dunbar looks at them.   One to the other.   Slowly.
                      DUNBAR
          Is that what I did, now? And of
          course, you can prove all of it.
                      OSBORNE
          We can prove that you're not Ray
          Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet
          is a court-martial in and of itself-
                      DUNBAR
          Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar?
          Was I ever told to state my name
          rank and serial number for the record?
          No. You assumed who I was, because
          I was wearing this uniform. Don't
          believe me?
He reaches under the table and rips out the HIDDEN MICROPHONE.
                      DUNBAR
          Check your tapes.
Hardy and Osborne exchange an uneasy glance.
                      HARDY
          We don't need the tapes-
                      DUNBAR
          Oh, you don't? What else do you
          have on me? You haven't found any
          bodies yet, have you?
                      HARDY
          We've found all of them.

                                                       87.
Dunbar chuckles at the bluff.

                      DUNBAR
          Ohhhh, I don't think so...

                      OSBORNE
          How do you know that?

                      DUNBAR
          Just a guess. Maybe they're not
          where they're supposed to be. Maybe
          somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -
          no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still
          plays as self defense. Face it
          detectives ... you have nothing.

Hardy, knowing he's right. In a flash he reaches down PULLS
OSBORNE'S GUN and grabs Dunbar, SLAMMING him up against the
wall, pressing the weapon TO HIS TEMPLE!

                      HARDY
          Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun-

                      DUNBAR
              (terrified)
          Jesus!

                      OSBORNE
          Hardy, what are you doing-

                      HARDY
          Isn't this how your story goes?
          Pike annoys someone so much he gets
          shot in the head-

                      DUNBAR
          Please, please don't-

A POUNDING on the locked door.    Hardy ignores it.

                      HARDY
          We can tie you to the chair if it'll
          work better for you-

                      OSBORNE
          Hardy, for Chrissakes-

                      HARDY
          WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?

                      DUNBAR
              (practically in tears)
          You'll never find it-

Hardy COCKS the pistol as Dunbar screams:

                                                           88.
                      DUNBAR
          You'll never find it cause HE'S NOT
          DEAD!
A CRASH as the door's lock SNAPS and M.P.'s POUR into the
room! Styles and the JAG Lawyer behind, taking in the scene.
                      STYLES
          What in God's name is going on?
Hardy releases Dunbar, who slides to the floor, gasping.
                      DUNBAR
          He- He made me do it-
                       HARDY
          Do what?
                      DUNBAR
          Hunting- we had to hunt him-
                      JAG LAWYER
          Sergeant, arrest these men!
                      OSBORNE
          You mean the exercise?
                      DUNBAR
          There never was an exercise! Never
          targets, never teams, I don't even
          know if there's a creek bed out there-
As the M.P.'s grab Hardy and Osborne, pulling them away...
                      HARDY
          What did you do?
                      JAG LAWYER
          That's enough-
                      HARDY
          Goddammit, what did you DO?!
                      DUNBAR
          I COULDN'T KILL HIM!
He breaks down sobbing.   Styles holds up a hand to the M.P.'s.
                       STYLES
          Hang on.
                       JAG LAWYER
          Colonel-
                       STYLES
          No.   I want to hear this.

                                                            89.
The JAG Lawyer glowers as the M.P.'s stand down.   Dunbar
tries to pull himself together. To Hardy:
                      DUNBAR
          You're right. I was the one he
          singled out. Beat me morning, noon,
          and night, ran me ragged. When
          Mueller found me, I was gone. He
          gave me a little taste...
INT. CADET SHOWERS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO
Mueller showing the syringe to the naked Dunbar.   Dunbar's
voice over speaks in unison with Mueller:
                      MUELLER AND DUNBAR (V.O.)
          I got a friend with an in at the PX,
          can hook you up...
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING
                      DUNBAR
          What I didn't know, was his friend
          was West. He ran the whole thing.
                      STYLES
          You're lying, son.
                      DUNBAR
          You think it's easy to have all that
          morphine just disappear without a
          higher up authorizing it? Check the
          requisition orders, I'll lay money
          it's his signature on them.
INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO
Dunbar, alone, sleeve rolled up, arm tied off: Sliding the
needle into his vein...
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          That was his game, see? Ride the
          cadets so hard they'd need something
          to stay on their feet. Then he'd
          send Mueller or Kendall to them,
          waving around their magic needle
          promising to make it all go away.
He hits the plunger, injecting.   His face goes tranquil.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING
                      DUNBAR
          It wasn't a new thing either.   He'd
          been doing this for years.
              (MORE)

                                                          90.
                      DUNBAR
          Every nine weeks, a new class of
          cadets, new potential customers.
          The amount of money involved over
          that period of time... this was some
          high stakes shit.
He takes a deep breath, looking at them.
                      DUNBAR
          Dunbar moved his through the kitchen.
          I worked in the motor pool and hooked
          all the mechanics. By the time the
          hurricane hit, we were all in. Some
          using, some pushing, some both. But
          then something happened. West heard
          one of us was about to talk, to blow
          his whole operation. He figured
          he'd made enough money, had enough
          of the army, maybe it was time to
          disappear. But first he was gonna
          teach us one last thing.
INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- LAST NIGHT
West, entering the,barracks, shouting the cadets awake.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          The Tuesday Night drill was the
          perfect cover. The hurricane made
          it even better.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- TARMAC -- LAST NIGHT
The cadets, climbing aboard the chopper.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          He put us on the chopper and flew us
          to his cabin. And then he told us.
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
The six men stand in rigid formation, eyes on West.
                      WEST
          Gentlemen! It has come to my
          attention that there is a traitor in
          our midst. Someone who was going to
          break the code of fraternal
          brotherhood that I have endeavored
          to create in all of you. Perhaps
          that failure is mine. But we take
          care of our own. And this traitor
          must be made to pay.
He walks down the line of the six men, eyeing each of them.
Finally stopping at one. Putting a hand on his shoulder.

                                                        91.
Nunez.
                         WEST
             Run.
                         NUNEZ
             Sir, I wasn't-
                         WEST
             I know you were. Cadet  Mueller found
             the letter you'd written to the
             Colonel in your locker.  You were
             going to betray us all.  Now, run.
He points to the door. The hurricane, RAGING outside.   Nunez
looks to the others, then the door, and understands.
He takes off running out the door.       Gone.
West walks over to a table covered with a tarp. Pulls the
cloth aside to reveal M-16's, PISTOLS, and GRENADES.
                         WEST
             Now we'll see whose training's paid
             off the most. You are to hunt Cadet
             Nunez down and bring his body back
             to me. If you fail and he escapes,
             we all go down together.
The remaining five cadets, understanding there is no place
for friendship or kindness here. This is life and death.
They walk to the table and gear up.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
Lightning, thunder, and rain as Nunez runs unarmed through
the thick brush.
SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM - The other five fan out, rifles up,
following his trail, ready to kill.
                         DUNBAR (V.O.)
             It was insanity. We were hunting a
             man down to kill him.
ON MUELLER
Making his way down embankment, M-l6 out, ready for anything.
From behind him, MOVEMENT...
                         DUNBAR (V.O.)
             He got Mueller first.
Nunez TACKLES HIM at full speed, feet SLIPPING on the wet
hill, and the two TUMBLE head first into a GULLY. Punching,
kicking, biting, anything to stop the other man.

                                                                 92.
Nunez, CHOKING Mueller as he strains to reach his gun...
                          MUELLER
            Roberto...
With a HEAVE, Nunez SNAPS HIS NECK.        Mueller lies still.
                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
            He took his gun. Used it on Childs.
Nunez spins, seeing CHILDS BEHIND HIM. He DIVES as Childs
fires! Hits the ground in a roll, comes up with Mueller's
rifle, and SHOOTS - BLOWING CHILDS BACK against the wet rocks.
                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
            I can't imagine what it was like.
            Having your friends try to kill you...
Nunez slumps against the gully's wall, breathing hard.          In
agony over what he's just had to do.
                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
            But you do what you have to survive.
Closing his eyes, Nunez steels himself. Wipes the blood
from his hands and climbs out of the gully.
ELSEWHERE
PIKE, creeping through the foliage. Trying to listen for
sounds of movement through the storm. His eyes narrow as he
hears a HIGH PITCHED WHINE...
The bullet hits his forehead dead center.        He crumples.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Nunez in a tree, thirty meters away.
Lowering his rifle.      He climbs down.
                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
            Kendall and I found Dunbar a couple
            minutes later.
TIME CUT TO:
Dunbar and Kendall come upon Pike's fallen form. They gaze
down at the uniform emblazoned with the name "DUNBAR".
                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
            It came to me in a split second.
            Change clothes, change identities.
            If James Pike gets discharged he
            goes right back to jail. But if I
            was Dunbar, I could walk away from
            all this with a new life. But then...
As he reaches down for the uniform, a SHOT RINGS OUT.

                                                           93.
KENDALL FALLS, wounded in the arm. Dunbar raises his rifle
to find Nunez, standing ten yards away, gun trained on him.
YELLING OVER THE HURRICANE:
                          NUNEZ
           Put it down!
A Mexican stand-off.   The rain continues to fall.
                       DUNBAR
           I just want to go!
Nunez shakes his head.
                       NUNEZ
           You were gonna kill me, Pike!    Thought
           you were my friend!
Dunbar, torn. He can't bring himself to shoot, but he can't
surrender either.
                       DUNBAR
           I have to get Kendall to a hospital!
                       NUNEZ
           He was gonna kill me too!
Silence.   The two men still facing each other.
                       NUNEZ {CONT'D)
           I snapped Mueller's neck! He was my
           best friend and I had to snap his
           neck because he was gonna shoot me
           for drugs! For West!
                       DUNBAR
           We don't have to do this! You go
           that way, I'll go this way!
Nunez laughs.
                       NUNEZ
           You'll shoot me in the back!
                       DUNBAR
           You killed three people!    Isn't that
           enough for one night?
More silence.   Neither moves.    The sky above, a maelstrom.
                       DUNBAR
           I don't want to die out here, Roberto!
           Do you?
Nunez, staring at him.     Deciding.

                                                              94.
                      NUNEZ
          If you even twitch...
Dunbar nods.
Nunez begins backing away, rifle still trained on him.
And then Dunbar spies something behind and to the left of
Nunez...
West.
Staring down at him from behind some brush.       Watching.
Nunez, slowly backing away. He pauses as his foot catches
on a fallen branch. Looks away from Dunbar for a split second
to step over it...
West nods to Dunbar as if to say "Go on. . . "
                      DUNBAR
          Forgive me. ..
And Dunbar FIRES.
Nunez, caught by the burst, GOES DOWN. The echo of the
gunshots, swallowed by the storm. Dunbar lowers his head in
agony. West walks down.
                      WEST
          Congratulations, Cadet Pike.      You
          get the gold star.
Dunbar stares at his Sergeant through the rain.
                        DUN BAR
          Fuck you.
West smiles.   Tilts his head to Kendall.
                      WEST
          You'd best get him out of here.
          Don't worry about the bodies, they'll
          be taken care of.
Dunbar doesn't move.
                      WEST
          This is where we part ways, Cadet.
          You tell them I died out here, or
          I'll come back for you. Tell them
          one of the others did me. Mueller,
          Childs, I don't care who. You and
          Kendall, you tell them a story.
              (smiling)
          You can tell a story, can't you?
Dunbar doesn't reply.   West laughs and flips him a salute.

                                                         95.
                       WEST
          Dismissed.

And West turns and walks away, stepping over Nunez.   Giving
Dunbar a clear shot at his back.

Dunbar raises his rifle, wanting, needing, dying to shoot
the old man...

But he can't.   West disappears into the bayou.

A GROAN from the ground. Kendall. Dunbar's reverie broken,
he leans down, beginning to unbutton the Dunbar Uniform...

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING

Dunbar stubs out a cigarette, finished. Hardy, Osborne,
Styles, and the JAG Lawyer gaping at what he has just said.

                      DUNBAR
          I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all.
          He came after us with a vengeance.
              (to Styles)
          You know the rest.

                      HARDY
          And the bodies?

                      DUNBAR
          You won't find them. Won't find
          West, either. He's too good.

                      OSBORNE
          No bodies, no West...

                      HARDY
          No death certificates.    No crime.

                      DUNBAR
          Just four people MIA.    Silence.

The JAG Lawyer steps forward.

                      JAG LAWYER
          You'll testify to this, the
          corruption, the drug scam?

Dunbar says nothing.

                      JAG LAWYER
          We can cut a deal for you on the
          Nunez killing.

                      DUNBAR
          I don't want any deals.

                                                            96.
                       JAG LAWYER
           If you're telling the truth, the PX
           requisition records will prove it-
                       DUNBAR
           All the proof you need will be when
           West comes back and puts a bullet in
           my brain. But I'll do it. I'm a
           dead man, anyway. Like Kendall.
               (looking at Hardy)
           We both should have died out there
           with our brothers. I know that now.
Silence.   The JAG Lawyer looks to Hardy, all anger gone.
                       JAG LAWYER
           I'll take him now if you don't mind.
Hardy nods. Dunbar rises and slowly walks to the door.
Turning back to Hardy.
                       DUNBAR
           Tell me, detective.   Did you get
           what you wanted?
Hardy shakes his head, sadly.
                       HARDY
           Not even close.
They leave.   Styles walks over to Hardy.
                       STYLES
           Tom-
Hardy holds up a hand, cutting him off. Styles nods,
understanding, and leaves, closing the door behind him.
Hardy and Osborne stand there.   Not speaking.    It's done.
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- OFFICER'S CLUB -- NIGHT
Several hours and bourbons later, Hardy sits at the bar,
drunk and alone. Out of place, the only one not in uniform.
Osborne walks in, locates Hardy, and strides over to the
bar, a sheaf of papers under her arm. Her face, stoic.
                       OSBORNE
           We need to talk-
                       HARDY
           Seven.
He takes a slug of his drink.
                       OSBORNE
           What?

                                                       97.
                      HARDY
          Seven guys. What was it you said?
          You were "just starting to believe I
          wasn't the guy people said".
He chuckles.
                     HARDY {CONT'D)
          Seven. That's the answer to Kendall's
          question. How many? Seven.
Osborne looks at him.    Realizing what he's saying.
                      OSBORNE
          This isn't the time-
                      HARDY
          This is the perfect time. You know
          what makes a good detective? The
          number of confessions they get.
          You're a good detective, Osborne.
          So now you get mine.
                      OSBORNE
          What if I don't want it?
                         HARDY
          Tough.
He pours himself another drink.
                         HARDY
          Thing about    taking money is, you
          don't have    to do anything.  You just
          sit there.     Maybe you don't return a
          phone call.     Maybe you don't follow
          up a lead.     But that's it.  Keep the
          money, your    work's done.
Osborne stares at him.
                      HARDY
          Seven unsolved murders. And you
          know what? It didn't weigh on my
          conscience. Not one goddamn bit.
He takes a slug from his glass and grimaces.
                      OSBORNE
          That's not true.
                      HARDY
          There are degrees of truth, officer.
          Always degrees.

                                                          98.
                      OSBORNE
          You're a good man, Hardy.
                        HARDY
          Really.
                      OSBORNE
          Far as I'm concerned, whatever you
          did in the past can stay in the past.
Hardy stares at her.
                      HARDY
          I may not be growing on you, but
          you're sure as hell growing on me.
He motions to the bartender for another glass, but Osborne
takes his hand, stopping him.
                      OSBORNE
          And because you're a good man, I
          know you'll do the right thing.
Hardy looks at her, questioning.   Osborne takes a deep breath.
                      OSBORNE
          Pike never made it to D.C.. Somebody
          took him off the plane before it
          left. My guess is he's already dead.
Hardy stares at her.
                        HARDY
          West?
                        OSBORNE
          Nobody saw.    But I don't think so.
She puts the papers on the bar.
                      OSBORNE
          These are the requisitions from the
          PX, the ones used to release the
          drugs to Mueller. West signed half
          of them - Pike was telling the truth.
          Look who signed the other half.
She taps the bottom of the paper. Hardy, not wanting to
believe it. He looks up at her, pained.
                      HARDY
          Do I have a choice in this?
                      OSBORNE
          Yeah. I can wait till you're off
          the base and do it myself.

                                                       99.
Hardy stares at his glass.   Deciding.
                       HARDY
          Fuck it.   Let's go finish this.
INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- NIGHT
Styles, finishing his paperwork. He rises and turns off his
desk light, bathing the office in DARKNESS. He's about to
leave when he notices a SILHOUETTE in the doorway.
                      HARDY
          "You have to get out of the way of
          the bigger dogs". That was good.
Styles squints at the figure.
                      STYLES
          Tom, is that you?
Hardy steps forward, into the office.
                      HARDY
          It was so good, I actually forgot
          you're one of the bigger dogs now.
          The Base Commander. The one in
          control.
You couldn't let him testify, could you?
                      STYLES
          What are you talking about?
                      HARDY
          If you let him testify then it would
          have all come out. West was supposed
          to take care of it out there, shut
          Nunez up and then disappear. But it
          got messy and people got killed. So
          you called your old pal Tom Hardy,
          figuring if worse came to worse,
          he'd cover for you.
                      STYLES
          You're drunk-
                      HARDY
          I'm not going to cover for you, Bill.
          Not for this.
Styles, realizing what Hardy's talking about.
                       STYLES
          Look-
He begins to move from behind his desk.

                                                   100.
                      HARDY
          Stay where you are.

                       STYLES
          Or what?   You've gone round the bend-

                      HARDY
          West had a partner. Someone who
          knew how to get things done.

Hardy throws the papers onto Styles' desk.

                      HARDY
          What I can't understand is why you
          signed these. If you'd just let
          West take care of the paperwork, no
          one would have known, but you got
          careless. So when Pike finally told
          the truth you had to get rid of him,
          too.

                      STYLES
          That's preposterous-

                      HARDY
          Toxicology report came back.
          Kendall's attack was caused by a
          drug known as anephadrine, maybe
          you've heard of it. It's for
          asthmatics. If an epileptic takes
          enough, it kills them. I checked
          with the nurses at the hospital -
          you're the only other person who
          visited Kendall.

                      STYLES
          Wanted to see if he was okay-

                      HARDY
          You poisoned him, Bill. You heard
          our interrogation, you knew he was
          ready to crack, so you killed him,
          just like Pike.

                      STYLES
          I'm not even going to dignify that-

                      HARDY
          No!  You will stand there and you
          will listen! What happened to you,
          Bill?  You were the one who joined
          up to do good in the world. You
          were the one who believed in it-

                                                      101.
                      STYLES
          You want to get into a finger pointing
          contest about character? The army
          kicked you out for drugs, the cops
          fired you for taking bribes from a
          mobster, and you think you can stand
          there and lecture me on codes of
          conduct? There's only one criminal
          standing in this room and it's you.
                      HARDY
          Not for long.
He walks towards the desk.
                      HARDY
          No more witnesses. West's a ghost.
          But it doesn't matter because we
          have your signature, the hospital
          log, and Kendall's toxicology report.
          And that'll be enough.
                      STYLES
          You're crazy-
                      HARDY
          You can't duck this, Bill. I may
          have done every goddamn thing in my
          life wrong but I won't let this
          happen.
                      STYLES
          For the last time, I have no idea
          what you're talking about-
                      HARDY
              (squinting)
          Get your hands away from the desk!
In the darkness we see Styles MOVE SUDDENLY...
                      HARDY
          Osborne, gun!
Hardy DIVES to the floor - Osborne in the doorway, PISTOL
raised, FIRES TWO SHOTS! Muzzle flare lighting the room for
a split second as Styles is BLOWN BACK against the wall!
Hardy gets to his feet and flicks on the LIGHT. Styles lies
slumped in the corner, two holes in his chest. Dead.
Osborne lowers her weapon, shaking.
Hardy points to the top desk drawer, which is open. Inside
it sits an IVORY HANDLED PISTOL. Fully loaded, safety off.
It's presence tells them everything they need to know.

                                                          102.
                      OSBORNE
          It's West's, isn't it?
Hardy nods and then turns to look down at Styles' body.
                      HARDY
          Now it's over.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- NIGHT
The aftermath. Flashing blue and red lights from parked
Military Police vehicles illuminate the grounds as M.P. 'S
string crime scene tape around the front entrance of the
building, securing the site for investigation.
Hardy takes in the entire scene from afar. Standing by his
GTO, watching as several M.P.'s finish questioning Osborne.
When she's done she spies Hardy and walks over to him.
                      OSBORNE
          What are you doing out here?
                      HARDY
          Leaving without saying goodbye.
          What are you gonna do?
                      OSBORNE
          Go home, get drunk, and try and forget
          this ever happened.
                      HARDY
          Think it'll work?
                      OSBORNE
          Nah.
                      HARDY
          Want company?
Osborne smiles.
                      OSBORNE
          A word of advice about women - that
          first hour or so after they kill
          their boss? Probably not the best
          time to hit on them.
                      HARDY
          I should probably write that down.
                      OSBORNE
          Yeah. .
Hardy pulls a card from his pocket and hands it to her.
                      OSBORNE
          Your phone number?

                                                      103.
                        HARDY
            In case you need me to testify about
            the shooting. They'll clear you.
A beat.
                        OSBORNE
            He was your friend.
                        HARDY
            Yeah. But he was a lot of other
            things, too. Thanks.
She nods.   An awkward moment.      Finally:
                        HARDY
            I'll see you.
He turns away.   Walking towards his car.
                          OSBORNE
            Hey, Hardy!
He turns back. She walks up and holds something out to him.
A ten dollar bill.
                        OSBORNE
            I owe you this.
He looks down at the money.
                        HARDY
            You saved my life tonight. Keep it.
                (pause)
            Actually, don't keep it, I need the
            money.
He takes the bill and Osborne laughs. He climbs into his
car and starts it. Grinning at her through the open window.
                        HARDY
            You're one of the good ones, Osborne.
            Don't sweat the details.
He puts the GTO in gear and drives off. She watches him go,
then looks down at his card. Smiling. Maybe she will call.
INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
A bottle of Scotch at her side, Osborne slips a tape marked
"BASIC TRAINING INTRO - SGT. N. WEST" into her VCR. Settles
back to watch it. West's face fills the screen.
                        WEST
            Welcome, Cadets. The art of warfare
            is simple and complex. Simple in
            its goal, complex in its execution.

                                                         104.
INT. HARDY'S GTO (MOVING) -- NIGHT
It's started to rain.    Hardy drives in silence.
                      WEST
          As Sun Tzu writes, the true warfare
          is deception.
A HITCHHIKER up ahead.    Hardy pulls over for him.
INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Osborne, drinking and watching.
                      WEST
          At all times you must confuse your
          enemies, surrounding them with
          uncertainty, giving them false hope.
INT. HARDY'S GTO -- NIGHT
The Hitchhiker gets into the car.
                      WEST
          At all times, you must mask your
          true intentions.
Hardy, smiling at him, because the Hitchhiker is not a
Hitchhiker at all...
                      HARDY (V.O.)
          Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
The Hitchhiker is Dunbar.
                      OSBORNE (V.O.)
          They got their stories straight. . .
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT
24 hours ago. The hurricane rages. A HAND pulls the PIN on
a phosphorous grenade and CHUCKS IT.
It blows, frying brush and nothing more.
West comes over the hill, running to investigate. He stops
at what he sees. Nunez stands unarmed in the creek bed,
SURROUNDED by the other Section Eight Cadets. A prisoner.
                      WEST
          What the fuck is going on?
                      DUNBAR
          Your weapons, Sergeant.
West doesn't move. Kendall walks over and DISARMS West,
pushing him into the circle next to the terrified Nunez.

                                                        105.
                      WEST
          Is this about that little drug
          business you all are running? Yeah,
          I know about that, Roberto told me-
                        NUNEZ
          Shut up!    Look, we won't say anything-
                      WEST
          Fuck that. You little pissers really
          think you can throw a scare into me?
Dunbar raises his rifle and SHOOTS NUNEZ. He goes down,
twitches once and lies still. Dead. West looks at Dunbar.
                      WEST
          You're gonna have to do a lot better
          than that, son.
                      HARDY (O.S.)
          How about this?
And with that, Tom Hardy emerges from the brush carrying, a
COMBAT KNIFE. West's eyes sparkle with recognition.
                      WEST
          Didn't I kick your ass out for this
          drug thing fifteen years ago?
Hardy just smiles.
                      WEST
          Should've known you were involved in
          this. Come on then. Let's see you
          try and stick me-
Moving faster than   West thought imaginable, Hardy moves and
the knife FLASHES,   CUTTING WEST OPEN stem to sternum. Hardy
grips the older man   by the shoulders, lowering him to the
ground as he dies.    Whispering in his ear:
                      HARDY
          Stem to sternum. You taught me well,
          Sarge.
And WEST DIES. A moment of utter silence and then VOICES
FROM THE PAST begin coming back to us:
                      STYLES (V.O.)
          You think you could explain all this
          to me?
Kendall walks over to Hardy and hands him a PISTOL.
                      HARDY (V.O.)
          I wouldn't know where to start.
Kendall holds out his arm, gritting his teeth...

                                                          106.
                      HARDY (V.O.)
          I guess it was about one man framing
          another...

And Hardy SHOOTS Kendall once, THROUGH THE ARM.

EXT. CLEARING -- THIS MORNING

Mueller and Childs lay NUNEZ's DEAD BODY out in the brush.
The sound of the Helicopter approaching...

TIME CUT TO:

Dunbar raises his rifle and FIRES towards the tree line.
Aiming at nothing. The Helicopter comes into view overhead.

DUST KICKS UP around Dunbar and Kendall - bullet hits.

                       HARDY (V.O.)
          When you commit a crime you know is
          going to be investigated, you need a
          fall guy.. .

ON STYLES' FACE - Watching this through the windscreen.

                      STYLES (V.O.)
          The one who won't talk was trading
          live fire with the dead one as we
          reached the pick-up.

RACK FOCUS TO - Hardy, concealed in the woods, FIRING at
Dunbar and Kendall's feet to simulate Nunez shooting at them.
Dunbar, shooting towards where Nunez's body lies. Making it
look like he just killed Nunez.

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- THIS MORNING

Hardy arriving at the Fort, EMBRACING STYLES.

                      HARDY
          And for that to work, you have to
          have a witness...

PAN OVER to OSBORNE, watching.

                      HARDY (V.O.)
          Someone who's not involved, who's
          word can't be questioned...

VARIOUS SHOTS -- Of Hardy and Osborne, investigating the
case, talking to Dunbar, talking to Kendall...

                      HARDY
          You only let them see what you want
          them to see, you make them believe...

                                                           107.
INT. OFFICER'S CLUB -- EARLIER
Osborne, showing Hardy the requisition forms.
                      OSBORNE (V.O.)
          They believe the innocent are guilty
          and the guilty are innocent.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- EARLIER
After shooting Styles, Osborne gives her story to the M.P.'s.
                      HARDY (V.O.)
          And if they're asked, that's what
          they'll tell the world.
INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- PRESENT NIGHT
Osborne, watching the taped West.
                       WEST
          Your greatest weapon will by your
          allies . . .
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- EARLIER
Hardy, taking a cigarette from Dunbar's pack.
                       HARDY
          My brand.   Must be my lucky day.
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- EARLIER
Kendall, coughing fit.   Hardy, getting him a GLASS OF WATER.
                      WEST (V.O.)
          . . . some of which you may have to
          sacrifice for the greater good.
Hardy, secretly dissolving a POWDER into Kendall's water.
                      HARDY (V.O.)
          We got the toxicology report . . .
INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- EARLIER
Hardy, confronting Styles in the dark.
                      WEST (V.O.)
          Make no mistake, the innocent will
          die. . .
Osborne, FIRING TWICE into Styles.   As he hits the wall

                                                        108.
                       HARDY (V.O.)
           Next time you frame a guy, pick
           someone who can't defend themselves...
           But it will not be in vain.
           Sometimes, you can trick the enemy
           into doing your work for you. . .
Osborne, staring down at WEST'S PISTOL.
                       HARDY (V.O.)
           He still carry those guns?
INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- EARLIER
Earlier.   Alone, Hardy plants West's pistol in Styles' desk.
                       WEST (V.O.)
           ...if you engage in a clever enough
           subterfuge.
INT. BASE PX -- BACKROOM -- EARLIER
Hardy stands behind Kendall and Dunbar, overseeing them as
they fill out requisition forms. Kendall signs West's
signature, Dunbar signs Styles'.
                       HARDY (V.O.)
           What I can't understand is why you
           signed these...
As we move into a CLOSE UP on Hardy:
                       OSBORNE (V.O.)
           You never told me why you got kicked
           out of...
                       STYLES (V.O.)
           The army kicked you out for drugs...
                       MUELLER AND DUNBAR (V.O.)
           I got a friend with an in at the PX,
           can hook you up...
                       STYLES (V.O.)
           There's only one criminal standing
           in this room and it's you.
INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Osborne, watching the tape of West's speech.
                       WEST
           Which brings us to the simple goal.
           For the true warrior, the one and
           only objective is to emerge from
           conflict unscathed.

                                                         109.
EXT. ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT -- PRESENT NIGHT

The GTO pulls into a space and Hardy and Dunbar get out.

                      HARDY (V.O.)
          I promised them I'd ask you where
          West and the others are...

                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Washout rejects, guys he said were
          "dumbfucks too stupid to know they
          dead"...

                      HARDY (V.O.)
          He's telling the truth up to a
          point...

They walk towards the bar's entrance.

                      HARDY (V.O.)
          You can't prove anything until we
          find the bodies...

                      PIKE
          All we gotta do is tell the story
          right...

                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          You haven't found any bodies yet,
          have you...

As Hardy and Dunbar push through the doors into the bar...

                      HARDY (V.O.)
          WHERE ARE THEY?

INT. ROADHOUSE -- NIGHT

A table of FOUR MEN look up as Hardy and Dunbar enter.

Mueller, Childs, Pike, and the Motor Pool DUTY SERGEANT.
All drinking beer, having a grand old time.

                      STYLES (V.O.)
          Habeas Corpus - you have to have a
          body to have a crime.

Hardy and Dunbar smile and go to join them.

INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- PRESENT NIGHT

As the taped West concludes his speech.

                       WEST
          Thank you.

                                                          110.
The screen cuts to STATIC. Osborne turns off the TV,
extinguishing the last source of light. OVER THE DARKNESS:
                       WEST (V.O.)
           You can tell a story, can't you?
EXT. ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT
Silence.   We slowly move towards Hardy's parked GTO...
                       HARDY (V.O.)
           Murder is basic.
Focusing on the TRUNK...
                       HARDY (V.O.)
           There are no conspiracies, no grand
           mysteries, no evil puppet masters
           behind it all, pulling the strings.
INT. GTO TRUNK -- NIGHT
WEST'S BODY, stuffed into the trunk of Hardy's car.
                       HARDY
           Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
EXT. CLEARING -- THIS MORNING
Dunbar lays the wounded Kendall down as the Helicopter
carrying Styles comes in for a landing. Dunbar wipes the
sweat from Kendall's brow and asks him seriously:
                       DUNBAR
           Are you ready for this?
