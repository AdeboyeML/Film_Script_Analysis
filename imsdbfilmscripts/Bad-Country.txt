            The door blasts open. Bud charges in, throws Grace against

            Buzz moves. Grace turns to look...

            ...In a blink, Catfish's gun comes up: ONE QUICK POP. A .45
            with a thick, barrel silencer. The mirror shatters. Grace's
            knees hit the floor. His head hits the sink, HOLDS. As blood
            runs from one small hole.

            Catfish straightens up in the next mirror. Tucks his shirt.
            Grace's body sags to the floor. Catfish and Buzz walk out.

            High stone walls topped with concertina wire. Looming guard
            towers. Thick FOG blankets the yard filled with CONVICTS.

            Jesse takes hold of a metal bar, lifts it from a bench press.
            He does two reps. The weights BANG down and Jesse sits up.

                                RAY O.S.
                      This place is bad...

            Ray adds weight to the already excessive amount. He sweats as

                      sign on my back, Jesse, they all think I
                      talked.

            Jesse scans numerous WHITE CONS watching the Wheeler brothers.

                      Just the other day... some spic fish got
                      hit with a weight. Ten other cons, they
                      beat him and stabbed him till there
                      weren't nothin' left. And the guards let
                      it happen.

            Ray fastens the safety collars and Jesse leans back.

                                RAY
                      His brains were on the wall, Jesse. Like
                      somebody painted 'em.

            Jesse does another set. Weights BANG down. He slowly sits up.

                      feel it fuckin' coming.

            Ray shoots a look at a group of ARYAN BROTHERS across the
            yard. CZAPP, their "leader," and ROACH. Jesse turns. Czapp
            looks at him. Eyes meet. Jesse leans back.

            The press shakes as Jesse does a last set. His red strained
            face as the bar lands with a CRASH.

            Jesse turns SLOW to find the Duty Guard watching him from the
            hall. Lights a cigarette, stares.

                      You should have come to me sooner, Jesse.

                      a problem.

            A Guard buzzes Jesse through.

            Jesse rolls him over. Ray is limp. A filthy SYRINGE imbedded
            his arm. Jaw slack. Eyes wide and vacant.

            THE PHOTO FLUTTERS FROM JESSE'S HAND TO THE FLOOR...

            Jesse lowers, pulling Ray to his arms. He shuts his eyes.
            Teeth clench. And as Jesse feels the bile rising, his massive
            frame begins to shake... Then we realize, he's crying...

            Jesse sleeps. Hand under the pillow. When there's a sound...

            His eyes SNAP OPEN to discover the silhouettes of SIX MEN,
            rushing into his cell...

            A LOADED SOCK swings out from Jesse's pillow, slams MAN #1 in
            the jaw with a CRACK!!

            On his feet, Jesse whips the sock around and whacks MAN #2's
            head against the concrete wall. He slumps down unconscious.

            A BLUNT OBJECT is rammed into Jesse's sternum. Another shot
            bangs his neck. The sock drops and a PADLOCK clatters out.

            With a final burst of energy, Jesse turns, SCREAMS and rushes
            MAN #3. Man #3 slams into the cell bars. CLANG!! Lights out.

            The remaining three Men attack. A series of blows rain down
            and Jesse sinks into their grip.

            HALL LIGHTS BUMP ON: NOW WE SEE, THESE "MEN" ARE GUARDS.

            More GUARDS pour in, led by Murphy. They yank Jesse from his
            cell and take him down the tier.

            Guards toss the cell in a thorough search. Mattress
            overturns. Shelves crash.

            door into...

            A TUNNEL

            between cell blocks. The ROAR of prisoners recedes as Jesse's
            dragged into darkness getting darker.

            presides over this arraignment hearing:

                                JUDGE PONDER
                      You stand accused of forty counts of
                      burglary, twenty nine counts of felony
                      theft, possession of illegal firearms,
                      possession or dealing in unregistered

                      incendiary devices, and seventeen counts
                      of receiving stolen goods... How do you
                      plead?

            CUT TO DANIEL KIERSEY, 40s, sharp, confident, expensively
            dressed. Jesse's attorney, rising:

                      Let's hear the arguments for bail.

            The DISTRICT ATTORNEY rises from his seat:

                                DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                      Your honor, this man is an habitual felon
                      as well as a flight risk. Our office has
                      overwhelming evidence that Mr. Wheeler is
                      not only guilty, but also a serious
                      threat to the community. The State
                      recommends that bail be denied.

                                KIERSEY
                      Your honor, my client deserves a
                      reasonable bail. He has every intention
                      of appearing and answering to all these
                      false charges. In addition, he is the
                      sole provider for his wife and newborn
                      child, who would suffer undo hardship if
                      this man were incarcerated.

            Jesse steps through his fence into deep WOODS, to find a CAR
            waiting idyll on a dirt road. 

            INT. CAR - PRE DAWN

            A HEAVY-SET MAN at the wheel. Jesse gets in as the headlights
            spin on and the car pulls away... 

            EXT. SHIPYARD - PRE DAWN

            Dark. Eerie and desolate. The car arrives. Jesse steps out
            and disappears into the shadows of a towering crane.

            On the jetty, a nondescript MAN stands alone against the calm
            Mississippi. His back is to us.

                      here 'cause I'm scared. I done what I
                      did, 'cause certain people crossed the
                      line. They didn't keep their word.

            A swamp area used as a mud retrieval source for the levy.
            Amite River. FOG OBSCURES NEARLY EVERYTHING.

            Jesse slowly emerges... Then Bud and Metro, on all sides, MAG-
            LIGHTS, FLAK JACKETS and SHOTGUNS. A DUFFEL BAG of SHOVELS.

            The sounds of the swamp are terrifying. Herons and bobcats.
            Boots hitting water. The buzz of a million mosquitos.

            SUDDENLY A RUSHING SOUND -- An ALLIGATOR shoves off the mire.

            Jesse suddenly STOPS. LISTENS. BREATHES. Bud and Metro stare.

            BLOW TORCHES ROAR as Pathologists burn through the drums.

            Sparks fly. The lids CRASH. Swamp water floods out... And
            immersed within: two sore-covered, DECOMPOSING BODIES.

            The room recoils from the fumes.

            Jesse is under the hood of his truck, fixing the engine...
            When a '71 Mustang, white-on-white, roars up the street. 

            Jesse glances over as the car pulls alongside the driveway.  
            It's CATFISH, at the wheel. A wolfish grin.

                                CATFISH
                      On a Sunday drive, that's all. The good
                      Lord ridin' shotgun, through another
                      glorious Louisiana mornin'.

            Jesse EYES his .45 atop the engine block, within reach.

                      Say, Jesse... Lucian's askin' about you.
                      Fact, a lot of people are.  

            Jesse stays on the engine, never turns around.

                      You tell him I'll come by.

                      That's good. I'll see you real soon then.

            taken at high-speed. FREEZE FRAME to BLACK & WHITE.

            MARTIN FITCH (30), Deputy Chief of Staff for US Attorney
            General. Pressed suit. Young face. Out of his element.

                      experience is more than adequate to

                      statement... We decide who the target is,
                      what's the threat assessment, the cost
                      value, over what time table it's gonna
                      take place... Which target do we go after
                      first. We don't want to miss a big target
                      hitting a smaller target, you understand?

                                BUD
                      No.

                                FITCH
                      Well, exposing bodies has limitations.
                      Those people are dead. We can't retrieve
                      their lives.

            Bud blinks.

                                BRADDOCK
                      He means there might not be enough to
                      back Jesse.

                                BUD
                      Keep him on the street without
                      protection, he winds up dead.

                                FITCH
                      What I'm saying is, we need fresh leads.
                      He'll need to present something that
                      separates him from those we're going to
                      arrest. If Jesse can't offer something
                      continuous... I'm afraid we can't be of
                      much help.

            Bud stares at Fitch. 

            A WAITRESS in her 50s approaches. 

                                WAITRESS

                      Well...we got ranch, thousand island and
                      oil. Which one you want?

            Bud's chair SCRAPES back as he stands, stares hard at Fitch:

                                BUD
                      Lost my appetite.

            And walks out.

            EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE DINER - DAY

            Bud stalks out to his car. Braddock follows, agitated. They
            say nothing till they reach the car.

                                BUD
                      I set this up. Me and Jesse. If the Feds
                      want to help, that's fine. But not him.

                                BRADDOCK
                      What do you mean, "me and Jesse?" He's
                      not your partner, Bud. This case is
                      beyond our capacity. It requires
                      resources we don't have.

            Bud unlocks the car. They stand, talking across the roof.

                                BUD
                      They ain't takin' us serious, Mike. They
                      send us some kid with a year under his
                      belt?! He don't even know what state he's
                      in... You want him in charge?!

                                BRADDOCK
                      You're God damn right I do! You're out on
                      a limb on this already, Bud! It's my job
                      to make sure you get back!

                                BUD
                      This is bullshit.

                                BRADDOCK
                      That may be. What it ain't, is open for
                      discussion.

            Braddock walks away. Bud simmers a moment, gets in his car.

            INT. A ROOM - FOLLOWING MORNING

            A bare room; nothing to tell us where we are. Jesse's on a
            stool. He runs his fingers down his mustache, grits his teeth.

                                JESSE
                      Y'all wanna talk about crime? Well I
                      could tell y'all things. Names.
                      Locations. What boat is movin' what
                      drugs, which one is guns. Who's gonna get
                      cut up and why. ...But what I got to know
                      is, if 'n when I do this... If I wear
                      your dog collar... Y'all gonna do what's
                      right by me and keep my head from gettin'
                      shot the fuck off? 'Cause the truth is,
                      you need me. You ain't got enough cops
                      with enough sense or enough time, to
                      clear them crimes that already been
                      committed and will be.

                      Y'all need me... I got the devil's

            REVERSE: We're in a HOTEL SUITE.

            Shades down. Full of AGENTS: FBI, ATF, DEA, SECRET SERVICE.
            Law enforcement everywhere. On the furniture, against the
            wall, sitting on the floor. Staring at Jesse in silence.

            Bud stands by the door with Braddock. And Fitch steps
            forward, laughs nervously...

                                FITCH
                      Okay, great... Thanks. Thank you, Jesse,
                      for that. And thank you, everyone for

                      Uh, we all know why we're here. To solve

                                FBI #1

                      It's a federal matter, gentlemen. Those
                      bodies were transported over state lines.

            An ATF AGENT #1 imposes:

                                ATF #1
                      Not so fast. Ammunition, grenades? This
                      man's house was a factory, for Christ's
                      sake. ATF is taking this.

                                DEA
                      Those murders were drug related. DEA's
                      got to do follow ups.

                                SECRET SERVICE
                      He was printing counterfeit money. 
                      That's Secret Service.

            ARGUING ENSUES, Agents' voices step over one another. Fitch
            tries to take control. Jesse's been silent, until...

                                JESSE
                      There's a hit list.

            Fitch hears this. He turns, loudly to the room...

                                FITCH
                      Wait! Wait a minute, quiet! Everyone
                      quiet!

            And EVERYTHING stops. Fitch moves to Jesse:

                                FITCH
                      A what?

                                JESSE
                      A hit list. There's much as twelve. Might
                      be one or two less now, I ain't sure.
                      Some could've already been gotten.

                                JESSE
                      Different reasons. It ain't so much why
                      or what they done that matters. Pick any
                      one of 'em off that list, AB puts you on
                      salary.

            Everyone is suddenly interested. Bud sees this.

                                JESSE
                      And you, sir, if I ain't mistaken...
                      You're Mr. Nokes, right?

            Agents part, revealing JOHN NOKES(50s), black, an emminent

                      Well, last time I seen it...you was
                      number two on that list.

            It's quiet. Nokes thinks. Then LAUGHS and approaches Jesse.

                      listened to these suits here, on who's

            Jesse is explosive under the low projection delivery and a
            CHILL falls over the room.

                      I'll sponsor him. Jesse's welfare will
                      come out of our budget. Anyone has
                      pending cases or leads for Jesse, see me.
                      I'll loan him out.

                      scope now. I'm here today because I want
                      to represent you exclusively. You need
                      someone lobbying at a state level, as
                      well as in Washington. My organization
                      can provide both. We've got contacts that
                      you don't have and other people can't
                      get. Now, I'm aware that you have
                      multiple businesses... However you need
                      one go-to guy, so that all your ventures
                      stay coordinated and all transactions and
                      contracts are realized. I am that person,
                      Mr. Adams. That's what I do.

            LUCIAN'S HAND lifts the cognac out of frame, drinks.

                                KIERSEY
                      What's this going to cost us?

                                MORRIS
                      As a retainer, I want an advance of three
                      hundred-fifty thousand, along with ten
                      percent of whatever economic benefit I
                      bring to this organization.

                                KIERSEY
                      Three-fifty? C'mon, Dick. That's out of
                      line.

                                MORRIS
                      If you want a quality global economic
                      plan, that's what you pay for-- 

                                LUCIAN O.S.
                      We'll give you two, Mr. Morris...That's
                      what it's worth.

            Morris goes suddenly silent, looks across at Lucian.

                                LUCIAN O.S.
                      The advance is a drop in the bucket. The
                      real money is the percentage. It's in
                      your interest to see it my way.

            Morris stares across the desk, several tense moments. Then:

                                MORRIS
                      You've got a deal.

            INT. LIVING ROOM, LUCIAN ADAMS' HOUSE - DAY

            Morris emerges from the office. He glances at Jesse, then
            shrugs on his coat and leaves... 

            Jesse looks back at the office doorway. FOLLOW Jesse in...

            INT. LUCIAN ADAM'S OFFICE

            ...past Kiersey, behind a massive desk in this impeccable
            room, we finally SEE LUCIAN ADAMS.

            Jesse is not invited to sit.

            Kiersey walks out and shuts the door... 

            ON LUCIAN

            he crosses slowly to a credenza, selects a clean shirt.

                                LUCIAN
                      You have a son now, right?

                                JESSE
                      Yeah...

            As he removes the shirt he's wearing, REVEAL tattoos: BLACK
            SUN on his back. GERMAN RUNES, SS BOLTS, HRUNGNIR'S HEART.
            And around his stomach, a belt of NORSE GODS with the words,
            "INVISIBLE EMPIRE." Prison tats, dark and aged.

                                LUCIAN

                                JESSE
                      I named him Ray.

            Lucian, no emotion, puts on a pressed dress shirt, fastens
            cuff-links.

                                LUCIAN

                      You've been a busy man, Jesse. More ways
                      than one.

                      Looks like you done just fine without me.
                      Business rollin' through the door.

            And Lucian finally turns; looks at Jesse, eyes measuring...

                                LUCIAN
                      Last I saw you, you asked for time. Time
                      to raise a family.
                      Time to straighten things out.

                      I gave you that time... Then safe jobs

                      they think it's niggers, gone widespread
                      on a hunt for pig's feet. But they all
                      professional. Burn jobs. Hot-weld oxygen.

                      respectable burglar could've done this.

            Jesse smiles slightly. They know each other well...

            ...When Lucian's smile suddenly drops. There's a flash of
            controlled anger across his face; and WE FEEL a curtain of
            tension fall heavily on the room.

                                LUCIAN
                      Jesse... With all the work you been
                      doin': Diamonds. Emeralds. A dozen safe

                      Where's the tribute to the greater cause?

            Jesse he pulls from his pocket, a tiny pouch. Sets it on the
            desk...

            He pours the contents into Lucian's palm: DIAMONDS and
            EMERALDS.

                                JESSE
                      Like I said, I just needed time.

            Lucian approaches the desk, opens the pouch: DIAMONDS and
            EMERALDS... A slow smile spreads across his face.

                                LUCIAN
                      Well, even prophets stumble once in a
                      while.

            Lucian embraces Jesse. Tight. Then, softly in his ear:

                                LUCIAN
                      It's a shame about your brother.

            As they part, their eyes meet. Something passes between

            I/E. JESSE'S TRUCK, TRAVELING - BACK ROAD - NIGHT

            Jesse at the wheel, glances nervously in the rearview. Lynn
            in the passenger seat, baby in her lap. They're driving under
            the cover of darkness... 

                                LYNN
                      I don't understand. Why do we have to
                      leave the state? You're not tellin' me
                      something. You're not tellin' me a lot.

            EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

            A twin-engine PLANE idylls. Lines of blue lights, strobe like
            rivers, air traffic above... And Bud, leaning against a
            nearby car with Shepard and Cobb.

            Jesse helps Lynn and the baby from his truck. Together, they
            walk toward the plane...

            Bud, watching from a distance, nods to Lynn.

            OUTSIDE THE PLANE

            Jesse and Lynn stare at each other. She's crying as he pulls
            her close, one arm around the baby. He says something to them
            we cannot hear...

            Then with the baby, Lynn boards her plane. An AGENT shuts the
            door. The engine SCREAMS to life, taking off...

                      front plus a job at four hundred a week.
                      That guarantees a hung jury with a push

                      There's pressure from Washington. They
                      send compliments for Jesse's work. But
                      our primary concern is that list. I need
                      names we can protect.

            AERIAL SHOT swooping along the HIGHWAY, then rising above the

            EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

            Closed for construction. A VAN arrives. A blinking barricade
            is pulled back, allowing entrance...

            Generators light the scene: A group of SHIITE MUSLIMS wait by
            a pair of idle FREIGHT TRUCKS. A crew of five AB SOLDIERS
            exit the van: Jesse, Catfish and Buzz among them.

            The door to one Freight truck rolls to the top, revealing a
            converted ASSAULT WEAPONRY SHOWCASE.

            Below covered scaffolding, both crews stand. Guns bulge
            through their coats. No talking. No sudden movement. 

            Shiites watch Jesse and Catfish examine the merchandise: SEMI
            AUTOMATICS, SHOTGUNS, CARBINES, SUB-MACHINE GUNS...

            Everyone looks at each other. Jesse acknowledges worth.

            Catfish pulls a large CANVAS BAG from the van, filled with
            cash. As he carries it toward a bench, a large Shiite (OMAR)
            reaches for the bag before Catfish can set it down... 

            ...Both men hold tight. Neither letting go. And there's a

            Catfish and Omar are eye-to-eye. Then, Catfish lets go with a

                      No problem. Money's all there.

            Omar hands the bag to Naseem. The count starts. Both crews
            watch closely...  

            ...All except Catfish, fixated on Omar, who stares back.

                                CATFISH
                      'The fuck you lookin' at...?

            The count stops. Naseem looks to Omar. Questions in Arabic go
            back and forth. The pressure getting to the group...

            SUDDENLY ARC LIGHTS BEHIND A DISTANT BARRIER IGNITE, flooding
            the scene. Everyone turns.

                                A VOICE

            Omar reaches for the bag of cash...

            BLAM! Catfish FIRES, point blank, shooting Omar in the face.

            And World War III erupts.

            AB's FIRE. Shiites RETURN FIRE. From several stakeout
            locations, ATF AGENTS deploy and OPEN FIRE.

            Jesse is grazed in the shoulder, slips, staggers-runs.

            SHIITE #1 FIRES THREE SHOT BURSTS at AB #1, who's blown
            apart. A generator and ATF #1 collapse.

            ATF #2 and #3 with pump shotguns OPEN UP on the AB's van.

            Naseem, over a Mercedes roof, FIRES A BURST at ATF, then
            swings onto AB #2 and FIRES, killing him. Naseem jumps into
            the Mercedes, yells at the DRIVER to go.

            Buzz RAPID FIRES, hits Shiite #1 in the back. Shiite #1 is
            spun around and Buzz shoots him in the head.

            Catfish FIRES into the lot... Hitting SHIITE #2.

            IN THE MERCEDES, Driver floors it. ATF re-emerges, kneels and
            PUMPS SHOTS into the Mercedes.

            Jesse has taken off, past the lumber storage. Catfish and
            Buzz follow, breaking for the Freight truck.

            IN THE MERCEDES, Driver is blown apart by ATF. The car
            CRASHES into a dumpster, knocking Naseem out.

            Jesse, Catfish and Buzz jump into the Freight. ATF FIRES.
            WINDOWS EXPLODE. SHIITE #3, trying to climb in is shot down.

            Jesse, behind the wheel... BURNS rubber pulling out of the
            stop, over and through a scaffold, collapsing it.

            The Freight truck draws everyone's FIRE. Jesse pilots it
            through the CHAOS. Scaffold DRAGGING behind. Sparks fly.

            JESSE'S POV: Where he's going. An opening in the
            construction, leads back to the HIGHWAY and ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

            ATF CARS speeds in, the opposite way...

            AS THE VEHICLES PASS: JESSE AND ATF

            lock eyes. And the Freight makes the highway, scattering
            traffic, to the sound of ongoing GUNFIRE...

            tall grass, where a vacant BREAD TRUCK is waiting.

                      business with Muslims. So if stealing me
                      here in the middle of the night, is some
                      kind of accusation--

                                LUCIAN
                      I'm not accusing you, Mr. Morris. But I
                      do find it interesting that right about
                      the time I employ you, my operation
                      starts having problems.

                                MORRIS
                      Yes, but--

                                LUCIAN
                      That is interesting...isn't it?

            Morris swallows hard as Lucian stares intensely.

                                LUCIAN
                      I want to know if this was an isolated
                      incident. If the ATF impeding on my work
                      is the result of a deeper threat.

                                MORRIS
                      What are you suggesting?

                                LUCIAN
                      I'm suggesting you contact your friends
                      in Washington.

                                MORRIS
                      With all due respect, Mr. Adams, that's
                      not what I was retained for.

                                LUCIAN
                      Well now it is.

                                MORRIS
                      That sort of information requires
                      clearance I don't have. If I start
                      sniffing around, people are going to ask
                      questions.

                                LUCIAN
                      I'm asking questions, Mr. Morris. And I'm
                      getting impatient.

            Morris gets stone quiet. Lucian hands him a phone.

                                LUCIAN
                      You don't leave here till I get answers.

            And like that, this conversation is over.

            Off a deserted street. A DENSE FOG resides, far as the eye

            Emotion rises to Jesse's face. He holds it in, barely.

            a lone CAR is parked in the shadows, fog rolling past...

            He hangs up. 

            A LONG MOMENT... Jesse stands there, watching the car... He
            slowly makes his way toward the back of the store, where his
            truck is parked. Pulse pounding, he tries the door...it's
            locked. Eyeing the car, he unlocks his truck.   

            THERE'S SUDDEN MOVEMENT. Jesse spins. And out of the darkness
            -- steps Bud -- ready to pounce...

            Flashbulbs burst rapid-fire as coroner crews and police

            of his car, a plastic bag over his head filled with blood.  

            IN THE FOREGROUND, lit by police lights, is Bud and Cobb.

            Cobb proffers Morris' wallet. Bud sifts through cards --
            Several businesses, out of state -- Then stops cold at one:

            A BARE BULB comes to light. Mottled with fly excrement.

            Jesse unlocks and opens several SAMSONITE SUITCASES. Stacked
            in grey packing foam are rows and rows of GUNS.

            Shotgun. A Colt .357 Magnum. A Remington sawed-off with

            grimy mirror. He cuts off his hair. Then using clippers,
            shaves his scalp and mustache.

            EXT. HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT

            The front lights go out. A terrible darkness.

            INT. HALLWAY, HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT

            A door flies open. Jesse, eyes darting, pushes Long-Hair in.
            Bandaged hand clamped to the collar. Shotgun at the neck.

            They move down a dark hallway. SPEED METAL throbs, growing
            LOUDER... Long-Hair, gash gushing, leg crunches with each
            step... They turn another hallway... Light spills from under
            a door, shadows behind it... Jesse edges Long-Hair forward,
            reaches the doorway, creeps through...

            INT. BEDROOM

            The door swings wide on the room, REVEALING: Buzz, on the
            bed, furiously fucking a dark-haired HOOKER, over a bureau.

            As Long-Hair rounds the corner... Buzz looks up, SEES Jesse.
            Dives for a gun. CHROME FLASHES. Everything EXPLODES at once.   

            The WALL DETONATES and Buzz goes down. Shocked. Choking.
            Blood juts from his side. He tries to get up. Can't.

            The HOOKER SCREAMS and cowers terrified in the corner.

            Jesse pumps, aims through the haze and fires again. Stereo
            explodes. MUSIC CUTS OUT, plunging us into silence.

            Jesse tosses clothes to the Hooker.

                                JESSE
                      Get out.

            The Hooker does.

            INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

            Two chairs. Buzz and Long-Hair back to back. Hands and feet
            tied. Blood spigoting. Jesse circles them with the shotgun.

            The boat rocks gently.

                                JESSE
                      We got some shit to discuss.

            Buzz, to Jesse, unintimidated:

                                BUZZ
                      Ain't got nothin' to say to you, Wheeler.

                                LONG-HAIR
                          (top of his lungs)
                      I need a doctor! I need a fuckin' doctor!

            In one motion, Jesse racks the shotgun, thrusts the barrel to
            Long-Hair's chin AND BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF.

            Buzz screams, REARS UP, chair collapses beneath him, DRAGGING
            a dead Long-Hair along the floor, still tied together.

                                BUZZ
                      FUCK! FUCK! OH, FUCK!

                                JESSE
                      House call.

            Jesse YANKS Buzz up. His chair rocks upright, into place.

                                JESSE
                      Where's Lucian?!

                                BUZZ
                      I don't know!

            Jesse punctuates, shotgun butt against Buzz's head. Neck
            snaps. Teeth rattle.

                                BUZZ
                      NO ONE KNOWS WHERE LUCIAN IS! NO ONE
                      KNOWS-

            Jesse strikes again, connects. Buzz goes down in a heap, eyes
            swollen purple slits. His skull gushing red.

                                BUZZ
                      ...fuck...

            Jesse steps over Buzz, pins the shotgun to his jaw.

                                JESSE
                      Who killed my family?

                                BUZZ
                      Ah shit, man!

            Jesse shifts his aim an inch, pulls the trigger. SHOT REVERBS
            HARD. Buzz SCREAMS, hysteria. 

                                JESSE
                          (racks another shell)
                      WHO KILLED 'EM?! CATFISH?!

                                BUZZ
                      CATFISH, YES, YEAH! FUCKIN' CATFISH!

            Jesse puts down the shotgun. Pulls from his gym bag, two CANS
            OF GASOLINE, one of which, he splashes over Buzz's face.

                                BUZZ
                          (flinches)
                      The fuck is that?
                          (sniffs, realizes)
                      WAIT, WAIT! WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?!

            Jesse pours the rest over Buzz and the lifeless Long-Hair.

                                BUZZ
                          (thrashing)
                      NO! NO, NO, NO, DON'T!! DON'T!!

            As Buzz pleads for his life, Jesse unloads the shotgun, dead
            aim...FIRES.

            THE MUZZLE FLASH. GASOLINE IGNITES. BUZZ GOES UP IN FLAMES.

            Instantly, a FIRE ERUPTS. Buzz and Long-Hair's corpses BURN.

            Jesse empties the other can of gas, FEEDING THE FLAMES. THE
            FIRE SPREADS. BURNING THE WALLS. THE FLOOR AND CEILING.

            Jesse stands there, the heat reflects the intensity in his
            face. For a moment, it's a vision in hell.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. HOUSE BOAT, BAYOU GHOULA - PRE DAWN

            Engulfed in flames. SIRENS and LIGHTS as FIRE TRUCKS and FIRE
            BOATS douse the burning boat with hard water.

            Among a crowd of SPECTATORS, the shaken Hooker is being
            questioned by Marandino.

            Bud and Cobb stand apart. 

                                COBB
                      We've had a tap on Kiersey's line forty
                      eight hours now. It's clean. Whatever's
                      he's up to, Bud, it ain't comin' through
                      the front door.   

            Bud starts leaving the scene. Suddenly FITCH and two AGENTS
            barge forward.

                                FITCH
                      Carter! We need to talk.

                                BUD
                      While your agents build their cases and
                      set for court, he'll erase the debt owed
                      to all of you. Overnight.

                                FITCH
                      So you're implying I should thank him?

            Bud shakes his head in disgust, keeps walking...

                      you and I have to work together on this.
                      We entice Jesse back. I'll get him full
                      protection, if he agrees to testify. 

                                BUD

                      fire? To plant a flag. To let us know he
                      doesn't need our protection. Doesn't want
                      it. He would've just left 'em for dead.

                      balls big enough to relate to this guy.

                      in this situation. Jesse wouldn't be in

            Lynn stumbles through the woods, holding her baby. Scared.
            Lost. Their skin bleached-out. Eyes hollow. Like apparitions.

            We're in a dream. A sadistic enhancement.

            WIDEN to reveal Jesse before a cracked mirror in a SERVICE

            INT. CORRIDOR, COURTHOUSE - MORNING

            An expensively dressed Kiersey emerges from a courtroom,
            flanked by a pair of well dressed AIDES.

                      numbers on my desk by three pm.

            The Aides scurry down another corridor, as Kiersey exits the

            A RUSHING POV FROM BEHIND: Slams the trunk on Kiersey's hands.

            Kiersey SCREAMS, drops to his knees. His wrists wedged in the
            trunk. And standing over him...is Bud.

            Bud, on police radio, driving high-speed.

                                BUD
                      What do you got?

            INT. METRO OFFICE - SAME

            Bud's VOICE over speaker phone. Marandino on the line with a
            sheaf of paperwork. Cobb enters.

                                MARANDINO
                      He's in the French Quarter. All numbers
                      paging Kiersey between five and six p.m.,
                      the last seventy-two hours, are pay
                      phones within a three mile radius.

                                BUD
                      Alright.

                                COBB
                      Bud, you gotta talk to Braddock. He's
                      lookin' for you, he's fuckin' pissed. 

                                BUD
                      Hold him off. I'll square it with him
                      when I get to the Quarter. 

            Bud punches the gas, traveling 90 mph.

            INT. CATFISH'S HIDEOUT - DAY

            CATFISH'S EYES blink awake - pinpoint dilated. WIDEN TO
            REVEAL he's stripped to his boxers, tied to the lazy-boy.

            And Jesse is seated beside him.

                                JESSE
                      I'm gonna ask questions... 

            Jesse rolls a tattoo tray of various HARDWARE towards him:
            Needles. Rusted pliers. An electric tattoo drill.

                                JESSE
                      When I'm satisfied with your answers, I'm
                      gonna kill you. How long it takes and how
                      much blood you want to spill...that's up
                      to you.

            Catfish grins. A wide, Amphetamine smile.

                                CATFISH
                      What do you want to know? Want to hear
                      about your brother? How we had him shot
                      up with strychnine? How he died slow
                      death?

            Without warning, Jesse grabs the PLIERS. A flash of movement,
            and there's a TERRIBLE SCREAM AS CATFISH'S FRONT TOOTH IS
            RIPPED OUT. He bucks violently in his chair.

            Jesse jams the DRILL into Catfish's gums, high speed. BLOOD
            SPRAYS. Loud, electric pain and Catfish CRIES OUT IN TERROR.

            Jesse sets down the drill, deadpan.

                                CATFISH
                      OH, YOU SONOFABITCH!!!

                                JESSE
                      Four days ago, my wife and son were
                      killed.
                          (pause)
                      I hear you took the contract?

            Catfish smiles. Lips quivering with hate.

                                CATFISH
                      Forty-four pounds, Miznay-Schardin. Like
                      you taught me. Fuck yeah, I took it. Blew
                      your bitch and kid sky high.

            Jesse grabs the pliers, YANKS another tooth. Catfish HOWLS.

                                CATFISH
                      MOTHERFUCKER!!!

            BLOOD SPEWS as the drill digs in. Catfish SCREAMS. Jesse
            tosses teeth on the tray.

                                CATFISH
                          (thrashing wildly)
                      OH, YOU'RE GONNA DIE! YOU'RE GONNA
                      FUCKIN' DIE!

            Jesse grabs Catfish's rapidly swelling jaw and yanks hard.

                                JESSE
                      Where's Lucian?

            Jesse TIGHTENS his grip. Vice-like. Blood fills Catfish's
            mouth. He gurgles, then SPITS in Jesse's face... 

            ...FLASHES OF STEEL and two more teeth rip out at the root.
            Catfish SCREAMS then passes out. Jesse slaps him awake.

                                JESSE
                      Where's he hidin' out?

            Catfish, last ounce of spite, cracks a blackened grin: 

                                CATFISH
                      Get fucked.

            THE DRILL STRIKES. Bone deep. Gum line splays open. Teeth
            crack and split. Catfish SCREAMS UNCONTROLLABLY. Blacks out.

            Jesse stops. A brief reprieve. He gets up and looks around
            the apartment. SEES: Magazines. A few revolvers. Empty liquor
            bottles. Meth on the counter. And on the stove:  

            A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE. Beside a pie tin, speed base boiling.  

            Jesse stares. He lowers the syringe into the tin, plunger up,
            drawing fluid...

            ...then very deliberately sticks Catfish's arm with the tip
            of the needle, pops a cc.  

            Catfish bolts awake, EYES WIDE. A long, wet WHEEZE.

                                JESSE
                      Where's Lucian?

            Catfish's head lulls. Jesse grabs him by the hair. Leans in.

                                JESSE
                      Where's Lucian?

                                CATFISH

                      New Orleans. Where in New Orleans?

                                CATFISH
                      New Orleans...

            Jesse looks Catfish dead in the eyes. And death is there...
            Begging.

                                JESSE

                      I believe you.

            With that, Jesse pushes the plunger down...ever...so...slowly.

            Blood burps and bubbles from Catfish's throat. Lungs convulse
            and spasm. Eye go wide then roll back. A suicide dose. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            Then crosses the street to...

            A NEWSSTAND

            outside the liquor store. Bud buys cigarettes and a newspaper.

                      Lucian's entering the building...

            Bud pulls on a KEVLAR VEST, holsters a .45. Extra clips on

            Marandino, fastens on a vest, loads a 12-Gauge, locks.

            Suddenly, through the side window... A LONE FIGURE, IN A
            QUARTER TRENCH, MOVES PAST. It happens in a flash.

            He throws open a door to a BAR AREA.  

            AB #10 and #11 FIRE SMGs WILDLY, running from the room. Jesse
            UNLOADS the sawed-off. MISSING. Plaster throws and crumbles.

            A GUNSHOT rips through Jesse's left arm. The sawed-off drops
            to his side. Jesse turns - EDGAR BINGHAM is FIRING a SERVICE
            REVOLVER - SHOTS MISS as Jesse dives behind the bar.

            HAROLD KAY is moving down the stairwell. FIRING an Automatic
            wildly. Bottles and glasses explode.

            Bingham keeps firing. Mirrors SHATTER.

            BEHIND THE BAR

            bullets splinter wood, Jesse slams another magazine into the

            Jesse rises over the bar, FIRING BURSTS into Kay, who tumbles
            down the stairwell like a rag doll. 

            Bingham shoots Jesse in the hip. He staggers, then falls and
            rolls to his back... 

            Bingham rounds the bar just as Jesse, somehow, lifts the .45
            and FIRES two slugs into Bingham's chest.

            Bingham collapses on top of Jesse. The .45 hits the floor.

            Jesse, trapped under the heavy Bingham, pulls the buck knife
            from his holster and sinks it into Bingham's kidney. TWISTS.
            Blood POOLS. Bingham MOANS...

            ...Jesse rolls the big man over, hoists himself high and
            impales Bingham through the throat. Dead.

            Jesse exhales, struggles up...rising to his feet...

            BLAM! - A SUDDEN GUNSHOT

            out of nowhere. JESSE COLLAPSES, A BUNDLE OF TWITCHING
            NERVES, BLOOD POOLING FAST OUT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD...

            ...AND LUCIAN STANDS OVER HIM, HIS .357 SMOKING.

            Lucian turns slow. Toward a cracked MIRROR. Suddenly...

            IN THE REFLECTION: BUD EXPLODES DOWN THE STAIRS, AND SLAMS
            INTO LUCIAN WITH THE IMPACT OF A TRUCK. BOTH HIT THE FLOOR. 

            Lucian points his gun at Bud's head, who reaches for the
            trigger guard, shifts the barrel an inch -- A ROUND GOES OFF,
            BLOWING THROUGH BUD'S SHOULDER -- HE YELLS OUT, HOOKS HIS
            FINGER IN THE TRIGGER, STOPPING THE NEXT SHOT.

            Bud flips Lucian over, rips the gun away. Lucian tries to
            break free. Bud grabs him - smashes the gun over and over
            against Lucian's face.

            Lucian's head BOUNCES. Eyes roll, then right.

            Lucian quarter rolls, then CRACKS a forearm into Bud's head.
            Again, and Bud is knocked back with a gash over his eye. 

            Lucian REARS BACK and KICKS HARD into Bud's sternum.

            Lucian scrambles. Bud tackles him into a table, which goes
            down. A chair breaks. Bud lands a thunderous hook and
            Lucian's nose shatters. Another and his cheekbone caves.

            Lucian drops like a rock. Tries to crawl under another table.
            IN A MANIACAL RAGE, Bud flips the table and stomps down on
            Lucian with furious blows that come one after another.

            Lucian tries to cover up. BUD IS ALL OVER HIM. Grabs Lucian
            by the throat and presses down.

            Lucian, fighting to breathe, digs his nails into Bud's face,
            tearing skin. 

            Bud's face twists with hate as he chokes the life out of him.

            Lucian's eyes BULGE...His mouth stretches WIDE...clutching at
            Bud's fingers, trying to pull away...

            Bud SNORTS, tightens his grip... bearing down... And at the
            last moment, the cop in him reemerges...

            Bud lets go.

            Lucian rolls to his side and coughs up a thick ribbon of
            blood and vomit. Bud slams on restraints.

            Bud staggers to his feet...breathing hard...Spots Jesse on
            the floor...And he slows...

            Jesse lies in shadow. Perfectly still. We cannot see his face.
            Only the dark pool of blood around him.

            Lucian passes out.

                                BUD

                      I got him... I got Lucian.

            SLOWLY PULL AWAY AND TRACK OVER THE MASSACRE...

            ...as POLICE come in...over bodies and blood and guns, and up
            the stairs and out a broken window, to the CROWDS in the
            street held back by POLICE, past flashing lights and
            emergency vehicles... 

            ...to where life goes on in New Orleans.

            The sun is out. The sky above is clear.

            ON BUD, as he leads Lucian through the bowels of city lock-up. 

            Lucian - in prison garbs, haggard, dark bruises - looks up as
            they pass a two-way mirror of an INTERROGATION ROOM, SEES...

            KIERSEY

            ...seated, making statements to Shepard, who is taking notes.
            Stacks of Jesse's reports surround them.

            Bud walks Lucian past, into...

            INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2

            ...and Lucian sits at a table. Bud across from him. Silence
            hangs, several moments. 

            ON BUD                                                             

            starting again, knowing... There's something bigger. A slow
            smile spreads...
