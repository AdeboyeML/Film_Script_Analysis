		Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your

	In the vast, already full parking lot, we see Gladys

	Gladys pulls into a HANDICAPPED SPOT.  Servettes and 
	CAMERA stand outside the car.  Iris points at the sign.

		Oh, sweet Jesus, what a showdown this

	Amber fixes Mary's hair, carefully brushing her balding 
	head.  Mary smiles, oblivious.

		...Amber does my hair...once a week.

				AMBER
			(flattered and embarrassed)
		Well...it's the least I can do for the 
		reigning Mount Rose Junior Miss Amer--

	Amber pulls the brush away with a clump of Mary's hair 
	dangling from it.

				AMBER (cont'd)
		Oh God...

				MARY
		What?

				AMBER
		Huh?  Oh...Uh, just a little snarl...

		Beautiful... Maybe next week... a

				AMBER
		Yah... sure...

	Amber gives a kind but worried smile to camera.  
	Suddenly, Becky Leeman enters with a large box of 
	chocolates.  She's fully aware of the cameras from the 
	moment she enters.

				BECKY
		Hellooo, Little Mary Sunshine!
			(pretending to notice camera)
		What?!  Oh-oh my God!  Lights!  
		Camera!  And me without a stitch of

	She's in full make-up.

				AMBER
		What're you doin' here?

		Oh, Amber, like you're the only one

				MARY
			(to Becky)
		Who are you?

				BECKY
			(covering)
		"Who are you?!"  Oh Mary, you kill me.
			(to camera)
		She always says that.  It's a little 
		game we play.  Every week - same dippy 
		little look on her face.  "Who are you 
		- who are you?"  Just like that.
			(in Mary's face)
		It's me - Becky - and I brought your 
		favorites.

	Becky puts the chocolates on Mary's lap, a few spill.  
	Throughout the following, Mary slowly reaches for them as 
	if they're forbidden fruit and she's a very hungry Eve.

				AMBER
		How nice, Becky, she's anorexic.

	Becky roughly puts her hands over Mary's ears, who's now 
	gently petting the spilled chocolates in her lap.

		Curry taped inside.

	INT. EMBALMING ROOM - LATER

	She turns the picture over to reveal, "YOU'RE NEXT!"

	EXT. MOUNT ROSE - STREET

	TWIN OFFICERS lean against their car.  One prepares to 
	pack some snuff.

				TWIN OFFICER #1
		Oh-yah, helluva way to go, there.  
		After some extensive investigation, we 
		figure the Curry girl musta been 
		drivin' and smokin' and KABLEWEY!

				TWIN OFFICER #2
			(holding a Skoal tin)
		Not enough left of her to fill a tin.

	He puts a pinch between his cheek and gum.

	INT. EMBALMING ROOM - LATER

	A visibly upset Amber still applies make-up to Brett.

				AMBER
		Yah-sure, Tammy liked to driver her 
		dad's thresher - she said the heavy 
		vibration helped her think, y'know?  
		But I know for a fact she only smoked 
		after a good drive.  You ask me or 
		anyone else who isn't scared to talk 
		about it - Tammy was murdered.
			(holding back tears)
		God, I bet Diane Sawyer never had to 
		deal with crap like this...
			(to crew guy)
		Toss me "Caucasian #5," would ya?

	A crew guy walks IN FRAME and hands her a make-up jar.

		Man, I can't wait for fishin' 
		season...

	Mr. Larson bursts in, white as a corpse.

				MR. LARSON
		Amber...

				AMBER
		No, don't say it.  Another stray 
		bullet to the head.

	She adjusts Brett's red plaid hunting cap.

				AMBER (cont'd)
		I'm gonna need more caps.

				MR. LARSON
		You hafta go home.  There's some kinda 
		emergency at the trailer park.

				AMBER
		Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring

	She grabs the keys and RUNS OUT.

	EXT. TRAILER PARK STREET/INT. HEARSE - NIGHT

	Amber drives fast and furious as we come to what's left 
	of her trailer.  All the NEIGHBORS are out drinkin' 
	beers, eatin' food and watchin' the excitement.

				AMBER
		Oh my God - no!  Is my mom okay?  Was 
		she home?

	Hearse SCREECHES to a halt.  We hear a THUD, then MOANS 
	from in back.  Amber jumps out.  Camera follows, a la 
	"COPS."  It's pandemonium with fire trucks, neighbors, an 
	ambulance, etc.

				AMBER (cont'd)
		Mom!  Mom!?  MOMMMM!

	Loretta runs up to Amber as TWO FIREMEN approach.

				FIREMAN #1
		You family?

				LORETTA
		No, she's just screamin' "Mom, Mom!"

				AMBER
			(to Loretta)
		Is Mom okay?

				LORETTA
		She's alive, sweetie.

				AMBER
		Where is she?!

				LORETTA
		She's right over there.

	Camera pans over to see a semi-conscious Annette as they 
	load her stretcher into the ambulance, shut the doors and 
	start to pull away.  Amber runs after them.

				DOCTOR
		Oh you betcha, this was a doozy.  
		Right now, our chief concern is to 
		stabilize Annette, then, in surgery, 
		remove this here.

	Removing BANDAGE to reveal BEER CAN, still held in her

				AMBER
		Oh God, I'm dead...

	A candy striper approaches them.

				CANDY STRIPER
		Hey, lil' Miss Sad-pants and her

		nice cool mints to turn those frowns 
		upside-down. "S."

				LORETTA
			(to candy striper)
		D'ya think a nice cool mint'd help if 
		I shoved your head up your ass?

	Fear sweeps over the Candy Striper - she bolts down the 
	hall!  Loretta puts an arm around Amber and starts to 
	walk down the opposite direction.

				AMBER
		So, what do I say?

				LORETTA
		Simple.  Just say, "Mom, I know you 
		sacrificed everything - relationships, 
		dreams - your tummy, ass and thighs - 
		all to bring me into this world.  All 
		so I could have tap lessons and be in 
		the pageant - the same one you were 
		in.  But, y'know what?  I'm quittin'."

	Amber sits on the bed.  Annette grabs her shirt.

				AMBER (cont'd)
		Mom!

				ANNETTE
		I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me

				AMBER
			(deep breath)
		Okay.  Yesterday I...I got this

	SHOT THROUGH the window.  Amber paces around Annette's

		Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I-
		I'm not goin' through this again.

				ANNETTE
		You're not goin' through this again?  
		You?  You're not the one who knows how 
		Jiffy Pop feels.

				AMBER
		Oh, c'mon... First the picture of 
		Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this?  
		It's scary.

				ANNETTE
		Let me tell you "scary," Amber.  Look 
		at me.  Do you wanna look like you 
		been rode hard and put away wet at my 
		age?  I'm a "lifer" here.  Best I can 
		hope for is to end up in a descent

				AMBER
		That's it, I'm goin'...

				ANNETTE
		Honest to God, if I got to do it over?  
		I'd start walkin' outta this town the

		Practically the only thing I wouldn't

	Amber sits on the bed.

				AMBER
		God I hope that's you and not your

				ANNETTE
			(smiling)
		It's me...I just don't want this to be

		No.  Mom said if I did, she'd look up

				DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
		So has your mom kept your dad's life a 
		secret?

				AMBER
		No.  She never hid the fact that my

		Oh-yah.

	ON AMBER ATKINS

	with a MAP OF THE U.S. HEADDRESS, dances up to the mic.

				AMBER
		Living in a country where no matter 
		who you are or where you come from, 
		you can grow up and become what you've 
		always dreamed of, makes me, Amber 
		Atkins, proud to be an American!

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - MONTAGE

	ON MOLLY HOWARD

	wearing an Atomic Blast at Hiroshima Headdress.

				MOLLY
		Atomic power makes me, Molly Howard, 
		proud to be an Asian-American.

	As she steps away from the mic, Tess Weinhaus, wearing a 
	huge ball of twine headdress, dances up to the mic.

				TESS
		Uh, this, uh, my Uncle Phil's World's 
		Largest Ball of Twine, in Bundy 
		Minnesota, makes me, um, it makes me 
		proud I'm American - I kinda 
		misunderstood the assignment.

	The ball of twine falls to the floor and rolls off the 
	stage, still attached at one end to her head.

	BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM

	Pandemonium!  Contestants change into their "Physical 
	Fitness" outfits.  (T-shirts with red flags, shorts) 
	Civil Servettes try to help.  A LARGE PICTURE of Janelle 
	Betz sits at her counter space.

				IRIS
		Okay, okay!  Listen-up.  Coupla notes 
		from last night's dress rehearsal.
			(off clipboard)
		Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous 
		are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' 
		the "Physical Fitness" routine...

				AMBER
		Oh my God!  My-my tap costume's gone.

	Commotion stops.  Becky continues to get ready.

				IRIS
		Uh, Amber?  We're not puttin' on our 
		Talent costumes.  
		You need to put on your "Physical 
		Fitness" outfit.  And let's shake a 
		leg, ladies.

				AMBER
		No, wait.  It-it was here before the 
		openin' number...wait.  What am I 
		sayin'?  I should just ask you, Becky.  
		Where is it?

	Becky freezes, staring daggers at Amber.

				BECKY
		What?

				AMBER
		You heard me.  Where is it?

	The other contestants slowly clear a path between them.

				BECKY
		If you're gettin' at somethin', you 
		better just say it.

				AMBER
		I just did.

				BECKY
		Well then, you better be willin' to 
		back it up, kcause you're talkin' like 
		crazy.

	They start to slowly circle each other - a cat fight's 
	brewin'.

				AMBER
		Oh-oh, you bring me some of that 
		snotty attitude, Becky - bring it on.

				BECKY
		Well, as my mother says at Sunday 
		dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!

				AMBER
		Oh, I'll "get it."  I'll "get it" all 
		right.  I might even take seconds.

	They're moving ever closer...

				BECKY
		If you want seconds, then I'll make 
		sure it's hot enough for ya.

				AMBER
		Bitch!

				IRIS
			(stepping between them)
		Girls!  Girls!

				BECKY
		Give me your stringy-ass hair!

				AMBER
		I'll get you!

				CREW GUY (O.S.)
			(barely audible)
		Oh God, don't stop kem now...

				BECKY
		You're choking my, you fucking bitch!

				IRIS
			(putting hand over camera)
		Y'know, I-I don't think yous boys 
		should, uh, should be in here while 
		the girls are changin'.

				AMBER
		I hate her!

				IRIS
		We all do.  Now let's go.

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

	Gladys is center stage.

				GLADYS
		Yah-so how kbout a big round of 
		applause for last year's Mount Rose 
		American Teen Princess, in a farewell 
		performance.  Who could forget her lip-
		synching to "Don't Cry Out Loud," by 
		Melissa Manchester.  And here she is, 
		Mary Johanson!

	Applause!  Gladys exits.  TAPED MUSIC "It's My Turn."  A 
	NURSE pushes MARY JOHANSON out in her wheelchair, 
	complete with portable oxygen.  Mary wears a gigantic 
	black wig and silver gown which hangs off her boney body.  
	She moves her lips to the words as the nurse pushes her 
	emotionally around the stage.

	EXT. GYMNASIUM - HALLWAY

	Contestants, in "physical fitness" outfits, wait outside 
	the double doors, holding freshly painted red, white and 
	blue step ladders.  Becky and Amber stare at each other 
	from opposite ends of the line.

				IRIS
		All right, why don't we take up the 
		stepladders, all right?  For the 
		Physical Fitness number?

				BECKY
			(picking up her stool)
		They're wet.

				LISA
		Hey, my hands are stuck.

				MOLLY
			(sniffing)
		Uh, I'm kinda dizzy from the fumes.

				IRIS
		Well, hold kem away from you so it 
		doesn't get on the outfits.
			(turning to Servettes)
		What kinda mental retard paints step 
		ladders the morning of a pageant.

	ON STAGE

	Hank is being pulled off stage by Harold.  Gladys adjusts 
	her dress, frazzled.

				HANK
			(under throughout)
		Here come the judge - pinch, pinch - 
		here come the judge - pinch, pinch - 
		here come the judge...

				GLADYS
		Get back!  Get back, you total retard!

				LORETTA
		Go Hank!

				GLADYS
		I'm okay, I'm okay - dress is fine.  
		I'm okay...well, our other judges are 
		Jean Kangas and John Dough...

	EXT. GYMNASIUM - HALLWAY

	Iris and Servettes go in the gym as Chloris Klinghagen 
	comes out.

				CHLORIS
			(loud whisper)
		Opening number looked, uh, good.  
		Solid.  But now you're gonna have to 
		actually dance, so...
			(holds up jar of Vaseline)
		Here.  Put a dab of this on the old 
		choppers, ladies.  It'll help you 
		smile.  And when they're lookin' at 
		your teeth - God willin' - they won't 
		be lookin at your feet.

	Chloris gives Amber the jar and exits.  From the gym, we 
	hear TAPED PATRIOTIC MUSIC.  Contestants CHEER and run 
	in.

	"PHYSICAL FITNESS" ROUTINE - PATRIOTIC MUSIC

	As cuts of patriotic dance moves progress, the girls have 
	more and more red, white and blue paint smeared on their 
	clothes, arms and legs.

	Amber's clearly the best.

	Taped music ENDS.  Contestants, covered with paint, 
	strike a final pose - sitting on ladders, standing, 
	kneeling.  Applause.

	BACKSTAGE - WALKWAY

	Contestants wait anxiously as they pass a can of 
	TURPENTINE and a RAG to remove paint from their arms and 
	legs.

				BECKY
		Hurry up.

				LESLIE
		Okay, guys, I think we all got some.  
		You just take it off.

				AMBER
		Here, I didn't get any.

				LESLIE
		Here, have some.

				MICHELLE
		Hand me another white one.

				LISA
		Listen, you guys, don't go int the 
		bathroom.  Tess blew chunks all over. 
		Man, she ate a big dinner.

				BECKY
		Maybe she shoulda shoved that lucky 
		bolt down her throat for desert.

	Becky storms off.

				AMBER
			(sotto, to other girls)
		And the winner of the "Spirit" award 
		goes to...

	Girls laugh quietly.  Iris pulls a dazed and confused 
	Tess - beg wet spot on her shirt - through the shot.

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

	Iris stands center stage, awkwardly holding the mic.

				IRIS
			(reading from notecard)
		"I'd like to take you back seventeen 
		years, when a peanut farmer was in the 
		White House, a group-a boys callin' 
		themselves kQueen' topped the record 
		charts and Gladys Leeman was Gladys 
		Wood and she was Mount Rose American 
		Teen Princess!"

	Gladys enters wearing sash, tiara and plaid culottes.  
	Applause.  A SLIDE is shown of her at 17.

				GLADYS
			(taking mic)
		Thank you, thank you.  You know, I won 
		the talent contest by sewing these 
		culottes, Butterick pattern 7-4-3-2.  
		Can you believe it?  They still fit!

				LORETTA
		She had a big ass then, she's got a 
		big ass now.

				GLADYS
			(pausing for applause)
		Thank you, thank you.  
		Our next eontestant is ready, so let's 
		welcome her: Tess Weinhaus!

	APPLAUSE.  Tess is pushed on stage.

	BACKSTAGE - LEFT

	Amber paces.  ON STAGE Tess drones on at the mic.

				TESS
			(in the b.g. throughout)
		The beagle is known for it's howl.  
		"Aaauuuuuhhhh."  The Pekinese has it's 
		own distinctive bark.  "Yip, yip, 
		yip."  Not to be confused with the 
		Chihuahua's, "Yap, yap, yap."  But 
		none can compare to the greatest bark 
		of all - the German Shepherd...

				AMBER
			(to camera, loud whisper)
		...Yah-it's just gone...
			(eyes welling up)
		I mean, I-I just wanna tap, y'know?  
		I'm not sayin' I'm the best, or that 
		I'd even win, but shouldn't I at least 
		get a chance to compete?
			(starting to sob)
		I just wanted my Mom to see me dance.

	CHLORIS KLINGHAGEN enters, small bag in hand.

				CHLORIS
			(loud whisper)
		Amber - Amber, c'mere.

				AMBER
		Please, Mrs. K, I got so much Vaseline 
		on my teeth, I'm gonna be smilin' for 
		a year.

				CHLORIS
		No.  Here.

	Chloris pulls a simple BLACK LEOTARD from the bag.

				CHLORIS (cont'd)
		It's nothin' special, but talent like 
		yours doesn't need to hide behind 
		sequins.

				AMBER
		Mrs. K--

				CHLORIS
		You're... you're special and... Ah 
		hell, go out there and kick some 
		Leeman ass.

	Amber, overcome with joy, gives her a big hug.

				CHLORIS (cont'd)
		Not so hard, sweetie.  I heard 
		somethin' snap...

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

	ON STAGE: Leslie Miller, in uniform, performs an 
	amazingly sexy cheer as TWO SINGLET-CLAD WRESTLERS 
	wrestle (One is boyfriend, Pat.).

				LESLIE
		Roll him over --
			(clap, clap, clap)
		Lay him flat
			(clap, clap, clap)
		Pin his shoulders
			(clap, clap, clap)
		To the mat
			(clap, clap, clap)
		Roll him over, lay him flat, pin his 
		shoulders, to the mat!  Yeahhhh!

	She JUMPS, KICKS and ends with SPLITS.  APPLAUSE!

								JUMP CUT TO:

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - LATER

	Michelle Johanson is on stage, sitting on a stool, 
	wearing all black.  She smiles warmly.  Then, with one 
	sweep of her hand across her face, her smile drops.  
	She's dead serious.

				MICHELLE
			(without emotion)
		Fade in...Earth.  The year is two-
		thousand twenty-four.  The question on 
		everyone's mind:  What is...Soylent 
		Green?

	She sweeps her hand back across her face and she's "in 
	character," pained, near death, and overly dramatic.

	BACKSTAGE - LEFT - CONTINUOUS

	Amber, now in the leotard, talks to Iris.  Michelle 
	performs from "Soylent Green" in the b.g.

				AMBER
			(loud whisper)
		Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to 
		me?  Why're you pretendin' you don't 
		know what's goin' on?

				IRIS
		Amber, I'm sorry.  I really am.  But 
		you know the rules.  All talent 
		costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys 
		before the pageant.

				AMBER
		But, doesn't someone taking your 
		costume so you can't compete, overrule 
		that rule?

				IRIS
		Sorry.  I-I don't make the rules.

				AMBER
		This, this... This is bullshit!

				IRIS
		Amber Atkins!  That is not American 
		Teen Princess language!

				AMBER
		Good, kcause this isn't an American 
		Teen Princess Pageant - it's, it's 
		Nazi Germany!

	Amber storms off.

				IRIS
			(shaking head)
		Where do they get this stuff...

	INT. BACKSTAGE

	CAMERA FOLLOWS AMBER as she storms over to BACKSTAGE - 
	RIGHT where Gladys watches Michelle ON STAGE.

				AMBER
		Mrs. Leeman?

				GLADYS
			(turning)
		Huh?

				AMBER
		I-I'm wearin' this costume.  I'm, uh, 
		I'm gonna do my talent tonight.

				GLADYS
		Oh really - I don't think so.
			(suddenly aware of camera)
		Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of 
		bad news, but rules state that a 
		costume must be okay'd at least a week 
		in advance.  And this...
			(pointing to costume)
		This is why we have the rule.  My 
		goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a 
		neckline this low on stage.  We have 
		kids in the audience.

				AMBER
		But, you - I mean... It's not my 
		fault.  I-I... Please?  I didn't do 
		anything wrong...

	Amber starts to cry.

				MICHELLE
			(climaxing)
		That's why... I must say...
			(raising arm upward)
		Soylent Green... is... people.

	She doubles over.  She's given it all.  APPLAUSE.

				GLADYS
		Oops, that's my cue.

	Gladys starts out on stage as Molly Howard, dressed like 
	a red, white and blue cowboy, runs up next to Amber.  
	She's twirling toy guns on her fingers.

				MOLLY
		Wish me luck.

				AMBER
			(drying her eyes)
		Good luck, Molly.

	One of Molly's guns flies off her finger.  She goes to 
	retrieve it.

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

	Molly is line dancing, occasionally taking "pretend" 
	shots into the air.  It's incredibly repetitive and dull.

	BACKSTAGE - CARL'S "LIGHT AND SOUND" BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

	As Billy Ray Cyrus' "Achy Breaky Heart" PLAYS in b.g., 
	Carl, the janitor, sets plastic army figures on fire with 
	a cigarette lighter.

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

	Gladys is center stage.  Molly Howard walks off crying, 
	having just finished her routine.  POLITE APPLAUSE.  
	She's still spinning her guns, again one goes flying.

				GLADYS
		Thank you, Molly.

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL/STAIRWELL - DRESSING AREA

	Lisa, top hat, tails, giant "I LOVE NY" button - and 
	others try to console a CRYING Amber.  Becky continues 
	singing O.S.

				LISA
			(arm around Amber)
		Oh, Amber...

				AMBER
			(can't catch breath)
		I-I-I-I-I-, j-uh-j-uh-just wanted to 
		compe-e-e-e-ete.

				LISA
		I can't believe this is happenin'.  I 
		can't believe she said you couldn't...

	Getting an idea, Lisa starts to take off her jacket.

				LISA (cont'd)
		Amber?  Here.

				AMBER
			(still sobbing)
		"Here," wh-wh-what?

				LISA
		My jacket.  Take it kcause, y'know, I 
		got my costume okay'd before the 
		pageant.  You can wear it.

				MICHELLE
		Oh man, Lisa, I wouldn't do this.

				LESLIE
			(to Lisa)
		They're never gonna let you perform 
		naked.  I asked.

				LISA
		Shut up, yous guys.  Look, Amber, I'm 
		not gonna win.  And let's be honest, a 
		family only needs one "Liza" and you 
		know Peter's got much better legs than 
		me.

				AMBER
		Your parents'd kill you.

				LISA
		Oh c'mon, I love kem, but you know 
		they only had me kcause Peter needed a 
		kidney.

				AMBER
		Lis, I want to, I really do, but... 
		Oh, I can't.

				LISA
		Then do it for Peter.  Mrs. Leeman 
		used to call him a "skinny little fag" 
		when he'd bag her groceries.  He'd pop 
		his Nancy-belt if his old jacket 
		somehow, I don't know, got her back.

				AMBER
		Yah?

				LISA
		Oh-you-beccha.

	Amber hugs her and takes the jacket.

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - STAGE

	Gladys guides Molly off the stage.

				GLADYS
		Now, it's with overwhelming pride that 
		I introduce contestant number six, who 
		also happens to be president of her 
		class - two years running - a member 
		of the honor roll and the new 
		President of the Lutheran Sisterhood 
		Gun Club - Rebecca Ann Leeman!

	STAGE GOES BLACK.  SPOT HITS BECKY, who sits at the edge 
	of the stage, holding a mic.  She's head to toe sequins 
	in her poodle skirt, sweater, saddle shoes, etc. 

				BECKY
			(talking over music)
		I don't know how many of you know 
		this, but I've got a very special 
		fella in my life - that's right, I 
		do... And if nobody minds, I'd like to 
		sing a little song, just for him.

	SPOT FOLLOWS as Becky stands and walks center stage to 
	what appears to be a COVERED MANNEQUIN.  TAPED INTRO TO 
	"I Can't Take My Eyes Off You."

				BECKY (cont'd)
		You're just too good to be true.  
		Can't take my eyes off of you.  You'd 
		be like Heaven to touch.  I wanna hold 
		you so much.  At long last love has 
		arrived and I thank God I'm alive.  

	Becky removes the sheet, revealing a MANNEQUIN dressed 
	like JESUS as he appeared on the cross: long hair, beard, 
	crown of thorns, loincloth.  The ARMS ARE STUFFED so they 
	move freely.  (Hands of stigmata.)

				BECKY (cont'd)
		You're just to good to be true.  Can't 
		take my eyes off of you...

	Becky TALK-SINGS - a la William Shatner's "Rocket Man" - 
	and DANCES around the Jesus mannequin doing the jitter-
	bug, the twist and a slow dance (his arms on her 
	shoulders).

	DURING THE SLOW DANCE, THE LOIN CLOTH SLIPS AND BECKY 
	MUST HOLD IT UP - GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF GRABBING HIS 
	CROTCH.

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - BACKSTAGE

	Iris approaches Lisa who's given her outfit to Amber.

				IRIS
		C'mon, Lisa.  You're up next.

				LISA
		I quit.  And, uh, since my costume, 
		y'know, was okay'd a month ago?  I'm 
		givin' it to Amber.

	Amber breaks a smile.

	Taped music ENDS.  APPLAUSE.  Gladys, mic in hand, joins 
	Becky for a big hug.

				GLADYS
		Boy, I'd hate to follow that.  Wow!

	Becky exits, pulling the wheeled Jesus behind her.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		Voice of an angel, that one.

	Iris runs self-consciously out on stage, whispers in 
	Gladys' ear, then runs back off stage.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		...Uh, I was just told that contestant 
		number seven, Lisa Swenson, has quite 
		the pageant.

	CROWD REACTS.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		Well, these things happen.  At any 
		rate, we still have one more 
		contestant - number eight, Amber 
		Atkins.

	Gladys exits.  A taped hip, hot DRUM BEAT starts.  
	Suddenly, Amber glides into CENTER SPOT.  (Now wearing 
	Lisa's costume, sleeves rolled up.)  Her feet burst into 
	an amazing routine.  The loud drum beats seem to fly from 
	her hands and feet as they punctuate the rhythm.  There's 
	no glitz, just unbelievable skill.  It appears effortless 
	as she floats around stage.  Like watching Michael 
	Jackson moon walk for the first time, you can't take your 
	eyes off her.  She concludes, center stage, with the 
	GREATEST THIRTY SECONDS OF HER LIFE.  The audience goes 
	WILD!  Amber takes bow after bow - they love her.  Gladys 
	enters quickly, mic in hand.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		Okay, okay, okay!  Well, now, it's 
		finally time to say good-bye to our 
		judges, so they can go make the 
		toughest decision of their lives.

	PAN TO JUDGES.  They look nervous as hell.  A relaxed 
	Hank sniffs from a paint soaked bag.

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS ROOM - NIGHT

	Judges stare nervously at the camera - clip boards in 
	front of them.  Hank's LOUD BREATHING from the paint 
	soaked bag is obviously getting on John's nerves.

				DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
		So who get's the crown?  How are you 
		going to figure this all out?

				JOHN
		Uh, we're gonna, y'know, compare 
		scores and uh, figure out a-a winner.  
		kCause we don't know the winner yet... 
		I mean, I-I don't know who Jean and 
		Harold picked.  No idea.  Did Gladys 
		send you in here?

				HANK
		I know the winner!  I know the winner!  
		I know the winner!

				JOHN
		No you don't!  Shut your goddamn 
		mouth, you son-of-a-bitch!!

	Nerves shot, John suddenly LAUNCHES himself across the 
	table at Hank.

				HAROLD
		Wait a second.

				JOHN
		You shut it!  You goddamn retard!

	Hank freezes, then starts to wail!

				HANK
		EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!

				HAROLD
		Come on!  Hankey here can't help it if 
		he was born crazier than a shithouse 
		rat!

	Hank stops crying and goes back to the bag.

				JOHN
		For fuck's sake, why didn't ya leave 
		him with a sitter?

	Hank begins crying again.

				HAROLD
		Real nice.  You know the sitter's 
		dead.

								DISSOLVE TO:

		Oh -- the blow to her head made her

	make-up.

				BECKY

		Oh, good Lord!  What're they doin'?  
		Lettin' the retard count votes?!

	Contestants stare at her in shock.  Iris enters.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		And the First Runner-up is -

		Contestant number eight, Amber Atkins.

	Ad-lib audience shock and disbelief.  Contestants are 
	stunned.  Amber steps forward, humbly takes the trophy 
	and stands beside Leslie.  Audience finally quiets.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		And finally, the moment I know I've 
		been waiting for...

	Iris hands Gladys a LARGE TROPHY and envelope.  Mary 
	Johanson is wheeled out wearing sash and tiara.

		Diane Sawyer...

	Loretta puts her arm around Amber.  They walk off as 
	Leslie and Pat approach.

				LESLIE
		Hey-hey, I'm Second Runner-up!  Whooo!  
		I got second place!

				PAT
		Third.

				LESLIE
		Huh?

	Lisa passes by with her parents.  They look pissed.

				LISA
		No, it was worth it.  Amber shoulda 
		won.

				LISA'S FATHER
		I'll tell ya one thing.  Peter never 
		woulda pulled a shenanigan like that.

				LISA
		Well, y'know what, dad?  Y'know what?  
		Peter's gay!

	She runs off.  Her parents stop DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS.

				LISA'S FATHER
		What?!

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON BECKY'S FACE.  Flashes illuminate it.  With each 
	photo she changes her smile and expression.  She loves 
	this.

	PULL BACK to reveal two older men, with old-style news 
	cameras, flash pictures.

				DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
		So, how does it feel to be the new 
		Mount Rose American Teen Princess, 
		Becky?

	OLDER MEN turn and look at camera, then take out a pen 
	and note pad.

				BECKY
		Well, it's all happenin' so fast.  
		Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems 
		real, y'know?  I mean, I won!  I'm the 
		winner!  I'm going to State!

				GLADYS
		She's the winner and we're going to 
		state.

	INT. MOUNT ROSE HIGH - GIRL'S BATHROOM - DAY

	Fry Girl #1 and Pregnant Fry Girl smoke.

				FRY GIRL #1
		What a surprise.  Gladys Leeman's 
		finally gonna go to State.  
		And she'll probably ride on Becky's 
		ass all the way to Nationals, too.

				PREGNANT FRY GIRL
		I wonder how she's gonna fix that one. 

				DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
		Are you ladies going to the parade 
		tomorrow?

				PREGNANT FRY GIRL
		Nah.  I think I'm like, due or 
		somethin'.

	MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - NEXT DAY

	Beautiful sunny day.  Lester talks to camera.

				LESTER
		Ahhh.  Beautiful as a whore's ass 
		today.  Eh, boys?

	In the b.g., Gladys holds a bullhorn, clipboard and 
	points to a LARGE SWAN FLOAT.

				GLADYS
			(into bullhorn)
		Hey!  Turn that float around.  You 
		think a swan's gonna swim ass first up 
		Main Street?

				LESTER
		Yah-Gladys had me order that swan 
		special made from Mexico (Me'hee'koe) 
		in case Becky won.  I do a lotta 
		business with those people.  I always 
		offer to pay kem in tacos.
			(laughing)
		Whoo, they love that.

	EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

	Entire town lines the road.  The Mayor and the Leman 
	family stand behind the red ribbon.  Parade PARTICIPANTS 
	are lined up behind them.

				MAYOR
			(into bullhorn)
		Yah-hello-hello...shit!  How the fuck 
		do ya work this damn thing, huh?  Oh.  
		Welcome to our first ever American 
		Teen Princess Parade - which also 
		happens to be the unveiling of our new 
		sewer system!

	CHEERS!  Becky cuts the ribbon.  More CHEERS!

				MAYOR (cont'd)
		Yah-so, while Becky gets on her float, 
		then, any questions kbout the new 
		sewer?  Yah, Clem?

								JUMP CUT TO:

	EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

	THE PASSING PARADE:

	- THREE FAT VETS, dressed as the Revolutionary War trio, 
	hold American, Minnesota and POW/MIA flags.

	- TWO BATON TWIRLERS stand in front of the Mount Rose 
	High School Band.  They play - way off key.

	- JUDGES wave from a convertible.  Hank, in passenger's 
	seat, struggles to get out.  His seatbelt prevents it.

	- TWO GRUNGY OLD CLOWNS smoke impatiently.

	- TWO FAT WHITE MEN, dressed as Indians, sit on scooters.

	- FAT MAN drives a riding lawnmower, pulling a flatbed 
	with A SPEEDBOAT and a FISHING CAMP GROUP.

	- FARMER pulls a goat with a sign: "Milk Me for $1.00"

	- A BRIGADE of tap dancing BASSOONISTS.

	EXT. MOUNT ROSE - STREET

	Harold and Hank pull over and park their truck.  Harold 
	quickly gets out, obviously in a hurry, slamming on a 
	pouting Hank.

				HAROLD
		Let's get this straight right now.  We 
		wouldn't have been late at all if it 
		wasn't for you. 

				HANK
		I want to have the big bag of little 
		donuts.

				HAROLD
		You get nothing, Hank, okay?

				HANK
		I want to get the big bag of little 
		donuts.

				HAROLD
		There's your paint can.  The next time 
		you drink window cleaner, I'm just 
		gonna leave it in ya.

	Harold rushes off for the parade, joining other folks 
	carrying baskets, lawn chairs and flags on the sidewalk.  

								JUMP CUT TO:

	EXT. MOUNT ROSE STREET - BACK TO DOCUMENTARY CAMERA

	PAN OVER to see Gladys helping Becky climb on the swan, 
	unaware of camera.  In b.g., DOCUMENTARY CREW interviews 
	Amber and Leslie on their convertible behind the swan 
	float.

				GLADYS
		C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it.  Now 
		get up there.  Ride it side-saddle if 
		you have to - like a horse.  C'mon, 
		now.

				BECKY
		It smells funny.  Like gasoline.

				GLADYS
		Oh for chrissakes, everything smells 
		like that in Mexico.

				BECKY
		My dress'll reek.

				GLADYS
		Listen, little missy, this cost your 
		dad a pretty penny.  Now get your ass 
		up there and show me some teeth.

	EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

	Amber and Leslie, in gowns, look unhappy as they stare 
	straight ahead, exhaust fumes - that appear to come from 
	the swan's ass - cover them and their old convertible.

				LESLIE
		Amber, if I die from these fumes, will 
		you be sure to cover the hickies on my 
		neck?

				AMBER
		Yeah...

				LESLIE
		And the bite marks on my ears?

				AMBER
			(slowly turning)
		Yes...

				LESLIE
		I know it doesn't matter, but on my 
		inner thighs.

				AMBER
		Yes, Leslie!

	EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

	Hank rubs his head, then angrily gets out of the truck, 
	SLAMMING THE DOOR ON ONE OF THE SUSPENDERS ON HIS 
	OVERALLS.  He starts to walk, but can't, eventually 
	leaning out from the truck - only moving his arms as if 
	walking.

	EXT. MOUNT ROSE SIDE STREET - LATER

	Hank, still stuck in the door, is being teased by a GROUP 
	OF KIDS who poke at him with flags and sticks.  ANOTHER 
	LITTLE KID taunts him with his cotton candy - keeping it 
	just out of his reach.  Hank bats at them like 
	Frankenstein and the torch wielding townsfolk.

	EXT. MOUNT ROSE SIDE STREET - LATER

	Hank, still stuck in the door, holds the little kid by 
	the back of the shirt in one hand and eats the kid's 
	cotton candy with the other.  The kid struggles to get 
	away.  A few BROKEN FLAGS are scattered on the ground.

				HANK
		Help...Hank!  Help...Hank!  
		Help...Hank!  Help...Hank!

	ON SWAN FLOAT.  Gladys approaches.

				GLADYS
		Okay, I designed the float, you know.  
		And, what's gonna happen here is that 
		this is going to look like a 
		glistening lake beneath the swan.

				IRIS
		Uh, Gladys?

				GLADYS
		What!

				IRIS
		We need more bars!

				GLADYS
		This is -- what?

				IRIS
		Enid ate a whole pan!

				GLADYS
		I swear to God she can't do anything 
		by herself.

	EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

				AMBER
			(to camera)
		Oh-yah, this is exactly how I pictured 
		it.  Chokin' on swan gas.

	Suddenly, like a gasoline soaked pinata, it EXPLODES!

	Gladys is thrown back.  Flames.  Screaming.  PANDEMONIUM!  
	Becky doesn't have a chance.  She's a pink taffeta BALL 
	OF FIRE.  The swan's back eventually collapses taking 
	Becky into it's burning belly. 

	INTERCUT WITH MR. HOWARD'S VIDEO.

	Gladys watches in stunned silence as her daughter and 
	only chance at State go up in flames.  Suddenly, she 
	CRACKS!

				GLADYS
		Oh my God!  My Baby!  The swan ate my 
		baby!
			(grabbing at burning float)
		Ow-ow-ow!  Get up, Rebecca!  Get outta 
		there!  We've gotta go to State!  Oh 
		hot!
			(she scorches her blouse)
		Oh, damn.  I like this blouse.  
		Rebecca!  Get up, angel face.  Time to 
		go to State!  Ow-ow-ow!

	Eventually, Gladys tries to climb up on the float.  Iris 
	pulls her off.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		Get offa me, you cow!

	Gladys spins and notices the silent CROWD.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		What're you lookin' at?  Huh?  A whole 
		God Damn town of losers!  That's what 
		I'm lookin' at!

	Crowd reacts.  Gladys notices Amber and runs up to her 
	car.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		You!  You piece-a-shit trailer trash!  
		This shoulda been you!  Damn, I 
		shoulda killed you when I had the 

	The crows reacts again.  Gladys spins, noticing someone.  
	Lester approaches.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		Hey, Ted, sorry.  I didn't know your 
		family was in the garage when I set it 
		on fire!

				LESTER
		Gladys!  Stop it!

				GLADYS
		Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much 
		as it was a bake sale.  Ah-
		hahahahahahahaha!

	Lester tries to pull her away from the crowd.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		Let go-a-me, you old bastard!

	She grabs a BURNING 2X4 off a float and starts swinging 
	it.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		At least you've got another daughter.

	CROWD GASPS.  Then stunned SILENCE.  CAMERA CIRCLES 
	Gladys and Lester getting reaction shots of the crowd.

				LESTER
		So help me, Gladys.

				GLADYS
		Becky was my only shot at state!

				LESTER
		That's enough!

				GLADYS
		Let go!  Let go of me.  Oh my God, 
		it's COPS!

	TWIN OFFICERS, followed by "COPS" TV CREW, run up and 
	aggressively tackle Gladys.  As the struggle on the 
	ground continues, crew guys go over and shake hands with 
	the "COPS" crew - obviously knowing them.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
			(pointing to Lester)
		He sells reproductions!  His 
		furniture's as fake as my orgasms!

	The COPS crew begins to mingle with the DOCUMENTARY crew.

				SCOTT
		Hey, man, how're you doin'?

				DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
		Hi!  What's up, Scott?  You remember 
		Bruce, right?

				SCOTT
		Long time, no see.

				DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
		Bruce, that's Roy.
			(they shake hands)
		Roy, Bruce.

	EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

	Lovely hillside.  A PASTOR and TOWN FOLK - heads bowed - 
	stand beside a FRESH GRAVE.

				PASTOR
		That's why, dear Lord, it's with such 
		great sorrow that we turn over to you 
		a young woman whose dream of ridin' on 
		a giant swan brought about her 
		untimely death.  Maybe it's your way 
		of telling us to buy American.

	EXT. GRAVEYARD - LATER

	The funeral is over.  Amber, Loretta, Iris and Servettes 
	awkwardly face each other beside the grave.  Iris takes 
	the PARTIALLY MELTED TIARA from the headstone.

				IRIS
		As, uh, actin' President of the Mount 
		Rose Civil Servettes, it's my duty 
		since Becky can't fulfill her duties - 
		kcause she's dead-n-all - to make you 
		Mount Rose American Teen Princess.

	She puts the TIARA on AMBER.  Loretta FLASHES pictures.

				MALE REPORTER #1
		Turn around and let me see.

	EXT. GRAVEYARD - LATER

	Annette, Amber (wearing her tiara) and Loretta are 
	leaving the crowning ceremony.  All are happy as they 
	push an extremely drugged Annette out of the cemetery.

				LORETTA
		What is wrong with you?

				AMBER
		I don't know.  I just didn't wanna win 
		like this.

				LORETTA
		You stop right there.  You are a good 
		person.  Good things happen to good 
		people.

				AMBER
		Really?

				LORETTA
		No.  It's pure bullshit, sweetie.  
		You're lucky as hell, so you might as 
		well enjoy it.  Let's get you a root 
		beer float.

				AMBER
		Okay.

				LORETTA
		Do you guys want some shots?  I'm 
		buyin'.

	EXT. LORETTA'S TRAILER - DAY

	Amber sits on the picnic table.  In the b.g., Loretta 
	exits her trailer with a FED-EX GUY.  She pats his buns 
	as he exits.  She approaches Amber with a packet.

				AMBER (V.O.)
		I never liked her, but she didn't 
		deserve to die in the belly of a swan 
		like that.  The whole thing's just 
		kinda sad and lame at the same time.

				LORETTA
			(handing over packet)
		This came for you, sweetie.

				AMBER
		Ah!  It's from State!  Oh my God!

	Amber rips it open and holds up a color brochure with 
	COLLEEN and TERRY in a glamour shot on the cover.

				AMBER (cont'd)
			(paging through packet)
		It's all the stuff I get to do.  Oh my 
		God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get 
		a "personal consultation" with a make-
		up artist -- Eeeh!  Okay, um, there'll 
		be a choreographer to the stars and, 
		oh no -- No way.  Oh... My... God!

				LORETTA
		What?  For chrissakes, spit it out.

				AMBER
		I'll be stayin' overnight at... The 
		Airport Howard Johnsons!

				LORETTA
		Right by the airport - Oh, Amber...

				AMBER
		There's an indoor swimming pool!  
		Ahhhh!

	Loretta joins in the screaming.

				AMBER (cont'd)
		Oh crap - I only got four days.  I 
		gotta practice!

	EXT. LORETTA'S TRAILER - MORNING

	MONTAGE BEGINS over MUSIC.

	Amber emerges from Loretta's trailer, Pop Tart in mouth, 
	book bag in hand.  SMILES.  WAVES.

	EXT. TRAILER PARK

	Taps her way down the road, out of the trailer park.

	INT. CAFETERIA - MONTAGE

	Amber scrapes trays.  PAN DOWN.  She wears tap shoes, 
	practices her routine.

	INT. HOSPITAL - MONTAGE - DAY

	Amber walks around the room in high heels, balancing a 
	bedpan on her head.

	INT. MORTUARY - MONTAGE

	Amber dances around the room, using a suit on a hanger as 
	a partner.  A naked old man is on the embalming slab, a 
	sheet covering his nasties.

	EXT. LORETTA'S TRAILER - NIGHT

	In silhouette, Amber taps on the picnic table by the 
	light of the FULL HARVEST MOON.

								DIP TO BLACK:

	EXT. AIRPORT HOWARD JOHNSONS - DAY

	WHITE LETTERS ON BLACK: "STATE FINALS"

	We look up at the towering Howard Johnsons and see a huge 
	banner which reads: "WELCOME AMERICAN TEEN PRINCESS, 
	FRIED CLAM PLATTER $9.99." Suddenly, a 747, not more than 
	thirty feet above the hotel, flies over - the sound is 
	deafening.

				LORETTA
		All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."

				AMBER
		Airport Ho-Jo!

				LORETTA
		I got it!  Yeah, why don't ya take a 
 
	Mr. Larson unloads Amber's luggage from the hearse.  
	Loretta leans against it, arm around Amber, smoking and 
	occasionally flipping off people who stop to stare at 
	this unusual sight.

				AMBER
		Loretta, don't do that.

				LORETTA
		I'm sorry.  They're just starin'.

				AMBER
		I gotta work with these women.

				LORETTA
		Okay, sweetie, that's all right.  
		Let's go.  Let's go.

	INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA

	There's a fake tropical look, with loads of plastic 
	palms, etc.  CAMERA FOLLOWS Amber into area.  BANNER: 
	"STATE FINALS - SPONSORED BY THE MINNESOTA MODELING 
	ACADEMY" Contestants (25) sit at tables, they seem more 
	mature, more professional.  Amber smiles and gives a 
	little wave.  Terry approaches Amber.

				TERRY
		And you are...

				AMBER
		Mount Rose American Teen Princess.

				TERRY
		Funny, you don't look dead.

	INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA - MOMENTS LATER

	Colleen and Terry address the assembled contestants.

	SUPER: COLLEEN DOUGLAS AND TERRY MACEY - MINNESOTA 
	AMERICAN TEEN PRINCESS STATE BOARD AND OWNERS OF THE

				COLLEEN
		Okay ladies, listen up.  I'm Colleen

				TERRY
		I'm a mirror.

				COLLEEN
		Correction.  This spunky monkey on my

				TERRY
		We're also the co-founders of the 
		Minnesota Modeling Academy.  
		Applications are at the tiki bar.  
		We'll wave the fifty dollar 
		application fee if you list a friend 
		and put her address.

				COLLEEN
		That's right.

				TERRY
		Okay?

				COLLEEN
		Mm-hm.

	INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA

	Loretta, seated at the bar, puts her arm around a man 
	next to her.

				LORETTA
		So...you're cute.  Oh, I see you're 
		married.
			(to bartender)
		You catch this in your mouth, I'll 
		give you a present.  All right?  Open 
		wide...
			(she throws the olive)
		Oh, God, you got that on the first 
		try.  Come here.

	Loretta kisses the bartender.

				LORETTA (cont'd)
		You are cute.

	INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - COURTYARD STAGE AREA - DAY

				TERRY
		Due to budgetary cutbacks - and the 
		fact that Nationals didn't cough up a 
		damn nickel this year - you won't be 
		stayin' overnight.  So pay attention, 
		you've got about eight hours until 
		showtime.

	INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - STAGE AREA - DAY

	A DISCO BEAT POUNDS from a boom box.  Mr. Melchoir, the 
	choreographer, watches contestants move in fast-paced 
	crisscrossing formations.  Amber is among them.  Miss St. 
	Paul screws up.

				MR. MELCHOIR
		Remember to count, ladies.  Cross on 
		the left and arms up on eight!  On the 
		beat!  On the beat!  Keep on it!  Keep 
		movin' it!  C'mon, Miss Forest Lake, 
		take that stick out of your ass or I 
		will.  All right.  Very nice.  Now 
		come on, arms out.  We're in the front 
		row.  Come on, sell it!  That's very 
		nice.  Remember, figure eights, 
		ladies...

	INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA - MOMENTS LATER

	Colleen and Terry smoke and drink at a tall tiki table 
	that's covered with empties.  In the b.g., a pageant 
	worker passes out PINK BAGS to the contestants.  All the 
	while, TWO FAT KIDS play "Marco Polo" in the pool.

				COLLEEN
			(tipsy, holding up glass)
		I can sum up our entire philosophy 
		with this glass.  I look at it and 
		say, "it's half full."  Which, in the 
		beauty pageant biz means, "Where the 
		hell's my waiter!"

	She laughs hard, then spins around in her chair.

				COLLEEN (cont'd)
			(screaming)
		Stop with the fuckin' Marco-Polo 
		before I rip your fat little heads 
		off!

	INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - STAGE AREA - AUDIENCE CHAIRS

	A very mature Miss Burnsville talks to Amber who is 
	staring at Miss Burnsville's supernaturally well-
	supported chest.

				MR. MELCHOIR
		Miss Burnsville, you're up next...

								JUMP CUT TO:

	INT. STAGE AREA - AUDIENCE CHAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

	Amber sits addressing the camera.  Miss Burnsville is 
	gone.

				AMBER
		Don't tell anyone, but, I have a 
		little secret weapon of my own.

	Amber pulls out a jar of Vaseline from her purse and 
	smiles innocently.

	INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA - SHELLFISH BUFFET - DAY

	Contestants hungrily fill their plates with seafood.

	INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA - SHELLFISH BUFFET

	Amber stands beside the buffet, holding only a salad.

				AMBER
		I don't eat shellfish.  Mom always 
		says, "Don't ever eat nothin' that can 
		carry its house around with it - who 
		knows the last time it's been 
		cleaned."  She should know.

								JUMP CUT TO:

	INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA

	Amber eats at a tall tiki table with Miss Minneapolis.

				MISS MINNEAPOLIS
		... I've done about thirty-five 
		pageants.  I guess my most memorable 
		one'd have to be Miss Teen America, 
		1995.  It was in Vegas.  My roommate 
		did Adam West.

	SUPER: MR. WEST WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT

				MISS MINNEAPOLIS (cont'd)
		She said he was sooo horny.

	Amber stares at her with wide-eyed disbelief.

								JUMP CUT TO:

	INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - STAGE AREA - DAY

	Amber watches four contestants in a row practice their 
	talents.  All are equally amazing.  
	"THEME from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY" starts.  Miss 
	Minneapolis steps ON STAGE - silver unitard, silver 
	streamers, silver tap shoes.  She starts a TAP ROUTINE 
	that RIVALS AMBER'S.

				AMBER
			(whispering to camera)
		Oh my God.  Look at her, she's 
		awesome.  I should just go home now.

	Terry and Colleen stand in front of the stage.

				TERRY
		Okay, okay, that's enough - I get it.  

	SUDDENLY Miss Minneapolis FREEZES.

				MISS MINNEAPOLIS
		Oh - oh my God...

		I gotta go!

	She runs off toward the RESTROOM.

				COLLEEN
			(calling after her)
		Well, you're gonna have to do 
		somethin' with those nerves before 
		Nationals.  Thirty-million people 
		aren't gonna wait while you run to the

	Other waiting contestants suddenly double over, ad-
	libbing "oh no! oh my God!"  "I'm gonna puke!" etc.  More 
	contestants grab their bellies.
