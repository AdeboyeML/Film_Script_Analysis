          EXT. SAN DIEGO - DAY
                         
          It's another picture perfect day in San Diego. The beaches,
          golf courses, and yacht clubs are packed with hundreds of
          rapturous citizens.
                         
                         
          EXT. BUS STOP - DAY
                         
          A BUS pulls up and unloads it's passengers.
                         
          We follow ADAM SCHWARTZ(25), a kind faced, mild mannered,
          pragmatist - who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old
          man. He steps off the bus, crosses the street and approaches
          MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL.
                         
                         
          INT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          Adam enters the Hospital. The mood is calm. All the chaos one
          would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked
          away behind the sterile and monochrome walls.
                         
          Adam walks to the reception counter. The RECEPTIONIST is
          engrossed with the latest edition of US Weekly. She ignores
          Adam who just stands there awkwardly, unsure of what to do.
                         
          Adam gives out a small cough to grab her attention. The
          Receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine.
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST
           Can I help you?
                         
                          ADAM
           I have an appointment.

           Adam Schwartz.
                         
          The Receptionist says nothing. Adam stands silent, not
          knowing what to do. He coughs again.
                         
          Annoyed, the Receptionist looks up but says nothing.
           2.
                         
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
                          (CONFUSED)
           Um, am I supposed to go somewhere?
                         
          With her eyes the Receptionist points to the waiting area.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Oh, should I go sit?
                         
          The Receptionist rolls her eyes and returns to her magazine.
                         
          Adam looks around the empty waiting room. He takes a seat and
          browses through a dozen outdated magazines: Highlights, Time,
          Life, Modern Maternity, etc. Only moments later, as though he
          hadn't just introduced himself, the Receptionist calls out:
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST
           Adam Schwartz.
                         
          Adam looks around the waiting room. There's no one else
          there. Again the receptionist calls out again -
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
           Adam Schwartz.
                         
                          ADAM
           Yeah, that's me.
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST
           Follow me.
                         
          The Receptionist leads Adam to a small changing room and
          hands him a hospital gown.
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
           Put this on.
                         
                          ADAM
           Do I need to take off all my
           clothes?
                         
          The Receptionist stares blankly at Adam.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           I'll figure it out.
                         
          The Receptionist leaves. Adam awkwardly undresses and slips
          on the hospital gown. Unsure which end of the gown is the
          front, Adam adjusts the garment a few times until he decides
          he has it right.
                         
          Adam pulls back the curtain of the changing room to find
          JOANNE, an overly cheery nurse.
           3.

           to meet you.
                         
          Adam scratches his chest, the hospital gown is beginning to
          irritate his skin.
                         
                          ADAM
           You don't happen to have anything
           in a cotton blend?

           Cotton. You're funny.
                         
          Joanne hands Adam a giant specimen cup marked with a thick
          yellow line.
                         
           NURSE JOANNE (CONT'D)
           Now I'm going to need you to fill
           this cup with urine. You think you
           can do that?
                         
                          ADAM
           You want me to fill this entire
           cup.
                         
                          JOANNE
           Yup.
                         
          Adam looks down at the cup in total disbelief.
                         
                          ADAM
           It's gonna take me at least a week
           to fill this. Can I take it home?

                          (LAUGHS)
           Take it home. You're so funny.

          It's a gray morning as the thick spring fog slowly begins to
          lift. With no one in sight, the only sound that can be heard
          is that of the waves crashing onto the shoreline and then
          rolling back out to the Pacific Ocean.

          INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The interior of Adam's house is spotless. Pictures on the
          walls: Adam and his dad sailing. Adam and his parents at his
          Bar Mitzvah. Adam and his best friend, Seth, at High School
          Graduation. A University of Berkeley hat. A National Academic
          Achievement Award in the Sciences.
                         
          Curled in a fetal position, Adam sleeps peacefully next to
          RACHEL (25), his loving girlfriend. Cute, charming, and
          artsy, Rachel is "Winnie Cooper" all grown up.
                         
          The sound of the waves crashing stops abruptly. A loud
          obnoxious alarm clock goes off. Startled, Adam jumps up.
          Drenched in sweat, and completely disoriented, he looks
          around in confusion.

          After a moment, Adam pulls an earplug out of each ear, and
          turns off the alarm. The sound of the crashing waves turns
          back on. Adam pushes a button on the alarm clock and the
          sound of the waves stops, but the loud obnoxious alarm
          returns. He pushes the clock again. The alarm turns off but
          now we hear the sound of crickets chirping. Again Adam pushes
          a button, this time we hear the sound of a loud thunder/rain
          storm, he pushes a button again, this time we hear the sound
          of loud clanging church bells. Rachel rolls over -

           It won't turn off.
                         
          Frustrated, Adam tries pushing all the buttons. This only
          makes it worse. We hear ALL of the previous sounds
          simultaneously sound off. Rachel rolls over and moans as she
          puts a pillow over her head.

          Adam reaches down and unplugs the alarm clock, bringing an
          end to the noise. He sits for a moment at the edge of the
          bed, collects himself.
                         
          Adam looks down at Rachel and begins kissing her neck.

          Rachel gently strokes her fingers through Adam's hair.
          Something catches her attention - a single strand of hair.
          She holds it up.

          the finishing touches on the CRO MAGNON exhibit - it's an
          elaborate life sized diorama depicting the life of a family

          inside there's a large fire and decorative horse drawings on
          the walls. The MAN instructs his SON to paint as the WOMAN
          teaches her DAUGHTER to sew. We see Greg positioning the

           Yes, that is an option. But because
           the tumor has spread to a such
           significant size. Cutting it out
           now would be risky.

          seemingly genuine, his tone is anything but.

           worrying. Alright?

           And if you look over on your left
           you'll see our newest exhibit "The
           Last Days Pompeii." Buried in 79 AD
           by the catastrophic eruption of Mt.
           Vesuvius, Pompeii remained hidden
           and forgotten until 1748 when
           archeologists began to excavate the
           site. Here we see exquisitely
           preserved objects that offer a
           glimpse into the day-to-day life of
           this ancient city.

           probably looked like.
                         
          Adam's exhibit is a highly morbid depiction of Pompeii's
          final hours. The scene is total chaos. Ash flies through the
          air. Hot molten lava engulfs the town. Miniature men, women,
          and children run through the streets in horror. People are
          sacrificing whatever they can for the Gods. There's a wild
          orgy in the streets. And a giant TYRANNOSAURS REX model
          devours a villager.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)

           "You could hear women lamenting,
           children crying, men shouting.
           There were some so afraid of death
           that they prayed for death. Many
           raised their hands to the gods, and
           even more believed that there were
           no gods any longer, and that this
           was one unending night for the
           world."

          A door bell. A hand reaches out. A finger on that hand pushes
          the door bell. The other hand holds a bouquet of flowers.
                         
          The hand belongs to Mitch's wife, MARGARET (80). She stands
          on the porch of a small beach bungalow.
                         
          The front door opens. Margaret looks straight ahead. Nothing.
          She then looks down, startled by Adam in a wheelchair.

           You're Adam? The way Mitch

          Adam and Margaret enter the living room. Everyone's there:
          Edith, Art, Katie and Seth.
                         
          Seth and Katie are playing a video game: DUCK HUNT. Edith
          sets food on the table.

           This food's not going to eat
           itself.
                         
          Everyone makes their way to the table. Visibly weak, Adam
          slowly lifts himself out of the wheelchair. He yelps in pain.
          Katie starts to help when Seth intervenes.

          Seth grabs hold of Adam, and with his help, Adam takes a
          small step and then lowers himself into his seat at the
          table. Katie places a pillow behind Adam's back.
