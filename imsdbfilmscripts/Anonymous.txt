    The sidewalks are filled with theater-goers heading for
    their shows. Cabs line the streets.

    SIDE ALLEY

    A cab quickly turns into the alley, coming to a
    screeching halt. A Man in a Grey Suit jumps out and
    rushes to the side entrance of a theater.

    In the background we see that the title of the play,
    "Anonymous", is written on the theatre's marquee...

    The curtains are still closed, and the sound of the
    audience excitedly MURMURING behind them is heard. .

    Stagehands are moving stage lights as--

    A STAGE MANAGER

    takes a nervous peek through the curtains to check the
    audience-- it's a full house. He holds a prop umbrella
    in one hand, anxiously checks his watch in the other.

    He looks on both wings of the stage-- and then relief
    floods his face as he sees The Man in the Grey Suit
    hurrying over to him. The Stage Manager wordlessly
    hands him the umbrella and signals to a stagehand in
    the background.

    The curtains start to OPEN and the MURMUR of the
    audience dies down.

    The man with the umbrella stands on the empty stage, a
    single light on him. He is "PROLOGUE". (We will see
    the same actor later as the "Prologue" of Henry V).

    "Prologue" regards his audience for a   beat before:

                Soul of the Age!

                37 plays, 154 sonnets, and several
                epic poems that are collectively known
                as the ultimate expressions of
                humanity in the English language. And
                yet... And yet...
                       (beat)
                Not a single manuscript of any kind
                has ever been found written in
                Shakespeare's own hand. In four
                hundred years, not one document-- be
                it poem, play, diary or even a simple
                letter.

                He was born the son of a glove-maker,
                and at some unknown time, armed with
                but an elementary school education, he
                went to London where, the story goes,
                he became an actor and eventually a
                playwright.

    OFF STAGE

    A stagehand takes a wooden hammer and beats against a
    flat metal pate, creating the SOUNDS of THUNDER.

    Another stagehand starts to lift shutters in front of a
    stage light back and forth to create LIGHTNING STRIKES.

                He died at the age of 56, and was
                survived by his wife and two daughters
                who were, like Shakespeare's own
                father, irrefutably illiterate.

In the rafters a stagehand opens valves.   It starts to
RAIN.

                         PROLOGUE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
            His will famously left his second best
            bed to his widow. But it made no
            mention of a single book or
            manuscript.

The actor who will play "Ben JONSON" (mid 30's) appears
in the wings, bearded, ready to go on stage, holding a
prop leather manuscript. Behind him a group of
Elizabethan "soldiers" strap on their swords.

ON STAGE

"Prologue" continues, as do TITLES.

                         PROLOGUE (CONT'D)
            Is it possible Shakespeare owned no
            books at his death because... he could
            not read? That he wrote no letters
            because he, like his father before him
            and his children after him, could not
            write?
                   (lets that sink in, then)
            Our Shakespeare is a cypher, a ghost;
            his biography made not by history...
            but by conjecture. His story not
            written with facts, but with...
            imagination.

The rain has intensified. "Prologue" turns and the
camera starts to leave him and the TITLES END....

                         PROLOGUE (CONT'D)
                   (more energetic)
            So! Let me offer you a different
            story. A darker story... Of quills
            and swords. Of power and betrayal.
            Of a stage conquered, and a throne
            lost!

A FLASH OF LIGHTNING, and for a moment only sheets of
RAIN are visible. No stage, no "Prologue". Then,
trough the rain, we see a form of a man... Ben
Jonson... running. Then we make out the shapes of
houses... a street. We're not on a stage anymore. We
are:

     Jonson-- carrying the manuscript-- runs up the street
     toward a large circular theater.

     He frantically opens the wooden door to the theater--


7    INT. THE ROSE THEATER - NIGHT                                 7

     --and he quickly bolts it behind him, turns, and
     desperately looks for a place to hide. He runs towards
     the stage as--


8    EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            8

     About a dozen uniformed guards reach the door. They
     are led by Sir Richard POLE (40), Captain of the Guard.

                            POLE
               Break it down!

     And several of the guards charge the door with their
     pikes, HITTING it hard.

                            POLE (CONT'D)
               Again!

     Jonson hurries backstage, and disappears from our view
     just as--


10   EXT/INT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                    10

     --the guards SMASH the door open.    Pole is the first

               Jonson!   Jonson!!    Show yourself!

     The soldiers immediately spread out into different
     parts of the theater. Jonson's gone. Because--

     JONSON

     has moved under the stage silently scurrying like a rat
     trying to find a place to hide among the stacks of
     props and costumes (swords, masks, flags and banners,
     shields, barrels, canons, etc.) But Jonson freezes
     when he sees--

                                                               4

amongst them.

                          POLE (CONT'D)
            Out with you! Jonson! We'll smoke
            you out like a rat if we have to!

Nothing.    A beat, then--

            Torch it.

The soldier hesitates.

                          POLE (CONT'D)
            Torch it!   All of you!

The soldiers obey, lighting fire to the walls, the
galleries, the columns as--

JONSON

GASPS in horror. Desperate-- he spies an open metal
box nearby filled with un-used fireworks.

He tosses the fireworks out of the box-- and then
places the bound manuscripts in their place, then
closes the box. Then-- he grabs a nearby rapier as--

FLAMES

--begin to take hold everywhere: the columns at the
front of the stage... the trompe-l'oeil walls... the
seating galleries... the columns...

A TRAP DOOR

opens center-stage, and Jonson JUMPS out, the rapier in
his right hand, ready for a fight. But-- three
soldiers jump onto the stage, pikes ready.

Jonson-- no fool- turns and runs for the other end of
the stage-- but then runs smack into four other
soldiers!

Ballocks!

Jonson turns this way and that-- nowhere to run-- grins
wryly, drops his sword. Raises his hands in surrender.

     Jonson, his hands tied behind him, is pushed through
     the door, Pole following.

     A small crowd of actors, whores, etc., watch the
     theater burn. The guards have to push their way
     through them.

     INSERT

     The fire reaches the fireworks below the theater's
     stage, and--

     BACK TO SCENE

     -- the SOUND of fireworks EXPLODING makes Jonson turn
     and see:

     THE THEATER

     Timbers CRASH and fireworks EXPLODE over the theater.


12   EXT. THE THAMES RIVER - DAWN                             12

     A longboat carrying Jonson, Pole and the guards makes
     its way towards the Tower Of London.


13   INT. TOWER OF LONDON - AN INTERROGATION ROOM - DAWN      13

     Jonson is thrown into a chair, a guard on either side
     of him. It's dark-- the only light coming from a few
     torches in the walls, and a large fire pit at the far
     side of the room.

     An INTERROGATOR (30's) faces him.   Dressed all in
     black, he is wispy thin.

                            INTERROGATOR
               You are Benjamin Jonson, playwright?
               Son of William Jonson, glass-blower,
               son of James Jonson brick-layer?

     Jonson nods.

                            INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
               And have you ever been arrested
               before, Mr. Jonson?

                            JONSON
               I'm a writer, aren't I?   Of course
               I've bloody well been--

And a guard BACKHANDS Jonson on the face full force--
hard enough to send Jonson and the chair to the ground.
His nose starts to bleed.

As the Guards pull him up, the Interrogator looks
across the room-- there is someone else there, a
FIGURE, watching, but cloaked in the darkness.

Jonson notices the figure as well.      We hear a voice
from the darkness.

                          FIGURE
             Ask him about the plays.

                            JONSON

             Plays?
                    (to the Figure)
             Which would you prefer, my lord? A
             pastoral? An historical? An
             historical-pastoral, or an hysterical
             historical pastoral--

And SMACK!    He's hit by the guards again.   He SPITS out
a tooth.

                          INTERROGATOR

             Jonson. We are interested in the
             plays given to you by Edward de Vere,
             Earl of Oxford.

Jonson stares at him a beat, and then looks into the
darkness.

                          JONSON
             I'm sorry my lord, but I am not sure I
             know whereof you speak. I have had
             the honor of meeting his lordship--

outside. Before we really understand what we are
seeing we are:

Jonson blinks, trying to stay conscious.      His mouth is
ripped, bleeding. So is his nose.

     The skin has broken on his forehead.     The Interrogator
     leans into the bloody Jonson.

a box of food and drink in front of her bosom-- much
like a match-stick girl.

                        SELLING-MAID
          Ale?   Mutton, mi' lord?

Southampton waves her off as they follow the usher up
another flight of stairs.

                        SOUTHAMPTON
           ...and last week, they had some sort
           of a device to hoist cherubs into the
           air and fly over the entire audience!

                        OXFORD
           An apò mekhanes theós. Deus ex
           machina. Machine of the Gods.

And as they ascend up more stairs, Oxford catches
glimpses of the stage and performance through the
rafters and over the heads of the attending audience.

                        OXFORD (CONT'D)
           Whenever the Greeks wrote their heroes
           into a situation from which they
           couldn't write their way out--

Oxford is becoming intrigued by the theater, almost
despite himself.

                        OXFORD (CONT'D)
           --Out came the apò mekhanes theós...
           As when Hippolytus is saved by
           Artemis, or Medea flown to Athens...
           Always good for an apò mekhanes theós
           was Euripides

Oxford continues up, two steps behind Southampton.

They come to the third floor and enter the box seating
area reserved for nobles, giving Oxford his first real
look at the theater itself. Oxford looks around and
sees-

FROM OXFORD'S POV

Audience members LAUGHING-- others DRINKING-- maids
SELLING food-- the actors ACTING...

It's alive.   Magical.

BACK TO OXFORD

Oxford takes it all in, almost stunned by it.

ON-STAGE

The actor William SHAKESPEARE (30) plays a commoner.
He is handsome, sexy, charismatic; and holds a tankard
of ale, and SWIGS from it constantly.

Another actor SPENCER (30) plays "FASTIDIOUS"; a
pompous, over-dressed, caricature of a nobleman.

                                                    pg. 11


He wears an enormous feather on his hat. Also on stage
is an actor called John HEMINGE (late 40's), who plays
"Sogliardo"

                         SHAKESPEARE
            And whither were you riding now,
            signior?

                         "FASTIDIOUS"
            Who, I? What a silly jest's that!
            Whither should I ride but to the
            court?

                         SHAKESPEARE
            O, pardon me, sir, twenty places more;
            your hot-house, your pig-house, or
            your whore-house!

The audience ROARS in laughter as Shakespeare looks
below at a buxom young lady among the "groundlings".
He smiles seductively. She smiles back.

BACKSTAGE

Jonson (now 25 and clean-shaven) is watching the
performance from behind a curtain, silently speaking
the lines with the actors.

IN THE RAISED SEATING

A group of playwrights and poets watch the play with an
air of judgement. They are: Christopher "Kit" MARLOWE
(32), young, brilliant, a bit foppish (he likes the
boys), Thomas NASHE (late 30's)-- a heavy-set, a hard
drinking satirist-- and Thomas DEKKER (29), considered
a bit of a hack by his colleagues.

They are called the "Mermaid's Wits" because they
frequent a pub named The Mermaid's Tavern.

                         NASHE
                   (takes a swig of ale)
            His second play, and almost a full
            house.
                   (burps)
            He's got a wit, does Jonson.

                         MARLOWE
            That might be so, but like a grain of
            wheat hid in a bushel of chaff: you
            shall seek all day ere you find it,
            and when you have it, it's not worth
            the search!


                                                             11
                                                 pg. 12


The others smile as a WOMAN passes.

                         WOMAN
          Ale!   Ale!!

                       DEKKER
          Marlowe-- spot me a few pence, will
          you? Henslowe still owes me for
          "Shoemaker's Holiday".

                       MARLOWE
                 (retrieving coins)
          That would be because no one saw
          "Shoemaker's Holiday".

                         DEKKER
          Ale here!

Marlowe gives the woman a few pennies as--

                       NASHE
          Kit... Isn't that one of your
          unrequited loves in the box over
          there?

Marlowe glances across the theater and spots
Southampton siting next to Oxford.

                       MARLOWE
                 (frowns)
          But with whom? Tell me not he prefers
          the company of such old grey men as
          that!

Nashe squints.

                       NASHE
          I think-- yes, by the beard, that's
          the Earl of Oxford. Old Tom Hooker
          used to play for him. Had his own
          acting troupe for private Court
          performances and the like.

                       DEKKER
          I wonder if he needs any material?

                       MARLOWE
          Certainly not any of yours.

                       NASHE
          No, no-- that was years ago. Had a
          falling out with the Queen, I heard.
          He's more of a recluse than a patron
          these days.

ON STAGE

Shakespeare points to "Fastidious".

                          SHAKESPEARE
             Who, he, the noble there? Why, he's a
             gull, a fool, no salt in him i' the
             earth; man, he looks like a fresh
             salmon kept in a tub!

Shakespeare struts around as though he owned the place.
The more he talks, the more the audience ROARS in
laughter.

                          SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
             He sleeps with a musk-cat every night,
             and walks all day hang'd in perfumed
             chains for penance.

                           A GROUNDLING
             Oi!   So that's what I been smelling!

More groundlings laugh.     Interestingly--

NOBLEMEN

in the box seats do not.

ON STAGE

Shakespeare continues his rant, speaking directly to
the groundlings.

                          SHAKESPEARE
             He has his skin tann'd in civet, to
             make his complexion strong, and the
             sweetness of his youth lasting in the
             sense of his sweet lady. And, sadly,
             the poor man's brain is lighter than
             his feather...

As the audience HOWLS in laughter, we see:

A NOBLEMAN

with a feathered hat gets up in fury, and exits the
theater, his lady with him. The Audience LAUGHS at him
as he goes.

ON STAGE

Shakespeare smiles triumphantly.



                                                              13

                         SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
            He is a good and empty puff, but he
            loves you well, signior. I wish you
            well with him.

OXFORD

Watches the nobleman with the big feathered hat pass
by.

BACKSTAGE

Later in the play...

Shakespeare returns backstage and takes a deep swig
from his tankard. He's actually drunk, though his
performance didn't show it at all. He spots Jonson,
and grabs him.

                        SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
            Jonson! Wonderful dialogue!
            Wonderful. I hope your next--

                          HENSLOWE (O.C.)
            Will!   Will Shakespeare!

Shakespeare turns to see a furious Philip HENSLOWE
(50'S) heading his way.

                         HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
            That's not ale in that goblet is it?

Shakespeare hides the goblet behind his back.

                         SHAKESPEARE
            Ale? Me? Drink during a performance?
            I am a professional sir!
                   (burps)
            A complete and--

He is interrupted by SCREAMS.    Not from actors on
stage, but by the audience.

IN THE THEATER

Complete panic erupts as dozens of The Queen's Guard
STORM into the theater. Everyone tries to get out as
quickly as possible, including the other actors, Henry
CONDELL (20's), Thomas POPE (30's), William SLY (13).

SIR RICHARD POLE, THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD

--jumps on stage.

           This play has been declared seditious
           and illegal by Lord William Cecil!

The audience begins to BOO at the mention of Cecil.

                        POLE (CONT'D)
           All are herewith ordered to disperse
           immediately!

                        A GROUNDLING
           Why don't you disperse William Cecil's
           arse!

                        POLE
           Arrest that man!

IN OXFORD'S BOX

                          SOUTHAMPTON
           Damn it all.    Well! Off to Essex's
           then?

He gets up. Oxford does not, seemingly interested in
the real drama below as everyone hurries from the
theater.

                          SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
           Edward?

Oxford turns to him, distracted, and nods.

ON STAGE

Jonson pushes his way on stage.

                        JONSON
                  (to Pole)
           Seditious? Seditious?! It's a comedy
           for god's sake! There's nothing
           seditious about--

                        POLE
           Oi, is that right, is it?    And you
           know this because?

                        JONSON
           Because I wrote the bloody thing!      And-
           -

                        POLE
           Arrest him as well!

Jonson is grabbed by guards.

     him.

                             JONSON

     Jonson looks around-- the cell is filled with a dozen
     or so other prisoners.

18   INT. TENNIS COURT AT ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                        18

     Robert, Earl of ESSEX (28), is playing tennis against
     Southampton. He's handsome, red-headed, and, we will
     learn, very ambitious.

                            ESSEX
               ...and how do the Cecils spend their
               time and energy? Shutting a theater!
               A theater, for god's sake? It's
               madness! No wonder the mob hates them
               so!

     The court is inside, and slightly different from
     today's game: the back walls are playable, somewhat
     like racquet-ball.

     Oxford sits on a bench, watching.   Essex SLAMS a shot,
     but it goes--

                              OXFORD
               Out!

     Essex looks furious, but holds his tongue.   Southampton
     prepares to serve.

               Hmm? I'm not sure, two thousand,
               maybe more.

     Southampton SERVES.   Essex returns, and another heated
     rally begins.

               Five or six I suppose.

     He HITS the ball again, and this time Essex misses it.

               the ideas of one man. That's power,
               Robert. And if there is one thing the
               Cecils understand, it's power.

          You are not in the Privy Council.
          Elizabeth does everything the Cecils
          wish of her. Everything!

BEHIND THEM

Oxford enters. They don't notice, though. He
instantly realizes he shouldn't say anything. He
listens as:

WIDER

                        ESSEX (CONT'D)
          Think, Henry, if James owes Cecil his
          throne, Cecil will have more influence
          in the next reign than he does in this
          one. And after William Cecil, his
          hunch-backed son will take his
          place...
                 (careful)
          That is why we must do everything in
          our power to ensure that the right man
          succeeds her.
                 (beat)
          A man deserving of the Tudor crown.

Southampton stiffens at that last phrase.

                       ESSEX (CONT'D)
          I ask you for the support of you and
          your men, Henry.... if it comes to a
          fight.

     Southampton looks at Essex hard.

                             SOUTHAMPTON
                You know you need not ask. I stand
                with you, as I always have.

     Essex smiles at him warmly. They both HEAR something
     shuffle behind them. They turn, and see:

     WHERE OXFORD WAS STANDING

     Nothing.   He is gone.

     BACK TO SOUTHAMPTON AND ESSEX

     They exchange a slightly worried look.

                                                         CUT TO:


20   EXT. ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                                         20

     Moments later, Oxford and Southampton are exiting the
     elaborate building that serves as Essex's London
     residence.

                             OXFORD
                Essex played rather poorly, didn't he?

     Southampton just nods, distracted.   Oxford reaches out
     to him, and touches his shoulder.

                             OXFORD (CONT'D)
                       (warning)
                Henry... The Cecils brook no rivals.

     Southampton pauses, confused for an instant, then--

                             SOUTHAMPTON
                       (re: his discussion with
                        Essex)
                You heard?

     Oxford nods.

                             SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
                Always concerned for me, aren't you
                Edward?

     They keep walking towards Southampton's men.

                             SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
                And what would you have me do?


                                                                   19

                       OXFORD
          I would have you deny him.

                       SOUTHAMPTON
          The son of the Queen?

                       OXFORD
          That is rumor only, Henry--

They stop. Southampton makes sure that his men are out
of earshot.

                       SOUTHAMPTON
          Rumor? My god, all you have to do is
          look at Essex to see the Queen's
          reflection. Everyone thinks he's her
          son, everyone! And I for one would
          rather bow to a Tudor, bastard though
          he may be, than a Scotsman!

                        OXFORD
          I desire nothing more than to see the
          next king be the rightful king. But
          what Essex contemplates will surely
          lead to Civil War.
                 (beat)
          No. If this is to be done, it must be
          done carefully, skillfully.

                       SOUTHAMPTON
          As I heard it, Elizabeth exiled you
          from her presence for the last twenty
          years because of your "skill" at Court
          politics.

And then he feels instantly ashamed of having said
that.

                       OXFORD
          I only have your interests in mind,
          Henry. For as you so rightly point
          out, my interests are already lost.

                       SOUTHAMPTON
          I know. Forgive me. You know how I
          feel about you. You have been a great
          friend to me ever since my father
          died. I promise you that I will do
          nothing rash without consulting you
          first.

Oxford nods, still worried, and Southampton heads for
his horse.


                                                           20

                            OXFORD
               Henry! Will you do me one thing more?
               Deliver a gift for me? A rather...
               elaborate gift?


21   EXT. CECIL HOUSE - SUNSET                                  21

     The stone house is nothing like a stereotypical Tudor
     house; it's enormous, and very ornate and intricate in
     design.

     It faces the river, and has an elaborate docking area
     which is now filled with all sorts of longboats letting
     the noblemen off for a week-end get away.


22   INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DUSK                       22

     Most of England's nobility is assembled in small
     groups, talking. It's a dour, quiet affair. Some
     music, no life. Quite Puritan.

     Southampton is there, but Essex and Oxford are nowhere
     to be seen.

     A HUNCH-BACKED MAN

     --makes his way through the room, causing conversations
     to cease as he walks by. Even the most senior of the
     nobles bow their heads slightly in greeting him. This
     is Sir ROBERT CECIL (mid 30's).

     He pauses near Southampton.

                              SOUTHAMPTON
               Sir Robert.

          with all the troubles in Ireland, who
          else should the Queen turn to but
          Essex?

Robert Cecil looks annoyed, but holds his tongue as the
SOUND of pikes HITTING the floor silences the hall.

A FOOTMAN clears his throat and--

                       FOOTMAN
          By the grace of god, her majesty,
          Elizabeth, Queen of England, Wales and
          Ireland!

DOUBLE DOORS

open, and Elizabeth (in her 60's) enters. She is
wearing a large sparkling pearl-encrusted dress with a
wide collar.

She walks slowly and carefully, and has a slight tremor
in her head and hands. She seems un-certain; like
she's not sure she recognizes all the faces around her
(Alzheimer's?). And she compensates for it by being
all the more regal, all the more un-human.

Essex is on her arm, dressed in a splendid jewel-
encrusted doublet.

Robert Cecil FROWNS at the sight of Essex on her arm.

Essex ignores Cecil's glare, notices Southampton--

                       ESSEX
                 (to Elizabeth)
          Ah-- Majesty, I've been told my lord
          of Southampton has a gift for you.

                       ELIZABETH
                 (eyes sparkle)
          A gift?

                       SOUTHAMPTON
          Yes, your grace, though not from me.

Southampton CLAPS his hands and a door across the room
OPENS.

A DWARF enters, followed by dancing faires, actors
swirling sparklers, and musicians playing music.


                                                           22
                                                  pg. 23


Elizabeth's rheumy eyes widen in complete delight, a
smile of total jubilation crosses her face.

Robert Cecil, on the other hand, looks horrified.

                       ELIZABETH
          Are you this gift, my precious little
          man?

                       ELIZABETH
          A play?

The dwarf bows his assent.

                       ROBERT CECIL
                 (to the Dwarf)
          Plays are the work of the devil, born

          You may tell your master that her

          --Will gladly accept your gift.

Robert Cecil turns to Essex, shocked.

                       ESSEX (CONT'D)
                 (to Elizabeth)
          Of course that is if you so desire,

          The choice is her majesty's to make,

Robert frowns as Elizabeth looks around, unsure of the
political tides around her. Then--

               Lead us to this gift.

     And the Dwarf leads Elizabeth towards the door. Essex
     follows, and Southampton locks into step next to him.
     They exchange a knowing look as--

     Robert Cecil steps in line far after the Queen, not
     happy with this turn of events as we hear--

                            "QUINCE" (O.S.)

     Sheer magic. Candles everywhere: in stakes, in the
     ground, in the trees. They light a make-shift "stage"
     surrounded by huge oak trees on three sides.

                            "BOTTOM"

     Chairs have been brought out and put in rows in the

     course). She loves it, SQUEALING in delight like a
     young woman. Essex is next to her.

ON STAGE

Several actors are mid-scene in "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" (Act 3, Scene 1), their make-up quite elaborate
and fantastical: "Bottom", who is costumed as a man--
except that he has a DONKEY'S HEAD, "Quince", a
commoner, "Puck", played by the dwarf who is now
dressed like a cupid, and "Titania", Queen of the
fairies, who is presently asleep in a bed of fur. Puck
hides behind a tree watching.

            I will walk up and down here, and I

BACKSTAGE

Oxford watches from behind a curtain, carefully
observing the Queen's reaction. Somehow we feel that
seeing her again after so many years stirs up some deep
emotion in him.

ELIZABETH

strongly reacts to Titania awakening.   It stirs some
memory in her. A pleasant memory.

OXFORD

watches, delighted by her reaction.

FROM HIS POV

We see Elizabeth watching. But it is an Elizabeth only
26 years old (referred to as YOUNG ELIZABETH in this
script). We HEAR the sound of other dialogue, but from
the same play. We are:

24   INT. HEDINGHAM CASTLE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT                    24

     Thirty-eight years earlier. And YOUNG ELIZABETH watches
     an earlier, slightly less sophisticated staging of "A
     Midsummer Night's Dream" (the costumes and sets are a
     bit more thrown together).

     All the actors are children from 7-12 years old or so.

     FROM BACKSTAGE

     A boy watches in the exact same position as we just saw
     Oxford. This is BOY OXFORD-- now only 10 years old.
     But he is made up and wears a winged costume for the
     character of "Puck".

                             "OBERON" (O.S.)
                ...and the owner of it blest ever

                meet me all by break of day.

     Oxford hurries--

                             "PUCK"

                this, and all is mended, that you have
                but slumber'd here while these visions
                did appear...

     Next to Young Elizabeth, JOHN DE VERE, Oxford's father,
     also watches, his face beaming with pride.

                             "PUCK" (CONT'D)
                ...And this weak and idle theme, No

                mend.

     A STERN LOOKING MAN

     is watching a few seats   away from Young Elizabeth.   He
     is WILLIAM CECIL (40's,   Robert's father). He is a
     Puritan, dressed all in   black (with a white lace

      Jonson is in a nobleman's longboat (for the first time
      in his life). Across from him sits FRANCESCO--
      Italian, 60's-- wearing a doublet with the Oxford coat
      of arms on its chest.

      The City of London is far in the distance.

      Jonson looks around uncomfortably at the luxurious boat
      for a moment before--

      Oxford smells the rose, inhaling its essence. Then he
      turns and sees Francesco escorting Ben Jonson towards
      him.

      Before they reach him he glances at his wife ANNE De
      Vere (40's) who sits in the distance knitting with one
      of their daughter's, BRIDGET (17).

      Jonson is quite uncomfortable to be at such a grand
      place. Jonson CLEARS his throat.

          That is true. And it was quite hard
          to come by. One does not cross my
          father-in-law lightly.

Jonson doesn't know who he is talking about.

          questionable distinction of being

Oxford looks over to his wife who watches them
suspiciously. He begins to walk away forcing Jonson and
Francesco to follow.

to Anne.

               But it's politics did seem to have
               quite an effect on the Tower. My
               father-in-law's men felt it quite
               seditious.

                            JONSON
               Politics? My play had nothing to do
               with politics! It was just a simple
               comedy--

               That showed your betters as fools who
               go through life barely managing to get
               food from plate to mouth, were it not
               for the cleverness of their servants.

               All art is political, Jonson.

               And all artists have something to say,
               otherwise... they'd make shoes. And
               you're not a cobbler, are you, Jonson?

          Yes. My lord. You wrote an entire

                       OXFORD
          Not a play, Jonson, I've written many.
          No doubt, many more than you yourself.
          A good number performed at Court years
          ago, others never seen by a living
          soul.

          No. I mean you to put your name to

          Well don't look like I just gutted
          your pet dog, Jonson. I mean to make
          you the most popular-- and therefore
          the most monetarily successful--
          playwright in all of London.

Jonson pales.   This is a disaster for him.

Jonson looks down at the manuscript, reads a few lines.

     without so much as a good-bye.

               My lord?

     But before he can follow, Francesco tosses a leather
     pouch of coins at his feet.

               That is for your trouble, Signor

               you break that silence, then... not so
               good for Signor Jonson.

     And Francesco follows after his master as Jonson picks
     up the pouch, examining its contents.

     And then Jonson realizes he doesn't know how to get out
     of the maze. He chases after them.

     waiting to disembark. He constantly holds an    ornately
     carved white cane.

               So! I am gone for three days, and you
               somehow manage to let her spend all of
               them solely in the company of the Earl
               of Essex...

     Robert Cecil looks at him sharply.   How did he know.

                            WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
               Don't think because I was in London, I
               didn't know exactly what went on here

               Of course not! You don't deny him
               anything. You find excuses. She is
               unwell, she is reading, she is seeing
               the Ambassador from Russia. For God's
               sake, use your imagination, Robert.

30   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                           30

     William Cecil enters an impressive hallway and turns to
     his son.


                            WILLIAM CECIL
               Now tell me about the play.

     Robert Cecil looks surprised for an instant that he
     knows about that as well.

                            ROBERT CECIL
               It-- it was an anonymous gift. Essex
               insisted it be performed, just to
               spite me in front of Court...

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               Of course he did.
                      (concerned)
               But what was it about?

                            ROBERT CECIL
               About? Some nonsense about fairies
               and cherubs.

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               ...And dancing asses?

     Robert looks surprised at his father who has stopped
     suddenly.

               Purpose?    What purpose?

               now deal not only with Essex, but
               Edward as well. For whether in shadow
               or in person, Edward has returned to
               Court!

     And with that he slams the door shut.

     Robert Cecil walks over to a nearby window. Visibly
     upset he starts to stare out of the window and
     remembers...

     THROUGH A THIRD STORY WINDOW

     We see servants carrying big trunks. There are at least

     And it is thirty years earlier.

     BOY ROBERT CECIL (now 9) is staring out of the window.
     His back must have been deformed either in utero or at
     birth, because even now he is hunchbacked.

                                                                  36

Finally Boy Robert Cecil turns and sees Young Oxford
(now 17) entering the hallway with William Cecil and
his wife and daughter, Young ANNE (15). In front of
them, lined up, are several men whom we will learn are
TUTORS.

Boy Robert Cecil doesn't move.

Boy Robert Cecil watches as his father turns to his
mother and sister.

          May I present my wife, Lady Cecil, and

Young Anne curtsies.

     Young Oxford is fencing with a tutor. He's quite good.
     In fact, he's better than the tutor, who is twice his
     age.

     Boy Robert Cecil casually watches as he plays chess
     against himself.

     Young Oxford, with a fierce, beautifully executed
     attack, disarms his tutor. The tutor's sword FLIES
     into the air, and hits--

     THE CHESS BOARD

     making the pieces scatter.

     Boy Robert Cecil looks up, his face furious, to see

     Young Oxford motions to go, then picks up the black

     Moments later, the Young Oxford heads down the hall
     alone, heading for his rooms, his sword still in his

     And a SERVANT is looking at the poems, then quickly
     stuffing them into a bag.

     But then he HEARS footsteps coming. Panicked, he looks
     for someplace to hide-- a tapestry half covers a door--
     he runs to it-- the door is locked!

     So he hides behind the tapestry just as the door opens,
     and Young Oxford enters.

     After a few steps, Young Oxford senses something amiss.
     Looks at his--

     WRITING DESK

     where the parchments are scattered.

     YOUNG OXFORD

     goes to his desk, picks up one of the pieces of
     parchment. It has poetry on it. His poetry. He goes
     through some other pages. And realizes other pages are
     missing. He becomes infuriated. He sees--

     Young Oxford CHARGES the tapestry, sword in hand.     He
     THRUSTS the sword THROUGH the tapestry.

     The man screams in agony as he falls. He doesn't just
     die, but screams and screams and screams.

     Young Oxford steps back-- half in horror... half in
     triumph. The SOUND of APPLAUSE takes us to:

     Thirty-three years later.

          second, majesty. His counsel has been
          invaluable to me, and no doubt will be

Elizabeth points to one of the dresses, and waves the
handmaidens away.

     A performance of "Romeo and Juliet". About a dozen
     actors are dancing. It is Act 1, Scene 5. "ROMEO",
     played by Spencer, is staring longingly at "Juliet".
     "Romeo" turns to his servant.

                 cheek of night like a rich jewel in an
                 Ethiop's ear; beauty too rich for use,

There is a natural change in the music, and all the

great deal of jealousy.

                gravely ill, but that all is in hand.
                Much of the Privy Council has already
                secretly agreed to his ascension to
                the English throne due to your
                tireless, but secret, entreaties on

               This is how kings are made, Robert.
               So it was with Elizabeth, and so it
               shall ever be. There were many rival
               claims to her throne, but none
               survived to make their claim. James
               must know that you will do the same
               for him, and he will reward you for
               it.
                      (beat)
               But we must do one thing more...

     William Cecil has a coughing fit-- reaches for a glass
     vial of medicine at his bedside-- takes it.

                            WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
               Like Essex, Edward must be removed.

               He uses the tools at his disposal, as
               we use the tools at ours. But ours
               will win... as they always have.

     Twenty seven years earlier. Young Elizabeth is pacing,
     terribly agitated. Bessie, the lady-in-waiting we have
     seen constantly at her side is the only other person
     present.

William Cecil thinks.

William Cecil looks startled.

          Marry him, your grace? He is already
          married.

          I can do what I will.

                        WILLIAM CECIL
          Can you?

She gives him a sharp look.

                       WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
          Most of the Catholic princes of Europe

          the hope that they might marry you,
          and thereby achieve your realm through
          other means.

Young Elizabeth hears him, thinks on it, then begins
pacing again.

He knows the answer to that.

     A simple, cold space, like William Cecil himself.
     William Cecil is alone in prayer. A few beats, then he
     senses he is not alone. He turns and sees Young Oxford
     (still 20).

                            YOUNG OXFORD

     William Cecil regards Young Oxford for a beat, then
     stands.

     Twenty-seven years later. Jonson is alone, trying to
     write at a small table, though it's obvious from his

          consequence, and we find ourselves in
          a cell quicker than a fart spreads in
          the trade winds. Will-- he murders a
          caricature of old William Cecil

75   EXT. OXFORD STONE - GARDEN - DAY                           75

     To Establish. A foggy day. In the Foreground we see
     the maze. Oxford and his fencing master, BEAULIEU
     (20's) are in the center of the maze dueling with
     rapiers for exercise.

     CLOSER

     They wear outfits that are slightly more protective
     than ornamental.

     They duel for a few moments, and then Oxford TOUCHES
     Beaulieu's shoulder. The speak entirely in French.

                             BEAULIEU
               Point!

     Oxford backs off, as does the fencing master.

                            OXFORD
                      (in French)

               Bien.    En garde!

     And they once again begin to duel. But we quickly
     surmise something is amiss. Beaulieu is much more
     aggressive than he was before. Oxford realizes it, but
     is an expert swordsman, and defends himself well.

     And then Beaulieu aggressively moves forward, and STABS
     Oxford in the leg.

     But Oxford has little chance to react, because Beaulieu
     continues his attack.

     This has become an assassination attempt, not an
     exercise.

     ENTRANCE OF THE MAZE

     Francesco is entering the maze with a silver tray
     carrying a pitcher and two goblets.

     CENTER OF THE MAZE

     Though wounded, Oxford is a superior swordsman. And he
     begins his own attack-- with a ferocity that surprises
     Beaulieu.

     IN THE MAZE

     Francesco heads for the center as--

     IN THE CENTER OF THE MAZE

     Oxford PIERCES Beaulieu's heart with his rapier, and
     Beaulieu SCREAMS--

     IN THE MAZE

     Francesco hears the scream, and starts to run.

                              FRANCESCO
               Signor?    Signor?!

     IN THE CENTER OF THE MAZE

     Oxford collapses as Francesco rushes in.

               Signor? Mio dio! Signor! What has
               happened--

     Oxford checks his leg wound, and glances at the dead
     Beaulieu. He tries to wave off Franceso's aid, but to
     no avail as--

                            OXFORD
               Beaulieu-- he, he tried to kill me...

     Jonson, slightly drunk, walks down a street, a whore
     under his arm, and notices a commotion up ahead: people
     talking by an alley near the Mermaid's tavern.

                                                                83

     MARLOWE, a dried stab-wound in his eye.

     A small, open air theater where a chained bear is being
     led around the theater. A set of mastiffs are being
     led on the opposite side of the theater.

     The spectators are unruly, loudly making bets for the
     mauling to come.

     Jonson is among them, taking a look at the bear, deciding
     whether to bet on it or not.

      Francesco gives Jonson a leather folder containing a

                They-- they haven't been very

                wanted you to know. To... to hurt
                you.

      She is crushed.

          wounds.

          These are her conditions for your
          release. One. You will not
          acknowledge the child. Two. You will
          never see the mother again. Three.
          You will avoid Court at all costs.
          Her majesty would prefer not to be
          reminded of you in any way ever again.

          No. You have the freedom of the
          kingdom. Just not of the Court.
                 (beat)
          Those are her terms. Here are mine.
          You will go back to my daughter. You
          will make some effort to make her
          happy and you will finally act
          according to your station in life, and
          accept the responsibilities of your
          great title.

Oxford reluctantly NODS.    William Cecil goes to leave.

                          YOUNG OXFORD
          My lord!     I, too, have a condition.

William Cecil turns.

               void, and I'll see your head on the

      ELIZABETH

      standing across the room.   How much has she heard?

      WIDER

      They all stand abruptly, worried. The women who was
      reading the book puts it down on a table.

      Elizabeth silently walks over to them, and picks up the
      book. She opens it as we--

      Elizabeth is looking out the window. It's raining
      outside. She is NOT wearing her wig, not much make-up,
      and looks quite... odd.

      Robert Cecil enters.

She doesn't have to say which one. Robert Cecil sees a

She seems surprised. Perhaps she was expecting Essex.
But then she smiles, and NODS in approval.

          Majesty... You are not having doubts
          about James of Scotland succeeding

Elizabeth goes into a rage.

                       ELIZABETH
          James?! He is the son of Mary! She
          plotted and schemed to steal the
          throne from under me! No son of hers
          will rule while a yet Tudor lives!

Robert Cecil is surprised by her fury. He bows his
head as Elizabeth tries to collect herself.

hesitates, and then she glares at him... He bows and
exits, the fury on his face plain.

Elizabeth looks at her own reflection in the window...

       Ben Jonson walks with a manuscript in his hands. He
       stops for a moment when he sees the new Globe theater.
       Workers are still painting the walls.

       He pauses when he sees a poster in front advertising a
       performance of "Richard III" on Monday next.


110A   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY                              110A

       Jonson sticks his head in and takes in the glorious new
       theater Shakespeare and Burbage have built.

       The actor Condell is on stage, rehearsing the character
       of "Gloucester". He walks on stage with a limp, and
       has a large hump on his back. He is a caricature of
       Robert Cecil.

                              "GLOUCESTER"

       Richard BURBAGE, the theater's stage manager, is
       watching his performance with Spencer and a group of
       actors.

       Jonson stops and watches the rehearsal for a beat.

And "Gloucester" heads backstage.

          Burbage. Wonderful theater. Wonderful!
          The best Bankside! But only one
          performance? Is it that bad?

          Hardly, it's Will's new play. Richard
          the Third. We've been hired to
          perform it free to the public.

          Free?

                       BURBAGE
          Aye. Some anonymous nobleman paid for
          everything. God knows Will never
          would.   Been rehearsing all week,
          just found out this morning, we go up
          next Monday.

Jonson thinks a beat-- that's odd-- but then holds up
his manuscript.

                 (grins)

      Jonson is deep in drink, by himself.   He listens as
      patrons of the bar say:

                scalawag, and your Jonson won't even
                try the hard drama. No, this is

      Jonson gets up, furious, and exits, quite drunk.     The
      actors don't even notice him.


112   EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF TOWER OF LONDON    - NIGHT           112

      Jonson stumbles down the streets, alone, deep in his
      own private hell. It's raining.

                Fancy a tumble? Only sixpence!

      The Tower of London. He makes a decision.

      Jonson sits in the same spot where Marlowe was sitting
      earlier. And he hates himself for it. Rain drips down
      the windows.

      Pole looks up from some papers.

                performance only. On Monday. All

                Yes. Of course you do. But in
                William Shakespeare's version, he is
                played as a hunch-back.

      Robert Cecil has prayed all night. His lips silently

      When Pole appears he doesn't stop his prayer. Only

      From high, high above a city of 200,000 souls. It's a
      beautiful sunny day, but black storm clouds are on the
      horizon.

      All of London is on its feet. They all are on their way
      to Bankside.

      The London Bridge is crammed one way. The River Thames
      is full of many small boats of theatergoers.

      The audience HUSHES as--

      ON STAGE

      "GLOUCESTER", the future Richard III, enters. He is
      hunch-backed, and looks as much like Robert Cecil as
      possible in terms of beard and costume. First the
      people are in stunned silence, but then like magic the
      hissing starts. It is followed by more hissing and the
      first boos.

      The actor playing Gloucester nervously looks around...

      IN THE GALLERIES

      Dekker seems surprised at the similarity to Robert Cecil.

      The hissing and booing has swelled so strong that the
      actor stops for a moment. But then he finds the courage
      again to continue.

      Jonson looks down at the Groundling's reaction, and
      spots--

      FRANCESCO

      in the audience. But among the Groundlings, not in
      Oxford's usual box seat.

                  lady's chamber to the lascivious

          Gloriana was out of favor. No one
          thought her very important at all.
          Except my father, of course. And when
          her first child was born, a male, my
          father took it, and hid it. The
          grandson of Henry VIII, the foundling

                 Leave us.    All of you.

                       OXFORD
          They only wished for a place in
          government equal to their station.
          Equal to their birth.

                       ELIZABETH
          You caused this! Your play, your
          words, caused my people to mob against
          me! Do you think I wasn't aware of
          your plot with this man Shakespeare,
          that I wouldn't recognize your voice?

Elizabeth turns away from him, angered.   She walks to a
window, turns her back on him.

She pauses for a long moment...    And then she decides.

      Oxford's wife Anne is there, but Oxford is nowhere to

      It's foggy. Oxford stands next to a carriage, waiting
      as the gates open, and Southampton-- scruffy and a bit
      worse for wear-- is escorted out.

      Southampton smiles weakly when he sees Oxford waiting
      for him. The two men walk towards each other and
      embrace.

      Both men have tears in their eyes.

      Shakespeare turns and sees Jonson heading his way.
      Jonson is completely drunk, waving a sword in one hand,
      a tankard in another.

      But Jonson CHARGES Shakespeare. Shakespeare easily
      dodges the drunk Jonson. Jonson ROARS and attacks
      again.

      Shakespeare dodges again, turns, and manages to grab
      Jonson by the throat. They are face to face.

          I have seen it in your face... He
          vexes you. How could he not? But he
          is not your burden. He is mine.

Then he nods to the manuscripts by his side.

                       OXFORD (CONT'D)
          All my writings. The plays, the
          sonnets... Keep them safe. Keep them
          from my family. From the Cecil's.
          Wait a few years, and then, publish
          them.

Jonson looks stricken.

                       JONSON
          I am not worthy of this charge, my
          lord. I... I betrayed you... I told
          them of your--

                       OXFORD
          I have made it my life to know the
          character of men, Jonson. I know you.
          You may have betrayed me, but you will
          never betray my words...

He puts the last manuscript on the pile.

Jonson looks at the--

      Jonson leaves Oxford's room, visibly shaken.    The
      manuscripts are under his arm.

      Anne, Oxford's wife is still there, surround by
      doctors.

      Then she sees Jonson leaving.

                                ANNE
                   Get out! You, your friends, your
                   blasphemous theaters, have brought
                   nothing but ruin and dishonor to this
                   family.

                                JONSON
                   Ruin? Dishonor? Madam. You, your
                   family, me, even Elizabeth herself
                   shall be remembered solely because we
                   had the honor to live whilst your
                   husband put ink to paper.

      He turns and exits.

      Jonson exits the building and walks away. He reads the
      dedication on the first page of the manuscript as he
      walks.

                                JONSON (V.O.)
                   To the Earl of Southampton. The love
                   I dedicate to your lordship is without
                   end; whereof this pamphlet, without
                   beginning, is but a superfluous
                   moiety.

      Jonson freezes, and looks back at Oxford's house,
      realizing there is another whole layer to all this;
      exactly what he can only guess.

      A few hours later. Oxford has died in his bed. Anne
      watches as a doctor covers his face with a sheet.

                             JONSON (V.O.)
                What I have done is yours; what I have

161   EXT. A SMALL CHURCH - DAY                                    161

      A casket is being interred into the family mausoleum.
      Anne is there, as are Oxford's children. So is Robert
      Cecil.

                             JONSON (V.O.)
                Were my worth greater, my duty would
                show greater; meantime, as it is, it
                is bound to your lordship, to whom I
                wish long life... still lengthened
                with all happiness.

      Southampton is there as well.   Watching. Tears roll
      down his cheeks.

162   INT. TOWER OF LONDON - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT            162

      Where we began.

      A bucket of water is DUMPED on Jonson. He regains
      consciousness and looks around. Somewhat confused he
      sees:

      Robert Cecil limping out of the dark towards him.
      Robert Cecil leans down, and very close to his ear,
      whispers:

                             CECIL
                I can make all this go away, Jonson...
                To be but a dream. Like one of your
                plays... Or, I can bring you so much
                pain-- pain that were you given a
                thousand years, and a thousand quills,
                you could never justly describe...

      Cecil steps back.

                       CECIL (CONT'D)
          I know you have them. All his
          manuscripts. My sister saw you leave
          Oxford Stone with them under your arm.

Jonson takes a long time before answering. Will he
betray Oxford?

                       JONSON
          They were destroyed...   burned...   by
          your own men...

Cecil doesn't know whether to believe him or not.

                       INTERROGATOR
          He's lying...

                       JONSON
          My lord? Why would I lie? Is there a
          man alive who has reason to hate him
          more than I?

Jonson stares directly at Cecil, knowing he is speaking
about Cecil as well as himself.

                       JONSON (CONT'D)
          He was something I could never be. An
          undeniable perfection... that plagued
          my soul... And to him I was...
          nothing. A messenger. Nothing more.

Cecil stares into his eyes for a long moment, searching
for the truth. Then he smiles.

                        CECIL
          Let him go!   He tells the truth.

Robert Cecil turns to leave, but then turns a last
time.

                       CECIL (CONT'D)
          And Jonson-- better him, won't you?
          Wipe his memory for all time. For
          you. And for me.

Robert Cecil smiles at Jonson, who can only stare at
him. Finally:

                       JONSON
                 (sotto)
          I am afraid that this is not possible,
          my lord.

Robert Cecil's smile freezes and he leaves.

163    EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF TOWER OF LONDON - DAWN               163

       Jonson is getting released. He walks away....a lonely
       figure.

       Set for a Court performance of a play. Courtiers bow
       as King James I enters the chamber, Robert Cecil two
       steps behind him. James takes his seat right in front
       of the stage, as Elizabeth used to.

       Jonson's eyes search the ground.   And, eventually, he
       finds it--

       THE METAL BOX

       that seems to somehow have survived the conflagration.

       JONSON

       opens the box.

       INSIDE THE BOX

       Are the manuscripts Oxford gave him. Jonson smiles,
       relieved. They are singed at the edges, but they are
       there. We hear--

                               PROLOGUE (O.S.)
                  O-- for a muse of fire... that would

      right next to him.

                We had seen some of this Shakespeare's
                plays in Edinburgh, Sir Robert. I
                must tell you, we enjoyed them
                immensely, and look forward to seeing
                many more, now that we are in
                London... I presume you are as avid a
                theater man as myself?

      Robert Cecil's smile remains frozen.

                could not prevent the public theaters
                from becoming ever more popular. William
                Shakespeare, however, spent the remaining
                years of his life not in the playhouses
                of London, but in the small town of his
                birth, Stratford upon Avon, as a
                businessman and grain merchant.
