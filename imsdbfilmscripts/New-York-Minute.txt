                    REVISED SECOND DRAFT

                    February 27, 2003

FADE IN:

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN
CLOSE ON the anxious, sweating, frightened face of DREW
MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life. Think Dustin
Hoffman in Marathon Man -- someone, something -- is after
her but UNSEEN.
She glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer,
her BREATHING becoming more labored.
Cutting through a deserted park, she leaps a bench.
Above her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten
the leaves.
Around the corner, she's back on a sidewalk lined with
beautiful homes, all quiet at dawn, the only noise her
racing FOOTSTEPS and quickening BREATHS.

DREW'S POV - HER OWN FRONT DOOR
and safety loom half a block down. She pours on the
effort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the stairs and makes the
door, rips it open, bolts inside and SLAMS it shut.

ANGLE ON THE SHRUB
where, with the CAMERA AT GROUND LEVEL, a GOLDEN
RETRIEVER PUPPY, unable to leap the hedge, PLOWS INTO IT
HEADFIRST and disappears. YELP!

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Drew, wheezing from the exertion, pulls an ASTHMA INHALER
from her pocket, takes a hit, then peeks out the window
in the front door and sees...

DREW'S POV
The puppy squeezes through the hedge, wiggling its bum to
extricate itself. A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL picks it up, hugs
it close:
                           SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL
             Where are you going, Jelly Bean?
                                                CUT TO:

                                                      2.

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - PARKER'S ROOM - MORNING
CLOSE ON A JAPANESE EXECUTIVE (with a CLOCK in his belly)
which suddenly begins SCREAMING IN JAPANESE, ITS JAW
WAGGING.
From under piles of clothes and sheets, PARKER MacLEOD,
17, Drew's twin sister, opens one eye, shuts OFF the
shrieking ALARM CLOCK.
With a SIGH, she throws her feet  over the edge of the
bed. Her room is a train wreck.    Grabbing a MatchBox 20
T-shirt from the pile on the bed,  she gives it a sniff.
Good enough. Pulling it on, she   pauses, looks a bit
concerned down at her navel.
A recent belly-button piercing looks a little red. She
touches it. Ouch. When a RINGING is heard, she begins
tossing clothes, blankets, shoes, trying to unearth the
source.
She pulls her BLACKBERRY from under the covers:
THOREAU 786:   MADE CRITICAL ERROR LAST P.M.
Parker snickers, types her return from...
NOTATWIN:   CONFESS
THOREAU 786:   DROPPED TRIPLE DEPTH CHARGE AFTER DINNER.
NOTATWIN:   THAT MUCH CAFFEINE IS ILLEGAL IN UTAH.
THOREAU 786: THEN BOUGHT 'NO MONEY DOWN' REAL ESTATE
COURSE AROUND 3:00 A.M.
This makes her smile.
NOTATWIN:   A CAREER MAN.   I LIKE THAT.
                                            CUT TO:

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING
Drew stands before the mirror, perfecting perfection. In
a tasteful suit, hair just so, she opens the drawer...
... which is hyper-organized, everything in a little
labeled nook. She pulls out tweezers and we see beneath
where it says, "tweezers."
She leans into the mirror very close, spots a stray
eyebrow hair, plucks it. Pulling back, she raises her
other eyebrow. Huh. Now they're not even.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                         3.

CONTINUED:
She leans in again and plucks one from the other eyebrow.
Uh-oh. This is like when your mom cuts your hair and
keeps cutting to get it even until you're shaved. She
reaches for the other side... but suddenly catches
herself and stops. Deep breath. Let's not get too
psychotic.
She dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar, then replaces
them.
Checking her teeth, she spots a stuck bit.       Grabbing her
WATER PICK she begins cleaning her teeth.
                           PARKER (O.S.)
             Morning.
Startled, Drew shoots herself in the eye with the water
pick. Parker's ENTERED from her side. Drew shuts off
the water pick, dries her face.
                           PARKER
             Why the young executive look?
                           DREW
             I have my interview at NYU today.
Parker, sleepy, stretches, unaware she's exposing her new
belly ring.
                           DREW
             No way Mom knows about that.
Self-consciously, Parker drops her arms, pulls her shirt
down.
                           PARKER
             And she never will. At least
             until after I'm married.
                           DREW
             Didn't it hurt?
                           PARKER
             Like hell.
Drew shivers.
                           DREW
             Piercings are so... unhygienic.
A little BEEP BEEP from her preset WATCH ALARM goes off.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                        4.

                           DREW
             Breakfast.
Drew turns on her heel and EXITS. When Parker sets her
Blackberry down we get our first glimpse of...
... HER SIDE OF THE    BATHROOM which resembles a post-
apocalyptic toiletry    landscape. There's a very clear
line of demarcation    on the counter like the demilitarized
zone separating the    Koreas.
Parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but
notices another message on her Blackberry:
THOREAU 786:     KNOW WHAT TODAY IS?
NOTATWIN:     ANOTHER DAY IN HELL?
THOREAU 786:     TWO WEEKS SINCE OUR FIRST CHAT.
NOTATWIN:     OUR ANNIVERSARY.    HOW SWEET.
THOREAU 786: SINCE IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION, MY REAL
NAME'S WARREN COLLIER. IF YOU'RE EVER IN THE CITY, I'D
LOVE TO MEET. GOTTA GO.
Accompanying the text, a PICTURE Warren has sent finishes
downloading -- eighteenish, the shaggy chic, Calvin Klein
model-type.
                           PARKER
                     (suddenly wide-awake)
             Hellooo, Warren.
Distracted, Parker drops her toothbrush, which bounces
off the counter and PLOPS into the toilet.
ON THE TOILET BOWL -- there it is, slowly sinking.
Parker is stone-faced. She looks to her sister's side of
the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered
holder. She's considering... she's reaching... then...
nah.
Instead, she squeezes the tube straight into her mouth,
brushes with a finger and spits.

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Drew's seated, napkin on lap, eating granola and studying
her open DAYBOOK.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                         5.

CONTINUED:
DR. QUINN MacLEOD, dressed professionally and obviously
together even at this hour, pours coffee for herself and
her husband, PROFESSOR CHARLEY MacLEOD, who ENTERS still
in his ratty old bathrobe and outrageous bed-head.
As a matter of routine, Quinn holds out his cup and he
takes it, kisses her and sits down to the paper.
                             DREW
             Morning, Dad.
                             CHARLEY
             Morning, baby.
                           DREW
             How's the book coming?
                            CHARLEY
                     (sigh)
             Well, sweety, my writing process
             is a lot like a giant
             hydroelectric dam. For a long
             time I just let the great ideas
             build up and build up until the
             sheer weight of them spills over
             and the words just come pouring
             out.
                           DREW
             Still stuck, huh?
                             CHARLEY
             Not a word.
Parker ENTERS with her Blackberry in hand, smooches her
pop, then takes a sat.
Parker's clearly a chip off her Dad's block. Both pour
milk first into their bowl, then Charley drops in Super
Sugar Crisp while Parker pours in Count Chocula. Both
hit 'em with a couple of spoons of extra sugar.
Mom takes a seat, too, primly eating a piece of dry wheat
toast that she slices in half first. Like Mom, like
Drew.
Drew spots the BLACKBERRY JPEG of Warren before Parker
can turn it over.
                           DREW
             Another one for the trophy room,
             huh?
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         6.

             Boys can be fun. You should try
             one some time.
                           QUINN
                     (to Drew)
             You ready for your interview?
                           DREW
                     (funny you
                      should ask)
             I've prepared a color-coded
             itinerary based on dividing the
             day into fifteen minute increments
             alternating blue/red, double-
             checked the train schedule,
             confirmed with the Weather Channel
             and rehearsed a couple of
             alternate scenarios last night,
             you know, just to account for all
             the possible glitches.
                           PARKER
             We'll take that as a yes.
                           CHARLEY
             I'm proud of you for sticking to
             your plan all these years, sweety.
                           PARKER
             I still don't understand why you
             want to finish college in two
             years? What's the big hurry?
                           DREW
             I want to hit the ground running.
             All those football games and the
             partying and the whole dating
             scene. It just seems like a lot
             of wasted time that could be spent
             more productively.
                           QUINN
             The Accelerated program would look
             great on your med school
             application.
                           PARKER
             Football games I get. But
             partying? A waste of time?
Parker looks to her dad.     He shrugs.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                           CHARLEY
             To each her own.
                            QUINN
             Well, Drew.   I have a surprise.
Everybody stops what they're doing for a BEAT.
                           QUINN
             I took the day off.
                     (excitedly)
             I'm going into the City with you.
                           DREW
                     (panicked)
             What -- ?!
Drew CHOKES on her granola and a little milk trickles out
her nose.
                           QUINN
             Isn't that great! We can do some
             shopping, have lunch, real girl
             stuff. Won't that be fun?
                           PARKER
             If you want to have fun, I'm the
             one who should go, not Mother
             Teresa over there.
Drew is still choking -- pretty badly.
                           PARKER
             Let me know if you want me to do
             the Heimlich. It'd be cool to
             have you owe me your life.
WHOOSH!   The granola goes down and she sucks air.
                           QUINN
             You okay?
                           DREW
                     (still clearing)
             No... I mean, it's... impossible.
             I've got every minute accounted
             for right up to the interview.
             Blue and red! It won't work.
                           QUINN
             I just thought... you know... I've
             been working and we haven't had a
             chance to spend much time
             together...

CONTINUED:
Quinn, the normally thick-skinned M.D., is tearing up.
                           QUINN
             ... and both my babies are going
             away to college next Fall.
She takes her plate and goes to the sink and Parker
follows her, putting an arm around her shoulder.
                           PARKER
             Don't be sad, Mom. Just think,
             when Drew leaves for school, you
             won't be losing a daughter, you'll
             be losing an anal-retentive social
             misfit who will be voted most
             likely to die a virgin.
Drew throws an arm around Quinn's other shoulder.
                           DREW
             I'm sorry, Mom. It's really sweet
             of you. But don't worry. Parker
             will be living here with you
             forever since no college on earth
             will ever take her.
                           QUINN
             Stop it, you two.
Mom blows her nose.
                           PARKER
             It's not fair you guys get to go
             into the City and I don't.
                           CHARLEY
             Don't you have a chem test, young
             lady?
                           PARKER
             Chemistry? Please. Name one time
             you ever used chemistry in your
             life.
                           CHARLEY
                     (beat)
             Good point.
                           QUINN
                     (adamant)
             I use chemistry every day.

                              PARKER
             You're a    doctor, Mom. I'm not
             going to    be a doctor. I can't
             even say    the word 'orifice,' let
             alone put    a finger up one.
The BEEP BEEP of Drew's alarm WATCH signals time to go.
Drew is trying to cover up, but she's reeling from the
news that her mother's going to accompany her.
                           DREW
                     (worried)
             Time to go.

INT. DREW'S ROOM - MORNING
Drew's room looks like a four-star hotel suite. Almost
trembling with tension, she ENTERS and immediately sits
down at her desk with her DAYPLANNER, turning to the
present DATE:
CLOSE ON THE PAGE, WHERE EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES IS COLOR-
CODED AND ACCOUNTED FOR RIGHT UP TO...
2:07 -- PROFESSOR QUE SPAULDING, CHAIR, NEW YORK
UNIVERSITY ACCELERATED STUDIES PROGRAM, ADMINISTRATION
BUILDING, SUITE 101.
                           QUINN (O.S.)
             Come on, honey! Let's tear up
             Manhattan!
With a shiver, Drew closes the book, looks up into the
mirror, takes a squirt off her inhaler to calm herself
and tries some self-reassurance.
                           DREW
             You're smart. You're resourceful.
             You'll find a way to make it work.
She tries to sell herself on this by smiling, but
something in the smile suggests SHE'S SCREWED.
Collecting her Dayplanner, purse, interview file and cell
phone, she drops them into her matching Coach shoulder bag.


EXT. DRIVEWAY - MacLEOD HOUSE - MORNING
Quinn hops in her Saab.
ANGLE ON the doorway, where Drew pauses, takes a deep
breath to brace herself, then walks like a condemned
prisoner to her mother's car and climbs in.

                                                   10.

INT. QUINN'S SAAB - CONTINUOUS ACTION
RING! Quinn's CELL PHONE goes off. Quinn looks annoyed,
checks the incoming number. Drew closes her eyes and
prays.
                         QUINN
                  (to phone)
          Doctor MacLeod...
                  (beat; winking
                   at Drew)
          I'm sorry, but my itinerary is
          booked solid today. Call Dr.
          Wessels. He's covering for me.
                  (beat)
          He did?
                  (beat)
          Are you sure it's the baby's head?
                  (beat)
          All right. I'm coming.
Frustrated, Mom hangs up and with a look of profound
disappointment, turns to Drew.
                         QUINN
          I'm sorry, hon. It's a Blue Light
          special in Maternity. Every bed's
          full and some poor woman is about
          to give birth in the gift shop. I
          have to go in.
Drew musters her best sad, sad face for her mom.
                        DREW
          Ah, darn it, Mom. That's a shame.
          It's like fate is conspiring
          against us.
                        QUINN
          I know.
                        DREW
          You absolutely, positively have to
          promise me we'll do it another

                        QUINN
          I promise. I better hurry. Have
          Parker drop you at the train
          station on her way to school, will
          you?
Quinn gives her daughter a smile and a kiss.

             Kill 'em in that interview.
                            DREW
                     (beat)
             Mom, you know, I might not get in.
                           QUINN
             Are you kidding me? You're Drew
             MacLeod. Nobody's smarter, nobody
             works harder and nobody, and I
             mean nobody, is ever more
             prepared.
Drew smiles, hugs her mom and jumps out, waving as her
mom backs down the drive and disappears down the street.
With the weight of the world suddenly lifted from her
shoulders, Drew looks to the sky and mouths, "thank you."
This is when Parker comes hauling down the driveway in
her Honda Accord. Drew signals her to stop, so of course
her sister IGNORES HER and jets into the street.
                            DREW
             Hey!   Stop!
Drew takes off running after the car!
                            DREW
             PARKER!!

EXT. PHILADELPHIA TRAIN STATION - MORNING
Commuters all jump from their cars and into the station.


INT. THE GIRLS' HONDA - MORNING
Parker pulls up to the curb at the station.       Drew
collects her bag.
                           PARKER
             Good luck with your interview.
Drew pauses, holding the door open.
                           DREW
             You know, Parker. Chemistry is
             important. When you think about
             it, everything's made of
             chemicals.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                         12.

CONTINUED:
                           PARKER
             Oh, I'm interested in chemistry.
             Just not the kind with all the
             numbers and stinky test tubes.
Drew shuts the door and hustles off into the train
station. Parker SIGHS, looks to the BLACKBERRY on the
seat next to her.
                           PARKER
             Ah, chemistry.

INT. FIRST TRAIN CAR - MORNING
Drew finds a seat.     She neatly folds her jacket and sets
it next to her.
She pulls out a lumbar support pillow and tucks it behind
her -- just right. Next, she takes out a tiny inflatable
lap desk, blows it up and sets it across her lap. A pen
goes in the little holder. Coffee from her Thermos.
After laying out her interview materials, she turns to
her reflection in the window.
                           DREW
                     (low; rehearsing)
             Professor Spaulding. Good
             afternoon. I'm Drew MacLeod.
An EXECUTIVE takes the aisle seat next to her, and after
a sideways glance at Drew's portable office, opens his
Wall Street Journal as the train begins to pull away.
EVERY COMMUTER is quietly reading the paper or staring
off into their own world, wondering why their life has
lead them to this sad moment when...
... they're all distracted by an AWFUL, AWFUL VOICE
singing Sheryl Crow's "Soak Up the Sun." It's Parker,
wearing her headphones and looking for a seat in the full
train car.
Drew stares at her, dumbfounded.
                           DREW
             What do you think you're doing?
                           PARKER
                     (too loud; with
                      headphones on)
             Looking for a seat.

                           DREW
             This can't be happening. Wait, I
             know. This is one of those Ground
             Hog Day dreams, isn't it?
Drew pinches herself too hard.
                           DREW
             Ow!
                     (to Parker)
             I'm awake now. You're supposed to
             disappear.
                           PARKER
                     (still too loud)
             You know, I just got this itch.
                           DREW
             Then scratch it and get back to
             school.
                           PARKER
             I couldn't concentrate anyway.
             I'm too... distracted today.
                            DREW
             You're permanently distracted.
             It's called Attention Deficit
             Disorder.
                     (spotting her
                       Blackberry)
             Is this about that chat room guy?
             It is, isn't it?
A look from the Exec reminds Parker of her headphones and
she pulls them off.
                           PARKER
             No! It's about spontaneity, which
             you obviously wouldn't know
             anything about.
                           DREW
             I swear to God, Parker, you go
             through boyfriends like Junior
             Mints. It's pathetic.
                           PARKER
             Pathetic? You want to talk about
             pathetic?! At least I don't count
             getting accidentally felt up in
             dodge ball as my first date!

                           PARKER (CONT'D)
             You're going to be eighteen and
             you've never even HAD a boyfriend!
The EXECUTIVE furrows his brow at Drew -- never?
                           DREW
             Is this any of your business?
He goes back to his paper.
                           DREW
             This is ridiculous. I don't    have
             time for this today. Fine.      Don't
             graduate from high school.     Make a
             mess of your life over some
             complete stranger. I don't     care.
             But leave me out. I have
             something important I need    to
             accomplish today, so please    go
             away.
                            EXECUTIVE
                     (to Parker)
             Would you like this seat so you
             two can fight?
                             DREW/PARKER
             No thank you.
Drew's ALARM WATCH BEEPS.
                           DREW
             I have to mentally preview my day
             now. I can't talk anymore.
Parker turns to go, then remembers something.
                           PARKER
             Uh, Drew? Do you have any money?
             I don't have enough for a ticket.
Drew just rolls her eyes and turns her back on her
sister.
The Executive peers over his spectacles at Parker with
the old paternal reprimand look.
                            PARKER
             Please.   Like you never ditched
             school.
                                                 CUT TO:

                                                    15.

INT. SECOND TRAIN CAR - MORNING
Parker's got her headphones back on and is SINGING Uncle
Cracker's "Follow Me," torturing everyone in her car.
                        PARKER
          'You don't know how you met me...'
But when she spots the CONDUCTOR ENTERING the front of
the car, she abruptly stops, slips down in he seat and
slides past the COMMUTER LADY next to her into the aisle.
                        PARKER
          Excuse me.
Parker heads the opposite direction from the ticket-
taking Conductor and out the back of the train car.

INT. THE TRAIN - WOMEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Parker stands by the door, waiting, listening to hear if
the coast is clear.
Sounds good. She cracks the door, steps out on tiptoes,
closes the door and THERE'S THE CONDUCTOR. He smiles.
                        CONDUCTOR
          Ticket, please.
                         PARKER
          Why don't I save the b.s. story
          and just ask you to cut me a break
          this one time because I know
          you've got a big heart and you
          remember what it was like when you
          were young and... and...
                  (off the Conductor's
                   look)
          ... randy?


EXT. TRENTON STATION PLATFORM - MORNING
Parker's on the platform. The Conductor climbs back on
the train into the FIRST CAR.
                        PARKER
                  (calling after)
          I guess you were never young and
          randy!
This is when she sees Drew sitting in the train window,
smiling and giving her a little victory wave.

                                                     16.

INT. FIRST TRAIN CAR - MORNING
The Conductor heads up the aisle -- does a double-take
when he sees Drew.
                           CONDUCTOR
          Very funny.
                           DREW
          Excuse me?
                           CONDUCTOR
          Let's go.
He takes her by the arm.
                        DREW
          What are you doing?
Drew scrambles to grab her bag, jacket, the little
inflatable lap desk falling to the floor.
                        CONDUCTOR
          I tried to be nice about it, but
          if you want the police involved,
          this is the way to do it.
                           DREW
          Police?     I didn't do anything.
                        CONDUCTOR
          No ticket, no train ride.
                        DREW
                  (realizing)
          No! That's not me! That was my
          twin sister you threw off!
                        CONDUCTOR
          Young lady, in thirty years I have
          heard every possible line but
          that's the lamest ever.
                        DREW
                  (pointing)
          She's right there!

ANGLE ON THE PLATFORM
No Parker.
He hauls Drew down the aisle but as they EXIT THE CAR,
SHE BUMPS HEAD-ON INTO BIKE MESSENGER/PRE-MED/MOUNTAIN
CLIMBER/MALE MODEL GUY -- they really do CRACK FOREHEADS,
OUCH!
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                       17.

CONTINUED:
IS DREW SEEING STARS? OR IS IT THE MAGIC OF THIS INSTANT
IN TIME WITH DREAM GUY?
BOTH OF THEM SHAKE OFF THE WOOZIES.     He smiles:
                            DREAM GUY
             You okay?
                            DREW
             I'm... ouch.
                           CONDUCTOR
             She's fine, considering she should
             be in jail.
As the Conductor escorts her down the stairs, she and
Dream Guy share a last look before she's...
... left on the platform just as the train's pulling out.
Still no sign of Parker and Drew doesn't have all her
wits about her.
                             DREW
             This   can't be happening! I have
             a...   a... little paper thingy.
             What   are they called? Ticket! I
             have   a ticket! It's right...
She drops her bag, contents spilling willy-nilly. On her
hands and knees, she frantically searches for her ticket
in the mess.
The Conductor, however, is already on the train stop as
it pulls away. He just waves, victorious.
Parker    steps back out onto the platform and the Conductor
spots    her. He looks from one sister to the other --
oops,    mistake. But it's too late. Sheepishly, he climbs
inside    and the train is gone.
                           DREW
                     (to the gods)
             AARRGGH! PARRR... KERRR!
Parker steps up from behind her.
                           PARKER
             You get kicked off, too? Why
             didn't you just buy a ticket?
Parker stoops to help collect a couple of things but
Drew, mad at hell, swats her hand away.
                                              (CONTINUED)

                           PARKER
             What happened to your head?
                           DREW
             Oh, just a minor concussion I
             sustained while the Conductor was
             throwing me off the train because
             he thought I was you sneaking back
             on the train!
                             PARKER
             Sorry.
                             DREW
             I'll bet.
Drew throws her bag over her shoulder and heads for the
ticket counter. The WELT on her forehead is gonna be a
doozey.
                             PARKER
                       (calling after)
             I am!    Where are you going?
                           DREW
             To see when the next train
             leaves.
                             PARKER
             I already --
But Drew's inside the stationhouse.
                          PARKER
             -- did. They said something about
             a delay.
Parker follows into the stationhouse.

INT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Packed with frustrated COMMUTERS. Drew's standing in a
long line at the ticket counter, steaming, turning a cold
shoulder on...
... Parker, who walks right through to the street side.

                                                   19.

EXT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - STREET SIDE - CONTINUOUS
ACTION
Parker steps outside where it's just as crowded. She
scopes the situation, which isn't good -- stranded
COMMUTERS jostle for the few remaining TAXIS.
TWO EXECUTIVES get into a shoving match.
To the left, a couple of BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CARS --
standard car service rigs -- sit IDLING, each with a
DRIVER next to it, holding up his sign with his client's
name scratched on it.
An EXECUTIVE (#2) passes her, finger in the air,
signaling the FIRST DRIVER who holds a sign that read:
"Wilcox."
                        EXECUTIVE #2
          That's me.
With no further ado, the driver opens the back door for
him, the Exec climbs in, the driver hustles around to his
side and in an instant, the car leaves the chaos behind.
Parker raises an eyebrow.    Hm.
The second driver (BENNIE) with a head like a cinder
block and no neck, is talking on his cell phone and
holding up a sign, "SCARPELLI."
Parker shoots a finger into the air. This barely gets
his attention but he nods, nonchalantly. Parker signals
again -- one minute -- then turns back inside.

INT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION
Drew has reached the counter, where a bitter TRAIN CLERK
who wishes he'd paid attention in school is tired of
angry commuters.
                        DREW
          That can't be.  I have to be there
          before two!
                        TRAIN CLERK
          Well, maybe if you flap your arms
          real fast you can fly there,
          because you won't get there on a
          train.
                        DREW
                  (about to explode)

Parker arrives in the nick of time, pulling her by the arm.
                            PARKER
             Come on.   Hurry. I got us a ride.
                           DREW
             Let go of my arm.
But Parker drags her away. Drew shoots a look back at
the Clerk, who sticks out his tongue at her.

EXT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Parker pulls Drew toward the Town Car.
                            DREW
             What's this?
                            PARKER
             A car service.
                           DREW
             Car service? You couldn't have
             called for a...
But Bennie opens the door for Parker like he's done it a
thousand times.
                            BENNIE
             Morning, miss.
                           PARKER
             Good morning. Thank you.   My
             sister's coming, too.
Drew KNOWS SOME SKETCHY SHIT IS GOING DOWN buy she's only
got this instant to consider. She glances at the
STRANDED MOB descending on a lone approaching CAB,
engulfing it.
                           PARKER
             You want to make that interview,
             or not?
Drew lets herself be pulled inside. Bennie shuts the
door and waddles around to his side.


INT. TOWN CAR - MORNING
Parker tries to play cool -- Drew's rigid -- angry and
afraid. Bennie checks his invoice.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                          21.

                           BENNIE
             So you're headed to the Teamster's
             Hall on Second Street?
                           PARKER
                     (chewing a lip)
             You know, Mister...
She checks his Chauffeur's License up front:        Benjamin
Loyola.
                              PARKER
             ... Loyola.
                              BENNIE
             Bennie.
                           PARKER
             Mr. Bennie? We have a slight
             change of itinerary. We need to
             go into Manhattan. 57th and 5th
             will be fine.
Bennie doesn't seem perturbed a bit.
                              BENNIE
             It's pre-paid.     No skin off my
             nose.
                           DREW
                     (whispering
                      throughout)
             Pre-paid? What's 57th and 5th?
                              PARKER
                        (whispering
                         throughout)
             Barneys.
                              DREW
             Not Barneys.
                           PARKER
             We've got five hours.     Relax.
He FIRES UP the LINCOLN and off they go.
Drew now has a pretty clear inclination as to what's
going on. She leans into her sister and WHISPERS.
                           DREW
             This was supposed to be someone
             else's car, wasn't it?
                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                        22.

CONTINUED:
                            PARKER
             So?
Just then, Bennie tosses the sign, which he'd stashed on
the dash, onto the seat next to him, face up so Drew can
read:
                            DREW
             'Scarpelli'?   We're supposed to be
             Italian?
                           PARKER
             Northern Italian.
                           DREW
             This is so... wrong.
                           PARKER
             What? You need to get to that
             interview. We now have a ride.
             We will pay for the ride. End of
             big deal.
This is when Bennie's CELL PHONE RINGS and he answers it.
                            BENNIE
             Yeah?
                     (beat)
             No.  The city.
                     (beat)
             What'a you talkin' about?
Bennie glances into the REARVIEW MIRROR, smiling at the
girls...
                           BENNIE
             I already got 'em.
... but his smile TURNS DOWN AT THE CORNERS as he
listens. The girls exchange doubtful looks. It gets
worse.
                           BENNIE
             They're right here in the car.
                     (to girls)
             'Scuse me.
Bennie RAISES THE PRIVACY GLASS but doesn't realize he's
left the intercom button on so they can still hear his
half of the conversation.
The girls are PETRIFIED.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                    23.

                     (low to Drew)
             Not good.
                           DREW
                     (swallowing)
             What's happening?
                            BENNIE
                      (to phone)
             Don't you think that's a little
             severe? I mean, they didn't see
             nothin' yet. They can't hear
             nothin'.
YES THEY CAN and they're now scared as hell.
                             BENNIE
             You're the boss.
                      (beat)
             Take it easy. I'll fix it.
                      (beat)
             No, I don't have a shovel. Not
             today. It'll be a big mess.
             Besides, I just had this suit
             cleaned.
The girls want OUT OF THIS CAR!
                           BENNIE
             I'll take 'em to the wharf, what
             difference does it make?
Drew yanks out her inhaler and sucks on it.
                            DREW
                      (whispered terror)
             Parker, I think maybe we should
             get out.
Parker sees the LIGHT AHEAD TURN RED.
                            PARKER
             I agree.   How about... NOW!
Just as Bennie brakes for the light, Parker throws her
door open and pulls Drew into the street!
An ONCOMING BUICK LOCKS UP its BRAKES as they dash for
the sidewalk.
                            BENNIE (O.S.)
             Hey?!   Where you goin'?!

                                                     24.

EXT. JERSEY SIDEWALK - MORNING
They hit the sidewalk and without breaking stride, race
around the first corner, looking back over their
shoulder.
                         PARKER
           He's stuck at the light!
VRROOOM!   Here comes the Lincoln storming around the
corner.
                         DREW
           He has no respect for traffic
           laws!
They run into the first ALLEY and hunker down by a
GARBAGE CAN. The Lincoln flies past. They dash back
out, the same way they came.
SCREECH!   Bennie LOCKS UP the WHEELS!
They round the same corner going the opposite way and
Parker pulls them into the first door...

INT. MINI-MART - MORNING
... where they crouch down the magazine rack. Among the
magazines is DOG FANCY with a picture of a Chinese
Crested Hairless on the cover and the headline: "EMPEROR
DEFENDS CROWN."
Parker peers over the top and out the window.
PARKER'S POV -- slowly, the Lincoln cruises the street,
Bennie scanning the neighborhood for them.
                         DREW
           Is he gone? I can't believe this.
           What did you get us into?
                           PARKER
           We lost him.    Wow. That was a
           rush.
                          DREW
           A rush?   Are you out of your mind?
                          BUM (O.S.)
           Hey.   Give me a quarter, will ya?
Spooked, they both turn to find a scraggly HOMELESS GUY
with a Slushee in his hand. They stand. Parker reaches
in her pocket.
                                             (CONTINUED)

                           MINI-MART CLERK
             Get outta here, Uncle Jerry!
                           PARKER
                     (to Homeless Guy)
             I don't have any change, but here.
Parker starts to find the Homeless Guy a dollar but Drew
reaches over to stop her...
                            DREW
             Parker, you're only feeding the
             poor man's disease. Buy him a
             healthy snack.
... just as the Homeless Guy reaches for the dollar and
the SLUSHEE IS KNOCKED FROM HIS HAND.
We watch in SLOW MOTION AS THE SLUSHEE TAKES FLIGHT, THE
CAP FALLING OFF AND THE STICKY, CHERRY RED MESS FANNING
OUT UNTIL...
... BACK TO FAST MOTION -- SPLAT!     IT CATCHES DREW FULL-
FACED, DRENCHING HER.
The Homeless Guy snags the dollar.
                           HOMELESS GUY
             I gotta go.
And he EXITS.     Parker SNIFFS.
                          PARKER
             Ew. That stinks. That's not just
             Slushee.
The MINI-MART CLERK approaches them, shaking his head.
                           MINI-MART CLERK
             It's Mad Dog. Look at that mess.
             It's gonna smell up the store all
             day.
Drew appears STUNNED, unable to form words so Parker
speaks for her.
                           PARKER
             May we use your bathroom please?
The cherry syrup and cheap wine concoction drips down
Drew's blank face.
                           MINI-MART CLERK
             Gas station at the end of the
             block. Have a nice day.

                                                      26.

INT. BURT'S PUMP 'N' GO - MORNING
BURT, who has no teeth, hands over the restroom key to
the girls. The key is attached to a full-sized STEERING
WHEEL. Burt SNIFFS, wrinkling his nose.
                        BURT
          You know, it's not my place to
          say, but you young girls got your
          whole lives ahead of you. You
          shouldn't be drinkin' at this hour
          of the day.
                        PARKER
          That's what I keep telling her.
                        BURT
          'Round the side.

EXT. BURT'S PUMP 'N' GO - MORNING
The girls practically have to drag the key around to the
restroom on the side.
Parker puts the key in and slowly... slowly...
CREAKING... opens the GATES OF HELL
ON THE GIRLS -- WHO STARE IN HORROR INTO THE ABYSS FOR A
BEAT, THEN:
                         GIRLS
          AHHHHHHH!!!!
                                            CUT TO:


INT. BUS - MORNING
Sitting side by side. A YOUNG MOTHER sits in front of
them with her NINE-MONTH-OLD BABY who's standing on the
seat facing the girls.
Drew's BUMP on her forehead is large and inflamed, her
hair a stringy, ratty mess of booze and red-dye number
four and glucose. She is in a REALLY BAD MOOD, only
staring straight ahead.
Parker's playing peek-a-boo with the baby and trying to
lighten up her sister's mood.
                        PARKER
          Everything's going to be fine.
                  (to baby)
          Peek-a-boo!

                     (to Drew)
             We're practically there. We'll
             get you cleaned up, you'll get
             into the program and...
                     (to baby)
             Peek-a-boo!
                     (to Drew)
             ... we'll both look back on this
             and laugh our butts off.
BLECCH! The BABY PUKES all over Drew.       She looks
sideways at her sister.
                           DREW
             I will never, ever, forgive you.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - MORNING
The bus pulls over then pulls away, leaving the girls on
the sidewalk.
                            PARKER
             See?   New York. We made it.
                           DREW
             I could be arrested for vagrancy
             looking like this.
                            PARKER
             Listen.   I've got an idea.
                           DREW
             No. No ideas. I'm going straight
             to that interview and wait,
             without moving or speaking,
             especially to you, for four hours.
                           PARKER
                     (ignoring her)
             Come on! We're going to the
             Plaza! We can be Eloise! We'll
             get a nice room, you can take a
             shower and I'll swap clothes with
             you! Simple as that!
                           DREW
             Do you have the slightest clue
             what that would cost?

             So? You've got the emergency
             credit card Mom gave you, right?
Drew's suddenly looking at her EMPTY HANDS.
                             PARKER
             What's wrong?
                            DREW
                      (dawning realization)
             Oh.   My. God.

                     (near coma)
             I left it in his car.

             Oh.
                           DREW
             He knows where I live. He's going
             to hunt me down and kill me.
                            PARKER
             Come on, Drew. I don't think even
             the Mafia kills people just for
             scamming a ride. Quit being
             paranoid.
                     (beat)
             So, we don't do the Plaza. I've
             got...
Parker digs in her pockets.
                           PARKER
             Six dollars and thirty-two cents.
                           DREW
             That won't get me hosed down at a
             car wash.
                           PARKER
             What are we thinking? You've got
             your secret-safety twenty!
                            DREW
                     (beat)
             My secret-safety twenty. Of

Parker looks her sister right in the eye.
                             DREW
             Yeah.
Drew takes off her shoe, lifts the inner sole and pulls
out a twenty, then realizes:
                           DREW
             Hey, how'd you know about my
             secret-safety twenty?
                           PARKER
             That's not important now. But
             let's just say that it's a good
             thing for you I think those shoes
             are so ugly I never borrowed them.
                     (pointing)
             Hey, how about there?
Parker points to hotel where the dilapidated sign reads:
THE RITZY PLAZA -- HOURLY RATES, HOT TUBS.
                           DREW
             No. I want to get clean, not
             contract hepatitis.

             We touch nothing.
Parker leads them inside.

INT. THE RITZY PLAZA
This looks like a good place to get your throat cut
fighting over a dime's worth of crack.
There's no real       lobby, just a small area to stand at the
"desk" which is       behind iron bars. Behind the iron bars a
rabbit-eared TV       with a busted-in tube houses a dead
houseplant. An        old easy chair leaks stuffing.

Above, a BABY SCREECHES. Something BREAKS.        Then a
DISEMBODIED VOICE SPEAKS to them.

             Keep your pants on. What'dya
             want?
The girls look behind them, nobody.       Behind the bars?
Still nobody. What the hell?
                           DESK CLERK (O.S.)
             I don't got all day.

             We need a room... with a shower.
             Just for an hour.
There's the sound of something SCRAPING across the floor
and then the MIDGET HOTEL CLERK appears behind the
counter. Now he's standing on a STOOL and we don't know
what he was doing behind the counter.
                            DESK CLERK
             Sixty bucks.

                           DESK CLERK
             Maybe if you two were in school
             you could figure out that half a
             sixty is thirty.
                           PARKER
             We've only got twenty-five.

             All right, all right, don't    get
             your underwear in a bunch.     As a
             public service, just 'cause    you
             stink so bad, you can have    it for
             twenty-five.
He retrieves a key and holds it up just out of reach
between the bars.
                           DESK CLERK
             Ten-dollar deposit on key.

             What part of 'That is all the

             next thing you know, you two are
             telling everybody, hey, this
             midget was a real sap. We gave

                               DREW
             Not a word.      Girl Scout's honor.
He grudgingly holds out the key for Parker, who takes it
and hands it to Drew while she gets the money out.
ON DREW -- sensing something, she looks down at her feet
where a HUGE RAT is licking the sweet stuff off her
shoes.
There's a rather LONG BEAT while this horror sinks in,
then:
                              DREW
             AHHHHHH!!!!
Key in hand, Drew makes a beeline out the door.
                              PARKER
             Drew?!   DREW?!
Parker follows her.
                           DESK CLERK
             Come back with my key!
The Desk Clerk jumps off his stool, opens his cage and
follows them into the street.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HOTEL - DAY
Panicked, Drew sprints down the sidewalk with Parker and
the Desk Clerk in tow.
Laying the hammer down, the Desk Clerk blasts past Parker
-- he's a midget, but he's got wheels.

THEM BOTH INTO THE LINE OF AUDIENCE MEMBERS, WHO THEN
TOPPLE LIKE DOMINOES.

             All right.   Who's the wise guy?
Parker pulls Drew out of the pile-up and grabs the key,
tossing it away from them, sending the Desk Clerk
scrambling after it.
The two girls HIGH TAIL IT around the corner.       Winded,
they stop.
                           PARKER

             Parker, it was not 'our' money and
             this is not 'our' day in New York.
             What it is, is quite possibly the
             most important day of my life.
             I've resigned myself to the fact
             that you don't give a crap about
             what you do with yours, but if you
             could find it in your heart, your
             tiny, cold steel heart, to respect
             what this means to me, I would
             appreciate it.
But Parker's not listening.       She's staring intently...
... ACROSS THE STREET where several TOWN CARS are parked,
the DRIVERS chatting next to a HOT DOG/PRETZEL CART.
Among them is Bennie, sipping coffee.       Parker spots him
and freezes.
                           DREW
             You're not even listening. That's
             typical. Look, we're splitting
             up. Give me back my secret safety
             money.
                             PARKER
                     (still looking past
                       Drew)
             You know how I told you not to be
             paranoid?

             Paranoid?
                           PARKER
             What I meant was, it isn't
             paranoia if someone really is
             chasing you.
Parker tries to subtly indicate with her eyes that Drew
should look across the street.
                           DREW
             What's wrong with your eyes?

Drew finally turns and she, too, freezes.
                            PARKER
             Quiet.   Don't run. He'll see us.
Not wanting to draw his attention, the Girls shuffle off
quickly down the street.
ON Bennie -- squinting across at them. Can he make them
out in the crowd? He nods to ANOTHER DRIVER, tosses his
coffee cup and climbs in behind the wheel.
                           DREW
             HE SAW US!
The girls break into a run.
                           DREW
             How'd he find us?
                           PARKER
             Maybe it's just coincidence!
                           DREW
             Or maybe WE TOLD HIM WHERE WE WERE
             GOING!!
She points up at the street sign -- 57th and 5th.   Oops.
                           PARKER
             Come on!
Parker leads her into traffic, HORNS BLARING, as they
weave their way across. On the far side, a HORSE
CARRIAGE pulls away from the curb and at the last minute,
Parker spots a fresh pile of...
... HORSE SHIT, which she manages to leap. Drew,
however, ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT OVER. She closes her
eyes.
                           PARKER
             Jump!
Drew stumbles, wrong-foots the takeoff but somehow
manages to get across it to the curb. For just a BEAT,
we see her surprised face. Hm. I did it.
Then they see Bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and
puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits
in full stride, slips on, and PLOPS INTO on his ass.
This gives the girls the opening they need and they ditch
inside some revolving doors.

                                                    36.

INT. THE PLAZA - GIRLS' POV - DAY
IN THE STREET, Bennie's getting up, brushing the crap
off. When a CAB HONKS at him, he gives it an Italian
salute and slaps the hood, but when he reaches the curb
it's clear: He's lost the girls.

DREW AND PARKER

                     (noticing)
             Is that guy looking at me?
Parker starts to look.
                           DREW
             Don't look.
                           PARKER
             When you ask a question like that,
             the person is going to look.
Drew drags her behind a palm. Sure enough, across the
lobby, a guy dressed as PLAINCLOTHES HOTEL SECURITY
(MORTY SESTERO) now pretends he wasn't keeping an eye on
them.
                           DREW
             I think he was.
                           PARKER

                           DREW
             Yeah, but I'm standing in the
             lobby of the Plaza looking like a
             deranged street person who might
             attack at any moment. In fact, I
             might attack at any moment.
The ELEVATOR behind them opens.
                           PARKER
             Let's go.
The girls slip into the elevator.     When it closes,
Morty's watching.

INT. HALLWAY - THE PLAZA - DAY
The girls climb out of the elevator and sneak to the end
of the hall where Parker stops and peers back around the

             We're not going to break anything.
                     (beat)
             We are going to enter, however.
                               DREW
             No.   No.   No.
                           PARKER
             Shhh... here comes somebody.
DOWN THE HALL a door swings open and MR. AND MRS. LO
BIANCHO, wealthy Bostonians, EXIT their suite.

ANOTHER ANGLE
REVEALS -- at the opposite end of the hallway, Parker and
Drew aren't the only ones watching. A PAINTER with one
lazy eye, ROGER, pauses with his roller and carefully
peeks around the corner.
                           MRS. LO BIANCHO
             It's the New York Kennel Club,
             Emile, not the New York
             Knickerbockers. Please call the
             caterer and cancel the beer.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                          39.

CONTINUED:
The ELEVATOR OPENS       for them and they step in. Parker
RUNS LIKE HELL for       the door of their suite... it's just
about to close when       she SLIDES LIKE PETE ROSE INTO FIRST,
just getting a hand       on it.
She lies there on the floor, holding the door and
WHISPERS LOUDLY to Drew.
                                PARKER
             Hurry up!
                                DREW
             No!
                            PARKER
                     (beat)
             I didn't want to have to do this,
             but... look in the mirror behind
             you.
ON DREW -- bracing herself, she turns slowly.
                                                CUT TO:

INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE - DAY
Practically sewn to Parker, Drew follows her into the
suite, both nervous, tiptoeing.
                           PARKER
                     (tentatively)
             Housekeeping?
                                                CUT TO:


INT. THE PLAZA - HALLWAY
At the end of the hallway, the PAINTER watches the suite
door close. Hm. What are those girls doing?

INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE
It's lavish, yaddada yaddada.
                           DREW
             I can't do this.
                           PARKER
             Drew, you're not a criminal. You
             just smell like one. This way.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                    40.

CONTINUED:
Parker leads her to the big double doors of the master
bedroom and slowly OPENS them.
There, on the bed, is THE EMPEROR, defending champion of
the New York Kennel Club Dog Show. A CHINESE CRESTED
HAIRLESS with his little crown sticking straight up, he
may be the most absurd-looking dog in history. He simply
eyes them. He might even be smiling.
                           DREW
             Oh, no.  Oh my god. A... a...
                     (puzzled)
             What the hell is it?
                           PARKER
             A dog?
                           DREW
             I'm itching already.   See?   Are my
             arms red?
Drew backs away -- she's about to break for the door.
                           PARKER
             Key down. I'll take him in the
             living room and keep a lookout.
             You just get in that shower.
Parker approaches The Emperor.
                           PARKER
                     (baby talk)
             Hi, little guy. You don't look so
             tough, huh? You don't look much
             like a dog, actually. More like
             Woody Woodpecker.
Happy to give the company, The Emperor practically jumps
into Parker's arms.
                           PARKER
             You're cute, aren't you, in a
             freakazoidal kinda way.
She takes him into the living room and moves to the door.
                           PARKER
             Was your daddy a rat? Is that it?
             Well, I still like you.
Parker, holding The Emperor, opens the door a crack to
keep a lookout.

                                                       41.

PARKER'S POV
The hallway's empty.
But The Emperor, feeling frisky, leaps from her arms into
the hallway, then turns TO face her. Come on. Let's
play!

BACK TO SCENE
                        PARKER
          Come back here, little ratdog.
          Come to Mommy Parker.
Parker pulls off a shoe and sticks it in the doorway to
keep it from closing, then, hesitantly, trying not to
spook him into running away from her, she steps into the
hallway.


INT. HALLWAY - THE PLAZA
But sure enough, just as she gets close, he turns and
dashes down the hallway.
                           PARKER
          Bad ratdog!
She chases him down the hallway     and then around the
corner where they have to dodge     cans of paints, a ladder,
until finally The Emperor slides     on some plastic
sheeting, careens into a can of     mauve paint and is
COVERED.
Arms reach down, pick him up and Parker looks up to see
the Painter (ROGER) with the now-mauve Emperor in his
arms.
                         PARKER
                   (breathless)
          Wow.   Thank you.
                          ROGER
                 Thank you. Bye bye.
          No.
He turns and RUNS for the stairwell door marked
EXIT. Parker, completely baffled, finally calls after
him:
                        PARKER
          That's not your dog!      Hey!

                                                        42.

ANGLE ON THE ELEVATORS AROUND THE CORNER
as they open   and the HOUSE SECURITY GUY (Morty) steps
out, looking both ways and spotting one thing awry...
... a shoe holding open the door to the Lo Bianchos'
suite.
                                              CUT TO:

INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE - MASTER BATH - DAY
Drew finishes struggling out of the last of her sticky
clothes and gets ONE FOOT IN THE SHOWER WHEN SHE HEARS:
                       HOUSE SECURITY GUY (O.S.)
          Hello? Mrs. Lo Biancho? House
          security!
POOR NAKED DREW FREEZES. THE WORLD STOPS SPINNING ON ITS
AXIS. Panicking, she grabs the shower curtain, pulling
it off its hanger and covering herself.


INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
The SECURITY GUY snoops toward the bedroom doors. Just
as he reaches for the handle, the door swings open,
SHADOCK, clocking him and dropping him.
Wrapped in the shower curtain, Drew races across the
living room. Just as she reaches the hallway, Parker's
there, also at a dead run and they don't even break
stride.

INT. THE PLAZA - HALLWAY
                        DREW
                  (panicked)
          There's a man in there!
                        PARKER
          Somebody took the dog!
They reach the end of the hallway and are TRAPPED.
Only one out. Parker HUFFS OPEN the window to the fire
escape and they climb out...

EXT. PLAZA ALLEY FIRE ESCAPE/ALLEY - DAY
... and scurry down the stairs only to find that THE
LADDER DOESN'T REACH.
                                           (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Parker hangs and then drops onto the top of a DUMPSTER
with one side of the lid still closed, then jumps to the
alley.
                             PARKER
             Hurry up!
But DREW'S FROZEN WITH FEAR and to complicate matters,
she's struggling to keep the curtain wrapped around
herself.
                           DREW
             I'll, uh, go around.
                           PARKER
             Are you out of your mind?!    It's
             only a little ways! JUMP!

INT. THE PLAZA - HALLWAY
Rubbing his sore head, Morty the Security Guy lumbers
down the hallway.
BEHIND HIM Mr. and Mrs. Lo Biancho get out of the
elevator:
                           MRS. LO BIANCHO
                     (peeved)
             When competing in a dog show, best
             to bring one's dog along, yes?
                           MR. LO BIANCHO
             I thought you had him, dear.
                            MRS. LO BIANCHO
                      (holding up her hands)
             See?   Empty.
But now they both notice the DOOR to their suite is wide
open.
                             MRS. LO BIANCHO
             Oh, dear God!
The elderly couple do their version of a panicked run
inside.
                           MRS. LO BIANCHO (O.S.)
                     (screeching)
             AHHHH!! MY BABY! SOMEONE'S
             KIDNAPPED MY BABY!

CONTINUED:
ON MORTY -- making an abrupt halt. Baby?!          He turns
around and lopes back to the suite.
                           MORTY
             Mrs. Lo Biancho? I'm Mort
             Sestero, hotel security.

                           MORTY
                     (somewhat relieved)
             The Emperor is a dog, right?
                           MRS. LO BIANCHO
             Not 'a' dog, no. THE NEW YORK
             KENNEL CLUB CHAMPION AND WHY
             AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FIND HIM!
Morty pulls his RADIO as he backs out the door and heads
down the hall.

                      (to radio)

Drew's still FROZEN on the fire escape.
                             DREW
             I can't do it!
                             PARKER
             Yes you can!


ANGLE ON THE END OF THE ALLEY
where Roger appears with The Emperor. Surprised        to see
the girls, he backpedals, worried he'll be seen,       but
they're too wrapped up in their own getaway and       he
quietly makes his way to his VAN (painted on the       back and
sides: "Michelangelo's Painting: A Masterpiece         every
time".
                             DREW

Roger's VAN SQUEALS AWAY, drawing Parker's attention.
She glimpses him in his side mirror as he disappears
around the corner into traffic.
Shutting her eyes, Drew drops onto the closed lid of the
dumpster.
                           DREW
                     (astonished)
             I did it.
Oops, the curtain starts to slip. When she reaches for
it she loses her balance and suddenly -- FWONK --
nosedives into the dumpster. The curtain floats INTO THE
ALLEY at Parker's feet.
                              DREW (O.S.)
             OW!
                           PARKER

                     (beat)
             Give me... my... curtain.
Parker tosses the curtain in and Drew climbs out.        They
hurry off down the alley.

                             MORTY
             Stop!    Bring back that dog!
MORTY'S POV -- The girls near the end of the alley. A
small dog could easily be concealed under that shower
curtain.
ON THE GIRLS -- running full-tilt, Drew turns to Parker.
                           DREW
             He thinks we have the dog!

WHAM! -- Drew's       CLOTHESLINED at the intersection by a
BIKE MESSENGER       who, in a valiant attempt to avoid her,
brakes so hard       he flies off the handlebars and lands
RIGHT ON TOP OF       HER.

             You know, one of us is gonna get

Parker yanks Drew from underneath Dream Guy.

The girls weave through the PEDESTRIANS but spot a COP
CAR SCREECHING to a halt in front of them and quickly
take a left into...

Where to now? Thinking fast, Parker pulls on a door --
locked -- the next door SWINGS OPEN as if by divine
providence and two HIGH FASHION MODELS step past them out
while the girls step inside.

          Where are they?! No more breaks!
          Do you hear me! We have a show to
          do, you nitwits! Models! BAH!
          You have hollow gourds for heads!
          The kind they make those Mexican
          rattles out of!
                           SHOWRUNNER
                     (always at his elbow)
          Maracas.
                        BOBO
          Maracas! Maracas that take coffee
          breaks when I am paying them a
          FORTUNE!
Bobo spots the girls coming through the back door and
physically grabs them both, pushing them at the
Showrunner.
                          BOBO
          Hair!  Makeup!
                   (Parker)
          Daywear!
                   (Drew)
          Clubbing! Vite!
This is when he gets a load of Drew's matted hair,
running makeup and shower curtain and does a double-take.
Hm. Does he like it?
                        BOBO
                  (confess)
          Is that Helmut Lang?
                  (recovering himself)
          Go!
The Showrunner shoves Drew one way, Parker the other --
Drew looks at her -- what the hell? Parker CLEARLY
MOUTHS: HAIR! MAKEUP! CLOTHES! and TEAMS OF DRESSERS
virtually surround them.
INSIDE THE MOB OF DRESSERS SURROUNDING DREW the HAIR
STYLIST raises his brush and scissors, but PAUSES.
The rest of the team stops, watching him make his
decision. He shrugs.

He excuses himself and the others begin shoving her into
couture.
                                              CUT TO:

DRESSING TEAM - A MOMENT LATER
And   the DRESSING TEAM surrounding Parker parts, revealing
her   in a very un-Parker-like, super-chic business suit.
She   catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and rolls
her   eyes. Boring.
The DREW TEAM parts and    we are stunned to see they've
chosen to drape her in a    show-stopping couture FREAK SHOW
OUTFIT that is some sort    of marriage between dominatrix
and nun, complete with a    habit and black leather bikini.
ON PARKER who spots Drew and is, for the first time in
the movie, speechless.
                           DREW
             Why does this not surprise me?
THE NEXT MUSIC CUE COMES UP and the SHOWRUNNER grabs
Drew...
                           DREW
             Excuse me, but I'm supposed to be
             going to my college interview.
                          SHOWRUNNER
             That's rich. A model going to
             college. What next? Talking
             monkeys?
... and pushes her through the curtains and...


INT. RUNWAY - DAY
FLASH go a hundred CAMERAS! Blinded, Drew stumbles
forward on a nine-inch spiked heels down the catwalk.
ON THE AUDIENCE -- ALSO SPEECHLESS.
This is when Drew catches sight of herself on a TV
MONITOR at the end of the walk.
                                              (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Her first instinct is to RUN, but suddenly THE AUDIENCE
HAS DECIDED -- IT'S A SMASH! THEY APPLAUD MADLY! BRAVO!
BRAVO!
Drew recovers herself a bit.        Wow.   They're clapping for
me?

INT. RUNWAY SHOW - BACKSTAGE
Parker's watching through the curtains when she spots
Morty leading two NYPD DETECTIVES (WILLIAMSON AND HOGAN)
through the back door. Uh-oh.
The Showrunner's holding her arm, waiting to throw her
onstage but when Morty turns in her direction, Parker
takes the initiative and...


INT. RUNWAY
... jumps onstage, vamping it down the catwalk like she
was born to it.
Drew's still at the end of the runway, basking in the
APPLAUSE and attempting to negotiate a precarious turn in
her SCARY SPIKED HEELS when Parker approaches her and...
... throws a hand on her hip, thrusts it out -- sexy
executive! and leans into her sister:
                           PARKER
                     (whispering)
             The hotel guy's here.
The juxtaposition of the TWO POLAR OPPOSITE OUTFITS
draped over twins suddenly throws the audience into
PAROXYSMS OF APPRECIATION for the inspiration of the
artist and they call him out! Bobo! BOBO! AUTEUR!
BRAVA!
Here comes a smiling Bobo, through the curtains, blowing
kisses and heading for the girls.
                           PARKER
                     (louder)
             And the police.
Bobo presses himself between the girls, taking their
hands and beginning his bows, but the girls spot Morty
peeking from backstage, and they TAKE OFF, leaping off
the front of the stage into the audience like punks
jumping into the mosh pit.
                                                 (CONTINUED)

The ADORING CROWD holds them up and they CROWD SURF
toward the rear of the room.
                           DREW
             Everybody washed their hands,
             right?

ANGLE ON MORTY
Spotting the commotion, he and the two cops race down the
catwalk. Realizing he'll never get through the crowd,
he, too, leaps off the stage to surf toward them but...
THE CROWD ABRUPTLY PARTS and he does a complete FACE
PLANT.
                           HOGAN
             I guess that explains why he's a
             security guard.


ANGLE ON THE GIRLS
who bust out the back doors of the large room and
unwittingly...

INT. THE PLAZA - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
... right back into The Plaza lobby.
                              DREW
                        (realizing)
             Perfect.
                           PARKER
             Is this what they call 'returning
             to the scene of the crime'?
Unfortunately for them, to get to the front door they
have to pass by...
... the PLAZA MANAGER and the other HOUSE SECURITY AGENT,
BRUCE (butch haircut, bad suit), consoling Mrs. Lo
Biancho.
When MORTY and the COPS come through the doors behind
them, however, there's no choice.
The girls try to look as inconspicuous as possible
heading for the revolving doors but they overhear:
                                                (CONTINUED)

                           PLAZA MANAGER
             I assure you, Mr. and Mrs. Lo
             Biancho, The Plaza will do
             everything in its power to see
             that The Emperor is safely
             returned and that the criminals
             are brought to justice.
                           MRS. LO BIANCHO
             Justice?! I want them executed!
             Tortured first, slowly, and then
             beheaded!
                           PLAZA MANAGER
             The Plaza's policy is of course to
             serve you in any capacity we can.
Morty spots the girls across the lobby just as they reach
the revolving doors.
                             MORTY
                       (calling)
             Bruce!    10-80 at the wagon wheel!
Bruce looks over to Morty like he's speaking Slavic, but
Morty's furiously pointing and Bruce sees...
THE GIRLS break for the revolving doors. Parker gets
there first, plunges in so fast that a MAN ENTERING is
tossed headlong into the lobby.
Drew tries to time the quickly-spinning door but one of
the very high SPIKED HEELS catches, throwing her forward
and sandwiching her in the revolving door.
                             DREW
                       (no breath)
             Park...
OUTSIDE -- Parker sees Drew caught in the door as Bruce,
Morty and the cops close in. Quickly, Parker pushes the
door back, releasing Drew, who jumps in and swings out.

EXT. THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Then, Parker HEAVES THE DOOR WITH ALL HER MIGHT, spinning
it so fast the security guys and cops can't jump in.


INT. LOBBY OF THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The four men all stand there, watching the spinning door.

CONTINUED:
                           MORTY
             Damn it!
Then, just    to their right, an ELDERLY WOMAN walks through
the regular    door just adjacent the revolving doors. All
four share    a sheepish look -- uh, maybe we should have
thought of    that -- then BOLT outside.

EXT. THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The police and security look left, right, across the
street.
                           BRUCE
             Where'd they go?
                           HOGAN
             They couldn't have gone very far.
             We'll split up.
                     (pointing)
             You go that way! You take Fifth!
             Come on, get on your horse!
Morty and Bruce take the cop's order and race off in
separate directions. Neither Hogan nor his partner
moves.
                           WILLIAMSON
             Coffee?
                           HOGAN
             Sure.
Williamson and Hogan step over to a hot dog cart set up
next to a NEWSPAPER STAND.

                           WILLIAMSON
             Beats me. They didn't have any
             stupid dog with them from what I
             could see.
                           HOGAN
             Might have stashed it.

The cops giggle at this.

             The rent-a-cop said the mutt's
             worth like 50 G's. That makes it
             grand theft, my friend. Five to
             ten.

ANGLE ON THE NEWS STAND
where a BLIND CASHIER (SPEEDY) smiles at the two
policemen.
                            HOGAN
                      (to blind cashier)
             Hey, Speedy. You didn't see a
             couple of blondes run past here,
             did you?
                           SPEEDY
             Yep. Couldn't miss 'em. Real
             criminal types. Looked like they
             were headed to Mexico.
                           HOGAN
             That's where they all go.


ANOTHER ANGLE
REVEALS Drew and Parker, crouched down behind the counter
right next to Speedy.

             I say we put Abbott and Costello
             on the ransom watch. I don't want
             to be stuck in the same room all
             day with Leona Helmsley's nasty
             stepsister.

             A painter did.
                           SPEEDY
             You girls best give yourselves up
             and tell 'em the story.

             Of course he's right. We're going
             to march in there and give
             ourselves up right this minute.
             They will, of course, take us down
             to the precinct, call Mom and Dad,
             we'll give our statement, they'll
             grill us under hot lights for a
             few hours, force us to confess
             with some tricky good cop/bad cop
             routine and the next thing you

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - CHARLEY'S STUDY
Head thrown back, mouth wide open, still in his        bathrobe,
Charley sleeps in the chair directly in front of        his
laptop. The SCREENSAVER, an animated version of         Jack
Nicholson in THE SHINING, just keeps typing "All        work and
no play..."
When the PHONE RINGS it nearly knocks him out of his
chair. He hunts it down through the MAELSTROM on his
desk.

out.

Charley's driving,      eating a sandwich and dialing his CELL

             I'm going into the City to meet
             some big shot publisher. Maybe
             I'll swing by NYU afterwards and
             see if I can give Drew a ride

             She's probably having too much fun
             to call. I'll ring her up. Bye

He hangs up and of course veers into the other lane
again, correcting wildly before resuming his merry way.

A SOCIETY FRIEND of Mrs. Lo Biancho, BABS, arrives to pay

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           67.

                           WARREN
             Hey, Angie, take the 11:00 for me,
             will you?
                             ANGIE (TOUR GUIDE)
             No way.    Judge Judy's on.
Drew grabs Angie by the collar, lifts her up.
                             DREW
             Angie?    Take the 11:00.
                           ANGIE
                     (to Warren)
             You owe me, Warren.
Angie heads out to take the tour.        Parker turns on
Warren.
                           PARKER
             Are you a lying sack, or what?
                           WARREN
             What was I supposed to do? I
             liked you. If I'd sent a real
             picture, would you have met me?
                           PARKER
             That's not the point.
                           WARREN
             That means no. At least this way
             I got to see you before you blow
             me off.
                           DREW
             No one is blowing you off, Warren.
             As a matter of fact, we're very
             happy to see you, aren't we,
             Parker?
                             PARKER
             I guess.
                           DREW
             And we're grateful for your help.
                           PARKER
             This is my sister, Drew.
                           WARREN
             Not-a-twin, huh?
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          68.

CONTINUED:
                            PARKER
             That's a joke.
                           WARREN
             Yeah, well. I guess everybody
             would like the world to see them a
             little bit differently than they
             are.
                           DREW
                     (quickly interjecting)
             Super. Now that that's all
             settled, is there a restroom I can
             get to without going out there?
                           WARREN
             What's wrong with going out there?
                           PARKER
             Police, for one thing.
                            WARREN
             Police?   I thought you guys were
             joking.
                           PARKER
             It's the kind of joke that will be
             a lot funnier a few years from now.
                            WARREN
             Well that door's the only way out.
             There's a restroom at the end of
             the main hall.
Parker opens the office door, peeking out.
                            DREW
             They there?
                           PARKER
             I don't see 'em.

ANGLE ON WILLIAMSON AND HOGAN
who Parker can't see because her line of sight is blocked
by the office door.


BACK TO DREW AND WARREN
                           DREW
             They must be searching the
             building.
                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                         69.

CONTINUED:
                           WARREN
             What'd you guys do, anyway?    Mug a
             couple supermodels?
                            DREW
             Let's go.
With Warren leading the way, they EXIT the office.

INT. U.N. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY
The three make their way across the vast lobby, but
before they reach the main hall...
                            HOGAN (O.S.)
                      (spotting them)
             Hey!   You two! Stop!
                            WARREN
             This way!
Almost instinctively, they go COMPLETELY SEPARATE WAYS,
Warren and Parker breaking left, Drew right.
Drew makes a mad dash down a hallway, makes a turn,
another turn, working her way deeper into the labyrinth.
Even while running frantically, she tries to smile
politely at everyone she passes until she spots a WOMEN'S
room and quickly ditches inside.


INT. U.N. - WOMEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
She hurriedly crosses, enters a stall, locks the door and
puts her feet up. She tries to catch her breath.
GROANS OF PAIN ECHO from the stall next to her.
Somebody's in BAD SHAPE.      Another HEART-RENDING GROAN
can't be ignored.
                           DREW
                     (to person in stall)
             Are you okay?
                           CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE
                     (near fatally
                      nauseous)
             Ohhh... I'm so sick. The mussels
             at lunch. You have to help me.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           70.

CONTINUED:
                           DREW
             I'm kind of in my own private hell
             right now.
                           CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE
             What's your name?
                             DREW
             Drew.
                           CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE
             Drew... it's vitally important.
A FILE FOLDER comes skidding from under the stall.
                             CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE
             Please.    You have to take this to
             Canada.
                             DREW
             Uh, Canada?    It's sort of far away.
                           CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE
                     (struggling)
             In the Assembly. Give the file to
             Mr. Wakefield, the Canadian
             representative.
                     (GROANNN!!)
             Please. I can't... get up.
                           DREW
             You want me to take this to the
             Canadian Representative to the
             United Nations?
                             CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE
             Hurry!    This is a crisis!
What can she possibly do?
                             DREW
                       (confused but...)
             Okay.
Drew EXITS the stall and goes to the door.
                           DREW
             Where's the Assembly?
                             CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE
             To the left.    Run!
Drew peeks out the door.       It looks clear.   Out she goes.
                                                 CUT TO:

                                                       71.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MAILROOM
On the run, Warren and Parker ditch through a door marked
MAILROOM. A BEAT LATER, Hogan appears from around the
corner.

INT. MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vacant and quiet. The DOOR OPENS SLOWLY and Hogan
ENTERS. It's a small room with a few canvas mail sacks
piled in a corner and a wall of mail-sorting cubbies.
An in-house MONITOR mutely broadcasts the now empty
ASSEMBLY ROOM.
Nothing here, Hogan closes the door. IN A BEAT, one of
the mail sacks wriggles and Warren sticks his head up.
                           WARREN
          He's gone.
Parker pops up from the same sack. Face to face, there's
an awkward moment of attraction between them.
                        WARREN
                  (no better idea)
          You have nice breath.
                         PARKER
          Thank you.
                  (beat)
          Maybe we should get out of this
          sack.
                                             CUT TO:


INT. U.N. ASSEMBLY - DAY
Drew peeks in through the door, reading the COUNTRY
IDENTIFICATIONS on the desks... Bangkok, Borneo,
Bulgaria... Canada.
The REPRESENTATIVES are in the middle of a heated DEBATE
that we hear being translated (and we see in subtitles).
                        CHINESE REP
                  (Chinese; subtitles)
          Impossible! This would be
          globally destabilizing!
                         BULGARIAN REP
                   (pointing angry finger)
          Hah!   Posturing and rhetoric!
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                            72.

CONTINUED:
The CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE is sitting gingerly in his
chair, shifting uncomfortably. He looks pale, shaky.
Drew commits herself and rushes down the stairs to his
desk with the file.
                            DREW
                      (whispering)
             Sir?
He puts a hand to his stomach -- he's struggling.
                            CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE #2
                      (ugh; groan)
             Yes...
                           DREW
             Oh, no. You didn't have the
             mussels at lunch, too, did you?
Even as she holds out the file, he races past her,
puckering his bum.
She watches him waddle up the stairs BUT AS HE EXITS, HE
PASSES WILLIAMSON AND THE U.N. SECURITY GUY IN THE
DOORWAY.
Drew sees them. Uh, oh. The only thing she can do to
make herself inconspicuous is to drop into the Canadian
Rep's chair and turn her back on them like she's one of
the Assembly members. She sits up, shuffles the files
around.
Glancing furtively to either side, she sees that everyone
else is wearing the TRANSLATION EARPHONE. She puts one
on.

ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVE
Williamson's gaze comes to rest on...
... THE BACK OF DREW'S HEAD.         Hm.   That looks familiar.
This is when the CHINESE REP stands, furious, and points
an accusatory finger at Drew!
                           CHINESE REP
             This crisis falls at the feet of
             one nation and one nation only!
             CANADA!
ALL EYES TURN TO DREW.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                       73.

CONTINUED:
                           CHINESE REP
             How do you defend such a position!
             The world is waiting to hear!
These are fighting words. The Assembly grows SILENT.
Drew wishes she could BEAM HERSELF somewhere off planet.
She gulps air. Glances left, right.
BUT SHE KNOWS THE DETECTIVE'S EYES ARE ON THE BACK OF HER
HEAD AND SO SHE CLEARS HER THROAT AND:
                           DREW
             Well, I'm not certain...
This furrows some brows.
                           DREW
                     (recovering)
             ... that I NEED to defend our
             position!
Ah, yes, some knowing nods.
ON THE NORTH KOREAN REPRESENTATIVE leaning over to confer
with the NORWEGIAN REPRESENTATIVE:
                           NORTH KOREA
                     (subtitles)
             Is she new?
                             NORWAY
             Beats me.
                             NORTH KOREA
             She's hot.
                             NORWAY
             Weird hairdo.

BACK ON DREW
                           CHINESE REP
             That is absurd!
                             DREW
             Absurd?!
Uhhh... where now? She notices the FILE the Rep in the
bathroom gave her and holds it up, shaking it for
emphasis.
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                          74.

CONTINUED:
                           DREW
                     (dramatic emphasis)
             Not so absurd, since I have the
             documents right here in my
             possession!
This draws a CHORUS OF MURMURS throughout the hall. The
Chinese Rep suddenly looks terribly worried and pauses to
confer with his ASSOCIATE.
                                                CUT TO:

INT. U.N. - MAILROOM
Parker's peeking through the door, checking the hallway.
                           PARKER
             How are we going to find Drew?
                           WARREN
             Something tells me that won't be
             too tough.
Warren points to the MONITOR. Parker's jaw drops.         Her
sister is addressing the entire U.N. Assembly.
                                                CUT TO:


INT. U.N. ASSEMBLY - DAY
Drew glances Williamson EXITING.
                           DREW
             And besides, who said absurd is
             necessarily bad? Sometimes absurd
             is good! For instance, absurd can
             be sort of... funny! In conclusion,
             I propose that all of you should
             talk amongst yourselves.
                     (quickly)
             Thank you.
Like Cinderella at Midnight, she turns and races up the
stairs as the Assembly is in complete turmoil -- KOFI
ANAN BANGS his gavel.
                           KOFI ANAN
             Canada has proposed further
             debate.
                           U.S. REP
             The United States of America
             seconds the motion!

                                                      75.

INT. LOBBY OF THE U.N. ASSEMBLY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Drew busts through the doors just as Warren and Parker
come running with the Detectives chasing them. The three
of them make for the front door but a TOUR GROUP comprised
of a hundred young JAPANESE GIRLS blocks their EXIT.
Warren thinks fast and YELLS IN JAPANESE.
                        WARREN
          Jin zshe miya BRAD PITT!
SCREAMING LIKE BANSHEES, the Japanese Girls all pour
outside, Warren and the Girls following.

EXT. U.N. PLAZA - DAY
Once outside, he YELLS AGAIN.
                        WARREN
          Dingo cashito, BRAD PITT ezukai!
The JAPANESE GIRLS turn around and STORM BACK THROUGH THE
DOORS, blocking Williamson and Hogan's EXIT.
The three of them run for the line of taxis.
                        PARKER
          You speak Japanese?
                        WARREN
          I may not look like an underwear
          model, but I'm smarter than a
          hundred of them put together.
Warren grabs a Taxi door.
                        WARREN
          Come on!
                        PARKER
          We don't have any money!
                        WARREN
          I'm smart AND rich!
Williamson and Hogan have fought their way out through
the little Japanese Girls.
Realizing they won't reach Parker and Drew in time, they
head for their own unmarked cruiser which is parked just
ahead of...
Bennie's TOWN CAR. He's holding the door for a cigar-
chewing CLIENT but watching the Girls climb into the cab
up ahead.

                                                      76.

INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS ACTION
They jump into the back seat, Warren in the middle.
Parker leans urgently into the DRIVER:
                        PARKER
          Follow that... uh...
                        DREW
          They're following US, Parker!
                         PARKER
          Oh, yeah.   JUST GO!
The TAXI pulls away from the curb.

INT. DETECTIVE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Williamson FIRES UP the CRUISER.
                        WILLIAMSON
          Maybe we should give them a little
          leash and see what they do with
          it.
                        HOGAN
          Fine. But we're gonna have to
          stop for lunch pretty soon, 'cause
          I'm getting heartburn.
They pull into traffic, following the Cab.
In a BEAT, Bennie's Town Car follows, too.


INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Parker leans across Warren to Drew.
                        PARKER
          Excuse me, what were you doing?
                        DREW
          Someone was sick in the bathroom
          and they asked me to -- hold on, I
          don't owe you any explanation.
                        PARKER
          You're the one all 'I gotta get to
          this interview or I'm gonna have a
          nervous breakdown' and yet you
          have time to address the United
          Nations?

             You know, technically, you have to
             have security clearance to enter
             the Assembly.
                           PARKER
             Not now, Warren.
                           DREW
             You have a lot of nerve, Parker.
             It was you that got me tossed off
             the train! You had to give the
             bum that dollar! You get the
             suit, I get the leather bikini!
                           WARREN
                     (under)
             Which isn't so bad.
                           DREW
             And you got Bernie Lipscomb while
             I got Scrabble with Mom and Dad!
                           WARREN
             Who's Bernie Lipscomb?
                           PARKER
             I told you, I didn't know you
             liked him! It was no big deal!
                             DREW
             It was to me!
                           PARKER
             How could I know? You never tell
             me anything!
                           DREW
             There's a good reason for that!
                           PARKER
             What's that supposed to mean?
                            DREW
             You know very well what it means,
             Ms. Big Mouth!
                           PARKER
             Big mouth?! Ooh, I hope you miss
             that stupid interview!

             Oh yeah? Well, the joke's on you,
             because there isn't any interview!
Oops. This just slipped out in anger.        Parker's brain
has to adjust, then:
                           PARKER
             What?
                            DREW
                     (beat)
             No interview. I screwed up.
                           PARKER
             You screwed up what?
                           DREW
             Scheduling the interview.    You
             deaf?
                           PARKER
             You're Drew. Drew doesn't screw
             ANYTHING up, let alone scheduling.
             You're the Iron Chef of
             scheduling.
                           DREW
             I missed the deadline.
                           PARKER
             How?
                           DREW
             After they made the first cut from
             the preliminary application, we
             were supposed to send in a form to
             secure our interview time and I
             filled it out and had everything
             ready to go in the mailbox and
             then...
Drew is near tears.
                           PARKER
             And then what? Earthquake?
             Tsunami? Nuclear winter?
                           DREW
             I forgot.
                           PARKER
             Forgot?

CONTINUED:
                           DREW
             Yes. I just forgot. When I found
             it in my bag a week later, I'd
             missed the deadline.
                            PARKER
             So today?   All this?   What are you
             doing?
                           DREW
                     (humiliated)
             I... I was going to try to meet
             Professor Spaulding and...
                           PARKER
             You were just going to jump him?
                           WARREN
             Sort of a guerilla interview?     You
             know, I'm a big Michael Moore
             fan...
A look from Parker quiets Warren.       Drew's choked up.    She
just nods, yes.
                           DREW
             I called and the secretary said
             there were no exceptions to the
             deadline so I was going to try to
             see him when he finished the other
             interviews. I knew it was
             hopeless, but... I was so...
             embarrassed.
Drew wipes her tears, then:
                           DREW
             Oh, to hell with it.
She opens the door and jumps out!
                            PARKER
             Drew?!   Drew, get back in this
             taxi!
Parker starts to open her door on the TRAFFIC SIDE! HONK
HONK! It's nearly SHEARED OFF by a passing truck and she
closes it just in time.
                           WARREN
             She's pretty upset.

                           PARKER
             Gee, you really are a genius.
As the taxi bogs down in traffic, Drew disappears around
the corner up ahead.
                           PARKER
             Talk about spontaneous.

EXT. BLOCK NORTH OF THE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Tears running, Drew's walking too quickly for the one
stupid shoe. She nearly turns her ankle.
                            DREW
             Darn it!   DARN IT DARN IT DARN IT!
This is when she sees, parked just down the block...
ROGER'S VAN with "Michelangelo's Painting" across the
back door.
                           DREW
             That's... that's the painter.
Drew quickly steps into the shadow of a doorway to keep
out of sight and watch the van.

             Maybe that's what they want us to

INT. ROGER'S VAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Roger dials a cell phone while The Emperor stands on the
passenger seat with his front paws on the dash. As far
as we can tell, he's having a great time being kidnapped
and doesn't mind being mauve.
                           ROGER
             Get in the back, will ya?
The Emperor ignores him, happily watching the streets of
New York go by.
                            ROGER
             Stupid dog.
But his CALL has gone through.        He imitates a GIRL'S
VOICE.

She looks to her husband, who consults his watch and then
holds up ONE FINGER.

             One hour.   Take it or leave it.
Bruce SIGNALS her -- keep him on the line!
                           MRS. LO BIANCHO
             You have one minute to decide.
She hangs up.     Bruce and Morty SIGH.

INT. ROGER'S VAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Roger looks at the phone. It wasn't supposed to go like
that. He looks at The Emperor.
                           ROGER
             Well, Mr. Fancy Pants. You can
             wipe that stupid smile off your
             face. I don't think they love you

                           MRS. LO BIANCHO (V.O.)
             Secondly, my husband will meet you
             in ten minutes on the corner of
             43rd and Broadway. He'll have the
             money. Bring the dog.

             But that's ridiculous!     You'll

             The police, it appears, have other
             priorities, like humans or
             something. And I assure you, the
             Hotel Security... people... will

             No wonder you look so happy. As
             far as you're concerned, you've
             escaped from the Wicked Witch of
             the West.

EXT. BLOCK NORTH OF THE GARDEN
Drew watches as Roger climbs out, looks up and down the
street, then moves around to the passenger side, grabs
The Emperor and drops him into a gym bag.
AT THE END OF THE BLOCK -- SPECTATORS for the New York
Kennel Club Dog Show have begun filing into the Garden.
Ever wary, Roger carries The Emperor under one arm. The
Emperor pokes his nose out. Roger pushes it back in.
The dog pokes it back out.
                           ROGER
                     (to Emperor)
             Knock it off.
Whoosh! From behind, DREW GRABS THE EMPEROR and takes
off running.
                             ROGER
             Hey!    Give me that dog!
Holding The Emperor at arm's length, Drew makes a run for
it with Roger after her.
ON DREW -- LOOKING RIGHT INTO THE SMILING MAUVE FACE OF
THE EMPEROR.
                           DREW
             I just want you to know that I'm

Puzzled, Mr. Lo Biancho falls in line behind Roger,
keeping up pretty well for an old dude with a gut.

             I'm telling you, I got a hunch
             these girls don't have anything to
             do with this dog.
Drew blows past them, holding The Emperor. The
Detectives exchange glances -- nice hunch -- and they
LEAP OUT OF THE CAR TO JOIN THE CHASE.

INT. BENNIE'S TOWN CAR - DAY
Just as he turns the corner, the PARADE PASSES HIM.   What

EXT. BLOCK NORTH OF THE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The Emperor's having the time of his life. He licks
Drew's face joyfully as she weaves through the growing
crowd.

DREW'S DOG-SLOBBERED POV
REVEALS A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN doing security at the
DELIVERY ENTRANCE to the Garden, where SHOW PARTICIPANTS,
wheeling their DOG KENNELS, are being checked in by two
SHOW OFFICIALS.


BACK TO SCENE
Drew draws a bead on THE POLICEMAN, determined to reach
him and hand over The Emperor:
                         DREW
          Officer?!   Officer?!
But SHOW OFFICIAL #3 appears from inside, taps the
Policeman on the shoulder -- they need him inside.   He
turns and goes through the door just as...
... Drew reaches the loading dock and hustles up the
stairs.
                           DREW
          Officer?!
She sprints past the other SHOW OFFICIALS checking in
CONTESTANTS.

          Miss! You can't go in without
          credentials!

A GROOMER combing a HOUND DOG points toward the CURTAINS
on the far side of the room and she blasts off that
direction.

CLOSE ON THE HOUND DOG -- lifting his big nose in the
air, he sniffs mightily and then...
BAYING LIKE HE'S COON HUNTING UNDER A KENTUCKY MOON, the
Hound Dog leaps off his table, heads after Drew.

EXT. LOADING DOCK (MADISON SQUARE GARDEN) - CONTINUOUS
ACTION
CHAOS.
The TWO SHOW OFFICIALS,    sporting nifty sweaters and
manicures, are prepared    to sacrifice their lives to block
the door. In addition     to the PARTICIPANTS trying to get
inside, they're holding    off Roger, Mr. Lo Biancho,
Williamson and Hogan.
                           SHOW OFFICIAL #1
                     (quite disturbed)
             No entry without official

             NYPD!   Move aside!
At the mention of POLICE, Roger's EYES GO WIDE. He
slinks down, losing himself in the crowd and sidles off.
                           SHOW OFFICIAL #1
                     (chin set)
             I'll have to see identification,
             officers.

             I'm so sorry, Mr. Lo Biancho. Go
             right in.
AT THE CORNER, Parker and Warren keep their distance, not
wanting to be seen by the Detectives.
                           WARREN
             You think she made it?
                           PARKER
             She's faster than she looks.

The ROAR of the CROWD and the BARKING of the PACK

Williamson, Hogan, Morty, Bruce, Mr. and Mrs. Lo Biancho

             Oh, go ahead.

DREW'S POV
The Detectives appear above her.


BACK TO SCENE
She holds up The Emperor.
                           DREW
             I, uh, just wanted to return him.
As the other OWNERS and HANDLERS gather their dogs,
Williamson hands The Emperor off to Mrs. Lo Biancho while
Hogan handcuffs Drew.
                           MRS. LO BIANCHO
             Flog her! Step aside and I'll
             whip her myself!

                           MRS. LO BIANCHO
             So she had an accomplice! We'll

                      The Emperor)
             Get him cleaned up, Emile.
Williamson and Hogan move Drew toward their car.
                           DREW
             I didn't take her dog, I swear.

             But I have this interview. I

             interview. I'd never lie to the
             police...
                     (it's over)
             ... never mind.
Just as they push her head down into the car, she
glimpses a vaguely familiar face among the myriad GAWKERS
-- it's the Bike Messenger. For just an instant they
lock eyes before the car pulls away.

DOWN THE STREET
Parker and Warren round the corner at a run, only in time
to watch the Detective's car leave with Drew in the back
window.
                           WARREN
             What now?
                           PARKER
             We have to go to the jail and tell
             them what happened.
                           WARREN
             What on earth did happen?
                           PARKER
             Poor Drew. She wanted to get into
             that program more than anything in
             the world.
With a SIGH, they turn to go and BUMP -- knock into
Bennie, who's staring coldly down at Parker.
                           BENNIE
             You goin' somewhere?
She's paralyzed with fear.

             anything and I'll swear to that in
             a court of law!
Bennie appears unmoved. Parker closes her eyes, trying
to meet death with dignity.
                           PARKER
             Just not in the face.
                           BENNIE
             What's the big idea? You two a
             couple a nutbags or somethin'?
She opens one eye.
                           PARKER
             Nut bags? No. I mean,    yes. Is
             there a right answer to  that?
             See, my sister had this  interview
             which turned out not to  be an
             interview, really and I  sort of
             messed things up because  I wanted
             to meet him.
Indicating Warren.
                            WARREN
             Really?   You came into town just
             for me?   Wow.
                           PARKER
             Not now, Warren.
                     (back to Bennie)
             Drew was going to be late even
             though technically she wasn't
             going to be late since there
             wasn't an interview and that's
             when we got in your car. I
             promise we meant to pay. It was a
             true emergency.
                           BENNIE
             I meant, why you runnin' when I'm
             trying to give you your bag back?
Bennie hands Parker Drew's daybag.      Parker takes it,
still trying to comprehend.
                           PARKER
             You were just...?

             book. She said you needed it
             pretty badly for that big
             interview. Listen, I gotta go.
             It's my mother-in-law's birthday
             and I gotta plant some stupid rose
             bush and then take her out to
             dinner at the Pier. See ya
             around.
Bennie waddles over to his Town Car and climbs in.

Parker looks at the daybag.

             You guys lead a pretty interesting
             life, don't you?
But now Parker's mind is elsewhere.     She pulls out Drew's
daybook, opens it.

                             JIM
             Wait.    Where are you going?
EXT. NYPD STATION HOUSE - DAY
Jim catches up to her.
                           DREW
             Thanks for getting me out of jail
             but I have to go home now because
             my entire life is ruined.

             Bad day, huh?

             You turn understatement into an
             art.
                           JIM
             Can you just tell me your name?
             Please?
                            DREW
                     (sigh)
             I'm Drew MacLeod. The girl who
             won't be going to the NYU
             Accelerated Program.
                             JIM
             Why not?
Drew looks at her watch.
                           DREW
             Because short of flying, there's
             no way to get from here to NYU in
             five minutes.
                             JIM
             Sure there is.

EXT. NYU ADMINISTRATION BUILDING
Parker's on the stairs with Drew's DAYBOOK open, staring
into it like someone who has a final exam in two minutes
but forgot to show up for the semester.
Warren's looking over her shoulder.
                            WARREN
             Wow.   And I thought I was anal.
                           PARKER
             This is no good. I don't do too
             well with the whole rehearsal
             thing. I'm more of a 'wing it'
             person.
Parker checks herself in her reflection in the glass.
Working herself into Drew form, she puts her hair into a
conservative bun and then tries straightening her posture.

                           WARREN
             You know, I've always had a thing
             for librarians.
                           PARKER
             Warren, honesty is fine. But you
             could edit a little, you know?
                             WARREN
             Got it.
                             PARKER
             Wish me luck.
                           WARREN
             Good luck, Drew.

INT. NYU ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - CLOSE ON A HAND
about to knock on a door that reads "Professor Que
Spaulding, PhD" when the door suddenly opens and the last
INTERVIEWEE steps out in a suit and tie, confidence
oozing.
Parker nods primly as he passes, then steps inside.


INT. OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY
A SECRETARY sits at her computer.        She looks over her
glasses at Parker.
                           SECRETARY
             May I help you?
                           PARKER
             I'm here to see Professor
             Spaulding.
                           SECRETARY
             You don't have an appointment.
                            PARKER
                     (beat)
             Um, no. However...

CONTINUED:
This is when the inner office door swings open and the
PROFESSOR himself, coat over one arm, briefcase in the
other, steps out.
Parker positions herself directly in front of him,
cutting off his EXIT.
                           PARKER
             Professor Spaulding?
                             PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             Yes?
                           PARKER
             May I have a moment of your time?
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             I'm sorry, but I have a plane to
             catch.
He tries to make a move.      Parker blocks him.
                          PARKER
             I know. But this is very
             important.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             What is this about?
                           PARKER
             Life and death, if you must know.
The Professor hesitates for just an instant, giving
Parker her opening. She grabs his hand, giving it a
vigorous, Young Republican shake.
                           PARKER
             I'm Drew MacLeod.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             Ms. MacLeod, I hope this is
             interesting.
                             PARKER
             Trust me.

EXT. NYU CAMPUS - DAY
STUDENTS leisurely make their way between classes.

             Yo!    Coming through!

The Students dive out of the way as Jim comes barreling
across campus with Drew clinging for life to his
handlebars.
Just outside the Administration Building, Jim hits the
brakes and Drew FLIES OFF THE HANDLEBARS and like the
puppy in the opening, disappears into a shrub.
                           JIM
             You okay?
The old Drew is back.     She scrambles out of the
shrub...
                           DREW
             Fine.
... and up the stairs -- then stops, turns.
                            DREW
             Wait right there.
                     (beat)
             I mean, I don't want to be bossy.
             You don't have to stay right
             there, if you don't want to.
                           JIM
             I'll be right here.
                           DREW
             Great.
She launches herself into the building.

INT. PROFESSOR SPAULDING'S OFFICE - DAY
Parker sits genteelly forward in her chair, legs crossed
just so at the ankles, hands folded in her lap.
                            PARKER
                      (primly)
             I promise you, though my missing
             the deadline seems to suggest
             otherwise, my studies would never
             suffer on account of my being
             unorganized. This was, and I
             think anyone who knows me would
             vouch for this, a complete
             anomaly.

             I was so thrown when my sister
             asked Bernard to the dance that I
             simply failed to post the schedule
             request and seeing it already
             checked off on my to-do list, I
             over-looked it until after the
             deadline had passed.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             Ms. MacLeod, I recall your
             application being one of the
             strongest we received. Not seeing
             your name on the interview list
             surprised me. I assumed, of
             course, that you'd changed your
             mind.
                           PARKER
             No. Not at all. This program is
             my number one priority.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             Yes, well, I'm sure you can
             appreciate that with so many
             applicants for so few spaces there
             must be rules to govern the
             selection process.
A FUSS from the OUTER OFFICE interrupts them and suddenly
the door bursts open and Drew BURSTS IN:
                           DREW
             Professor Spaulding? I can't
             apologize enough for barging in
             like this.
The Professor is not only thrown by the interruption, but
by Drew's particularly bizarre, barefoot look.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             No. Please. It looks like I'm
             taking the red-eye now anyway.
Drew shuts the door and then is startled when she gets a
face full of Parker, already there.
                           DREW
             Parker?
                           PARKER
                     (worried wink)
             Hi, Parker.

                     (don't blow it)
             Oh, the Professor and I have had a
             wonderful talk about how important
             this program is to me and how it
             was my sister, Drew, who screwed
             things up.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             I'm having a little trouble
             following this.
                           DREW
             You were... being me?
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
                     (to Drew)
             Would you like to sit down?
Seeing her plan to help Drew go awry, poor Parker's lip
trembles.
                           PARKER
             When I saw them take you to
             jail...
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             Jail?
                           PARKER
             ... I didn't think you'd make it.
             I knew I wouldn't be any good at
             it, but I figured at least there
             was a chance.
                            DREW
                     (beat)
             That's... sweet.
                           PARKER
             You're not mad?
                           DREW
             No.
                           PARKER
             I'm so sorry for today.

             it later.
                             PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             Please.    Go right ahead.
                             PARKER
             Thank you.
                           DREW
             Parker, consider, just for a
             moment, whether this is the
             appropriate time and place.
                           PARKER
             Okay, I considered.     What I want
             to say is, I didn't    purposefully
             set out to ruin your    day, but that
             doesn't mean I'm not    a little...
             jealous.
                             DREW
             Jealous?
                           PARKER
             I'm not like you. I don't have
             your intensity, your focus, your...
                             PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             Fashion sense?
                            PARKER
             I just mean, maybe, even if I
             don't intend to, maybe that
             jealousy, you know, gets in the
             way sometimes.
                           DREW
             You mean subliminally you're
             undermining me?
                           PARKER
             I don't know if I'd get that
             technical about it. But yeah.
                           DREW
             Well, thank you for saying that.
                            PARKER
             You're welcome.
                     (beat)

                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             There's got to be something. Like
             how you lost your shoes?
                           PARKER
             How you're secretly jealous of me?
                           DREW
             Why would I be jealous of you?
                           PARKER
             Oh, let me see. Because I don't
             have a stick up my butt? Because
             I know how to have fun? Because
             I'm spontaneous and creative and
             men are all my love slaves?
Drew stops, ponders this deeply.
                             DREW
             Nope.
Then she smiles, only a teensy bit.
                           DREW
             Well, maybe about the love slaves.
This is the first moment in a long time when the sisters
share a smile. Drew turns to the Professor.
                           DREW
             Professor, I'm Drew MacLeod.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             Are you certain?
                           DREW
             I wanted more than anything in the
             world to be a part of your
             program. I still do. But I
             failed. I didn't follow the
             rules. And honestly, before
             today, I didn't know how I was
             going to live with that. How to
             live with failure. I'm not good
             at it. I haven't done it much.
             But today I realized that I've
             lived in fear of it too long.

             Better yet, I'll get over it.
             Maybe I shouldn't be in such a
             hurry after all. Maybe it would
             be best for me to just take
             this...
Drew takes her DAYBOOK from Parker and drops it in the
wastebasket.
                           DREW
             ... and lighten up.
Parker looks horrified at the sight of Drew's daybook in
the trash and fishes it out.
                           DREW
             Thanks for your time. Sorry if
             you missed your plane.
He shakes her hand.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             It was worth it, I assure you.
             Now, could you clear up one thing
             for me?
                           DREW/PARKER
             Sure.
                           PROFESSOR SPAULDING
             What's this about jail?
                                              CUT TO:

EXT. NYU ADMINISTRATION BUILDING
Warren and Jim sit waiting when the Girls come out,
smiling.
Drew turns to Parker.
                           DREW
             Thanks.
The sisters hug, but we GO...
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                         105.

CLOSE ON PARKER -- EYES WIDE.
                              PARKER
             Sis?
                              DREW
             Yeah?
                              PARKER
             Gotta go.
Parker grabs Warren by the hand and blasts around the
corner just as...
Charley MacLeod pulls up in his truck and parks half on,
half off the curb.
He leans over, waving to Drew.
                              CHARLEY
             Hi, baby!
Drew goes over to the truck.
                           CHARLEY
             I was in the city. I tried to
             call you. Thought you might want
             a ride home.
                              DREW
             Sure.
                           CHARLEY
                     (what?)
             Is that a new outfit?
                              DREW
             Yeah.     Hey, one minute, 'kay?
                              CHARLEY
             Sure.
Drew goes back to Jim.
                              DREW
             Thanks.
                           JIM
             You're welcome.
                              DREW
             I, uh...
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                            106.

CONTINUED:
                           JIM
             You want to maybe... get together?
                           DREW
             First I want to take a shower.
             For about a week.
Drew leans over and kisses him on the cheek.         Then she
reaches into her bag and pulls out a card.
                            DREW
             Call me, okay?
                           JIM
             You have a card? Aren't you in
             high school?
She smiles, shrugs and climbs in her dad's truck. They
pull away, leaving Jim waving. When they're out of
sight, Parker and Warren come back around the corner of
the building.
                           PARKER
             Oh, man. I'm doomed.     I'll never
             get home before them.
                            WARREN
             Sure you will.
Warren pulls out a CELL PHONE, hits speed dial.
                             WARREN
             Dad?   Hey.   I need a favor.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
Passing over the City, Warren and Parker are strapped in,
headphones on, and have to talk above the DIN.
                           PARKER
             Warren, something tells me you're
             spoiled!
                            WARREN
             Yes!   But in a good way!
                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - EVENING
Both girls are putting on makeup, getting ready to go
out. Everything appears the same as before, Drew's side
neat and clean, Parker's a wreck.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                       107.

                            QUINN
                      (sternly)
             Girls?
Quinn steps in, grimfaced.
                           QUINN
             How naive do you think I am?
The Girls share a look.       Busted.
                           PARKER
             We, uh, don't think you're naive,
             Mom.
                          DREW
             No. Honestly, it was all an
             accident.
Quinn holds out her hand revealing a BELLY RING.
                           QUINN
             I know what this is.
There's almost a palpable sense of relief between the
girls. They BOTH LOOK DOWN and pull up their shirts --
Parker's not the only one who has her naval pierced --
Drew does, too.
                           QUINN
             Parker, I'm disappointed you'd do
             something like this without
             consulting me, but Drew? What got
             into you? Do you know how
             unhygienic those places are?
                           DREW
             It was... spontaneous.
                          QUINN
             Yeah. Obviously. Oh, by the
             way...
She holds out her other hand, which has an envelope.
                           QUINN
             This came in the mail.
They stare at the envelope -- NYU ADMISSIONS DEPARTMENT.
                              PARKER
             So?   Open it.
There's a HONK.
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                           108.

CONTINUED:
                           CHARLEY (O.S.)
             The guys are here!
Parker and Quinn stare at Drew.
                              PARKER
             Come on!
                           DREW
             It doesn't really matter one way
             or the other. Maybe I shouldn't
             be in such a hurry. Why don't we
             go out and have some fun.
             Besides, if this isn't good news,
             I don't want it to ruin our night.
Parker and Quinn simply continue to stare.
                                                 CUT TO:

INT. MacLEOD LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Charley's laying on the couch with some chips on his
stomach watching the game.
Jim and Warren are watching, too.
                           CHARLEY
             So, how'd you two meet the girls?
Jim and Warren share a look.        This is a story best left
untold.
                           JIM/WARREN
                     (simultaneously)
             A dance/A class.
                           CHARLEY
             Dance class, huh? Stupid    me. I
             figured it had to be that   day in
             New York when Parker blew   off her
             chem test and Drew was in   jail.
Charley smiles.       He's not as out of it as he appears.
Suddenly, all three women SCREAM JOYFULLY O.S.
                              CHARLEY
                        (offering)
             Chips?
                                              FADE OUT.

                              THE END
