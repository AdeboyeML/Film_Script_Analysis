           Once upon a time, in a far off
           kingdom, there lay a small village at
           the edge of the woods...

          Suddenly, the WELL-WORN BOOT of Cinderella steps into the
          frame and lands on what we thought was the sky, but in fact
          is simply its reflection in a puddle of water. A strong CHORD
          accents the splash and we begin a musical vamp.

          As LRRH sings, she begins to help herself to all the buns she
          can lay her hands on.

          The WIFE reaches for a basket, while the BAKER tries to wrest
          away a bun or two from the girl.

           I don't suppose you're planning on
           buying any of these?
          The WIFE gives the BAKER a look, then hands LRRH a basket.

          The BAKER and his WIFE are cleaning up after their day's
          work. There is an unexpected knock at the door. They stare at
          one another momentarily.

           It's the Witch from next door!
          The DOOR pops off its frame and goes flying across the room
          in a giant puff of smoke. The BAKER and his WIFE scream and
          cower in a corner.
          As the fog clears, we see the WITCH for the first time and
          she's not a pretty sight. MICE and other vermin drop from
          beneath her cape and scatter through the cottage.

                          WIFE
           We have no bread.

           It's not what I wish. It's what you
           wish.
          She moves towards the WIFE as the BAKER tries unsuccessfully
          to protect her. She points her gross finger towards her
          belly.

           young wife and you to this cottage.
           They were a lovely couple. But not
           lovely neighbors. You see, your mother
           was with child and she developed an
           unusual appetite. She admired my

          In the moonlight, we see the BAKER'S FATHER, wearing a
          hunting jacket, scale over the WITCH'S wall and into her
          garden. From behind a wooden trellis, she WATCHES him as he
          gathers her greens:

          An open-air carriage and horses wait in the courtyard. The

          The BAKER is trying to clean up the mess when his WIFE races
          downstairs holding his FATHER'S HUNTING JACKET. She hands it
          to the BAKER.

          cobblestone lane, his WIFE walking next to him.

          A large willow tree stands tall.

           BAKER (V.O.)
           Deep within the woods, Cinderella had
           planted a branch at the grave of her
           mother. And she visited there so
           often, and wept so much, that her
           tears watered it until it had become a
           magnificent tree.
          CINDERELLA kneels in prayer.

                          CINDERELLA

          She begins to cry.

          In the reflection, CINDERELLA sees the tree slowly twist and
          turn taking on the shape of her MOTHER, who looks down upon
          her.

                          C'S MOTHER
           What is it that you wish, child?

          CINDERELLA closes her eyes and makes her wish.

          The wind now blowing the willow tree, its LEAVES begin to
          rain down on CINDERELLA, turning gold and silver as they
          swirl around her, transforming her clothes into a beautiful
          gown.
          CINDERELLA looks down to see that she is now wearing a pair
          of shoes literally made of gold leaf. When she looks back up,
          the tree has now returned to its former shape.

           Thank you, Mother.

          of exotic flowers as she munches on a treat. We hear HEAVY

          LRRH goes about her business picking flowers further from her
          path.
          ANGLE ON THE BAKER who has been observing LRRH from a
          distance. Like a bat, the WITCH swings upside down from a
          tree above the BAKER:

                          WITCH
           Why are you standing there?! Go get

          The WITCH swings to the ground.

           asked you in the first place? I'm not
           allowed to touch any of the objects!
          We suddenly hear the lilting sound of a young voice singing
          in the distance. The WITCH, almost intoxicated by her sound,
          swoons with delight. Then:

          She wraps the cape about herself and disappears in such a
          strong blast of wind that it knocks the BAKER to the ground.

           This is ridiculous!
          ANOTHER ANGLE. LRRH is picking flowers off the path, blithely
          unaware of anything else. The BAKER gets up and hurries over
          to her.

          He quickly unties it.

           Please -- give it back!
          They have a tug of war.
          The BAKER pulls free and runs off with the cape. LRRH stands
          there momentarily stunned, then lets out a loud scream.
          ANGLE ON THE BAKER. He stops cold, realizing what he's done,
          then runs back to LRRH and places the cape around her
          shoulders.

                          BAKER
           I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure
           that you really loved this cape. Now
           off you go to Granny's -- and be
           careful that no wolf comes your way.

           I would rather a wolf than you any
           day.

          RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE glides through the woods on a white stead.
          It's difficult to say who is more beautiful, the PRINCE or
          the HORSE. From the corner of his eye he notices something in
          the distance. He slows down and circles back, and HEARS the
          melodious singing of RAPUNZEL. He dismounts and slips through

          An exquisite tower, surrounded by a thicket of tall rose
          bushes, with no entryway, just a lone window at its peak. At
          the bottom of the tower, the WITCH looks upward:

          proceeds to lower the longest stretch of hair you've ever

          stops and stares at the cottage which is built into a large

          OAK TREE.

           BAKER (V.O.)
           As the little girl approached her
           Granny's oak tree, she was surprised
           to see the door standing open.

                          LRRH
           Oh dear, how uneasy I feel. Perhaps
           it's all the sweets.

          LRRH makes her way down a curved staircase in the house. She
          sees the CURTAINS drawn around her GRANNY'S BED and, behind
          them, the SILHOUETTE of what "looks like" GRANNY.

           Come in, my deary.
          LRRH moves towards the bed with trepidation and slowly pulls
          back the curtain. The WOLF is revealed, lying under the
          covers, dressed in GRANNY'S nightcap and robe.

          gleaming white FANGS.

          The BAKER crosses the bridge and heads towards the cottage.
          He suddenly hears LRRH scream. Nervously he pulls the knife
          from his belt.

           BAKER (V.O.)
           And with a single bound, the wolf had
           devoured the little girl. Well, it
           was a full day of eating for both.

          The BAKER enters and hears a loud SNORE. Brandishing the
          knife, he moves towards the bed where he sees the WOLF
          DRESSED AS GRANNY, sound asleep, a piece of the red cloth
          sticking out of it's mouth.
          Squeamishly, he pulls back the sheet to see the WOLF'S
          SWOLLEN STOMACH. He raises his knife and as he brings it
          slashing down we hear a loud HOWL from the WOLF.

           DON'T COME NEAR ME WITH THAT, FOOL!! I

           bring me the items or that child you
           wish for will never see the light of
           day!
          With a grand sweep of her cape, the WITCH throws off dirt and
          muck over the BAKER and the BAKER'S WIFE as she disappears
          into a cloud of dust.
          The BAKER wipes dirt from his mouth.

           Go back to the village. I will make
           things right. And then we can just go
           about our life. No more witches or dim-
           witted boys or hungry little girls.
          The BAKER'S WIFE starts to speak.

          She goes.

          EXT. WOODS - PINE FOREST - DAY

          WIDE SHOT. We hear the hoofbeats of horses coming from both
          directions. Crossing the frame and each other are
          CINDERELLA'S PRINCE on his BLACK stallion and RAPUNZEL'S
          PRINCE on his WHITE steed. They pass out of the frame. After
          a few beats, they return trotting, meeting in the middle.

                          R'S PRINCE
           Good brother. I was wondering where

                          C'S PRINCE
           Disappeared, like the fine morning
           mist.

           She was lovely?

           The loveliest.
          They dismount and walk their horses through the forest.

                          R'S PRINCE
           I am not certain of that! I must
           confess, I too have found a lovely
           maiden. She lives here in the woods.

           The woods?
          In the background we see the WIFE, who has wandered by on her
          way back home. She stops to EAVESDROP on the PRINCES.

                          R'S PRINCE
           Yes! In the top of a tall tower that
           has no door or stairs.

                          C'S PRINCE
           Where?

                          R'S PRINCE
           Two leagues from here, due east, just
           beyond the mossy knoll near the rose
           thickets.

                          C'S PRINCE
           And how do you manage a visit?

                          R'S PRINCE
           I stand beneath her tower and say,
           "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your
           hair to me." And then she lowers the
           longest, most beautiful head of hair -
           yellow as corn - which I climb.
          The WIFE is thrilled by this news, and runs off.

           of such a thing.

                          R'S PRINCE
           I speak the truth! She is as true as
           your maiden. A maiden running from a
           prince? None would run from us.

          EXT. RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - NIGHT

          The BAKER'S WIFE fights her way through a thicket. Her
          clothes are now ratty, her face scratched - but she
          approaches the tower with trepidation.

           Rapunzel, Rapunzel? Let your hair down
           to me.
          The window at the top of the tower opens and RAPUNZEL sticks
          out her head looking downward. The WIFE hides to the side.

           Excuse me for this.
          She takes a fist full of hair and gives it a pull. Nothing.
          She tries once again, this time with more force eliciting a
          little yelp from RAPUNZEL. Finally, she holds on to the hair
          and just starts running away from the tower as fast as she
          can. We hear RAPUNZEL yell as the WIFE succeeds in pulling
          some of the hair from her head.

           BAKER (V.O.)
           As the Baker's Wife bolted from the
           tower, the second night of the
           festival was thrown into chaos when
           Cinderella once again ran from the
           Prince.
          While the BAKER'S WIFE continues to run away from Rapunzel's
          tower, in the distance she sees a flutter of gold moving
          through the moonlit trees. CINDERELLA? She changes course in
          pursuit.
          SERIES OF SHOTS with MUSIC
          CLOSE-UP on CINDERELLA'S SHOES as they make their way through
          wooded path.
          ANGLE ON THE WIFE as she races towards them in pursuit.
          The WIFE catches up with CINDERELLA and tackles her to the
          ground, CINDERELLA'S slipper falling off. They both dive for
          the slipper, when an approaching noise catches the WIFE'S
          attention.

          CLOSE-UP on the shoe as CINDERELLA snatches it from the
          ground. CINDERELLA rushes off.
          The WIFE stares frozen in horror as the PRINCE'S HORSE races
          towards her. She lets out a scream and the horse stops short,
          rearing up. The STEWARD'S horse charges off the path into
          thickets.

          happy.

           No sign of her, my liege.

           Well, what are you waiting for? See if
           you can find her.
          The STEWARD rides off. The PRINCE pauses. The ultimate
          seducer, he gives the WIFE the once over.

           C'S PRINCE (CONT'D)

          The BAKER searches for MILKY-WHITE along a large PATHWAY,
          disheveled and exhausted.

          He HEARS sounds off in the distance.

          The STEPFAMILY'S carriage is passing through a large hollowed
          opening in the base of a huge tree.
          We can hear the STEPSISTERS bickering, their blonde hair
          bobbing animatedly.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          The BAKER stands in the middle of the pathway, flagging down
          the carriage. He pulls an ear of corn from his satchel. As
          the carriage slows, he hops on the sideboard.

          She pushes the BAKER off the carriage and he somersaults
          backwards into the brush.
          The CARRIAGE speeds off. Deflated, the BAKER picks himself
          off the path and sits on what he thinks is a white rock.
          There is a muffled "Moo..." He jumps up realizing he's been
          SITTING on the cow.

          He hears something and hides behind a BUSH. Then, seeing it
          is his WIFE, he steps out.

          They kiss but their moment of romance is interrupted when a
          large GOLDEN EGG rolls down the hill between them. The WIFE
          screams.

          The BAKER looks up and sees that the SHADOW has now moved a

          EXT. RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - DAYBREAK

          Hidden by a broken piece of WALL -- someone or something is
          watching the R-PRINCE climbing out of the window.

           BAKER (V.O.)
           When dawn broke, the Baker and his
           Wife had but one day left to reverse
           the Witch's curse. As for Rapunzel's
           Prince, he returned yet again to the
           forbidden tower.

          With RAPUNZEL smiling down, the R-PRINCE descends her hair.
          Once he has reached the bottom, she pulls her hair back in
          and closes the window.
          ANOTHER ANGLE. We discover that it's the WITCH who has been
          watching. She is not happy.
          The PRINCE mounts his horse and rides off towards a low rose
          thicket -- an easy jump.
          With a thrust of her stick, the WITCH makes the thicket shoot
          up before the PRINCE has time to act. His HORSE stops short
          and he screams as he is thrown over the horse's head into the
          thicket.
          ANGLE ON THE WITCH. She smiles at her handiwork then turns to
          stare at the top of the tower vindictively.

          to hack off her hair. The girl lets out a mighty shriek.

          To frantic MUSIC, JACK is making his way down to the bottom
          of the beanstalk with all the speed he can muster. This is
          made more difficult by the GOLDEN HARP which he has slung
          over his shoulder.

           BAKER (V.O.)
           Jack took the little girl's dare and
           before he knew it, found himself
           fleeing from a Giant.
          Suddenly, the BEANSTALK shakes mightily, making JACK hold on
          for dear life. He looks up to discover the Giant climbing
          down after him; Jack feverishly picks up speed and jumps the
          last six feet to the ground. He quickly drops the harp and
          runs to a large axe embedded in the stump of a tree.
          JACK swings the AXE striking the BEANSTALK.

          when there is a TREMENDOUS CRASH with the force of an
          earthquake. The BAKER and his WIFE are knocked off their feet
          and tumble into a bank of FERNS. They scramble to their feet
          and look to one another.

          The MOON is now half covered by SHADOW. DROP DOWN to find
          CINDERELLA running down the steps; commotion ensues as she is
          followed by the PRINCE and his retinue.

           BAKER (V.O.)
           ...as for Cinderella, she fled from
           the Prince... again.
          ANOTHER ANGLE. Suddenly, when CINDERELLA is MID-FLIGHT on the
          steps, she falters, unable to move. She looks down to see
          that there is TAR on this step and her shoes are stuck.
          ANGLE ON THE PRINCE. Smiling as he sees he has finally
          trapped his prey.

          CINDERELLA lifts her feet out of the shoes and moves to a

          goes to pry the second shoe, she stops.

          Coming out of the freeze, she quickly leaves one shoe and
          slips on the other, then dashes off out of sight.
          The PRINCE picks up the golden shoe from the tar and holds it
          up triumphantly. He addresses his STEWARD and RETINUE.

          CLOSE-UP on CINDERELLA'S FEET, awkwardly running with one
          shoe on, one shoe off.
          ANOTHER ANGLE. She hears someone close on her trail and looks
          back to see the wide-eyed WIFE in pursuit.

           I didn't attack you. I attacked your
           shoe. I need it. I have a magic bean
           in exchange for it.
          Breathless, CINDERELLA stops. Stands defensively. The WIFE
          pulls out the bean from her pocket and hands it to her.

           As the Prince anxiously waited, the

          The STEPFAMILY watches as the STEWARD helps FLORINDA up on to
          the back of the Prince's horse. In pain, she grits her teeth
          in a frozen smile.

           Minus one toe, Florinda mounted the
           Prince's horse, unaware of the blood
           dripping from the slipper.
          As the STEWARD steps back, he notices a tiny speck of blood
          on his white glove. He looks up to the PRINCE to show him his
          hand. The PRINCE looks back to FLORINDA who shrugs
          sheepishly.

          "WOOSH" of a knife--

          The PRINCE and STEWARD wait impatiently in the torchlight.

           Minus a heel, Lucinda did her best to
           swallow the pain.
          At last, LUCINDA appears, masking her pain with a smile, and
          limps towards the PRINCE. She is followed by her MOTHER and

          SISTER.

          LUCINDA winks at the PRINCE flirtatiously, then promptly
          faints to the ground with a thud. The shoe falls from her
          foot. The PRINCE nods to the STEWARD who walks over and
          gingerly picks up the bloody slipper.

           which her late father left behind but
           she cannot present herself. She is too
           dirty.
          Out of the shadows, CINDERELLA appears.
          The STEWARD hands the slipper to the Prince, who kneels down
          in front of CINDERELLA and easily slips it on her foot.

                          C'S PRINCE
           I would recognize these beautiful eyes
           anywhere. This is the true bride!
          The PRINCE sweeps CINDERELLA off her feet and leads her to
          his horse. The two of them ride off.
          FLORINDA and LUCINDA watch, not at all happy. Then they hear
          a CAWING (the sound of birds) overhead. They look up,
          alarmed.
          BIRD'S POV. Far below, FLORINDA and LUCINDA cower together,
          dreading what is to come as the CAMERA rushes towards them.

           BAKER (V.O.)
           As punishment for their cruelty,
           Cinderella's birds swooped down upon
           the Stepsisters... and blinded them.
          The BIRDS enter the picture frame, more and more, their
          CAWING rising to a crescendo until their flapping wings are
          all we see.

          EXT. MARSHLAND - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

          RAPUNZEL is alone in a mossy bower on an isolated island in
          the middle of swamp waters filled with POISONOUS SNAKES. She
          hums a sad refrain.

           BAKER (V.O.)
           As for Rapunzel, the Witch had
           banished her to a swamp in the darkest
           depths of the forest.
          ANOTHER ANGLE. The R-PRINCE with a ragged scarf wrapped
          around his now blinded eyes, sits slumped over on his horse
          as the animal navigates its way through the marshy expanse.
          The R-PRINCE lifts his head as he hears RAPUNZEL'S singing.

          Could it be? The horse, seemingly knowing the way, follows
          the sound as the R-PRINCE calls her name.

                          R'S PRINCE
           Rapunzel? Rapunzel?

          ANGLE ON RAPUNZEL
          She looks up and cries with delight when she sees her PRINCE
          across the water.

                          RAPUNZEL
           My darling!
          She jumps into the swamp, fearlessly ignoring the SNAKES,
          until she reaches terra firma and her man.
          R-PRINCE falls from his horse onto the ground.

                          R'S PRINCE
           Rapunzel? Is it you?
          RAPUNZEL reaches him and rips off his scarf. She kneels to
          cradle his face, weeping.

                          RAPUNZEL
           How could she do this to you?
          EXTREME CLOSE-UP: RAPUNZEL'S TEAR falls into the R-PRINCE'S
          blind eye.
          The PRINCE'S vision is restored.

          The BAKER is pulling a very obstinate WHITE COW through the
          woods. He looks up at the MOON which is almost completely
          covered in SHADOW.

          A desperate glance at the BAKER. He couldn't have screwed

          The WITCH walks over and smacks the animal. Flour puffs off
          its back.

          MILKY-WHITE has been covered with LEAVES.

          They quickly move away, and the WITCH invokes some
          unintelligible incantation, and with the wave of her cape,
          the DEAD COW comes back to life, shaking off the leaves.
          JACK races over to her.

          The WIFE and BAKER walk towards the COW and begin feeding it
          a portion of the ingredients. Not an easy chew for the
          animal.
          The WITCH hands them a silver chalice.

          The BAKER grabs the ear of corn from JACK, pulls the hair
          from the corn and feeds it to the cow.
          JACK begins milking the cow again. We hear the distant CHIMES
          OF MIDNIGHT begin.
          Light pours from above bathing them in a growing haze of BLUE
          LIGHT as the SHADOW finally eclipses the MOON. The COW lets

          The WITCH drinks the potion. She begins to shake. Blue smoke
          begins to pour from her and swirl about as if she is trapped
          inside a cloud. The WIFE lets out a shriek..
          The BAKER looks at his WIFE, her belly begins to grow to nine-
          months-full of pregnancy.

          The cloud that has surrounded the WITCH now engulfs the area
          until a brisk wind blows it away, revealing a beautiful woman
          standing in the BLUE LIGHT of the FULL MOON. The WITCH has
          been restored to her former self, and she likes what she
          sees.

          CHEERING SUBJECTS who toss more into the air as they clamor
          to catch a glimpse of CINDERELLA and her PRINCE on their
          wedding day.
          MUSIC. CINDERELLA'S carriage resplendent in gold drawn by

           running from her Prince.
          CINDERELLA'S POV on the crowd.

          "fascinator" hat.

          by cheers.
          The STEPFAMILY awaits the married couple. The beaming

          off through the crowd and disappears.

          The R-PRINCE searches the crowd for RAPUNZEL. Those who
          haven't fled, quiet and gather around. The C-PRINCE takes the
          horn.

                          C'S PRINCE
           There's no need for worry. It was an
           earthquake in a far-off quadrant of
           our kingdom. Nothing to fear at all.
           As many of you know, we had another
           little shaker just days ago. I will
           personally investigate the

          EXT. KINGDOM - DAY

          A dense mist settles across the kingdom. In the distance a
          beanstalk stretches up to the sky. C'S PRINCE and his RETINUE
          gallop away from the destroyed castle into the woods.

           BAKER (V.O.)
           But as they made their way back into
           the woods, their familiar paths were
           nowhere to be found and their lives
           were about to take an unexpected turn.

          EXT. WOODS - FLOWERED PATH - DAY

          The BAKER and his WIFE are walking down a path -- or the
          remnants of a path.

                          WIFE
           What's happened? Everything's so
           different.
          They discover LRRH sitting on her suitcase in what was once a
          lush area, now trampled and broken.

                          BAKER
           Hello, little one. Are you alright?
           What are you doing here? With a
           suitcase?

                          LRRH
           I'm moving in with Granny. Our whole
           village collapsed. I couldn't find my
           mother anywhere. And now I can't find
           my Granny's cottage.

                          BAKER
           What do you mean?

                          LRRH
           I went down the dell, and I didn't
           recognize anything. There was no path.

           Calm down.

                          BAKER
           We can help you find Granny's without
           the path.

                          WIFE
           Yes.
          The WIFE is exhausted. She hands the BABY to the BAKER.

                          WIFE (CONT'D)
           Please take him for a few moments.
          The BAKER is clearly uncomfortable holding the BABY. They
          continue walking. The BABY begins to cry.

                          BAKER
           Why does he always cry when I hold
           him?

          The BABY wails. The BAKER hands the bundle back.

                          BAKER
           He doesn't want me. He wants his
           mother!

           I'll take care of him -- when he's
           older...
          They hear COMMOTION in the distance.

           Who might that be?

                          BAKER
           It's the Steward and the royal family.

          EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Through a thick haze, the BAKER sees the STEWARD, the
          STEPFAMILY and a few SERVANTS carrying trunks and tending to
          the blind, hobbling STEPSISTERS.
          The BAKER makes his way to them with his WIFE and LRRH in
          tow.

                          BAKER
           What brings you into the woods?

                          STEWARD
           I have no idea! I don't make policy. I
           just carry it out.

           I think it best we get back to the

          She holds out a hand for LRRH.

          LRRH takes her hand.
          But then the ground begins to shake. A frightening and
          increasingly loud crunching noise. They fight for their
          footing.
          The STEPFAMILY drop their belongings and rush to each other.
          The BAKER puts his arm around his WIFE.
          Everyone's faces fill with terror as a huge shadow engulfs
          them.

           A giant woman!
          Through the trees we see the furious face of a female GIANT.
          We never see her in her entirety -- but the volume of her
          voice matches her size.

                          GIANT
           Where is the lad who killed my
           husband?

                          BAKER
           We haven't seen him.
          The WITCH, who has slipped in behind the group, comes forward
          startling everyone and moves directly to the GIANT.

                          WITCH
           We'll get him for you right away.
           Don't move!
          LRRH races past the WITCH and brandishes her knife.

                          LRRH
           It was you who destroyed our house -
           not an earthquake.

                          GIANT
           And who destroyed my house? I want
           him!
          A great bellow that makes the trees shake.
          The WITCH moves towards the STEPSISTERS.

                          WITCH
           Would you like a blind girl instead?

          FLORINDA and LUCINDA scream. The STEPMOTHER takes them in her
          embrace.

           How dare you? She wants the boy!
          And then JACK'S MOTHER arrives. Innocently, she asks the
          worst question possible.

                          JACK'S MOTHER
           Jack! Has anyone seen my Jack? He ran
           off again and I've been...
          Everyone stares at her. JACK'S MOTHER does a slow take
          looking up and discovering the GIANT.

           (meaning the GIANT)
           She's looking for him too.

                          GIANT
           Give him to me!
          The GIANT suddenly reaches down. They all quickly duck out of
          the way.
          JACK'S MOTHER runs forward to confront the GIANT.

                          JACK'S MOTHER
           Jack is just a lad! We had no food to
           eat so he sold his beloved cow in
           exchange for magic beans.

                          GIANT
           The boy - I want the boy!

          The GIANT stomps her foot in anger.

           I'm waiting!
          They all lose their balance. The STEWARD uses his staff to
          hold JACK'S MOTHER back, trying to silence her.

                          STEWARD
           Don't make her angry, woman, or you'll
           get us all killed!

          trips and falls.

          The GIANT takes off, the power of her footsteps forcing
          everyone to hold on to one another for safety.
          The BAKER'S WIFE sees JACK'S MOTHER, who is still lying on
          the ground. She goes to her.

           LET THE MOMENT GO./ DON'T FORGET IT

           FOR A MOMENT, THOUGH./
          The WIFE looks in the direction of where the C-PRINCE exited.

                          WIFE (CONT'D)

           JUST REMEMBERING YOU'VE HAD AN "AND,"/

           WHEN YOU'RE BACK TO "OR"/
          She looks down to the BAKER'S scarf and pulls it from her
          waist.

                          WIFE (CONT'D)

           MAKES THE "OR" MEAN MORE/ THAN IT DID

           BEFORE./ NOW I UNDERSTAND--/ AND IT'S

           TIME TO LEAVE THE WOODS!
          With newfound determination to return to her husband, she
          ties the scarf around her neck and begins to trace her steps

                         BACK:

                          WIFE (CONT'D)

          She stops. An ominous expression crosses her face. We begin
          to hear the pounding steps of the GIANT moving closer. The
          WIFE scrambles up a steep incline trying to find a way to get
          out of the GIANT'S path. She makes it to the top, but
          realizes there is no way down on the other side.
          As the GIANT'S footsteps near, the WIFE is engulfed in
          darkness. Trees begin to fall around her and as the earth
          shakes, she loses her balance and falls backwards with a
          scream.

          EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT

          The BAKER is pacing back and forth. CINDERELLA is tending to
          the BABY. LRRH sits staring sadly into space.

                          BAKER
           She should be back by now.

                          LRRH
           She wouldn't get lost.

                          CINDERELLA
           I'm sure she'll return.

                          BAKER
           No, I must go and look for her--
          They hear a commotion. It's the WITCH, who has JACK by the
          scruff of the neck.

                          WITCH
           Look who I found!

                          JACK
           You're hurting me!
          The WITCH continues pulling the boy along.

                          BAKER
           Let go of him!

                          WITCH
           I'll let go of him when I give him to
           the Giant.

                          LRRH
           Leave him alone!
          LRRH goes to try and pull JACK away from the WITCH. A tussle
          ensues, and the BAKER notices that JACK has dropped
          something. He goes over and picks up his SCARF.

                          BAKER

                          BAKER (CONT'D)
           Where did you find this?
          The WITCH releases JACK.

          As the truth sinks in.

                          BAKER (CONT'D)
           This is my fault. I let her wander off

           He's going to the Giant and I'm taking
           him.
          The BAKER grabs hold of JACK.

           Yes! He's the one to blame! It's
           because of you there's a giant in our

          ANGLE ON A TREE BY THE TAR PIT
          The BAKER is scaling his way up the tall tree. JACK follows
          him, each carrying slings and stones. A branch gives way
          under JACK but he is able to keep his balance.

           Careful, there. Not so fast.

           You needn't worry -- this is easier
           than a beanstalk.

          the baby. LRRH returns.

           They're in the tree -- over there. We

           Was she killed by the Giant?

                          BAKER
           No. It wasn't like that. She was
           fighting with the Giant, trying to
           protect you, and she was pushed by the
           Steward -- and -- she fell.

           The Steward will pay for this.

                          BAKER (CONT'D)

           MAYBE I JUST WASN'T MEANT TO HAVE

                          CHILDREN--
          The BAKER hears his WIFE'S voice. We see her over his
          shoulder.

                          WIFE

           DON'T SAY THAT!/ OF COURSE YOU WERE

           MEANT TO HAVE CHILDREN.

                          BAKER
           Shhhh.
          As the Baker holds his son close, the baby begins to calm
          down for the first time in his father's arms and his WIFE
          disappears.
          The BAKER tells the story to his son -- THE SAME STORY AS WE

          HEARD AT THE BEGINNING.

           BAKER (CONT'D) WITCH (V.O.)
          Once upon a time...in a far CAREFUL THE THINGS YOU SAY,/
          off kingdom...there lay a CHILDREN WILL LISTEN./

           CAREFUL BEFORE YOU SAY,/ "LISTEN TO

          The light of the new dawn streams down on them, framing the
          newly formed family. As the BAKER continues to tell the story
          the CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS UP overhead to reveal the vast woods,
          now changed by the Giant's path.
          The CAMERA then carries us back beyond the woods and to the
          Village where we see the destruction that has visited it.

          The CAMERA finally pans up from the Village to the sky and we
          are returned to where we began: the grey clouds of an early
          morning sky.
