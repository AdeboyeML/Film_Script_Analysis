          MARK SCHULTZ (27, 180 lbs., cauliflower ears) lifts a human-
          sized, leather WRESTLING DUMMY from the mat to stand in front
          of him. He performs a series of repetitive moves - hooking
          one arm under the dummy's arm, then the other; one side, then
          other. Again and again. It looks almost as if he's dancing
          gently with it.
                         
          Then, very fast, Mark spins quickly around behind the dummy,
          grabs it in a bear hug, arches his back, lifts and SLAMS it
          to the mat, landing on top.
                         
          QUICK CUTS: Mark spinning, lifting and slamming the dummy -

          Dave looks at the BACK OF HIS HAND, where he's written down a
          name and phone number in MARKER. He grabs one of Mark's VHS
          labels and a pen and writes the information.

          Seven HIGH SCHOOL BOYS plus a couple of PRE-TEENS, all in
          wrestling gear, sit on the mat in front of Mark. He seems
          manic, evangelical, not tuned into his audience.
                         
                          MARK
           The minute you step on the mat, you
           are exactly who you are. You can't
           hide. You can't pretend you trained
           harder than you did, you want it
           more than you do. My brother Dave
           and me care about this more than we
           care about anything. The difference
           between the number one guy in the
           world and the number four guy is
           paper thin. The one who wins is the
           one who wants it more, who's
           willing to sacrifice, who can take
           the pain. I can take the pain. My
           brother Dave can take the pain. Can
           you take the pain?

          Dave and the two men see Mark, WAVE to him - but Mark
          pretends not to notice, busies himself loosening his wrists,
          hands, neck. Dave walks over to him.

          They start to circle each other. We sense immediately their
          differences: Dave's hunched and not very muscular physique
          belies his quickness and enormous strength.

          Mark's defining characteristic is brute force. A weight class

          BROTHER.

          Mark RUNS hard through the woods - pushing himself - jumping
          fallen branches, sprinting up hills. He reaches the edge of
          the woods and stops, bent over, breathing heavily.
                         
          Across the field, PRIZE HORSES are led out of the stables
          onto the grounds of the estate. Mark WATCHES.
                         
          A few wrestlers (Zerega, Popper and Dan Bane) emerge from the
          woods behind Mark, running. Dan Bane leaves the other two.

          Zerega and Popper jog off. Dan comes to stand next to Mark,
          who has taken his little pair of BINOCULARS from the pocket
          of his sweats and is looking through them. After a moment, he
          hands Dan the binoculars. Dan looks through them.

          faces, feeding them treats from her hands. She's completely

          reaches du Pont, and from a step below him, THROWS HIS ARMS

          Mark and the team are watching a VIDEOTAPE Garcia has gotten
          of an early ULTIMATE FIGHTING MATCH. It's an American street
          fighter versus a huge Brazilian Jujutsu expert. The match is
          brutal and bloody and the wrestlers watching are CLEARLY INTO
          IT. Mark is lying on the couch - attentive, but quiet.
                         
          There's KNOCKING at the door, but the guys don't notice it.
          Much LOUDER KNOCKING. Garcia opens the door. It's du Pont.
          Mark RISES to greet him as Dan MUTES the video.

          MUSIC in the background. The (now dozen or so) wrestlers and
          their families are gathered around the picnic table, the keg,
          the roasting deer on the SPIT over the fire.
                         
          Du Pont is at the table. Mark stays very much ON THE
          PERIPHERY of the group. Dave's holding court at the table -
          in front of a huge platter of venison steaks -
                         
                          DAVE
           There's this big match between an
           American and a Russian. The Russian
           is a monster, never lost, kills
           everybody with this hold called The
           Pretzel. So the American coach
           tells his wrestler, "Listen,
           whatever you do don't let this guy
           get you in The Pretzel or you're
           dead." Sure enough, match starts,
           the Russian gets him in The
           Pretzel.
                         
          There are smiles around the table.

           The coach buries his head in his
           hands because he know's it's all
           over. Suddenly, he hears the crowd
           roar. When he looks up the Russian
           is flying through the air - he
           lands on his back, the American
           jumps him. Pins him. Boom. The
           match is over.
                         
          Du Pont is studying Dave intently, fascinated by the hold he
          has on people - the attention he gets.

           "Nobody's ever gotten out of The
           Pretzel," the coach says afterward,
           "How'd you do it?" "Well, Coach, I
           was just about to give up when I
           opened my eyes and there was this
           big hairy pair of balls right in
           front of my face. I had nothing to
           lose, so with my last ounce of
           strength I craned my neck and bit
           those babies as hard as I could."
                          (SOME LAUGHS)
           The coach says, "And that did the
           trick?"

          makes this man so effortlessly magnetic.

          actually behaving as if he's coaching. Dave looks at some of
          the wrestlers, realizes this is the norm. He laughs, pats du
          Pont on the back.

          pieces of it): Dave explains how Mark needs to be left alone.
          Du Pont resists at first; Dave is gentle but firm. He tells
          du Pont he shouldn't be in Mark's corner right now.
                         
          Finally, du Pont turns and WALKS OUT. Dave turns back toward
          Mark. Mark puts his head down and PEDALS even harder.

          They get in the car and du Pont turns on the ignition. Before
          he shifts into gear, he removes the PISTOL from his waistband
          and places it on the middle seat. He pulls out.

          Du Pont drives the dirt road that edges the woods ringing the
          enormous front lawn. The trees are bare, a bit snowy.
          Peaceful and pretty. The car approaches Dave's house.

          Du Pont's car pulls up. Dave's Subaru is parked in the yard
          out front, and Dave lies half-in-half-out the driver's side
          door, working on the FUSE BOX under the steering column.
                         
          Dave rises out of the car to see who's pulled up.

           Hey, Coach.
                         
          Dave takes a step toward du Pont's car. Du Pont just looks at
          him through his open driver's window.

          Du Pont SHOOTS Dave. The bullet goes through Dave's hand,
          smashing into his chest, throwing him to the ground.
                         
          The Security Guard scrambles out the car door and ducks
          behind the passenger side fender.

          Du Pont SHOOTS Dave in the back. Then he SHOOTS him in the
          back of the head.
                         
          After a few moments, he drives away.

          He's in front of a painted cinder block wall. He wears only
          shorts, no shirt. A CLOCK ticks on the wall behind him.

          He's completely still, except for his heavy breathing. The
