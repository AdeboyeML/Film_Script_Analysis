THE S A I N T 
by Jonathan Hensleigh 
Director: Phillip Noyce 
February 8, 1995
New York City 

The only difference between the 
saint and the sinner is that every 
saint has a past and every sinner 
has a future.  
- O. Wilde - 

FADE IN: 
The majestic city and bay, as seen from the elevation of the surrounding 
Shan Ho hills as we SUPER  

HONG KONG  1965 

PANNING away from the city, we come before the bleak facade of the SAINT 
IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE.  

BOY'S VOICE (o.s.) 
Simon Magus was a magician and 
sorcerer in uhhm... Sumatra.  

INT. HONG KONG - SAINT IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE - DAY 
Twenty boys, aged 7 to 12, sit at spartan desks, bibles raised. FATHER 
O'NEAL walks amongst them. A career Jesuit with razor eyes and thin lips. An 
awful man.  

FATHER 0'NEAL 
(sternly) 
Sumeria.  
And what happened to him Francis? 

FRANCIS, 12, is the eldest and largest boy.  

FRANCIS 
Jesus' disciples came and performed 
miracles. When Simon Magus saw the 
miracles he offered disciple Peter 
gold for the powers of God.  

FATHER 0'NEAL 
What did disciple Peter say to that? 
Michael Quinn? 

Father O'Neal stands before the youngest, littlest boy, who, unlike the others, 
exhibits no fear in his huge, intelligent eyes. Father O'Neal hates this boy.  

The boy, MICHAEL QUINN, doesn't respond.  
Father O'Neal snatches his bible, revealing a SECOND BOOK hidden behind it.  

It's a dime store pulp adventure with a gaudy cover entitled "THE KNIGHTS 
TEMPLAR." 

FATHER 0'NEAL 
Answer the question Michael.  

The little boy stares up at him.  

MICHAEL QUINN 
That's not my name.  

Father O'Neal yanks the boy from the chair. Drags him by the arm across the 
room and out into the corridor.  

THE OTHER BOYS wait two seconds, then they spring up and run, en masse, 
to the door. Grouped in the threshold, straining for a good view, they watch 
as -- 

FATHER O'NEIL pulls Michael Quinn into an office down the corridor. The door 
has a stained-glass window.  

It begins. We see it in SILHOUETTE: Father O'Neal with a CANE SWITCH in 
his hand, the boy beneath him. Down the switch comes. Again. And again.  
The boy YELPS. And again and again and again... and now he SCREAMS...

THE BOYS HUDDLED IN THE DOORWAY begin to wince. With every repeated, 
merciless descent of the switch...  

INT. SAINT IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE - EATING HALL - NIGHT 
THE BOYS sit at benches. Michael Quinn stares stoically ahead. The back of 
his shirt is striped with blood.  

FATHER YIN, 50's, a Chinese Jesuit, grim in black frock and white collar, 
paces amongst the benches. Father O'Neal watches from the side.  

FATHER YIN 
Why one child is born into a good 
home and another into poverty - that 
is but part of God's design. All of 
you are unwanted, put here because 
of the sins of your unwedded 
mothers. The church has fed you and 
educated you. Given you a home. A 
name. An identity.  

Stopping before Michael Quinn, he points to a PORTRAIT ON THE WALL of a 
stern-faced Jesuit.  

FATHER YIN 
Who is that, boy? 

MICHAEL QUINN 
Father Michael Quinn.  

FATHER YIN 
Yes. A great man. You ungrateful 
little cur, you will sit here 
without food until you appreciate 
your namesake.  
(to the other boys) 
All of you will sit with him. Put 
lunch away, Mr. Fong.  

MR. FONG, the orphanage cook, wheels a FOOD CART into the kitchen and 
locks the door. Father Yin exits, followed by Father O'Neal and Mr. Fong, 
leaving -- 

A HUNDRED BOYS staring at Michael Quinn.  

DISSOLVE TO: 

INT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
Again, Father Yin stands before Michael Quinn. The boys are seated for their 
evening meal.  

FATHER YIN 
What is your name, boy? 

Silence. Michael Quinn stares straight ahead.  

FATHER YIN 
Put supper away, Mr. Fong.  

MR. FONG wheels the FOOD CART into the kitchen and locks the door. Again, 
a hundred boys stare at Michael Quinn.  

INT . ORPHANAGE BUNKROOM - NIGHT 
A long, narrow room with bunkbeds. The boys aren't sleeping. They're 
grouped around Michael Quinn's bunk. One boy has his hand clamped to 
Michael's, mouth, the others are wailing on him... and outside -- 

INT. ORPHANAGE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BUNKROOM - NIGHT 
Fathers O'Neal and Yin watch through the door.  

FATHER YIN 
Spareth the rod, spoileth the child.  

INT. ORPHANAGE - MORNING 
Father Yin grits his teeth, staring down at Michael Quinn, whose face is 
welted. Nothing has changed.  

FATHER YIN 
Put breakfast away, Mr. Fong. 
 
Again, the FOOD CART goes into the kitchen. The Fathers and Mr. Fong exit.  
The boys rise, moving toward Michael Quinn. They're going to kick the living 
shit out of him.  

MICHAEL QUINN 
Stop. You'll have your breakfast.  

Michael Quinn walks to the locked kitchen door.  
The other boys, curious, follow.  

Michael Quinn kneels before the door, examining the lock. He looks around.  
On a counter next to the door are EATING UTENSILS. Michael Quinn picks up 
A FORK. He bends the fork's tines. Inserts it in the lock.  
He fishes around for a second. Nothing happens. He pulls the fork out, 
rebends it, and inserts it in the lock again. And CLICK.. ..the lock pops.  

Michael Quinn turns and smiles. The boys flood inside.  
The hungry boys go for the food cart, scooping up eggs and sausage. They're 
ravenous. Francis, mouth full of sausage, beams at Michael Quinn.  

FRANCIS 
They should've named you Simon, like 
Simon Magus the sorcerer.  

MICHAEL QUINN 
No. Simon. . . .  
(pulls the "KNIGHTS TEMPLAR" paperback from his back pocket) 
...Templar.  

Suddenly a SHARP WHISTLE. The boys, startled, whip their necks around.  
MR. FONG stands in the doorway.  
Father O'Neal and Father Yin enter quickly.  
The boys back away from the food cart.  

FATHER YIN 
Who.. . who did this...? 
The boys look at Michael Quinn. Then Francis speaks: 
FRANCIS 
I did father.  
And another boy, James: 
JAMES 
I did father. .  

And another and another: "I did father." They all say it. And the littlest 
youngest boy, surrounded by his new confederates, smiles slightly. His eyes 
glint.  

CUT TO: 

Begin MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE 

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA - NIGHT 
A chilly September night. A rally is underway in the Dvortsovaya Ploshchad, 
the vast square at the foot of Nevsky Prospect Boulevard. The Winter Palace 
and Hermitage loom in the b.g.  
500,000 ST. PETERS BURGERS' stand shoulder-to-shoulder, listening to a 
SPEECH. INTERNATIONAL T.V. CREWS (the BBC, CNN, etc.) are transmitting 
the event.  

SPEAKER (o.s.) 
In I917 Lenin stood here and 
promised a new age. The result? 
Tyranny. Poverty. The darkest 
years in our history.  

THE SPEAKER stands on a platform behind a cluster of microphones, his 
image projected on a huge screen (like the Sony screen in Times Square) 
above and behind him.  

He is MICHAEL ROMANOV, coal-haired, fierce, ardent, eyes glinting like onyx, 
voice cutting the night air.  

ROMANOV 
In 1987 Gorbachev stood here and 
promised a new age. The result? An 
end to communism. Democracy. A 
free economy. And what else? 
Chaos.  
(crowd CHEERS) 
The economy run by criminals, the 
government run by charlatans. And 
they are in league together! 
Thieves! Traitors! 
(louder CHEERS) 
Men and women of St. Petersburg, 
citizens of Russia, the salt of this 
country, this must end! 
(deafening CHEERS) 
Join me then in the song of our 
forefathers.  
Romanov begins to sing, ably, the first verse of "Mother Russia" 
(the Russian anthem before the Bolsheviks).  

THE CROWD joins him. The Ploshchad rings with the voices of half a million 
Russians...  

CUT TO: 

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NIKKO HOTEL - CONTINUOUS 

We're 12 stories up, outside the city's Nikko hotel.  
The rally across town is a distant glow.  
We hear the singing crowd.  

TWO HANDS appear, gripping the nooks of the exterior architecture. A MAN 
IN BLACK climbs up, securing a sling to the window frame in which to sit. A 
bulky BACKPACK hangs from shoulder straps.  
He produces a diamond cutter; begins carving a man-sized aperture in the 
window. Below, in the foyer  

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM 
-- A JAPANESE SECURITY MAN sits at his guard station, watching C.N.N.  
NEWS on a small television. Wolf Blitzer is reporting live from the rally.  

WOLF BLITZER 
(on t.v.)
An extraordinary allegation, 
Bernard, that Russia's present 
leadership, including President 
Victor Karpov, is connected with the 
country's underworld.  

Inside the foyer ballroom, Japanese businessmen are hosting a reception. The 
Nikko Hotel's core is hollow, like the Hilton in New York; thus, the ballroom's 
"ceiling" is 12 stories up.  

CHAMPAGNE SERVERS are passing out glasses. A grey-haired Japanese 
businessman, HIRO MYAKI, clinks his glass. The guests pay attention.  
During this we focus on a CHAMPAGNE SERVER moving toward the lobby 
elevators with a full tray.  

HIRO MYAKI 
Ladies. Gentlemen. The Myaki 
Corporation looks forward to many 
profitable days ahead. To our new 
manufacturing facility in St.  
Petersburg. To the new Russia! 

As the crowd CLAPS...  

EXT. NIKKO HOTEL - EXTERIOR WALL 
...the Man In Black kicks at the cut section of window, pushing it into the 
hotel and plunging inside after it.  

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE 
The Man In Black catches hold of a steel girder and dangles, and, 
miraculously -- 

THE PIECE OF WINDOW doesn't fall.  

It's stuck to his feet with suction cups.  

The Man In Black moves, hand over hand, toward the mezzanine balcony, the 
window stuck to his feet.  

IN THE LOBBY BELOW 
Everybody's beaming, toasting, congratulating, etc., totally oblivious to THE 
MAN IN BLACK, 12 stories up, inching hand-over-hand across the roof 
superstructure.  

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE OVER MEZZANINE 
The Man In Black has reached the mezzanine.  
TWO JAPANESE SECURITY GUARDS, armed with automatic rifles, walk their 
shift directly below him. They pass a wall mounted television, also carrying 
the NEWS: 

WOLF BLITZER
(on t.v.) 
One thing's certain, Bernard: 
Michael Romanov, age 32, French born 
and Oxford educated, descendent of 
the last czar, is a political force 
to be reckoned with.  

The guards move down the mezzanine; one jokes, the other laughs. They 
disappear around a corner.  
The Man in Black hangs from the girder with one hand; with the other he 
yanks the piece of window off his foot-mounted suction cups.  
He drops to the mezzanine. He rests the glass against the wall. He peers over 
the balustrade at the party below. Satisfied, he removes his hood, ENDING TITLES.  

This is SIMON TEMPLAR. A hard, self-reliant, crafty man. You should treat him 
as such or be very sorry you ever met him. It is unfortunate that a man of 
Templar's various talents can be so lacking. How? 

His journey has been through a tough world and he has come fast. This one 
gives no quarter. Ever. Though his outward self glows with life, he is dead inside.  

Templar, focused utterly, steals inside a corridor.  

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR 
A long corridor with a door at the end, on which is engraved: MYAKI 
CORPORATION. At the entrance, secured in a niche, is a BRONZE BUST OF 
HIRO MYAKI.  

Templar stops cold. A RUG (an oriental runner) extends the length of the 
corridor.  

Templar kneels, lifting an edge of the rug.  
Revealing ANTI -THEFT PRESSURE SENSORS.  
Templar produces a DARTGUN (the size of a flare gun, silenced, with a spool 
of steel cable attached to the top). He aims down the corridor and fires.  

A STEEL DART explodes from the barrel, spooling out the cable, and imbeds 
above the door at corridor's end.  

Templar yanks the other end of cable from the spool. He looks around for 
something to secure it.  

TEMPLAR 
Sorry about this.  

He ties the cable around Myaki's bronze neck.  
He hangs from the cable, testing it. It will hold.  
He pulls out an aluminum contraption with small wheels and two handle grips.  
It's A GLIDER for the cable.  
He attaches the glider to the cable, grips the handles, and glides the length of 
the corridor.  

THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR - OVER THE DOOR 

Templar bumps up against the door. He pulls his knees up and over the 
handles of the glider, then flops over backwards, hanging upside down.  
HIS FACE is now right next to the door handle, over which is an ELECTRONIC 
LOCK (opened by punching a code).  

Templar pulls out a BLACK BOX. It's a really small, really powerful computer 
and its job is to run through every possible number combination in about a 
minute and a half. Templar wires the computer to the lock with two needlelike 
ELECTRODE PROBES.  

He activates the system. The little computer starts running through 
combinations of numbers. He waits, hanging upside down. Meanwhile-- 

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE - ELEVATOR LOBBY 
The Japanese guards are smoking by the elevator, joking, laughing. One of 
these guys is a riot...  
The elevator opens. The CHAMPAGNE SERVER comes out, tray in hand.  

CHAMPAGNE SERVER 
Compliments of Mr. Myaki.  

JAPANESE GUARDS 
(delighted) 
Ahh! 

Beaming, they each take a glass. They clink and drink.  

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR 
The computer BEEPS. It's finished.  
Templar turns the door handle; pushes open the door.  
He pulls himself up. Hangs from his hands again.  
He swings his legs back and forth, getting momentum up.  
He releases from the glider and lunges inside.  

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MYAKI CORPORATION OFFICES 
A grand boardroom with Japanese furniture and art.  
At the end of a fifty-foot mahogany table is a PAINTING OF HIRO MYAKI.  
Templar walks over to it.  

TEMPLAR 
Sorry again.  

He RIPS the painting off the wall and heaves it aside.  
And here, where the painting was, is A SAFE.  
Templar unshoulders his backpack. He pulls out a 40-pound CARLSBAD & 
RINKER industrial diamond-tipped drill, as big as a jackhammer. No finesse 
here, people.  

No, there's no time for high-tech. He's going to drill right through the bitch, 
right through four inches of tungsten steel. He starts setting up the drill.  

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE LOBBY 
Two CHAMPAGNE GLASSES lie shattered on the floor, and next to that mess 
lie the JAPANESE GUARDS, now unconscious. The champagne server's 
gone...  

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE 
...because he's here, moving quickly toward the Myaki Corporation's office, 
and he's not a champagne server, but a thief and a killer, a blonde Russian 
named ILYA.  
Ilya stops just outside the interior corridor. With the GUARD'S KEYRING, he 
shuts off the anti-theft mats and moves around the corner into the corridor.  

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR 
Ilya stops short. His eyes spark.  
He sees Templar's cable and glider.  

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MYAKI CORPORATION OFFICES 
Templar, wearing goggles, leans into the drill as THE BIT CHEWS into the 
tungsten lock. This is a violent exercise. SINEWS OF METAL spit out like 
shrapnel.  

He's through the lock in seconds. Templar heaves the drill aside; it lands with 
a THUD on the beautiful mahogany table. He opens the safe.  
INSIDE THE SAFE is one object: A SMALL BOX, the size of a cufflink keeper.  
Templar grabs it and opens it.  

INSIDE THE LITTLE BOX is a tiny MICRO-CHIP.  
Templar closes the box and pockets it.  

ILYA (v.o.) 
Don't move.  

Templar freezes. His eyes twitch.  
This wasn't in the plan...  

ILYA (v.o.) 
Turn around. Slowly.  

Templar faces Ilya. Ilya has a silenced handgun.  

ILYA 
On your knees.  
(Templar sinks to his knees) 
Give me the box. Slowly.  

Templar pulls out the box. Tosses it to Ilya.  
Ilya raises the handgun at Templar's head. Smiles.  
Try something: throw an extension cord on the ground. I guarantee it will 
land coiled in several places.  

Ilya happens to be standing inside one of the coils of the drill's extension 
cord.  
And this is not lost on Templar.  
Templar, on his knees, grabs the cord and yanks it; the coil tightens around 
Ilya's ankles. His legs fly from under him and he goes down, the gun 
clattering across the floor.  
Ilya tries to get to his feet.  
Templar floors him with a right cross.  
Templar grabs the box and his backpack and sprints across the room. Ilya 
gains his feet and grabs his gun; sprints after Templar.  

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE 
Templar runs to the balustrade and climbs atop it.  

He jumps, clutching the ceiling girder above.  
He's going out the way he came in.  
Suddenly ILYA'S HANDS are around his ankles.  
Templar falls. He's going 12 stories to his death.  
No. His fingers clutch the outside of the balustrade. Templar dangles there, 
looking up at the sadistic face of Ilya. And suddenly below -- 

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM 
-- A JAPANESE WOMAN, looking up, pointing at the man dangling from the 
balustrade above, SCREAMS. And now everybody looks up.  

HIRO MYAKI 
Sound the alarm! Call the police! 

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE 
Ilya and Templar. Ilya calmly compresses his foot against Templar's left 
knuckles.  

ILYA 
The box please.  

Templar, grimacing, reaches with his right hand and pulls the box from his 
pocket. Hands it slowly to Ilya, who reaches over the balustrade for it...  

TEMPLAR stuffs the box in his teeth and grabs Ilya's hand, jerking him over 
the balustrade.  
Ilya falls 12 stories to his death.  
No he doesn't. He falls one story and miraculously catches the balustrade 
there.  
Templar clambers up again, atop the balustrade.  
He jumps to the ceiling girder.  
Hand over hand, swinging like an acrobat, Templar's across the girder in 
seconds.  

He releases from the girder to the window frame.  
There's one further problem. BULLETS. Ricocheting all around him. Fired by -- 

ILYA, one floor down.  
Templar reaches over his shoulder. Pulls a GUN from his backpack. To return 
fire? No, it's the DART GUN.  
Templar aims the dart gun out the aperture he cut in the window and fires.  

EXT. NIKKO HOTEL - 12TH FLOOR 

A STEEL DART launches from the window, flies fifty yards, and imbeds in the 
STAIRCASE BULKHEAD OF THE BUILDING ADJACENT TO THE NIKKO.  

INT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE 
Templar ties the cable to the ceiling girder.  
He pulls out his black hood and drapes it over the taught cable. He grabs both 
ends of the hood.  
And he jumps.  

EXT. NIKKO HOTEL/ADJACENT BUILDING 
Templar flies through space, across the cable, the hood acting as a makeshift 
glider.  
He lands on the roof of the adjacent building.  
Templar looks around. SIRENS ARE WAILING.  
He runs across rooftops, disappearing into the St. Petersburg night.  

INT . NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM 
Total chaos. Women screaming, everybody running around. Ilya comes 
through the panicked crowd.  
Ten ST. PETERSBURG POLICEMEN enter.  

ILYA 
I tried to stop him! He went out 
the window! 

Five policemen go for the elevators. Five more exit quickly. Ilya follows.  

EXT. NIKKO HOTEL - ENTRANCE 
The befuddled police race off, looking skyward at the top floors of the 
building.  
Ilya curses silently. And peels away from the cops and commotion, off into 
the night.  

CUT TO: 

INT. A BRITISH-AIR 747 - MORNING 
The First Class section. The plane is in flight.  
A STEWARDESS, young, perky, comes down the aisle pushing a 
magazine/newspaper cart.  

STEWARDESS 
Newspaper sir? 

SIMON TEMPLAR sits there, dressed as usual without much heed to fashion.  
Note this, reader: Templar is not a super-spy, super-hero, or super-rake. He 
is a thief.  

He's examining several antique Russian BRACELETS and LOCKETS. He looks 
up at the stewardess.  

STEWARDESS 
(Cockney) 
Wow, are those gorgeous or what...  

TEMPLAR 
You have an eye for beauty. Of course - you see it every time you 
look in the mirror.  

She blushes, fidgets, as his eyes bore in on her.  

STEWARDESS 
Why thank-you, Mr...  
(reads seat assignment) 
Templar.  

She continues down the aisle, smiling to herself.  
Templar resumes with his lockets.  

INT. BRITISH AIR 747 - FIVE HOURS LATER 
The plane has landed.  
PASSENGERS are filing out past the Stewardess.  

STEWARDESS 
Goodbye, goodbye, enjoy your stay in London, etc.  

Templar moves past the Stewardess, carrying TWO CARRY-ON BAGS. He 
winks at her. She winks back, and fingers one of the RUSSIAN LOCKETS, now 
around her neck.  

STEWARDESS 
Good-bye, Mr. Templar.  

As Templar moves off, she smiles to herself and CUT TO: 

INT. LONDON - HEATHROW AIRPORT 
Templar walks briskly away from customs.  
A MAN IN TRENCHCOAT falls in behind Templar.  
TWO MEN appear in front of Templar, blocking his path; the man behind 
Templar comes to his side. They are Scotland Yard men BAKER, TEAL, and INSPECTOR MACDUFF.  

INSPECTOR MACDUFF 
How's the weather in St. Petersburg? 

TEMPLAR 
Cold.  

INSPECTOR MACDUFF 
Let's warm things up for you.  

Baker and Teal gruffly take Templar by the shoulder and walk him forward and CUT TO: 

INT. HEATHROW CUSTOMS - INTERROGATION ROOM 
A spartan room, a table and two chairs. MacDuff ransacks TEMPLAR'S BAGS 
while, across the room -- 

Templar kisses the wall, hands outstretched, as Baker finishes frisking him.  
Templar turns.  

BAKER 
He's clean.  

TEMPLAR 
(to MacDuff) 
Careful with that. It's delicate 
equip...  

MacDuff lifts Templar's 9MM PISTOL from the bag.  

TEMPLAR 
. . . ment.  

MACDUFF 
Yes. Very.  

TEMPLAR 
It's for protection.  
I deal in antique....  

MACDUFF 
(snaps) 
I know what you deal in. And these? 
Your pajamas? 

He holds up Templar's black bodysuit.  

TEMPLAR 
For jogging. My doctor's 
recommended five miles a...  

MACDUFF 
Sit down and shut it.  

Templar sits down.  

Baker has Templar's papers. He holds up a certificate.  

BAKER 
He's licensed to carry, Inspector.  

MACDUFF 
Let's see the passport.  
(Baker hands MacDuff 
Templar's passport) 
What's your nationality this week, 
Templar? 

TEMPLAR 
I forget.  

MACDUFF 
(looks at passport) 
Issued by the Principality 
of.. . Yemen? You're bloody joking.  

TEMPLAR 
(shrugs) 
Call the embassy 

MacDuff whips the passport at Templar. Templar calmly moves his head; the 
passport flies by. Hits the wall.  

MACDUFF 
Shut it.  

MacDuff leans down, coming in close.  
Templar doesn't blink. His expression never changes.  

MACDUFF 
You pass through Russia for a day 
with that gear and, what a surprise, a prototype 
computer chip worth quarter of a billion quid is nicked 
from the Myaki Corporation the night you arrive. We know 
you didn't fence it in Russia. Where is it? 

The door opens. Teal enters, tossing several X-RAY PHOTOGRAPHS on the 
table before MacDuff. Two are of Templar's bags, two are of his body.  

TEAL 
(Cockney) 
All negative. He didn't swallow it.  

An embarrassing pause.  

TEMPLAR 
You've got three options: charge me, 
or release me.  

MACDUFF 
What's the third.  

TEMPLAR 
You can kiss my ass.  

A dreadful pause. MacDuff smiles.  
He turns away, then turns back and viciously backhands Templar across the 
face; Templar's head jerks. The blow would knock most men out.  
Now Templar smiles. Like a serpant. And says calmly: 

TEMPLAR 
I'm a busy man. Make up your mind.  

MacDuff stares at Templar, gritting his teeth.  
Templar rises. Begins collecting his things.  

CUT TO: 

INT. LONDON RESTAURANT - EVENING 
A quaint place off Piccadilly. The STEWARDESS (from Templar's flight) gulps a 
martini. She is tipsy. She shows it.  

STEWARDESS 
.. . then me mum says, call uncle 
Charlie, he's in the airline 
business, there's jobs there, good 
benefits too, and.. ..where was I? 

TEMPLAR, enduring this, sits opposite with a scotch.  

TEMPLAR 
How you got your job.  

STEWARDESS 
Right! 
(hiccups, giggles) 
'Scuze me.  

Templar motions to a passing WAITRESS.  

TEMPLAR 
Another round please.  

STEWARDESS 
Ye're tryin' ta get me drunk, aren't 
you? Are you cute or what? I gotta 
freshen up.  
(she rises) 
Where's the loo in 'ere? 

TEMPLAR 
Back there. Leave your locket.  
I'll polish it for you.  

She smiles crookedly; hands over the locket.  

STEWARDESS 
Are you a dearheart or what...  

She blows Templar a kiss and lurches off to the bathroom. Templar watches 
her a moment.  
When she's gone he puts the locket on the table.  
He pries open the back of it with a pen-knife.  

INSERT - THE LOCKET - there is a compartment in which sits THE STOLEN 
MICRO-CHIP. Templar plucks out the chip and drops it into an envelope.  

BACK TO SCENE - FOLLOWING THE STEWARDESS 
as she returns to the table. She sits down. Looks around. Templar's gone. The 
locket's gone. The waitress appears.  

STEWARDESS 
Maam, where's the gent who was 
sitting 'ere? 

WAITRESS 
He left, luv. Said you'd take care 
of the bill.  

She hands the Stewardess the bill. She stares at it.  

STEWARDESS 
What? 

She sinks down, confused, blinking, near tears. CUT TO: 

INT. LONDON - MUSGRAVE HOTEL 
A small, plush, discrete residential hotel in the heart of Mayfair (Regent Street, Grovesnor Sq. or equivalent). TEMPLAR approaches the front desk with his carry-on bags. CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON and the HOTEL MANAGER are behind the desk.  

CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON 
Mr. Templar! Good to see you sir.  
Your room key - south penthouse as 
usual. Your suits are up from storage, 
pressed of course, and 
there's a bottle of Oban on the 
dresser.  

TEMPLAR 
Thanks Harry. Oh, and Harry...  
(pulls out the envelope with the computer chip) 
.. . ship this by overnight courier to that address.  

CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON 
Very good sir.  

JIMMY, a young Bellman, takes Ternplar's bags. Templar doesn't let go. An 
uncomfortable pause.  

CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON 
Jimmy, Mr. Templar carries his own bags.  

Templar steps past Jimmy into the elevator.  

JIMMY THE BELLMAN 
What's with the bags, gov'nuh? 

HOTEL MANAGER 
They're all he ever brings. The 
man's bills are paid by a bank in 
Switzerland and his mailing address 
is a corporation in Lisbon. Bloody strange...  

CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON 
Mr. Templar, strange? No sir, he's 
just shy.  

CUT TO: 

INT . MUSGRAVE HOTEL - SOUTH PENTHOUSE 
Ternplar sits at a desk with a bottle of Oban scotch and glass, staring at the 
screen of a modemed MINI-COMPUTER.  

-- Templar types: LION CONTACTING ZEBRA: IS ZEBRA HOME? 

-- And this comes back: AFFIRMATIVE, LION.  

-- Templar types: PIGEON IS FLYING; WILL ARRIVE A.M.  

-- And this back: EXCELLENT. LION GETS LION'S SHARE. -- Templar types a 
new command. A new screen appears: 

******* NATIONAL BANK OF GENEVA ******* 

PRIVATE UNMARKED ACCOUNTS 

PLEASE ENTER SECURITY PASSWORD 

Templar types in: 77N8LS473Z. This appears: 

******* NATIONAL BANK OF GENEVA ******* 

ACCOUNT OF: TEMPLAR, SIMON 

BALANCE (AS OF 8/1S/95): U.S. $47,895,12S.12 (Not a typo, reader. It's forty-seven million bucks.) 

Templar picks up his scotch and drinks, staring at the screen. He's waiting for 
something...  
The first digit, "4," vanishes.  
A "5" appears in it's place. Now fifty-seven million.  

Templar permits a slight smile, having just made 10 million dollars, and 
drinks his scotch.  

The phone RINGS. Templar eyes it skeptically. He picks it up.  

TEMPLAR 
Yes.  

A voice with an Eastern European accent: 

VOICE 
Is this Simon Templar? 

TEMPLAR 
It depends.  

VOICE 
A meeting. Midnight, Blackfriars 
Bridge.  

TEMPLAR 
Involving what? 

VOICE 
A lot of money. If you want it.  

Click. Templar recradles the receiver; He stares at it a moment and CUT TO: 

INT. MUSGRAVE HOTEL LOBBY - LATER - NIGHT 
Templar enters the lobby wearing a fresh suit under a black leather trench 
coat. He goes to the desk, where concierge Harry Winston looks up.  

TEMPLAR 
Harry, I'm going for a walk over 
Blackfriars Bridge. Midnight.  

Pause. And Harry, just perceptibly, nods. And returns to his obsequious self.  

HARRY WINSTON 
Very good, sir.  

Templar walks off through the lobby.  

HARRY WINSTON 
Jimmy 
(Jimmy walks over) 
It's about time I taught you how to 
run the front desk.  

CUT TO: 

EXT. LONDON - BLACKFRIAR' S BRIDGE - MIDNIGHT 
Fog. The bridge lights cast everything in a sickly yellow glow. Below, A 
TUGBOAT plows the river, horn BELLOWING. The lights of Southwark twinkle 
beyond.  

Templar enters from Victoria Embankment.  
TWO FIGURES emerge from the fog. Templar approaches.  
One is a huge dim-wit with greasy hair, as tall and wide as a bookcase. His 
name, aptly, is ZERO.  
The other is middle-aged and strongly built. A high forehead; clipped, irongrey 
hair; square jaw and aquiline nose; deep-set, ruthless, unblinking eyes.  

This is GREGOR TRETIAK. To characterize him as the John Gotti of Russia is to 
demean him. He is vastly more powerful.  

TRETIAK 
Interesting.  
(sizes up Templar) 
You are not a big man. But men like 
you never are. It is my pleasure, 
Simon Templar. My name is...  

TEMPLAR 
I know who you are. Tell me what 
you want, or I keep walking.  

TRETIAK 
Suppose I don't want anything.  
Suppose I want to kill you.  

TEMPLAR 
Suppose there's a high-powered rifle 
trained at your head.  

As Tretiak's eyes dart about, Templar raises his hand, waving, signaling to 
someone below the bridge -- 

BELOW THE BRIDGE - ON THE VICTORIA EMBANKMENT 

-- that someone is CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON, in a cloth cap and rain 
mack now, and yes, he has a 30.6 scoped rifle trained at Tretiak's head.  

BACK TO THE BRIDGE Tretiak's jaw muscles twitch. He smiles thinly.  

TRETIAK 
Rumour has not lied about you, Mr.  
Templar. Last night something was 
stolen in St. Petersburg. My city.  

TEMPLAR 
You talk about the place as if you 
own it.  

TRETIAK 
(sinisterly) 
I do, Mr. Templar. May I ask who hired you? 

TEMPLAR 
You can ask. I won't answer.  

TRETIAK 
What you stole I wanted very badly.  
(beat) 
Ilya.  

Ilya emerges from the shadows.  
Locks eyes with Templar. The thief from the Nikko! 

TRETIAK 
What is the saying - if you can't 
beat them, why not join them? 
An American phrase, no? Or are you 
British? Australian? 

TEMPLAR 
I'm nothing. Except bored.  
Get to the point.  

TRETIAK 
(smiles) 
Of course. An American scientist 
has worked ten years to develop a 
certain technology. I am informed 
that the technology will be made 
public at the annual nuclear science 
symposium in Washington D.C. I 
would like the plans and 
specifications for this technology. Before the symposium.  

TEMPLAR 
What are we talking about? 

TRETIAK 
A nuclear fusion generator. We have 
a man on the inside.  

TEMPLAR 
Why can't he steal it? 

TRETIAK 
He's tried. The scientist trusts no 
one and keeps no hard records of the 
technology in the lab.  

TEMPLAR 
Nuclear fusion. They say it's 
mankind's only hope after all the 
oil's gone. This guy's actually done it? 

TRETIAK 
She.  

TEMPLAR 
Come again? 

TRETIAK 
She, Mr. Templar. The scientist is a woman.  
(hands over a dossier) 
Her dossier. All the information 
you will need.  

TEMPLAR 
My fee is fifteen million U.S.  
dollars, half up front, half when I 
deliver. You'll hear from me.  

Templar turns and walks off.  

TRETIAK 
Templar, one question.  

Templar stops. Turns.  

TRETIAK 
I ask you to steal a person's entire 
life's work. You have no reaction.  
Are you that cold? 

Templar stares back, expressionless. He turns and disappears into the fog.  

TRETIAK 
No, rumor hasn't lied about you, Templar.  

CUT TO: 

EXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - ESTABLISHING SHOTS 
Various establishing shots of this suburban community just north of 
Manhattan. Pretty, charming, affluent.  

INT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - SUPERMARKET 
A large suburban supermarket.  
The aisles are full of Westchester women: affluent, country clubby, 
housewifey types.  
A HAND reaches for a BOTTLE OF LEMONADE (100% Natural) , bringing it 
down to the eye level of -- 

JILLIAN ST. THOMAS. She is lean, a swimmer's body perhaps, with terrific 
acuteness and authority in her thought, speech, and action. Debate this 
woman? Fine, but you'd better know what the hell you're talking about. Her 
stare can stop a train.  
She's casually dressed. Only her JACKET stands out.  
It's waist-cut, with a colorful diagram of protons and electrons circling a 
nucleus embroidered on the back.  

JILLIAN 
(reads ingredients) 
Filtered water, high fructose corn 
syrup. Lemon juice concentrate.  
Citric acid. Gum acacia...? 
(grumbles) 
Totally natural, yeah right.  

She returns the bottle and turns, coming face-to-face with SIMON TEMPLAR, 
wearing a moustache and glasses now.  
He has a bottle of LEMON JUICE in his hand.  

TEMPLAR 
Try this.  
(smiles) 
Sorry, I overheard.  
(hands her the bottle) 
The real thing. No chemicals, 
no preservatives.  

She reads the label. Satisfied, she looks at Templar.  

JILLIAN 
Thanks.  

She puts it in her cart and wheels off and CUT TO: 

INT. SUPERMARKET - PRODUCE SECTION - MINUTES LATER 
Jillian is examining apples. There is a THUMPING NOISE. It persists. Finally 
she looks over at -- 

TEMPLAR. He's standing in front of the watermelons. He's thumping one with 
his thumb. He notices Jillian.  

TEMPLAR 
Hello again. These aren't ripe.  
How are the apples? 

JILLIAN 
Excellent. They're in season.  

Templar walks over to the apples. Picks one up. Studies it for a moment.  

TEMPLAR 
I wonder why He didn't want us to eat these.  

A pause. She looks at him, puzzled.  

JILLIAN 
Who? 

TEMPLAR 
God. In the Garden of Eden.  

JILLIAN 
Oh right. Sorry, little slow today.  
Bad headache.  
(looks at the apple) 
Uhm, actually, I don't know.  

TEMPLAR 
Why wasn't it: "No bananas." Or: 
"Avoid, at all cost, kumquats." 
Wonder what God had against apples.  
She gives him a funny look and turns away.  

JILLIAN 
Sorry. Can't help you.  

TEMPLAR 
How about William Tell? You really 
think he shot one of these off his 
brother's head with an arrow? 

Jillian turns around again. A pause.  

JILLIAN 
Do I know you? 

TEMPLAR 
Unlikely. I just moved to New York.  

She stares at him. This is a very strange man.  
Intriguing yes, but also possibly a lunatic. She decides to take the dismissive 
route: 

JILLIAN 
Well uhhm, sir, to answer your apple 
questions, one, I don't know what 
God's problem was. Two, William 
Tell, like Paul Bunyon, never 
existed. And in case you're 
wondering, Isaac Newton discovered 
gravity through planetary 
observation not because one of those 
fell on his head, and I seriously doubt 
that eating one a day will keep the doctor away.  
(beat) 
Okay? 

She wheels her cart off. Says over her shoulder: 

JILLIAN 
By the way - welcome to the Big Apple.  

Templar watches her wheel off. His eyes glint. This is going to be 
interesting...  

CUT TO: 

EXT. WESTCHESTER SUPERMARKET - PARKING LOT - DAY 

Jillian slams down the hatch of her station wagon, now filled with groceries.  
She gets in.  
The car pulls out of the parking lot.  

INT. JILLIAN'S STATION WAGON - DRIVING 
Jillian, driving, drinking her lemonade, listens to a cassette tape. An 
authoritative, scholarly, Indian voice: 

VIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) 
Nuclear fusion occurs when pairs of 
nuclei meet and their protons and 
neutrons fuse together into a single 
nucleus. The fused nuclei move off 
at high speed, producing energy.  
Nuclear fusion could provide us 
with almost unlimited power.  

JILLIAN 
No, really? Moron.  

VIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) 
All you need are two hydrogen gases, 
deuterium and lithium, and a machine 
to make them fuse under controlled conditions.  

JILLIAN 
C'mon, Dr. Singh. Tell me something 
I don't know.  

Jillian sees something through the windshield.  
She turns down the volume and squints -- 

JILLIAN'S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD 
A ROLLS ROYCE sits on the road shoulder. As we pass the Rolls, we see 
SIMON TEMPLAR standing next to it wearing a hopeless expression.  

BACK TO SCENE - JILLIAN 
looks at the Rolls in the rear-view mirror. She frowns.  

JILLIAN 
Just keep driving.  

Jillian frowns again. Against her better judgment, she pulls over. Throws it in 
reverse.  

EXT. WESTCHESTER - SUBURBAN ROAD SHOULDER - DAY 
Jillian's station wagon backs up to the Rolls Royce on the road shoulder. Jillian 
gets out.  

TEMPLAR 
Hello! 
She walks up to him. Together they look down at THE REAR TIRE. It's flat, a 
pancake.  

JILLIAN 
Where's the spare? 

TEMPLAR 
I.. .well.. .I'm not really certain.  

JILLIAN 
You do know how to change a tire.  

TEMPLAR 
Sorry.  
(beat) 
I'm not very...  
mechanical.  

Jillian rolls her eyes.  

JILLIAN 
Give me your keys.  

Templar hands them over.  
They walk to the rear. Jillian opens the trunk.  
They both look down at -- .  

THE TRUNK'S INTERIOR - THE SPARE TIRE is also flat.  

TEMPLAR 
(sheepish) 
Sorry.  

Jillian rolls her eyes again.  

JILLIAN 
All right, where do you live? 

TEMPLAR 
Close.  

JILLIAN 
It's your lucky day.  
(begins to walk off) 
Come on.  

Templar watches her walk off. He smiles grimly.  

CUT TO: 

INT. JILLIAN'S CAR - DRIVING 
The car winds through Westchester roads.  

VIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) 
Research has centered on a machine 
called a tokamak, developed in 
Russia, essentially a doughnut 
shaped tube that contains the gases to 
be fused.  

At this, Templar stares at the tape cassette.  

VIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) 
The tokamak hasn't worked because 
the two gases must be heated to a 
temperature of hundreds of millions 
of degrees, and kept together for 
several seconds.  

JILLIAN 
Try room temperature, idiot.  
The Tokamak's got it all backwards.  

TEMPLAR 
Uhhm. Excuse me. Who is that? 

JILLIAN 
Him? A powerful, well-respected man 
who doesn't know a goddarnn thing 
what he's talking about. If I got 
one tenth of his funding...  

Jillian reaches down and yanks off the cassette player.  
She looks out the window, grumbling. They drive on.  

TEMPLAR 
It's the next left. First driveway on the right.  

EXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - TEMPLAR 'S HOME 
Jillian's station wagon pulls into the circle of the largest mansion in 
Westchester County. Just stupendous.  

INT. JILLIAN'S STATION WAGON 
Jillian stares, open-mouthed, at the mansion.  

JILLIAN 
You live here? 
(turns to him) 
Are you for real? 

He picks up Jillian's lemonade bottle.  

TEMPLAR 
Like the label says. No chemicals, 
no preservatives.  

JILLIAN 
(points at the house) 
You work for this or inherit it? 

TEMPLAR 
My father made shoes. I inherited 
the company. Now I make shoes.  

JILLIAN 
(looks at the house) 
That's a helluva lot of shoes.  

TEMPLAR 
Uhm listen, I'm not very good at 
this and I realize we just met, 
but I'm even-tempered, politically 
moderate, belong to no religious 
cults, have no children I know of, 
am free of communicable diseases, I 
happen to find you attractive...  

JILLIAN 
Wait a minute, hold on.  
Are you asking me out on a date? 

TEMPLAR 
Yes.  

JILLIAN 
How do you know I'm not married? 

TEMPLAR 
I believe the fourth finger on your left hand is...  

JILLIAN 
(quickly) 
Okay so I'm not married.  
I could have a boyfriend.  

TEMPLAR 
I'd be surprised if you didn't have several.  

JILLIAN 
Be surprised. Lemme give you a hand.  

Jillian pops the wagon's back hatch and gets out.  Templar follows. They walk to the wagon's rear.  

JILLIAN 
What about you? There's no wife stashed 
on some island someplace? 

TEMPLAR 
No wife stashed on some island.  

They pick up Templar's groceries; each takes two bags.  

JILLIAN 
No mistress? C'mon. No bimbo on the side? 

TEMPLAR 
Not a one.  

They walk toward the mansion.  

JILLIAN 
Well, that's a start. Here's the 
deal with me: I am not particularly 
even-tempered, I'm staunchly 
liberal, belong to no 
religious cults but I do believe in God as a 
basic force of good, have no 
children because one has to have sex 
to do that and, well, let's not 
pursue that, am free of communicable 
diseases, see above, and you're an 
attractive man, if a little weird, 
and well.. .hell, why not.  
(smiles) 
You've got a date, shoemaker.  
What's your name? 

TEMPLAR 
Michael. Michael Quinn.  

They reach the mansion's front veranda. They set the groceries on a wicker 
couch.  

JILLIAN 
I'm Jillian St. Thomas.  

They shake hands. Jillian fishes for a pen.  

JILLIAN 
I'll give you my number.  

TEMPLAR 
Just say it. I have a good memory.  

JILLIAN 
(looks at him) 
Eight seven seven, five two nine eight.  

TEMPLAR 
Good. Great. I'll call you.  

JILLIAN 
I've heard that before.  

TEMPLAR 
I will call you. You saved me 
today. Thanks again.  

She walks off to her car. Templar turns toward the front door. Jillian suddenly 
stops. Turns.  

JILLIAN 
Hey.  
(Templar turns) 
What's my number? 

TEMPLAR 
(without hesitation) 
Eight seven seven, five 
two nine eight.  

JILLIAN smiles and continues toward the car, mumbling: 

JILLIAN 
And he has a brain.  
What do you know.  

AT THE MANSION'S FRONT DOOR - TEMPLAR watches Jillian get in her wagon 
and drive off. Then Templar keys open the door and enters.  

INT. WESTCHESTER MANSION - DAY 
The place is empty. Totally. No furniture. Nothing.  
Just Templar's two CARRY-ON BAGS on the floor in front of Templar.  

DISSOLVE TO: 

INT. WESTCHESTER MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
It's late now. About 10 p.m.  
Templar sits on a packing crate in the vacant living room with a glass of 
scotch, studying Jillian's life.  

There are pages of personal data and many photographs: Jillian in cap and 
gown; Jillian in a lab coat; Jillian at the beach, etc.  

DISSOLVE TIME CUT TO: 

A LEGAL PAD, with Templar's handwritten note: 
NO HARD COPIES - COMPUTER SOFTWEAR 

TEMPLAR stares into the screen of his mini-computer.  
It is two hours later.  

INSERT - THE MINI-COMPUTER SCREEN - Templar has entered every detail of 
Jillian's life. Looks like this: 
Home state: Massachusetts 
Hometown: Milton 
Highschool: Milton Academy 
Highschool mascot: Bulldogs 
University: Harvard 
University mascot: Crimson 

It just goes on and on: names of parents, family members, teachers, pets, 
boyfriends; favorite movies, colors, sports teams, hobbies, etc.  

DISSOLVE TIME CUT TO: 

TEMPLAR finishes entering the details of Jillian's life.  
He copies it onto a 3 1/4 disk, pulls out the disk and shuts off the minicomputer.  
He leans down and picks up a SHOE BOX. Opens it. He lifts out a WOMAN'S 
SHOE and jerks the heel, which lifts away from the sole on hinges. revealing a 
hidden compartment, in which Templar places a small transistor.  
He clicks the heel shut. THE SHOE -- 

MATCH DISSOLVES TO: 

THE SAME SHOE, now on Jillian's foot and WIDEN TO -- 

INT. MANHATTAN - LE CIRQUE 
-- Jillian and Templar at a corner table in Le Cirque. The meal is over. They're 
drinking coffee, laughing, at ease. The "date" is going well.  

TEMPLAR 
I am not eccentric.  

JILLIAN 
No? You live in the biggest house 
in America but do your own shopping, 
you talk to strange women about the history 
of apples, and you give 
a first-time date.. . shoes? 
Isn't the tradition flowers? 

TEMPLAR 
You said you liked them.  

JILLIAN 
I do. I'm joking. They're 
beautiful. Thank-you.  

They smile at each other. A WAITER brings more coffee. There's a sudden 
commotion. Jillian and Templar look -- 

ACROSS THE ROOM - a group of WAITERS are clapping their hands for a 
YOUNG COUPLE seated at a table.  

JILLIAN 
(to the waiter) 
What happened? 

WAITER 
(smiles) 
He just asked her to marry him.  
Anything else? 

JILLIAN looks at the radiant young couple. Smiles.  

TEMPLAR 
Just the check please.  
(the waiter exits; Jillian looks at him) 
You didn't answer my question.  
Maybe it made you uncomfortable.  
Maybe I should just shut up...  

JILLIAN 
No, it's all right. Okay: "Why 
Jillian never got married, chapter 
One:" I don't know where you're from. . .  

TEMPLAR 
Canada.  

JILLIAN 
I don't know what it's like there, 
but here, if a teenage girl doesn't 
want to be a cheerleader, or drink 
'till she pukes every weekend, or 
talk endlessly on the phone every 
night about absolutely nothing, then she 
doesn't win many popularity 
contests, know what I mean? 
That pretty much took care of highschool.  

TEMPLAR 
College? 

JILLIAN 
Try earning double p.h.d.'s 
from Harvard before you turn twenty-three 
and having a social life.  

TEMPLAR 
Can I ask a personal question? 
(she nods) 
What's your I.Q.? 

JILLIAN 
(laughs) 
That's personal? My I.Q.? 
Let's just say it's high.  

TEMPLAR 
Very high.  

JILLIAN 
Yes, very high. As high as yours.  

TEMPLAR 
You don't honestly mean that.  

JILLIAN 
Oh, you're a smart one, shoemaker.  
It's in the eyes. I can always tell.  

They stare at each other. Neither averts eyes.  

JILLIAN 
I just don't often get 
the opportunity. It feels nice.  

TEMPLAR 
For me, too.  
(and he means this:) 
You're very pretty.  

JILLIAN 
Stop it. Flattery will get you...  
someplace. I don't know where yet.  

She smiles. The waiter arrives with the check; gives it to Templar. Jillian picks 
up her purse and takes her wallet out. Templar sees her doing this...  

TEMPLAR 
No no no, absolutely not.  
Put that away.  

JILLIAN 
It's not for us. It's for the couple over there.  
(points at the couple across the room) 
Waiter, put their bill on my card please.  

WAITER 
Maam? Are you sure? 

Jillian nods. The waiter takes Jillian's card, exits.  
Jillian smiles at Templar. [Due to his mean origins and evolution, Templar has witnessed approximately three charitable acts in his whole life, and this was 
the third.] Thus does Simon Templar smile uneasily back.  

CUT TO: 

INT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - JILLIAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Neat, modest, non-descript. Jillian and Templar enter. Jillian walks across the 
living room into a bar alcove off the living room.  

JILLIAN 
I'll make the booze.  
Turn on the news. I want to catch up on that 
Russia thing.  

Templar turns on the T.V. His eyes rove around, casing the place.  

JILLIAN (o.s.) 
What do you want, Michael? 
I've got everything.  

TEMPLAR 
Scotch please. No ice.  

CNN EVENING NEWS with anchor BERNARD SHAW comes on.  

BERNARD SHAW (on T.V.) 
.. ..of the steadily growing NeoCzarist 
Party, leveled more allegations against 
President Victor Karpov. According to 
Romanov, two men, Gregor Tretiak...  

Templar looks at the T.V. and double takes.  
A PHOTO OF GREGOR TRETIAK has appeared on the screen.  

BERNARD SHAW (o.s.) 
.. . and Ivan Gracha...  

A PHOTO OF IVAN GRACHA, 50's, short, beady-eyed, sinister, appears on the 
screen.  

JILLIAN pokes her head out of the bar.  

JILLIAN 
What brand? 

BERNARD SHAW (o.s.) 
...allegedly the most powerful of 
Russia's underworld bosses, are 
linked to President Karpov in 
illegal enterprises...  

JILLIAN walks over to Templar. They watch together.  

JILLIAN 
That country's going to explode.  

TEMPLAR 
It very well might. Oban.  

JILLIAN 
What? .  

TEMPLAR 
My brand of scotch.  
Oban. Have any? 

JILLIAN 
No, but there's a liquor store 
five minutes away.  

She grabs her coat, heads for the door.  

TEMPLAR 
Wait. Don't be ridiculous.  

She stops. Looks at him.  

JILLIAN 
I want to be ridiculous.  
(pause) 
Michael, I haven't had anybody 
over in...a long time. And I 
happen to like you. I want to do 
this right. Okay? 
(he smiles; nods) 
I'll be back in ten minutes.  
(points at fireplace) 
Build a fire.  

She winks at him and exits.  
Templar walks to the window and stands there, waiting.  
We hear Jillian's car start, see the headlights.  

TEMPLAR 
You're making this too 
easy, dear.  

He pulls from his pocket a BLACK CASE, flips it open, turns it on. On a 
miniature computer screen is a detailed map of WESTCHESTER COUNTY. Two 
locations are pulsing: 1) Jillian's house and 2) a moving object, transmitted 
from a homing device, which we now see  

INT. JILLIAN' S CAR - DRIVING 

-- it's in JILLIAN'S SHOE as she stamps on the brake at a stoplight and waits 
and we CUT BACK to the house...  

INT. JILLIAN' SHOUSE - BACK HALLWAY 
TEMPLAR moves down the hall opening doors, looking for Jillian's lab. He 
moves quickly, ruthlessly.  

He comes to a heavily locked FIRE DOOR. He unpockets a set of burglar's 
tools.  
For Templar, these locks are a joke. He opens them with alarming speed. He 
pushes open the door, revealing a DESCENDING STAIRCASE. He descends.  

INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - BASMENT 
Templar finds a lightswitch and flips it on.  
His eyes widen. Here we find -- 

JILLIAN'S LABORATORY. A POOL OF WATER (the size of a small swimming 
pool) is surrounded by HUNDREDS OF TEST TUBES of various shapes and 
sizes containing chemicals.  
Templar moves through, eyes scanning everything.  
He sees JILLIAN'S COMPUTER. Walks over to it.  

He unpockets the HOMING SYSTEM and sets it on the desk.  
The PULSING LIGHT is still moving; Jillian hasn't yet reached the liquor store.  
He turns on Jillian's monitor and hard drive. The COMPUTER SCREEN blinks 
on. We see a MENU: 
A.) Personal finances 
B.) Income tax 
C.) Things to do 
D.) Addresses 
E.) Research 

Templar positions the cursor on "E.) Research" and hits "enter." The modem 
engages; this appears: 

******* WELCOME TO THE INTERNET ******* 
PLEASE WAIT 
Then this appears: RETRIEVAL CODE: _____________________ 

TEMPLAR 
Smart girl. Send your data into 
cyberspace and only you can retrieve 
it. Because only you have the code.  

He unpockets the 3 1/4 disk containing the data from Jillian's life and pushes 
it into the disk drive. He types a command; a new screen appears: 

DATA ENTRY SYSTEM 
Press any key to begin 

Templar hits a key and the old screen reappears: 
******* WELCOME TO THE INTERNET ******* 
PLEASE WAIT 
RETRIEVAL CODE: ______________________ 

But now, in the space next to "Retrieval Code," Templar's data appears. word 
after word, like this: 
-- "Massachusetts" 
-- Computer: ACCESS DENIED 
-- "Boston" -- 
-- Computer: ACCESS DENIED. 
-- "Milton" -- 
-- Computer: ACCESS DENIED 
-- "Milton Academy" 
-- Computer: ACCESS DENIED 
-- "Bulldogs" 
-- Computer: ACCESS DENIED 

It's incredibly fast, a new word appearing every second, as the system tries to 
crack Jillian's code. But the computer denies access to each word.  
The HOMING DEVICE suddenly BEEPS. The pulsing light has stopped, 
indicating Jillian is at the liquor store.  
Templar grimly turns back to the computer.  

CUT TO: 

INT. WESTCHESTER LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT 
The clerk, WALTER, hands Jillian her change.  
She exits with a SCOTCH BOTTLE in a brown wrapper.  

CLERK 
Goodnight Jillian.  

JILLIAN 
Night, Walter.  

INT. JILLIAN'S LABORATORY - NIGHT 
Templar paces; he looks at the homing device. The PULSING LIGHT is moving 
back toward Jillian's house.  
Templar looks at the computer; his system continues entering words: 
"Hendrix." ACCESS DENIED. "Purple Haze." ACCESS DENIED. "Red Sox." 
ACCESS DENIED. "Celtics." ACCESS DENIED. On and on...each is met with 

ACCESS DENIED.  

INT. JILLIAN'S STATION WAGON - DRIVING - NIGHT 
Jillian, driving, turns on the radio. She hums along.  

INT. JILLIAN'S LABORATORY 
Templar stares at the HOMING DEVICE; the pulse is getting closer; it's do or 
die now...  
Templar's system suddenly stops. It has run through every word. Each has 
met with failure.  
TEMPLAR frowns. He yanks the system disk from the disk drive. He begins 
pacing...  

TEMPLAR 
Okay, think. Think.  

Templar suddenly gets an idea.  
He sits and types: "Tokamak." ACCESS DENIED Templar stares at the screen 
in frustration.  

He looks at the HOMING DEVICE; the pulsing light is getting really close.  
Templar concentrates with every brain cell.  
We can feel him think. He's remembering something.  

MEMORY FLASHBACK 

We're in Jillian's car again, when they first met.  

JILLIAN 
Try room temperature, idiot.  
The Tokamak's got it all backwards.  

BACK TO THE LABORATORY 

Templar grabs a pencil and notepad and spells out: 
TOKAMAK. Under this he spells it backwards: KAMAKOT.  
He turns to the computer and types: "KAMAKOT" And instantly this flashes: 
ACCESS GRANTED.  

TEMPLAR 
Open sesame.  

The retrieval begins: A DOCUMENT appears on the screen: 
THE GENERATION OF ENERGY FROM COLD NUCLEAR FUSION 
Submitted by: DR. JILLIAN ST. THOMAS 

Templar scrolls through the document; we see a dizzying display of graphs, 
tables, plans, specifications, etc.  
Templar pulls out the disk containing Jillian's data and shoves a fresh disk 
into the disk drive. He begins copying Jillian's research from harddrive to disk.  
He looks at the HOMING DEVICE. Christ, she's almost back.. .and indeed -- 

EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE 
-- Jillian's car comes wheeling into the driveway.  

INT. JILLIAN' S LABORATORY - NIGHT 
The document is copied. Templar grabs the copied disk from the disk drive 
and rips the slip of paper from the notepad. He flicks off the computer and 
sprints across the lab, then up the stairs.  

EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE 
Jillian reaches for the doorknob and enters -- 

INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE 
She comes in. TEMPLAR, relaxed, lounges on the couch, flipping through some magazines.  
He smiles: 

TEMPLAR 
That was quick.  

She walks past him to the bar alcove.  

JILLIAN 
Now Mr. Michael Quinn, let's have 
that scotch. Hey, what happened 
to the fire? 

TEMPLAR 
I thought we'd create our own.  

JILLIAN 
(smiles) 
Down boy.  

He gets up; goes to the fireplace; grabs some logs and lays them across the 
andirons and we -- 

DISSOLVE TO: 

THE LOGS, now gently burning. Cole Porter is playing.  
CAMERA PANS past Jillian's shoes on the carpet, past the Oban Scotch on the 
coffee table, now half empty, to -- 

-- the couch, where Jillian and Templar are locked in a heavy kiss. Jillian stops.  

JILLIAN 
Whoah whoah whoah, time to put 
on the brakes. Those lips oughtta be 
licensed buddy...  

TEMPLAR 
Sorry. I wasn't trying to...  

JILLIAN 
I know you weren't but if we keep 
going I'm gonna be the one who gets us 
both in trouble. Whew! 
(fans herself) 
Haven't felt like that for awhile.  
(she brushes a lock of hair from his eyes) 
Am I going to see you again? 

A pause. Perhaps, just perhaps, for the first time in his black life Templar's having a hard time lying...  

JILLIAN 
Michael? 

TEMPLAR 
(smiles at her) 
How about breakfast? 

JILLIAN 
It's a date. I'll walk you 
out, shoemaker.  

EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
In the threshold they kiss again.  

TEMPLAR 
Good-night.  

JILLIAN 
'Bye. Drive safe.  

Templar walks off to his Rolls Royce parked in the driveway. He smiles at her and waves.  
He turns toward his car; his face goes hard and cold.  

DISSOLVE TO: 

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NEVSKY PROSPECT - CONTINUOUS LATE AFTERNOON 
On the Nevsky Prospect, St. Petersburg's equivalent of the Champs-Elysees  

MICHAEL ROMANOV stands on a raised platform outside the gates of a 
PALATIAL MANSION taking up a whole city block. TEN THOUSAND 
SUPPORTERS surround him. Many carry large, slogan-filled banners.  
Four THUGGISH-LOOKING MEN stand guard inside the mansion's compound, 
giving Romanov the eye. One is ZERO (Tretiak's bodyguard on Blackfriars 
Bridge).  

MICHAEL ROMANOV 
Where is Russia's capital? Moscow? The Kremlin? No, Russia's capital is...  
(points at mansion) 
THROUGH THOSE GATES! 
(crowd CHEERS) 
A den of thieves! 

A LIMOUSINE pulls through the crowd, which reluctantly parts. The guards 
within the compound open the gates.  

MICHAEL ROMANOV 
And here - the Prince of Thieves! 

GREGOR TRETIAK sits in the back of the limousine, silently glaring at 
Romanov. The limousine rolls inside the compound, the gates CLANGING 
shut.  

MICHAEL ROMANOV 
Every citizen in St. Petersburg 
knows what that man does, yet the 
police don't arrest him. They 
protect him! How can this be? 
Maybe we should ask our elected 
whores in Moscow! 

The CROWD CHEERS WILDLY and starts hurling rocks, bottles, etc, through 
the gate at -- 

-- TRETIAK, emerging from the limousine. Tretiak's guards surround him; 
they move quickly up the mansion's marble steps, dodging the thrown debris.  

SIRENS WAIL. Four large police vans roar up, the back doors flinging open.  
ST. PETERSBURG POLICE, in riot gear, deploy from the vans.  
The police push into the crowd, wielding riot shields and batons. A melee 
breaks out, Romanov supporters versus the police.  

INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - EVENING 
Tretiak and his men move past A GUARD STATION manned by TWO GUARDS 
watching six SURVEILLANCE MONITORS (showing, at all times, certain areas of. the compound).  

This is a former nobleman's residence; a 20 foot diameter CRYSTAL 
CHANDELIER hangs from the domed roof fifty feet above. A spectacular 
staircase ascends to a mezzanine, with offices (formerly bed chambers) off it.  

Tretiak approaches a man in a lab coat, ZUBOV, wearing a grim, anxious 
expression. Zubov chainsmokes constantly.  

ZUBOV 
There's a problem.  

Tretiak follows Zubov down stairs into -- 

INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - BASEMENT LABORATORY 
-- a large room with TECHNICIANS hunched over computers.  
Tretiak follows Zubov to a large bank of computers.  

ZUBOV 
(indicates computer) 
This is the data your thief sent us.  

Tretiak looks at Zubov's COMPUTER SCREEN.  

INSERT - THE COMPUTER SCREEN. Again we see: 

THE GENERATION OF ENERGY FROM COLD NUCLEAR FUSION 
Submitted by: 
DR. JILLIAN ST. THOMAS 

BACK TO SCENE 

TRETIAK 
(confused) 
Cold fusion? 

ZUBOV 
Yes. Fusion at room temperature.  Regarded as an impossibility by the scientific community. A myth.  
(smiles) 
Then I read this.  

Zubov begins scrolling through the document; again we see the displav of graphs. tables. plans. Specs.. etc.  

ZUBOV 
She first proves why hot fusion - the tokamak - is impractical. You must heat the hydrogen gases so high, more energy is wasted than created. Here she goes into the benefits of cold fusion.  
(scrolls more pages) 
The hydrogen isotopes needed.  
(scrolls more pages) 
The physical plant. She even estimates its cost. Extraordinary.  
(scrolls more pages) 
The next pages are the critical part, what no one in fifty years has discovered.  
(looks up at Tretiak) 
The combination of chemicals in which atoms will fuse at room temperature.  

Tretiak leans toward the screen, waiting.  

TRETIAK 
Well? Let's see.  

ZUBOV 
Tretiak - I think from reading 
this that the woman's done it.  
She may have found a source of 
unlimited energy.  

TRETIAK 
What do you mean 
may have. Show me.  

ZUBOV 
I said there was a problem.  
Zubov hits the "scroll" key. The next page appears; we see the heading at the top of the page: THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR COLD FUSION 

But there's something wrong with the rest of the page.  
Terribly wrong. We know this because of  

TRETIAK'S EXPRESSION, and it's not too happy.  

TRETIAK 
Where's the rest of it? 

ZUBOV 
It's in her head. 

and CUT TO: 

INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING 
JILLIAN, humming the Cole Porter song from the previous evening, fills a basket with breakfast for two: eggs, bagels, etc. Sunlight streams in. Birds chirping.  

She wears jeans and her jacket with the atomic diagram embroidered on the back. She grabs flowers from a vase; tosses them in the basket. Smiles.  

INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM 
She enters with the basket. Looks at the disheveled couch and the bottle of Oban. She hums the Cole Porter song, stabs her feet in THE SHOES TEMPLAR GAVE HER and goes to the front door.  

EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - FRONT 
Jillian comes out, running into -- 

YURI, her lab assistant, who comes up the front stoop. Mid-20's, heavy 
Russian accent, white lab coat.  

YURI 
Good morning, boss.  
Where are you going? 

JILLIAN 
To see a friend.  
Be back in a couple hours.  

She gets in her car.  Yuri gives her a look, goes inside.  

INT. JILL IAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM 
Yuri enters. The foyer phone RINGS. Yuri answers.  

YURI

ILYA (o.s., in Russian) 
There's been a change of plans.  
Yuri stares at the phone and -- 

CUT TO: 

EXT. WESTCHESTER - TEMPLAR' S MANSION - MORNING 
The huge estate, as before. Jillian's station wagon pulls into the circular driveway. Jillian gets out with the breakfast basket. Moves up the flagstoned walk.  
Suddenly the front door opens. A WOMAN, mid-30's, pretty and well-dressed, comes out and locks the door.  

JILLIAN watches her. The woman comes down the walk.  

WOMAN 
May I help you? 
(beat) 
Do you have an appointment? 

JILLIAN 
A what? 

WOMAN 
To see the house.  

JILLIAN 
The man who lives here...  
who owns the house...  

WOMAN 
What man. The estate is rented 
for weddings and corporate events.  
Are you. ..interested...? 

JILLIAN 
No. No.  

The rental agent gives Jillian a funny look and gets in her car. Drives off.  Jillian stares at the house, thunderstruck. Then she sharply inhales: 

JILLIAN 
Oh my god. ...  

Jillian gets in her car.  

CUT TO: 

TEMPLAR'S COMPUTER screen, which reads:

INT. J.F.K. INT. - FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS 
TEMPLAR sits in the British Air lounge. He has shaved and his eyeglasses are 
gone; he looks like himself again. In the b.g., businessmen are relaxing, reading newspapers, drinking coffee. Over the intercom: 

INTERCOM VOICE 
Varig Air flight 157 to Rio 
de Janeiro, departing at 8 a.m, 
boarding now from gate seventeen.  

Templar checks his wristwatch: It's 7:40 a.m.  
Templar types in his password and waits.  
On the screen, this:

ACCOUNT OF: TEMPLAR, SIMON 
BALANCE (AS OF 8/15/95): U.S. $57,895,125.12 (the same balance since

Templar frowns. Something's not right.  
He hasn't been paid.

Jillian runs down the hall, breath escaping her lungs.  

JILLIAN

(calls down the hall) 
Yuri! 

She unpockets her keyring, her hands trembling uncontrollably.  

INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - LABORATORY - MORNING 
Jillian races down the stairs and across the lab to her computer. She moves in a panic, as if in a living nightmare. She turns the computer on. She types in the code word, "kamakot," and her research paper appears on the screen. In the lower right corner it reads: LAST ENTERED: 10:23 p.m.  

JILLIAN 
No.. . ..  

She sees something on the desk.  The NOTEPAD on which Templar wrote his notes.  The page is indented with Templar's pen marks; the words "tokamak" and "kamakot" are clearly visible.  

JILLIAN 
No, this can't be happening. Yuri! 
(turns, calling) 
YURI! 

She jumps, startled, because YURI is right behind her.  
He moves toward her and -- 

CUT TO: 

INT. J.F.K. INT. - FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS 

WOMAN (o.s.) 
Is that a good system? 

A WOMAN, 40's, dowdy and serious in an accountant-like way, has sat down across from Templar. Points at Templar's computer.  

TEMPLAR 
Yes.  

WOMAN ACCOUNTANT (o.s.) 
Going to Europe? 
(Templar ignores her) 
Uhmm, I'm going for coffee.  
Like some? It's really no trouble. ...  

Okay lady, anything to get rid of you: 

TEMPLAR 
Sure. Black please.  

She smiles and walks off to the coffee counter, passing A BUSINESSMAN, who sits down with a steaming cup of coffee and starts reading the WALL STREET JOURNAL.  

Templar eyes the man, then looks back at his computer.  
He begins typing. The phone modem engages.  

Templar types: LION CONTACTING BEAR. IS BEAR HOME? 
-- This comes back: AFFIRMATIVE. 
-- Templar types: LION HAS NOT BEEN PAID. EXPLAIN. 
-- This comes back: LION'S DATA IS DEFECTIVE. 
-- Templar types: DEFINE "DEFECTIVE." 
-- This comes back: LIONS EMPLOYMENT TERMINATED.  

Templar stares at the screen, his mind racing...  
THE ACCOUNTANT WOMAN comes back to the table with Templar's coffee.  
Sets it before him. Smiles.  

TEMPLAR 
Thanks.  

INTERCOM (v.o.) 
British Air flight 74 to London 
now boarding from gate fifteen.  
I repeat, British Air Flight 74...  

The Woman Accountant rises, picks up her bag.  

WOMAN ACCOUNTANT 
Well, that's me. So long.  

She smiles. Templar sort of smiles back. She walks off to catch her flight.  THE BUSINESSMAN next to Templar, hidden behind his newspaper, sets his coffee cup down next to Templar's.  
The Businessman flips a page, engrossed in an article.  
He reaches back for his coffee, but takes Templar's cup.  

He drinks from the cup.  

TEMPLAR 
Excuse me, that's my. . . .  

The Businessman's newspaper is shaking. Violently. It falls to the table.  The Businessman's face is flushed. He twitches. He pitches over. His head THUDS on the table.  

Templar feels the Businessman's carotid artery. He's dead. Templar picks up his coffee and smells it.  Templar's eyes dart to the lounge.  The Lady Accountant is gone.  Nobody in the lounge has noticed what's happened.  Templar hurriedly collects his things.  

CUT TO: 

EXT. WESTCHESTER - JILLIAN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 
AN AIRPORT TAXI stops at the curb. Templar gets out, paying the cabbie. The taxi pulls away.  
Templar approaches the house, eyes darting. He moves toward the door, 
unpocketing his 9mm pistol. He checks the doorknob, turning it. It's open. ...  

INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - DAY 
Templar enters. No one is here. He moves through the living room into the back corridor, glancing into the kitchen, where we see that --

hand.  

INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - BACK CORRIDOR - DAY 
Templar moves through the hall, looking in each door.  
He comes to the lab staircase. The door is open.  
Templar heads down the stairs.  

INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - LABORATORY - DAY 
Templar comes down; he walks to the computer.  
He looks at the document on the screen. He begins scrolling, going to the end 
this time.  
We see the graphs, tables, plans, specs., etc. Then the critical page appears: 

THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR COLD FUSION 
And under that. . . .. A NINTENDO GAME. Little spaceships are flying around chasing other little spaceships!  TEMPLAR stares at it, stunned: what he sent the Russians is essentially worthless. Templar shuts off the monitor. The screen blackens. The black screen reflects light. It reflects A PERSON coming down the stairs. A person with a gun...  

Templar dives away as THREE BULLETS blow the computer monitor to shards.  
THE WOMAN FROM THE J.F.K. LOUNGE, not an accountant but an assassin, 
draws a bead on -- 

TEMPLAR, who scrambles across the room ducking under lab tables as 
BULLETS shatter bottles, beakers, test tubes; glass fills the air.  
TEMPLAR stands up, his 9mm leveled at the woman.  
The woman's gun is leveled at Templar. - 

TEMPLAR 
That's a Reuger nine shot.  
I counted nine.  

FEMALE ASSASSIN 
What if you're wrong.  

The tension boils. Templar was right: her hand flashes to the gun, ejecting the spent clip. She tries to ram in a fresh clip but she's not fast enough...  

TEMPLAR'S across the room in half a second. He presses his gun to her 
forehead.  

TEMPLAR 
When were you hired and for what? 

I'm not in a very good mood...  

Templar cocks the hammer. This gets her attention.  

FEMALE ASSASSIN 
Okay. Take it easy. I was hired a week ago to take you and the woman out, and detonate the house. It was empty when I got here.  

TEMPLAR 
Who's your employer? 

FEMALE ASSASSIN 
I don't ask names.  

TEMPLAR 
Did they have accents? Russian? 
(she nods; he lowers his gun) 
I'm paying you out of your contract.  
Don't ask questions. What's your price? 

FEMALE ASSASSIN 
Fifty thousand for you, fifty 
for her, fifty for the house.  

Templar pulls out his wallet, from which he unfolds three pieces of negotiable paper. Hands them to her.  She examines them.  

TEMPLAR 
U.S. bearer bonds.  Good as cash.  

FEMALE ASSASSIN 
About the airport - no 
offense you understand.  

TEMPLAR 
None taken. Go and 
don't come back.  

And she turns and walks off.  

INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM 
Templar enters, looking around, thinking. He looks in the bathroom. He looks in the closet. On the floor are Jillian's footwear: sneakers, pumps, cowboy boots, etc.  

Right, Templar, the shoes...  

TEMPLAR pulls out his HOMING DEVICE and clicks it on.  

INSERT - HOMING DEVICE SCREEN 

Like before, an electronic rendering of WESTCHESTER COUNTY. But no 
pulsing light. Templar enters commands, adjusting the screen, widening it to GREATER NEW YORK.  Somewhere in Queens, fairly close to the Atlantic Ocean, we see a PULSING LIGHT. But it's fixed, inert.  
The pulsing light begins to move east, quickly.  

Templar watches it. The pulse is moving too quickly for an automobile. And it's heading for the ocean. And it goes in the ocean!

TEMPLAR 
Your ticket. What'd you pay for it? 

BROOKS BROTHERS MAN 
What? 

TEMPLAR 
I'll give you twenty grand for it.

Frankie looks at her wristwatch.  

FRANKIE 
Five hours. What type of job? 

TEMPLAR 
Eyes and ears. Two hundred 
thousand cash for two days work.  

FRANKIE 
Who's the mark? 

TEMPLAR 
Gregor Tretiak. His headquarters.  
His office in particular.  

Frankie lights a cigarette. Thinks.  

FRANKIE 
Gregor Tretiak is not a very 
nice man, Simon. Four 
hundred thousand.  

TEMPLAR 
Deal. Now listen, Frankie...  

DISSOLVE TO: 

INT. THE RUSSIAN GULFSTREAM - DAY 
Four hours later. Jillian sits, head bowed, unconscious. Yuri sits opposite. He is nodding off.  If only Jillian could wake up...  
The PILOT shouts back.  

PILOT 
We're over Helsinki.  
Yuri wakes, sits upright. Yawns.  

INT. REMY'S LEAR JET - DAY 
Remy's peering out the window. Sees something.  

REMY SAMARKAND 
Simon, there! 

Two miles ahead, THE RUSSIAN JET roars past, heading east toward St.  
Petersburg. Remy jerks the stick, banking into a right turn behind the Russian jet. Remy 
looks at his ALTITUDE GAUGE.  

REMY SAMARKAND 
They're descending.  

Remy looks at Templar; Templar nods back.  
Remy pushes the stick; the Lear jet begins descending.  

INT. THE RUSSIAN GULFSTREAM - DAY 
Jillian sits, still unconscious. Or is she?  

JILLIAN' S POV - THROUGH SLITTED EYES 

Through the tiniest slit of eye, so as not to appear conscious, Jillian looks at Yuri, then at TWO PARACHUTES shelved above the emergency exit.  
BACK TO SCENE - YURI stands up and stretches. He goes to the window and 
looks out.  [Wheelchair trivia: wheelchair armrests are removable, enabling a patient to 
transfer himself from the chair to a regular chair, or car seat, etc...] 

JILLIAN'S RIGHT HAND (photographed in extreme close-up under the 
blanket) pulls out the PIN securing the armrest to the wheelchair. She lifts the armrest, separating the aluminum tubing, freeing her right wrist.  

INT. REMY'S LEAR JET - DAY 
Through the windshield is the RUSSIAN GULF STREAM.  
Remy, his headset on, turns to Templar.  

REMY 
The St. Petersburg tower wants us to circle.  

TEMPLAR 
No. Follow them down.  

REMY 
What do we do when we land? 

TEMPLAR 
Haven't figured that out yet.  

INT. THE RUSSIAN GULFSTREAM - DAY 
The aircraft is tilted forward in descent.  
The PILOT shouts back to Yuri: 

PILOT 
(Russian, subtitled) 
Prepare for landing.  

The Pilot shuts the cockpit door.  
Suddenly JILLIAN'S EYES are open; her hands are free and she's throwing off 
the blanket and gripping the wheels.  
She pushes; the wheelchair bursts forward.  
YURI gets to his feet; the wheelchair slams against his shins. Jillian WHIPS 
the detached armrest across Yuri's head. Yuri falls backward, dazed.  
Jillian rolls to the emergency door, one hand yanking open the door, the other 
grabbing a PARACHUTE from the shelf. Wind howls through the cabin.  
Jillian gets the parachute on. Her ankles are still bound to the footrests. To 
hell with it, she'll lose the wheelchair in mid-air. She pushes forward as -- 

-- YURI lunges across the floor, grabbing the wheels. JILLIAN AND THE CHAIR 
teeter on the edge of emergency door exit, half in, half out.  
Yuri clings to the chair wheels. His body jerks forward. He's sliding on his 
stomach. Jillian and the chair are pulling him out. Terror in Yuri's eyes. He 
grabs for the door frame. His fingers slip.  
Jillian, the wheelchair, and Yuri hanging from the wheelchair, plunge from the 
aircraft.  

INT. REMY' S LEAR JET - DAY 

Templar's bagging his computer and homing device.  
REMY suddenly clutches his arm.  

REMY 
Simon.  

Templar looks up.  

TEMPLAR' S /REMY' S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD JILLIAN AND YURI fall from the aircraft.  

INT . THE RUSS IAN GULFSTREAM 
The pilot, looking down at Jillian and Yuri, clicks on his short-wave radio: 

PILOT 
We have a problem.  

EXT. SKIES OVER ST. PETERSBURG - DAY 
JILLIAN freefalls in the wheelchair, her ankles still bound to the chair's 
footrests. YURI is beneath her, clutching the wheels. He tries to pull himself 
up.  

JILLIAN yanks the rip-cord; a plume of silk spills out and Jillian and the chair 
SLINGSHOT UP, decelerating from 120 m.p.h. to 20 m.p.h. in two seconds.  
Yuri can't take the "G" force; his hands rip away from the chair. He 
plummets, SCREAMING, and 3000 feet later he will hit concrete in St.  
Petersburg.  

Jillian pulls out the footrest pins (the footrests separate from the chair in the 
same manner), freeing her ankles. The chair releases, falling away.  

INT. REMY' S JET - CONTINUOUS 
Templar turns to the cockpit storage hatches behind him.  
He yanks open one designated: PARACHUTES.  

REMY SAMARKAND 
Don't! 

TWO HUGE TOUCANS fly out of the hatch.  
They flap around the cockpit.  
Templar looks askance at Remy...  

TEMPLAR 
Remy...  

REMY SAMARKAND 
I get ten grand for them in Paris.  
Maybe a Russian would pay more? 

Templar grabs a PARACHUTE PACK and races to the back of the plane. He 
YANKS OPEN the EMERGENCY EXIT DOOR. Cold air blasts his face.  

TEMPLAR 
Put down in Helsinki 
and wait for my call! 

And Templar jumps and -- 

CUT TO: 

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS 
An autumn day in Peter the Great's city.  
Peaceful. Normal. Pedestrians walk the streets.  
[note: St. Petersburg is called "Venice of the North" because it's built atop 
marshy islands connected by canals. There are over 400 bridges; on the 
canals, boat traffic is often as dense as automobile traffic.] 
A WOMAN, glancing up, notices something.  

WOMAN (Russian) 
Look.  
(points skyward) 
Look! 

Other pedestrians stop. They, too, look up at -- 

A PARACHUTIST (Jillian of course) descending into the heart of the city! 
And down she comes, landing hard in the middle of an intersection. TAXIS 
and AUTOMOBILES swerve aside, nearly killing her. Others SCREECH to a 
stop.  

JILLIAN gets to her feet, wild-eyed and frantic, tangled in cord and parachute 
silk. She looks around at -- 

CROWDS OF PEDESTRIANS staring at her.  

JILLIAN 
Help me. I'm American. Police! 

A ST. PETERSBURG POLICE CRUISER comes through the intersection to a 
stop. A YOUNG COP, just 20, hangs up his c.b. radio and gets out. He 
approaches Jillian.  

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - PETER AND PAUL FORTRESS CITY PARK 

Across the Neva River from Jillian is a city park with a HUGE EQUESTRIAN STATUE OF PETER THE GREAT.  Under the statue, two OLD RUSSIAN GEEZERS are playing chess, smoking 
pipes, arguing, etc.  

Down TEMPLAR comes. The parachute snags on the BRONZE HORSE'S HEAD.  
Templar dangles 15 feet off the ground. He looks at the GEEZERS directly below. Hello there.  

TEMPLAR 
Sorry about this.  

He shrugs off the parachute pack and falls, landing on the chess board, 
scuttling the pieces. The Geezers fall backward on their behinds.  
Templar gets to his feet, gaining his bearings, looking for Jillian. He takes off running.  

INT. POLICE SEDAN, DRIVING - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Jillian sits in the back seat, catching her breath. The Young Cop looks at her in the rear-view mirror.  

JILLIAN 
Do you speak English? 

YOUNG RUSSIAN COP 
Yes. Some.  

JILLIAN 
Thank God.  
(takes a deep breath, composes herself) 
I'm an American scientist. Last night, in New York, a man stole something from me, then this morning I was kidnapped by my lab assistant, god this sounds like a bad novel . . . . .  

Suddenly a ROCK bounces off the windshield.  

JILLIAN 
What was that? 

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREETS - DAY 
The police cruiser moves past A THRONG OF MICHAEL ROMANOV 
SUPPORTERS carrying placards and banners. They begin pelting the cruiser with rocks and bottles.  

INT. POLICE CRUISER - DAY 
The cruiser clears the Romanov supporters.  
Rocks and bottles smash on the back windshield.  

YOUNG RUSSIAN COP 
There could be revolution maybe.  
City very dangerous.  

IN THE INTERSECTION AHEAD - TWO OTHER POLICE CRUISERS pull into the 
street, blocking it.  The Young Russian Cop brakes; the cruiser comes to a stop in front of the other cruisers.  

An OLDER RUSSIAN COP, followed by a PLAINCLOTHESMAN, approach the 
young cop's cruiser.  

EXT. TROITSKY BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
TEMPLAR sprints across the Neva River Bridge connecting the Peter and Paul Park with downtown St. Petersburg.  
He suddenly stops short, seeing -- 

TEMPLAR' S POV - TWO BLOCKS AWAY 

-- JILLIAN in the cruiser, the Older Cop and the plainclothesman approaching.  

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - INTERSECTION - DAY 
The Older Cop leans in the window.  

OLDER COP 
(Russian) 
Is this her? 

YOUNG COP 
(Russian) 
Yes sir Sergeant Ravik.  

The plainclothesman emerges from behind the Older Cop.  
In one shocking, effortless motion, he places a silenced handgun to the Young 
Cop's head and squeezes the trigger. Blood spatters the windshield.  
JILLIAN gasps in horror at the plainclothesman. It is...ILYA.  
The Older Cop opens the door, shoving the Young Cop's corpse to the 
passenger side. Ilya gets in back next to Jillian, pressing the HANDGUN into her ribs. The cruiser ROARS off into St. Petersburg traffic.  

EXT. AT THE FOOT OF TROITSKY BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS 
TEMPLAR looks around. He sees A MOTORCYCLE STAND filled with MOTORCYCLES. Runs to it. Chooses a big, powerful, Honda street machine.  
He pulls out his burglar's tools; jams one in the ignition. He has it running in seconds. He throws it in gear and ROARS off.  

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREETS - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Templar blasts through traffic on the Honda. He's on a street parallel to Jillian's.  

AT AN INTERSECTION Templar looks to his right, where he can see, one block over on the parallel street -- 

THE POLICE CRUISER moving through traffic.  Templar guns the motorcycle. The engine WHINES. He races ahead, 
accelerating through the gears.  AT THE NEXT INTERSECTION - TEMPLAR throws the cycle into a skidding, hair-raising turn.  He's going 'round the block to cut off the sedan.  

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG INTERSECTION - DAY 
The police cruiser moves through the intersection.  Suddenly TEMPLAR'S MOTORCYCLE, Templar-less, veers into the path of the cruiser. The cruiser hits it head on. The motorcycle rides up the cruiser's hood and smashes through the front windshield. The cruiser careens out of control. It fishtails twice and crashes into A STREETLIGHT POLE.  

INT. THE POLICE CRUISER - DAY 
UP FRONT, the Older Cop is unconscious; he's taken the full brunt of the motorcycle through the windshield.  

IN THE BACK, Ilya is groggy, semi-conscious. JILLIAN is reeling also; there's a gash on her forehead.  The BACK PASSENGER DOOR jerks open. TEMPLAR lunges inside.  Ilya raises his gun but he's weak, disoriented. Templar yanks it from his hand and pistol whips him.  This has all happened so fast.  Jillian looks at Ilya then at Templar...  

JILLIAN 
What...? WHO...? 

And Templar yanks Jillian out.  

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The intersection is chaos: PEDESTRIANS running up, surrounding the police cruiser, vehicles stopping, etc.  
Templar, virtually dragging Jillian, plows through the crowd, passing a 
Russian Army Corporal who's just gotten out of his ARMY SUPPLY TRUCK.  

RUSSIAN ARMY CORPORAL 
(Russian) 
Let me help! 

TEMPLAR 
(Russian) 
(pointing back at the police sedan) 
Help them! 

The Corporal runs to the smashed cruiser, and -- 

TEMPLAR and JILLIAN run to the Corporal's SUPPLY TRUCK.  

INT. RUSSIAN ARMY SUPPLY TRUCK - DAY 
The driver's side door opens. In comes Jillian, then Templar. Templar shoves Jillian across the front seat and gets in, behind the wheel. He floors it.  
They accelerate into traffic. Templar looks at Jillian. She's trembling, staring 
catatonically straight ahead.  

JILLIAN 
Who are you. Tell me who you 
are and what the hell is going on.  

TEMPLAR 
I was hired to steal your research, 
but you know that by now. You left the critical 
data off the disk.  
Where is it? memorized, right? 
(she doesn't answer) 
That's a bad cut. Here.  

He hands her his HANDKERCHIEF. She swats it away.  

TEMPLAR 
Look, you're in big trouble.  
The guy who hired me will do anything 
to get your research. Once he has it, you're a 
corpse. Give me the missing data and I'll get 
you out of here. You can trust me.  

She stares at him in disbelief.  

JILLIAN 
Trust you? 
(chews the word) 
Trust you...? 

She grabs the door handle and yanks it open. Templar grabs her arm, pulling her back. They wrestle back and forth...  

TEMPLAR 
Damn it, don't be stupid...! 

She picks up the CORPORAL'S STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE, sitting in a holder 
on the console between them, and throws it in Templar's face.  

TEMPLAR 
ARGGH! 

Templar recoils, blinded, releasing Jillian. He jerks the steering wheel to the side and stomps on the brakes.   JILLIAN lunges out before the supply truck fully stops. She hits the pavement running. She hurries off, blending into the crowded sidewalk.  

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS 
Templar gets out, cursing, wiping the hot liquid from his eyes. He looks around. Runs off in Jillian's direction, abandoning the supply truck.  

CUT TO: 

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - LOMONOSOVA AVENUE 
Templar, running, out of breath, rounds a corner onto Lomonosova Avenue, in the city's shopping district. It's jammed with PEDESTRIANS, SHOPPERS, MERCHANTS, etc. Templar moves through the crowd, eyes scanning left and right. There's no sign of Jillian.  
Then he sees her.  
Just a glimpse. 50 yards ahead. Moving through the crowded sidewalk toward the FONTANKA (the largest and most beautiful of the city's grand canals).  

EXT. LOMONOSOVA AVENUE - FONTANKA CANAL BRIDGE - SUNSET 
Templar runs over the Fontanka Canal Bridge. Nothing. He comes back the 
other way. Nothing.  
He stops in the middle of the bridge, exhausted, out of breath. Below him, 
passing under the bridge, all types of WATER CONVEYANCES (skiffs, barges, 
dinghies, etc) are navigating the canal.  

And emerging from underneath the bridge, seated in the back of a WATER 
TAXI,...is Jillian.  Templar races off the bridge.  

EXT. FONTANKA CANAL - EMBANKMENT PROMENADE - SUNSET 
Templar sprints down the sidewalk promenade next to the canal. The water 
taxi is 50 yards past the bridge.  
JILLIAN sees him coming.  
TEMPLAR closes the gap. 30 yards. 20 yards. Now 10. Now he's running 
alongside the taxi, staring at Jillian.  
And she stares back at him, stony, expressionless.  
The canal is wider now, and the water taxi accelerates, pulling away from the 
slower skiffs.  
Templar slows to a jog. He stops, lungs heaving. The sun is setting to the 
west.  
The water taxi speeds off into the setting sun, leaving Templar with this 
image of Jillian: eyes unblinking, staring at him with pure, unadulterated 
hatred.  

CUT TO: 

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NEVSKY PROSPECT - NIGHT 
Night is falling. Down the street from Tretiak's headquarters, A FEDERAL 
EXPRESS VAN rolls up to a traffic light.  

INT. FEDERAL EXPRESS VAN - NIGHT 
FRANKIE has arrived in St. Petersburg. She sits at the wheel in a Federal 
Express uniform. She pulls out a charge of C-4 plastique with a timer. She 
opens the van door; tosses it into a sidewalk TRASH RECEPTACLE.  
She accelerates through the light, now green, and takes a left into TRETIAK' S 
HEADQUARTERS, parking behind a LIMOUSINE which has just entered.  
The limousine's doors open. Several dark-suited men get out. One of them is 
IVAN GRACHA (the Russian mafia figure shown on the C.N.N. broadcast).  

INT. TRETIAK'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
A MAP OF ST. PETERSBURG AND OUTLYING REGIONS is spread out on 
Tretiak's desk. Tretiak, Ilya, Zubov, and ten men are present.  

ILYA 
There could be another solution.  
The woman is not-the only scientist 
working in this field. Is she? 

Tretiak turns to Zubov, who nods.  

ZUBOV 
No. There are others.  

TRETIAK 
Get on a plane. Leave tonight.  

The door opens. Zero, the huge bodyguard, enters.  

ZERO 
Gracha is here.  

Tretiak goes immediately to his desk, pressing the "RECORD" BUTTON on a 
v.c.r. within. The surveillance camera in Tretiak's office begins taping the 
meeting.  

IVAN GRACHA and six bodyguards enter.  

GRACHA 
This had better be important.  
It's my wife's birthday.  

TRETIAK 
My apologies to your wife.  

GRACHA 
An apology from Tretiak? 
An historic moment.  

TRETIAK 
(placating) 
Come now, Ivan, why must we feud.  

GRACHA 
We feud because we hate each other.  

TRETIAK 
It is true there have been harsh 
words between us. We are rivals. But rivalry 
is bad for business. Upon what conditions would 
you accept a partnership? Be reasonable.  

GRACHA 
Fifty percent of the drug trade 
in St. Petersburg and Moscow. A third of 
prostitution and gambling.  

TRETIAK 
Agreed.  
(they shake hands) 
I need the men in your areas, Ivan, 
for two days. Particularly Moscow 
and points South.  

GRACHA 
Why? 

Tretiak hands TWO PHOTOGRAPHS to Gracha. One is of JILLIAN, taken 
somewhere in Westchester, wearing her "atomic" jacket. The second is an 
Interpol photo taken of TEMPLAR in a cafe in Amsterdam.  

TRETIAK 
To find this woman...  
and kill this man.  

GRACHA 
(smiles) 
This is a private matter, I take it.  
(Tretiak smiles) 
Then you'll have them.  

TRETIAK 
Ilya - some wine for Ivan Gracha.  

INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - NI GHT 
TWO GUARDS man the guard station, eyeing the bank of six video monitors.  
Frankie enters with a big DELIVERY BOX.  

FRANKIE (Russian) 
Delivery.  

Frankie hands Guard 1 the box and hands Guard 2 a clipboard for his 
signature. Frankie looks at the surveillance monitors and raises an eyebrow.  

ON TRETIAK'S OFFICE MONITOR - we see Tretiak with Ivan Gracha raising a 
toast. In the screen's lower corner are the letters "REC." The meeting is being 
taped.  

EXT. NEVSKY PROSPECT - NIGHT.  
THE C-4 in the trash receptacle blows. It blows up TWO CARS and A TREE. A 
monstrously concussive explosion.  

INT. TRETIAK' S OFFI CE 
Gracha drops his wine glass; it shatters on the floor. Gracha and his men 
unholster their weapons. Tretiak's men go for theirs. A tense stand-off.  

GRACHA 
What is this, Tretiak? 

TRETIAK 
Put your guns down.  

Tretiak goes to his desk; stabs an intercom button -- 

INT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 
The guards, save one, barge out the front door. The remaining guard answers 
the intercom, leaving FRANKIE unattended by the surveillance monitors.  
Her hand moves to THE CO-AXIAL CABLE behind the video monitors, yanking 
it. She plugs a TRANSMITTOR into the monitor, then replugs the co-axial 
cable into the transmitter. The guard turns to Frankie.  

FRANKIE 
What was that? 

DISSOLVE TO: 

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREET - NIGHT 
TEMPLAR stands in a shop doorway. He pulls out his homing device. Adjusts 
the screen.  

INSERT - THE HOMING DEVICE 

The computerized screen now shows the ST. PETERSBURG CITY GRID. Two 
pulses: 1) a fixed pulse (Templar) and 2) a moving pulse (Jillian) on the other 
side of town.  
Templar turns his collar up; walks off into the night.  

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS - NIGHT 
TEMPLAR comes down a street in a scummy part of town. A GUY in a doorway 
swigs a vodka bottle, looking dangerously at Templar. A few PROSTITUTES 
pass.  
Templar pulls out the homing device.  

INSERT - THE HOMING DEVICE - The MOVING PULSE is one block from 
Templar, emanating from inside a huge building, the NEVSKY RAIL STATION.  

BACK TO SCENE - Templar pockets the homing device and walks across the 
street to the train station.  

INT. NEVSKY STATION - MAIN CONCOURSE - NIGHT 
An enormous facility, 100 yards long with a vaulted ceiling and entrances at 
the north and south ends.  

Templar-enters from the north, looking around. He walks quickly to the center 
of the station concourse.  

STATION LOUDSPEAKER (v.o.) 
Next train to Moscow boarding on platform 8.  

Templar approaches Platform 8. Passengers are boarding the next train to 
Moscow. Against the wall, a gang of ten PROSTITUTES are smoking, drinking 
vodka, laughing.  
Templar freezes.  
JILLIAN is with the prostitutes. Her back's to Templar, but it's her. Same 
"atomic" jacket, the shoes Templar gave her, same height, same weight. ...  

Templar isn't the only one who's spotted her...  
TWO MEN IN BLACK TRENCHCOATS, obviously Tretiak's men, are converging 
upon Jillian from the other direction. They haven't yet seen Templar...  

Templar moves off quickly, drawing his gun. As Tretiak's men move in for the 
kill.  
TEMPLAR falls in behind them, WHIPPING the barrel of his gun over one, then 
the other. They fall, unconscious. The PROSTITUTES, alarmed, whirl around 
and...  

...It's not Jillian.  
Templar, thunderstruck, looks at THE PROSTITUTE'S feet. She's wearing 
JILLIAN'S SHOES and JACKET. On her wrist is JILLIAN'S WRISTWATCH.  
Templar turns. The TRAIN TO MOSCOW is pulling out of the station. ...  

Templar sprints away, back toward the station concourse. It's all clear now; 
Jillian sold her clothes and watch and bought a ticket to Moscow.  

EXT. NEVSKY STATION - NIGHT 
AUTOMOBILES are parked in front of the station. Templar picks a B.M.W. out 
come the burglar's tools. Templar's through the door lock in two seconds. He 
gets in and shoves a tool in the ignition lock.  

CUT TO: 

INT. TEMPLAR'S STOLEN B.M.W. - NIGHT 
Templar speeds down the highway, moving in and out of traffic. His cellular 
phone chirps. He unpockets it, clicks it on.  

FRANKIE 
Simon. Good news.  

INT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
In the b.g. through a window, we see Tretiak's headquarters looming down 
the street.  
Frankie sits in front of six VIDEO MONITORS like those in Tretiak's 
headquarters; they are receiving the video transmissions from Tretiak's 
surveillance cameras. We see exteriors, Zubov's lab, corridors, etc.  
Frankie is looking at A MONITOR OF TRETIAK'S OFFICE; Tretiak is pacing, 
talking on the phone.  

FRANKIE 
They haven't found her and 
they don't know where she is.  

INTERCUT - FRANKIE IN HOTEL/TEMPLAR DRIVING 

TEMPLAR 
She's on a train to Moscow.  

FRANKIE 
That's bad news. They're 'stopping 
every train leaving the city.  

TEMPLAR 
Call you later, Frankie.  

Templar tosses the phone and jerks the wheel. The B.M.W. veers wildly 
across three lanes of traffic, swerving off the highway down an exit ramp.  

CUT TO: 

EXT. ROAD SOUTH OF ST. PETERSBURG - NIGHT 
The St. Petersburg city outskirts. Templar's B.M.W. rounds a corner onto a 
two-lane road running next to the Moscow line train tracks.  

INT. TEMPLAR'S B.M.W - NIGHT 
Templar stares ahead through the windshield.  

TEMPLAR'S POV - THE TRAIN TRACKS - A half mile ahead is a street crossing.  
We see the blinking caboose lights of the TRAIN TO MOSCOW. It's stopped at 
an intersection in front of TWO BLACK SEDANS parked across the tracks.  

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - NIGHT 
JILLIAN sits alone, looking around nervously, wondering why the hell the 
train's stopped. Her hair is brushed over the gash on her forehead. She wears 
the prostitute's ratty jacket and shoes.  

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CARS 
Two of Tretiak's men enter the first passenger car, heads swiveling back and 
forth, checking every passenger's face.  

EXT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - REAR CAR - NIGHT 
Templar runs up to the rear passenger car.  

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CARS - NIGHT 
Tretiak's men come through the third car.  

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - REAR CARS - NIGHT 
Templar comes the other way looking for Jillian. Through one car and into the 
next.  
He sees JILLIAN. This time it is her.  

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CARS - NIGHT 
On come Tretiak's men, into another car. They're one car away now...  

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - JILLIAN'S CAR 
JILLIAN sits up in her seat; she looks through the connecting door into the 
next car, which TRETIAK'S MEN are entering. She rises to flee, running into -- 

-- TEMPLAR. Jillian's eyes bulge. She's going to scream. Templar clamps her 
mouth and shoves her forward to the exit door which opens to the parallel 
tracks.  
Templar wrenches open the door and sticks his head outside, looking down 
the tracks. We hear a TRAIN WHISTLE and RUMBLING WHEELS.  
Templar comes back inside. TRETIAK'S MEN are half-way through the next 
car and approaching fast.  

TEMPLAR 
We're going to jump. Okay? 

Jillian, terrified, wide-eyed, nods. And they jump.  

EXT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - PARALLEL TRACKS 
Templar and Jillian lunge from the train onto the parallel tracks. A train 
whistle BLARES. Jillian looks up; her face contorts with shock at -- 
A TRAIN bearing down on them at 60 m.p.h. 100 feet.  
Now 70. 50. Jesus, it's right on top of them...  

TEMPLAR grabs her hand and yanks her across the tracks with 10 feet to go.  
The TRAIN SCREAMS past them.  

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - DAY 
TRETIAK'S MEN enter the car where Jillian was. Outside, the St. Petersburg 
train flashes by, blocking any view of Templar and Jillian on the other side of 
the tracks.  
They continue down the aisle, into the next car.  

EXT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - PARALLEL TRACKS 
The train to St. Petersburg is gone. Jillian stares at Templar with hateful eyes.  
He gets up and yanks her to her feet. Pulls her back toward the train to 
Moscow.  

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - REAR CAR - NIGHT 
A GERMAN BUSINESSMAN is having a heated conversation on a cellular 
phone. Outside, we see TRETIAK'S MEN walking toward their vehicles.  
Templar and Jillian enter the private berth across from the businessman. It 
has reclining chairs and a curtain for privacy. The train BEGINS MOVING 
again.  
Templar and Jillian sit, regarding each other.  

TEMPLAR 
You can't get rid of me.  

JILLIAN 
Like a bad flu.  

TEMPLAR 
Pretty smart, selling the clothes and 
watch. You were going for the U.S.  
embassy, weren't you? 

JILLIAN 
Present tense please  
I am going.  
Before we discuss the present, 
let's discuss the past.  

She stares hard, malevolently at him.  

JILLIAN 
Who the hell are you. I want 
full name, address, profession, 
and don't - don't - say Michael Quinn 
of 112 Mason Street, shoemaker.  

TEMPLAR 
My name is Simon Templar.  
I don't have an address because I 
live in hotels. I'm a professional thief.  

JILLIAN 
Good. We're getting somewhere.  
I'd like to respond to that.  

The German Businessman is looking at them.  
Jillian pulls the curtain shut.  
Then she SLAPS Templar, hard, across the face.  

JILLIAN 
You wicked man.  
(slaps him again.  
You liar.  
(slaps him again) 
Thief.  

She draws back to slap him again.  
He catches her arm.  
They freeze this way, faces inches apart.  
She's trembling, her face a mask of hatred.  

JILLIAN 
I hope you rot in hell.  

He lets go of her. She stands up.  

TEMPLAR 
Where are you going? 

JILLIAN 
As far away from 
you as I can.  

Templar pulls out his 9mm pistol.  

TEMPLAR 
Sit down.  

Jillian stares at the gun.  

JILLIAN 
You're joking.  

TEMPLAR 
Michael Quinn jokes. I don't.  

She glares at him. Slowly sits. Templar pulls out his cellular phone.  Punches numbers.  

TEMPLAR 
Remy. Be at Moscow Airport 
at eight a.m., fueled and ready to go.  

Templar clicks off the phone and pockets it. Then he pockets the gun, its 
barrel pointing at Jillian through his jacket. With his free hand he grabs her 
arm and puts it under his arm, clamping it to his body.  

TEMPLAR 
We're going to sit here and not 
make a scene. I'd get some rest.  
Templar leans back, shutting his eyes.  

TEMPLAR 
I sleep light.  

Jillian, out of the corner of her eye, notices something through the curtain...  
ACROSS THE AISLE - THE GERMAN BUSINESSMAN is folding up his cellular 
phone and stuffing it in his satchel briefcase on the floor. He leans back and 
closes his eyes. The satchel briefcase sticks into the aisle.  
Close enough for Jillian to touch...  

DISSOLVE TO: 

EXT. BENARES, INDIA - ESTABLISHING - MORNING 
The exquisite, astonishing city on the Ganges River.  

EXT. BENARES - UNIVERSITY OF BENARES 
A courtyard in the traditional Indian style. Zubov and two of Tretiak's men 
approach a building.  
Zubov rings the doorbell. Seconds pass. The door opens. An Indian gentleman 
peers out.  
He's about 50, in a madras shirt and nehru jacket. This is DR. VIJAY SINGH, 
whose taped lecture we heard in Jillian's station wagon.  

ZUBOV
Dr. Singh? Dr. Vijay Singh? 

VIJAY SINGH 
Who are you and what do you want? 

ZUBOV 
My name is Vapin Zubov. I would 
like to discuss something with...  

VIJAY SINGH 
(scowls) 
Come back at a decent hour...  

Dr. Singh begins to shut the door. Zubov puts his hand in the door, jamming 
it.  

ZUBOV 
I would like to discuss cold fusion, Doctor.  
Dr. Singh's demeanor changes. Pushes open the door.  

VIJAY SINGH 
Come in.  

CUT TO: 

INT. THE TRAIN TO MOSCOW - MORNING 
PASSENGERS are yawning, pulling up their window blinds. Sunlight streams in. A PORTER passes by. .  

PORTER 
Thirty minutes to Moscow, 
thirty minutes...  

The Porter moves past the German Businessman; he's asleep and snoring.  
Across the aisle -- 

JILLIAN'S EYES are darting from the German Businessman, to TEMPLAR, 
who's looking out the window.  

JILLIAN 
I need to use the ladies' room.  
I think you can trust me to...  

TEMPLAR 
I don't trust anybody.  

Jillian gives Templar a disgusted look. She rises and moves into the aisle.  
Ternplar follows.  

JILLIAN 
Tell me something.  
How much were you paid? 

TEMPLAR 
It's not your business. Move.  

JILLIAN 
I think it is.  
C'mon. Tell me.  

TEMPLAR 
Fifteen million dollars, 
but it didn't work out. Did it.  

They pass a PORTER serving snacks (fruits and cheeses) from a cart. Jillian looks' at the cart.  

JILLIAN 
Does it bother you? What you do? 

TEMPLAR 
No.  

JILLIAN 
You have no conscience? 
No sense of morality? 

TEMPLAR 
Define morality.  

JILLIAN 
It's a commonly used and 
generally understood word.  

TEMPLAR 
Not by me. .  

They've arrived outside the LADIES ROOM. Jillian opens the door, begins to 
enter.  

TEMPLAR 
Wait.  

JILLIAN 
You are not going in there with me.  

Templar brushes past her, leaving the door open.  
He steps up on the toilet, examining the WINDOW above.  

JILLIAN 
Okay, how about: Do unto others 
as they would do unto you.  

TEMPLAR 
How about: Do unto others 
before they do unto you.  

Templar pulls up the window. It opens only five inches; it's prevented from 
rising further by TWO SAFETY SCREWS drilled through the frame.  

JILLIAN 
How about: love thy neighbor.  

TEMPLAR 
The man who said that was 
crucified by his.  

Satisfied, Templar steps down and walks back to Jillian. She shakes her head, 
laughs mirthlessly.  

JILLIAN 
Were you raised by wolves? 
Who were your parents, Lucretia 
Borgia and the Marquis de Sader 

TEMPLAR 
The two people in question weren't 
as nice as that. I wouldn't know.  
I never met them. Are you through? 
It's all yours.  

She gives him a look and shoves past him into -- 

THE LADIES ROOM Jillian enters, closes the door and locks it. She stands on the toilet and examines the window. Sees the safety screws. She steps down.  
She turns on the sink, then kneels and pulls up her pantleg, revealing THE 
GERMAN BUSINESSMAN'S CELLULAR PHONE stuffed in her sock. She pulls it 
out.  
She turns the sink on full blast, creating as much noise as she can, and 
punches numbers.  

JILLIAN 
International operator please.  
(pause) 
The American Embassy in Moscow, please.  

Jillian waits for the call to connect and CUT TO: 

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CAR - AISLES 
Jillian exits the ladies' room.  

JILLIAN 
You really will rot in hell, 
know that? 

TEMPLAR 
Good, all my friends will be waiting for me.  
They move down the aisle, passing the SERVING PORTER, Jillian's hand 
dangles over the fruit and cheese cart.  
She plucks up a SERVING KNIFE with two fingers and slides it up her sleeve.  

JILLIAN 
Friends? I thought you trusted 
no one.  

TEMPLAR 
I don't. Give it to me.  

JILLIAN 
(innocently) 
What.  

TEMPLAR 
The knife you just took.  

Jillian sighs. Pulls the serving knife out of her sleeve and hands it over. When 
she turns back toward her berth, she doesn't like what she sees -- 

THE GERMAN BUSINESSMAN has woken up. He's yawning, opening up a 
stack of business correspondence sitting on the armrest of his chair with a 
LETTER OPENER.  
JILLIAN continues down the aisle, sweating it out. If the guy discovers that 
his phone is missing...  

Each step is a mile.  
Finally Jillian and Templar come to their berth. The German Businessman is 
reading a letter. The letter opener is sitting on the stack of unopened letters.  
Jillian "accidentally" knocks the stack of letters and letter opener off the 
armrest. They fall to the floor next to the German Businessman's satchel 
briefcase.  
Jillian quickly drops to a kneeling position and begins gathering up all the 
letters.  

JILLIAN 
I'm so sorry! 

As Jillian rises and hands the German Businessman his letters, we see that  

THE CELLULAR PHONE is back in the German Businessman's satchel 
briefcase.  
Templar and Jillian sit down.  

CUT TO: 

EXT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION, TRAIN PLATFORM - MORNING 
The train pulls into the station.  

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - MORNING 
The Porter comes down the aisle, calling out: 

PORTER 
Moscow Station, Moscow Station! 

Templar and Jillian move with the other passengers toward the exits. As they 
pass the ladies' room: 

JILLIAN 
Give me a second, will you? 
I don't feel well.  

TEMPLAR 
Make it quick.  

Jillian goes in the bathroom.  

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - LADIES' ROOM 
Jillian enters and stands on the toilet. Out comes the German Businessman's 
LETTER OPENER. She centers the opener in one of the screw heads, leans into 
it, and twists. She begins unscrewing it.  

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - AISLE OUTSIDE LADIES' ROOM 
Templar is impatiently looking at the ladies' room door.  
The passengers are filing past him.  
He knocks on the door.  

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - LADIES' ROOM 
Jillian's got one screw out. The other is coming. Templar KNOCKS again.  

JILLIAN 
Just a second.  

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - AISLE OUTSIDE LADIES' ROOM 
Templar knocks again, LOUDER. No response inside.  
The German Businessman passes by him...  

GERMAN BUSINESSMAN 
Porter, I seem to have lost my letter opener...  

Templar stares at the guy.  

INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - LADIES ROOM 
The door SMASHES open, splintering the lock. Templar bursts in. Something 
instantly gets his attention.  
The fully opened window. And no Jillian... Templar bolts out.  

CUT TO: 

INT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION, MAIN CONCOURSE - MORNING 
Jillian hurries up the escalator to the main concourse. A stupendous, vaulted 
interior. As impressive as Grand Central in New York or Victoria in London.  
She moves through the crowd. Eyes scanning everything and nothing. She 
bumps into A COMMUTER, who scowls.  
Jillian takes cover by one of the immense marble pillars. She pulls her collar 
up. Waits it out.  

ACROSS THE CONCOURSE - A MAN studies her. He's tall, blonde, looks like he 
played linebacker for Ohio State.  
He approaches. She eyes him. Everyone is a potential enemy. But this guy is 
obviously American.  

BLONDE MAN 
Ms. St. Thomas? Jillian? 

JILLIAN 
Yes.  

The Blonde Man opens his wallet, flipping out his EMBASSY BADGE and C. I. A. CREDENTIALS.  

WHITEHEAD 
John Whitehead, Special Agent, 
Central Intelligence Agency.  
Was your trip all right? 

JILLIAN 
Yes it was fine, oh who cares, 
I'm finally safe...  
(squeezes his hand) 
Do you have a car? 

WHITEHEAD 
Yes, outside. First I'd like to ask 
you some questions. That was an interesting 
story you told the embassy.  

JILLIAN 
Interesting? It's true.  

WHITEHEAD 
Please understand: the United States 
Embassy receives fifty calls a day.  
My husband's been murdered, 
my daughter's been sold into white slavery, 
you get the idea. So before we waste a lot of people's 
time, Ms. St. Thomas, you say you have p.h.d.s 
in chemistry and nuclear physics.  
What's the atomic symbol for, say. ..gold? 

Pause. Jillian stares at Whitehead.  

JILLIAN 
You've gotta be kidding me...  

CUT TO: 

INT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - TRAIN PLATFORM - MORNING 
Templar dashes across the platform, looking everywhere. Jillian has vanished.  
Suddenly his cellular phone chirps. He unpockets it and clicks it on.  

TEMPLAR 
Talk to me, Frankie.  

INT. ST. PETERSBURG - FRANKIE'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING 
FRANKIE, red-eyed and drinking coffee, is staring at the video transmission 
from Tretiak's office. Tretiak and Ilya are talking. .  

INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO (as deemed necessary) 

FRANKIE 
She called the U.S. Embassy a 
half hour ago.  

TEMPLAR 
What? 
(considers this) 
Does Tretiak know? 

FRANKIE 
Simon, the U.S. Embassy has more leaks 
than a Polish submarine. Who do you 
think intercepted the call? 

As FRANKIE says that, she doubletakes at the monitor showing Tretiak's 
office. Frankie's eyes widen.  

ON THE VIDEO MONITOR - A THIRD MAN has entered the room.  
It is the crusading reformer, MICHAEL ROMANOV.  
Frankie stabs a button on a tape recorder next to her monitors. It begins 
taping the transmission from Tretiak's office.  

TEMPLAR 
Thanks, Frankie.  

FRANKIE 
Simon, wait. . . .  
CLICK.  

Frankie turns some dials, bringing into ZOOM FOCUS Tretiak and Romanov.  
She ups the volume. We hear this: 

TRETIAK 
Hail Michael Romanov, Czar of the 
Fatherland. How will that sound 
to the average Russian? 

FRANKIE 
(a whisper) 
I don't believe it...  

CUT TO: 

INT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - ESCALATOR - DAY 
TEMPLAR runs up the escalator, plowing through the disembarking 
passengers, taking two stairs at a time.  

INT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION, MAIN CONCOURSE - MORNING 
Templar comes off the escalator. The place is packed with COMMUTERS. He 
moves off, eyes darting in all directions for Jillian, while meanwhile  

ACROSS THE CONCOURSE, BY THE PILLAR - CONTINUOUS 

JILLIAN 
. ..Cd, that's big "C" little "d," 
cadmium's valence is 2, its atomic number 
is 48 and its atomic weight is 112.411 or 
would you like that carried out five more decimal 
places? Good enough? 

WHITEHEAD 
(smiles) 
Good enough. Come this way, 
Ms. St. Thomas.  
He ushers her off.  

As they move from behind the pillar, 50 yards away -- 

ACROSS THE CONCOURSE - TEMPLAR sees Jillian and Whitehead. He looks around, thinking.  He sprints for the side exit.  

EXT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - MAIN ENTRANCE/EXIT - DAY 
The circular drive where travelers are picked up and deposited by taxis, 
buses, automobiles.  
Jillian and Whitehead exit the station.  
AHEAD - TWO MERCEDES SEDANS are waiting. Several darksuited MEN stand 
next to an open back door.  

JILLIAN 
(shakes her head) 
What a nightmare.. To think my 
work could just be taken from me...  

WHITEHEAD 
You're safe now, Doctor St. Thomas.  
We'll have you back in New York in no time.  
They continue toward the parked Mercedes.  

Suddenly Jillian blinks. She sees something.  
It's TEMPLAR, driving a Russian sedan. He rolls to a stop across the circular 
drive, staring a hole right through Jillian, grimly shaking his head at her, 
trying to warn her...  

JILLIAN 
Agent Whitehead...  

Whitehead looks at Jillian.  

Pause. Jillian eyes Templar across the drive.  

AGENT WHITEHEAD 
Yes? 

Jillian looks at the men waiting by the Mercedes. She looks at two Moscow 
police officers standing to the side. Something's wrong. Something doesn't 
feel right.  

AGENT WHITEHEAD 
Ms. St. Thomas? 
You had a question? 

They're drawing closer to the waiting Mercedes...  

JILLIAN 
Nothing, I was just thinking that 
when my research was stolen I felt like 
the Buffalo Bills after they lost four World Series.  

WHITEHEAD 
Hah hah, I bet you did. I'm a baseball 
fan too hah hah...  

Jillian looks at him differently.  

The Buffalo Bills lost four Super Bowls, Whitehead.  
They continue toward the waiting sedans.  

JILLIAN'S EYES dart around. Her forehead is sweaty.  
And she bolts from him, taking Whitehead by surprise.  
JILLIAN sprints across the circular drive for Templar's car, Whitehead after 
her. The men by the waiting Mercedes converge on Jillian from the side.  
TEMPLAR throws open the passenger side door for Jillian.  
The men coming from the Mercedes open fire on Templar, blowing in the 
sedan's side window. Templar ducks.  
JILLIAN'S almost there...  
She reaches the open sedan and dives inside.  
She tries to shut the door; WHITEHEAD gets hold of it.  
JILLIAN SCREAMS at Templar.  

JILLIAN 
Go! 

Templar floors it. The car SQUEALS away from the curb. Whitehead runs 
alongside, trying to get the door open.  
The car accelerates. Whitehead sprints but can't keep up. His feet leave the 
ground; he clings to the doorframe through the blown-out window.  
Whitehead pulls his gun from his shoulder holster and aims across Jillian's 
body at Templar. His finger 
squeezes the trigger as Jillian shoves his hand up.  
BULLETS blow holes in the roof of the car.  

JILLIAN hits Whitehead, hard, in the head.  
Whitehead's head snaps back. She hits him again.  
Whitehead falls away from the car.  
He rolls twenty feet and stops, dazed but alive.  

INT. TEMPLAR' S STOLEN SEDAN - DAY 
Templar guns the sedan through a RED LIGHT. Cars to the left and right 
SCREECH to a stop. The sedan flies on...  

JILLIAN 
TAKE ME TO THE EMBASSY.  

TEMPLAR 
We're going to the airport.  

Templar guns the accelerator.  

EXT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - CIRCULAR DRIVE - DAY 
The TWO MERCEDES pull up to Whitehead, who staggers to his feet. He gets 
in the lead Mercedes; the two cars race off after Templar and Jillian.  

INT. TEMPLAR'S STOLEN SEDAN - DAY 
Templar floors it through another intersection. he looks in his rear view 
mirror. There's no sign of the two Mercedes. They've escaped.  

TEMPLAR 
Good.  

JILLIAN 
Is it? Who's worse  
them or you? 

Templar looks down and registers shock -- 

- - IN THE INTERSECTION AHEAD, A BLIND MAN with a walking stick is tap 
tapping across the intersection.  
Jillian cringes, expecting the worst. Templar throws the steering wheel and -- 

EXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION - DAY 
-- The sedan swerves, clearing the BLIND MAN by two inches, skidding wildly 
through the intersection.  

INT. TEMPLAR'S STOLEN SEDAN - DAY 
Templar fights the wheel but he's losing...  

The skid can't be corrected. Jillian SCREAMS.  

EXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION - DAY 
The sedan slides sideways, hits the curb and flips over, spinning like a top 
across the sidewalk.  

CUT TO: 

INT. WHITEHEAD'S MERCEDES - DAY 
The Mercedes moves through traffic. Whitehead and the other men look 
around. The Mercedes rounds a corner.  
Across the intersection is the OVERTURNED SEDAN on the sidewalk, 
surrounded by gawking PEDESTRIANS.  

EXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION 
The Mercedes pulls up. Whitehead and his men get out. They warily approach 
the sedan, drawing guns. The pedestrians back off, getting the hell out of the 
way.  

Whitehead and his men surround the car. They kneel, guns trained 
inside...Templar and Jillian are gone.  
Whitehead barks at his men.  

WHITEHEAD 
Fifteen block radius.  
Go house to house.  

Whitehead looks around at the surrounding buildings. We FOCUS on one of 
them, a RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH several blocks away, under scaffolding 
and mesh wire, in the process of renovation. CAMERA pushes in on the 
church's HUGE ONION SHAPED TURRET. . . . .  

INT. MOSCOW - RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH 
 and we're in the turret's interior: round, with stained glass windows, a desk 
and chair. A trap door leading to the vestibule below BANGS OPEN.  

JILLIAN comes up, followed by Templar, his gun in hand.  
They're cut and bruised, exhausted.  
Jillian slumps against the wall, shivering.  
Templar puts his equipment on the desk and goes to each of the windows.  
From this elevation he can see the entire city.  

TEMPLAR'S FIRST POV - RED SQUARE, a mile across town, where a thousand 
Muscovites are listening to a pro Michael Romanov speech.  

Shifting from Red Square to the city outskirts, we see MOSCOW 
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, where Remy waits.  

TEMPLAR'S SECOND POV - THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY is just a few blocks 
away - we see the American flag flying from the roof stanchion.  
In the intersections around the embassy, Tretiak's men stand by their 
vehicles, watching. Every point of access to the embassy is sealed.  
We see WHITEHEAD. A Mercedes pulls up to him. ILYA gets out.  

TEMPLAR 
The embassy's surrounded.  

BACK TO SCENE - JILLIAN 
is staring at Templar's computer. The modem is engaging. JILLIAN sits up, 
staring at the screen.  
Jillian reads an ELECTRONIC MESSAGE which appears: 
BEAR CONTACTING LION.  
GIVE HER TO ME.  
IN RETURN, 20 MILLION AND SAFE PASSAGE.  
IF YOU REFUSE YOU WILL DIE.  

Jillian's eyes grow wide with terror.  
Templar looks out a third window.  

TEMPLAR'S THIRD POV - Tretiak's men are going building to building in a 
fifteen block radius sweep, closing in on the church.  

TEMPLAR 
The airport's out. They're drawing a 
noose around us. We don't have much time.  

TEMPLAR turns away from the window.  He sees Jillian looking at his computer.  He walks over to it and reads the message.  Jillian gets slowly to her feet, watching Templar.  JILLIAN's mouth quivers as Templar types: LION CONSIDERING OFFER.  Templar looks at Jillian. She stares back. A long moment. Neither moves.  

JILLIAN 
What are you going to do? Tell me.  I deserve at least that.  
(desperate now) 
I'll die. If you take their offer, they'll kill me.  

TEMPLAR 
And if I don't, they'll kill me.  
Interesting situation I'd say.  

Jillian sinks to the chair, her voice shaking.  

JILLIAN 
Oh god. It's over, it's all over...  You're not human. You're an animal.  

TEMPLAR 
I'm a businessman. I perform services for profit. And spare me the lecture. You didn't spend ten years in that mildewed basement for the good of humanity, you did it to get rich. Richer than anyone on earth. Richer than God.  
(beat) 
I'll make you an offer - pay me my fifteen million out of your royalties - should come to about one month's. . .

Pause. She slowly looks up at him.  

JILLIAN 
I don't hold the patent rights to cold fusion.  

TEMPLAR 
What? 

JILLIAN 
You fool. Don't you understand? 
(her voice cracks; she begins to softly cry) 
It wasn't about money, it wasn't about becoming rich...  

TEMPLAR 
If you don't own the patent rights, who does? 

JILLIAN 
A foundation in my name. The royalties 
were going to go to scientific research, 
curing cancer, .. .christ how can you understand this...  

She lowers her head, weeping openly.  

CAMERA PUSHES in on Templar, staring at her. Even the darkest of men have a seed of goodness. Here, for the first time, does it flower in Simon Templar.  

But we don't know this. Templar betrays nothing.  
He picks up his homing device and clicks it on.  
He types in this command: MOSCOW.  
The device beeps; THE MOSCOW STREET GRID appears.  
He types a new command: SUBTERRANEAN DATA.  
Moscow's SUBTERRANEAN GRID appears superimposed over the street grid; 
we see the guts of the city; the Moscow subway, water and gas mains, etc. In a corner of the screen is a TABLE OF SCHEDULES.  
Templar analyzes the information on the screen.  

He quickly rises; goes to Jillian, pulling off his belt.  
He pulls her up. She stands limply, still weeping, no longer resisting. He's 
bigger and stronger, there's no use. Templar gathers Jillian's wrists together 
and ties them with the belt.  
He pulls her to the trapdoor and CUT TO: 

EXT. MOSCOW - SIDEWALK 
Several pedestrians walk by. Templar walks Jillian quickly to a MANHOLE 
COVER. He kneels and hoists the cover off. He points into the hole.  
Jillian, her wrists bound, steps down uneasily, her feet finding the top rung of 
a STEEL LADDER. She descends into the manhole. Templar follows.  

INT. MOSCOW - SUBTERRANEAN SEWER SYSTEM - DAY 
Jillian and Templar come down the ladder, dropping to the steel-gridded 
walkway over the Moscow sewer.  
Templar pulls Jillian twenty feet down the walkway.  
At this point in the wall there is a HATCH with a compression HATCHWHEEL, 
the turning of which opens the hatch, like on a submarine.  
Within the hatch we hear RUSHING WATER.  

TEMPLAR 
That's a municipal water main.  
In one hour you're going in there.  

Templar pulls out a SWITCHBLADE. Clicks it on.  
Jillian, shivering with terror, stares at the blade...  

TEMPLAR 
Listen. They shut it down twice a 
day for five minutes to clean the filters.  
Once at noon, once at midnight. Noon is in one hour.  

JILLIAN 
How do you know all this? 

TEMPLAR 
Part of my job. Now ask the logical question...  

JILLIAN 
.. . where does it go? 

TEMPLAR 
Very good. Under the United States Embassy.  
There's an exit hatch into the embassy 
courtyard. That's where we're going.  

JILLIAN 
We...? 

Templar lowers his gun. He lowers the blade to her wrists and cuts the belt.  

TEMPLAR 
You heard me.  

A long pause. They stare at each other.  

JILLIAN 
Then what happens? 

TEMPLAR 
Let's get to the embassy, 
then we'll talk about it.  

JILLIAN 
Templar - about that night at my house 

TEMPLAR 
Don't talk about it, okay? 

He turns away from her. She watches him.  

JILLIAN 
Okay.  

CUT TO: 

EXT. MOSCOW - RED SQUARE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The Michael Romanov supporters are marching past the Kremlin with 
PLACARDS BEARING ROMANOV'S FACE, chanting: 
KARPOV MUST GO! Ahead, awaiting them, are -- 

Two units of MOSCOW POLICE in riot gear. A POLICE SERGEANT clicks on a 
megaphone.  

MOSCOW POLICE SERGEANT
Disperse. Disperse! 

On come the Romanov supporters. Rocks start flying. The Romanov 
supporters push into the line of police. The police push back with shields and truncheons.  A melee breaks out. The Romanov supporters surge past the police. It is a wild, uncontrolled, chaotic scene.  

EXT. MOSCOW - THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY - DAY 
ROMANOV SUPPORTERS flood past the embassy gates, chased by Moscow 
Policemen. Fights rage allover the street. A full-fledged riot is breaking out.  OVERTURNED CARS are burning. LOOTERS run through the streets with stolen goods. We hear the sporadic CRACKLE of small arms fire.  

IN THE U. S. EMBASSY COURTYARD 
A U. S. MARINE and ARMY GREEN BERET detachment, grimfaced and heavily 
armed, stand silent vigil inside the embassy's wrought-iron gates.  
COLONEL WILLIAM CROSBY, embassy c.o., exits the embassy and 
approaches the front gates. A FULL BEER BOTTLE smashes at his feet, 
showering him.  

COLONEL CROSBY 
Jesus H. Christ.  

ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE U. S. EMBASSY 
Ilya and his men stand next to their vehicles, silently watching the embassy.  

CUT TO: 

INT. MOSCOW SEWER SYSTEM - DAY 
The WHOOSHING water in the municipal water main begins to subside. Templar looks at this watch.  

INSERT - TEMPLAR'S WRISTWATCH - it is exactly 12 noon.  

TEMPLAR 
Right on time.  

The water subsides to a trickle. Templar grips the hatchwheel and turns it.  Opens the hatch. Residual water spills out onto the walkway.  Templar pulls himself into the water main. He extends his hand to Jillian.  Jillian looks uncertainly inside.  

TEMPLAR 
Four blocks. Right under Tretiak's men 
and up into the embassy compound. You can do this.  
She grabs Templar's hand. He pulls her up and inside -- 

INT. MOSCOW - MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - DAY 
-- a four foot diamater pipe. Templar pulls out a PENLIGHT, switches it on and 
sticks it between his teeth. On hands and kneess Templar and Jillian move off 
through the water main.  

INT. MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - EXIT HATCH UNDER STREET 
Templar and Jillian crawl up. Templar shines his penlight at the ceiling; AN 
EXIT HATCH WITH HATCHWHEEL is above them.  

JILLIAN 
It doesn't seem like we've gone far enough.  

TEMPLAR 
We haven't, up there's the street in 
front of the embassy.  
(looks at his wristwatch) 
Come on. We've got two minutes.  

They crawl off through the water main.  

INT. MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN UNDER EMBASSY 
Templar and Jillian crawl toward A SECOND EXIT HATCH.  

TEMPLAR 
There it is.  

They reach the exit hatch. They look at it.  Jillian trembles.  

JILLIAN 
Oh my god...  

The EXIT HATCH has no hatchwheel. It's sealed.  
Jillian, panicked, looks down the water main.  

JILLIAN 
We. ...we've got to go back.  

TEMPLAR 
(checks his watch) 
Not enough time.  
(thinks) 
The hatch under the street.  

JILLIAN 
What about Tretiak's men  

TEMPLAR 
Better than drowning.  

They scramble off.  We hear WHOOSHING WATER coming down the pipe.  

JILLIAN 
The water's back on! 

Back they go, crawling as fast as they can.  

INT. MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - EXIT HATCH UNDER STREET 
Templar and Jillian reach the exit hatch under the street. Templar grips the 
hatchwheel as -- 

THE WATER ROARS through the pipe, hitting Jillian flush, blowing her 
backward; she desperately clings to Templar's shoulders as he spins the 
hatchwheel.  The water rises mercilessly. There's a foot of air, then six inches, then just three, then none at all, and they're under water...  TEMPLAR desperately turns the hatchwheel, spinning it one last time and WHOOOSH, the hatch door blows open  

INT. MOSCOW - MANHOLE BELOW THE STREET 
- - and SMASHES against A ONE FOOT DIAMETER PIPE running along the wall 
of the service manhole, CRACKING a fissure in it. PRESSURIZED GAS blows 
out of the pipe. TEMPLAR pulls himself up. He reaches down and pulls Jillian up. Templar kicks the exit hatchdoor closed and spins the hatchwheel shut.  
JILLIAN looks at the GAS spewing from the cracked pipe.  
She sniffs the air. Templar looks at the pipe. A warning is printed in five 
languages: GAS - DANGEROUS.  

TEMPLAR 
City gas line.  

JILLIAN 
We can't stay here, 
we'll asphyxiate.  

Templar and Jillian clamber up the steel runged ladder to the manhole cover.  
Templar pushes up the manhole cover, popping his head out, looking around.  HIS EYES widen with alarm --- 

A POLICE VAN is rolling straight for his head. He ducks and closes the 
manhole cover as the VAN RUMBLES over it.  
Templar listens. Above, the van has stopped.  
Templar pushes up the manhole cover. The VAN has stopped directly over the 
manhole.  

EXT. MOSCOW - STREET IN FRONT OF THE U. S. EMBASSY 
Templar slithers out. Pulls up Jillian. They're under the van now.  
The van's rear door opens; TEN MEN jump down to the pavement. We see 
their BLACK BOOTS; they are MOSCOW POLICE, arriving to arrest the looters.  
Templar and Jillian crawl toward the van's rear.  
Templar looks toward THE U.S. EMBASSY. It's 100 yards away, but looks like 
100 miles.  

TEMPLAR 
Both of us will never make it.  
But one of us can.  
(draws his gun) 
Give me ten seconds, then 
break for the embassy and 
don't stop running until you're 
at the gates. It's a hundred yards, 
so move it.  

JILLIAN 
What are you going to...  

TEMPLAR 
That's my business.  

JILLIAN 
Wait...  
(he stops) 
.. .Simon. Don't do this.  
They'll kill you.  

A long, tense pause.  

TEMPLAR 
The world can do without Simon 
Templar. It can't do without you.  
(smiles grimly) 
See you around sometime.  

He takes a deep breath and logrolls out.  ABOVE THE VAN - TEMPLAR gets to his feet in the street, gun drawn. He 
races from the van, heading in a direction away from the embassy.  
ACROSS THE STREET - ILYA double takes, seeing Templar sprinting from the 
van.  

ILYA 
Kill him! 

Ilya, Whitehead and Tretiak's men sprint down the street after Templar, firing 
as they run, leaving -- 

JILLIAN UNDER THE VAN with a clear path to the embassy. She counts it off:  three. . . . four. . . . five . . . . .  

TEMPLAR dives behind an OVERTURNED CAR and comes up firing on Tretiak's 
men.  

IN THE U. S. EMBASSY'S FRONT COURTYARD 
Colonel Crosby watches the situation unfold.  

COLONEL CROSBY 
What the hell is going on.  

IN THE STREET - ILYA, WHITEHEAD and the other men close in on Templar, 
laying down a withering fusillade of fire. Templar returns fire from behind the 
car.  

UNDER THE VAN - JILLIAN 

JILLIAN 
. . . nine. . . . TEN. . . .  

Jillian logrolls out from under the van.  
She sprints for the embassy gates.  
BEHIND THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR 
sees Jillian running for the embassy. As he returns fire, he exhorts her under 
his breath.  

TEMPLAR 
Go. Faster.. . .  

ILYA, firing on Templar, sees Jillian. He spins, running in a new direction. He's 
going to get Jillian before she can reach the embassy.  JILLIAN, sprinting, screams to the embassy marines.  

JILLIAN 
Open the gate! 

IN THE EMBASSY COURTYARD - COLONEL CROSBY turns to his second in command, a Lieutenant JONES.  

COLONEL CROSBY 
Do it.  

Lieutenant Jones and a MARINE PRIVATE push open the embassy gates.  
COLONEL CROSBY watches Jillian helplessly. There's nothing he can do. Not until she reaches the embassy.  On Jillian comes, legs pumping, feet pounding the pavement. ILYA is right behind her.  She can feel his breath he's so close. Twenty yards. Fifteen yards. Ten...  

BEHIND THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR dodges bullets, corning thick and heavy now, and watches in terror as --- 

ILYA, with a desperate reach, collars Jillian. She shrugs off her jacket, leaving Ilya with the jacket but no Jillian. Jillian lunges through the embassy gates...  

... and is instantly surrounded by U.S. Marines. Jillian looks up at Colonel Crosby, panting.  

JILLIAN 
I'm an American citizen.  

COLONEL CROSBY 
You have our full protection ma'am.  
(looks at Ilya) 
Back away from the gate.  

Ilya's black eyes stare at Colonel Crosby. He backs away from the gate. He turns and sees  

AT THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR, out of bullets with his hands raised, 
surrounded by Tretiak's men behind the overturned automobile.  Ilya, fuming, walks across the street to Templar.  AT THE OVERTURNED CAR - ILYA walks up to Templar. With the calm efficiency of a hangman, Ilya puts his hand on Templar's shoulder and forces him down, down to his knees. He sticks his gun to Templar's head.  

He's going to execute Templar right there, behind the overturned car in the street.  

IN THE EMBASSY COURTYARD - JILLIAN, watching, frantically turns to Colonel Crosby.  

JILLIAN 
Do something! 

COLONEL CROSBY 
That's Russian soil out there, ma'am.  

Jillian turns away, horrified, shielding her eyes.  

BY THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR AND ILYA 

TEMPLAR (Russian) 
Wait. A cigarette. It's customary.  

Ilya looks at Templar. Looks at his men.  
And Ilya laughs. Chuckling at first, then open-mouthed.  
All of TRETIAK'S MEN laugh in Templar's face.  
Ilya takes out a cigarette. Hands it to Templar.  
Lights it for him.  

TEMPLAR (Russian) 
Thank-you.  

And Ilya and Tretiak's men continue to laugh.  

They won't be for long...  
Because Templar is looking at A GRATE above the municipal lines below. And 
TRETIAK'S MEN are sniffing the air, wondering why it smells like rotten 
eggs...  
Templar flicks the cigarette into the grate and dives away as -- 

THE ENTIRE STREET IN FRONT OF THE U. S. EMBASSY blows sky high as THE 
GAS MAIN ignites .  
Ilya, Whitehead, and the other men are blown off their feet. Some are killed.  
Asphalt and dirt rain down, followed by -- 

WATER, as the municipal water main goes up.  
Ilya and Whitehead get to their feet, looking around, water falling like a 
monsoon.  
Templar is gone.  
And the police van is SPEEDING away.  

INT. POLICE VAN - DAY 

Templar guns the van through Moscow streets. He pulls out his cellular 
phone. Punches numbers.  

EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 
Remy stands by his jet, smoking a cigar, looking impatiently at his watch. His 
cellular phone beeps.  

REMY 
Simon, where the hell are you...  
You want me to do what? 

Remy clicks off the phone and scrambles up into the cockpit of the Lear.  

INT. POLICE VAN - DAY 
Templar guns the van straight for -- 

A group of TRETIAK'S MEN conducting the building-to building search. They 
pull two sedans into the intersection, blocking it.  

INT. MOSCOW INTERSECTION - DAY 
Templar doesn't slow - he accelerates, and hits the two cars where their 
bumpers meet, BLASTING through them -- 

-- and races on past the intersection.  

INT. REMY' S LEAR JET - DAY 
Remy's Lear jet skirts Moscow rooftops, just 200 feet off the ground. As the jet clears the KREMLIN roof, we see majestic Red Square spreading before 
us...  

EXT. RED SQUARE - DAY 
TEMPLAR'S POLICE VAN roars into Red Square as -- 

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE - REMY'S LEAR JET touches down. In 
Red Square. It taxis to a stop next to Lenin's tomb.  
The police van SCREECHS up next to the Lear. Templar races from the van to 
the jet, dodging BULLETS fired from -- 

TRETIAK'S MEN, firing from sedans entering the square.  
The Lear jet accelerates straight for the oncoming sedans, lifting off, almost 
scraping the landing gear against their windshields. It wings into the air, 
clearing the top of the Ivan Memorial by a foot.  
And heads west. To freedom.

briefcase. Tretiak emerges from the mansion, greeting Doctor Singh.  

INT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT 
Dr. Singh enters behind Tretiak and Zubov. They move to Zubov's lab table.  
Dr. Singh dons reading glasses. Zubov places Jillian's research before him.  
Singh flips a page, then another.  
He is awed. It's like Salieri looking at Mozart's sheet music. He's searched all 
his life for something and... another person has found it.

Rabineau flips the page. SIMON TEMPLAR'S PHOTO stares at Jillian. She 
studies it a moment. Shakes her head.  

AGENT LONNER 
Be certain, Ms. St. Thomas. Look again.  

She looks again. Studies Templar's photograph.  

JILLIAN 
I'm certain. It's not him.  

Agents Rabineau and Lonner exchange a look.  

EXT. MANHATTAN - CENTRAL PARK - DAY 
Jillian walks down the tree-lined mall.  
Templar is standing there.  
She walks up to him. A moment.  

JILLIAN 
They showed me photographs

And a photograph of you.  

TEMPLAR 
And...? 

JILLIAN 
I said that the man in the photograph doesn't have the eyes of a criminal.  
(pause; they stare at each other) 
The Washington symposium is tomorrow afternoon.  I'm going. I'm presenting my research to the scientific community.  

TEMPLAR 
What about your data...  

JILLIAN 
It's in my head. I'll wing it.  

TEMPLAR 
(draws closer to her) 
You need to conduct further research anyway. I'll help you.  

JILLIAN 
What are we researching. ..? 

Jillian draws closer. Their lips are almost touching...  

TEMPLAR 
The benefits of warm fusion.  

Templar pulls her lips to his and CUT TO...  

INT. JILLIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
There follows a love scene.  Afterward, in each other's arms: 

JILLIAN

TEMPLAR 
Being bad is the only thing 
I've ever been good at.  

JILLIAN 
You can be good at being good.  
(she strokes his hair) 
If you're afraid of the dark, remember the night rainbow.  If tomorrow morning the sky falls, have clouds for breakfast.  If the birds forget their songs, listen to the wind. And if between right and wrong, do what is right.  

TEMPLAR 
Who said that? 

JILLIAN 
(smiles privately) 
My grandmother.  

Templar gently takes her face in his hands.  Whispers to her.  

TEMPLAR 
How did I meet you.  This saint.

Late at night. Dr. Singh is working feverishly. The desk is stacked with papers

DR. SINGH 
Zinc oxide. Iridium mercurate.  
Sodium bicarbon nitrate.  
A cobalt magnesium isotope.  
Liquify the cobalt at 665 degrees

The chemicals begin to mix.  He picks up an ELECTRODE NEEDLE attached to a LIGHTBULB.  
Dr. Singh takes a deep breath. He introduces the electrode needle into the

PHOTOGRAPHERS are taking Jillian's picture as she moves through a crowd

with her.  
It is raining. The place is a sea of umbrellas.  
Several REPORTERS trail after her.  

REPORTER 1 
Doctor St. Thomas! Ben Rothstein, 
Omni Magazine. Is it true? Have you done it? 

JILLIAN 
That question will be answered in

REPORTER 2 
Marilyn Jones, Doctor St. Thomas.  
Dr. Vijay Singh has said that 
your theories are insupportable...  

JILLIAN 
(smiles) 
Sorry, but I'm not interested in 
Doctor Singh's opinions on this 
or anything else.  

JILLIAN moves up the steps, radiant and beautiful; it is the pinnacle of her 
life. She looks across the Mall.  
TEMPLAR stands there. Alone, smiling at her.  
Jillian winks at him, mouthing the words: "open it." 
TEMPLAR understands. He pulls a GIFTWRAPPED BOX from his pocket and 
opens it. Inside is a TIE-PIN; a stick figure man with a halo over his head.  
Templar sticks it through his tie. Picks up the accompanying card.  

INSERT - THE CARD reads: 
Anyone can be a saint, Simon Templar.  
Templar looks back at Jillian. He sees something.  
Behind Jillian, moving toward her through the crowd, is a BLONDE MAN 
UNDER AN UMBRELLA. It looks like... Ilya.  
Templar squints for clearer vision. He begins walking toward the Smithsonian.  
He quickens to a jog, now he's running...  

ON THE SMITHSONIAN STEPS - THE REPORTERS crush into Jillian.  

REPORTERS 
Ms. St. Thomas, Ms. St. Thomas...  

JILLIAN 
Please, no more questions. ...  

Across the sea of people, TEMPLAR reaches the Blonde Man. Templar grabs 
his arm; whips him around.  

BLONDE REPORTER 
Hey! What's the idea? 

It's not Ilya, just a reporter with blonde hair.  
Meanwhile JILLIAN, backing up the stairs from the reporters, draws closer to - - 

A DARK-HAIRED MAN, seen from behind, who lowers an umbrella, pushing a 
button on the handle, revealing a GLISTENING NEEDLE POINT. CAMERA 
moves over his shoulder, revealing...ILYA. With dyed black hair.  
JILLIAN keeps backing up the stairs...  

...Behind her, Ilya's needled umbrella strikes her.  
JILLIAN feels something. Like a bee sting. Her hand moves to her hip...  

.. .as ILYA moves off through the crowd...  

...TEMPLAR comes through the crowd to Jillian. The F.B.I. AGENTS grab him.  

JILLIAN 
Stop it! I know him! 

The Agents release Templar.  
Jillian looks at him. Templar's panting, out of breath.  

JILLIAN 
Simon? What is it? 

TEMPLAR 
Are you all right? 

JILLIAN 
Yes.

Their results couldn't be duplicated. ...  

Jillian is perspiring. She has cotton mouth. She picks up her ice water. Her

They're camped out now.  
A C.N.N. NEWS TEAM transmits from the square.  

WOLF BLITZER 
The scene is reminiscent 
of the Tiananmen Square 
crisis, Bernard.  
The death toll stands at 
forty-eight civilians and 
at least twenty-one armed 
forces personnel.  
Rumors escalated today that...  

EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - ADMIRALTY - ESTABLISHING 
A LIMOUSINE pulls through a 'crowd of ROMANOV SUPPORTERS outside the 
heavily guarded gates of the Admiralty, 
Russia's Naval headquarters, akin to Annapolis.  

WOLF BLITZER 
.. . General Nicolai Radischev...  
(we see a photo of Radischev) 
...has promised Michael 
Romanov his support, pending 
the outcome of today's meeting 
between Romanov and President Karpov.  

ROMANOV, in the back of the limousine, waves to his supporters. They go 
wild, clapping and cheering. The limo continues into the Admiralty compound.  

EXT. ADMIRALTY - DAY 
The limousine rolls through a guarded checkpoint, stopping before -- 

THE ADMIRALTY'S NUCLEAR SITUATION FACILITY: in a more dangerous time, 
this is the place from which Russian military leaders would conduct nuclear 
war.  
It's an acre-sized field of concrete, recessed 30 feet into the earth. It looks 
like a very large, very deep swimming pool emptied of water.  
In the middle is a concave-shaped entrance hatch (visualize an enormous 
bowl turned upside down). The two halves of the concave hatch open down 
the middle, each side retracting into the facility.  
On the concrete floor next to the hatch is a SMALL DETECTION UNIT. We'll 
find about the unit shortly...  

Romanov and four bodyguards exit the limousine. Two RUSSIAN SECRET 
SERVICEMEN escort Romanov to the entrance hatch. They descend down 
stairs to -- 

INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS - DAY

computer stations run the length of the room. It looks like a N.A.S.A. control 
room.  
The Secret Servicemen lead Romanov across the room to -- 

INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS OFFICE - DAY 
An office, relatively comfortable, with a computer, a television and v.c.r., and 
a small satellite link.  
VICTOR KARPOV, the popularly elected President of Russia, rises. Karpov is 
55, intelligent, with a calm, professional demeanor.  

ROMANOV 
A nuclear bunker, Mr. President? 
You must worry for your safety.  

KARPOV 
I have reason to.  

ROMANOV 
Yes. You do.  

They glare at each other.  

KARPOV 
You understand my policy 
on taping meetings.  

Romanov consents with a wave of his hand. Karpov motions to his ATTACHE, 
who flips the switch on a VIDEO CAMERA mounted in the wall.  

KARPOV 
I'll get to the point.  
Your remarks are irresponsible; 
they've caused civil unrest. Unless 
you appeal to your supporters 
to stop rioting, I will institute martial law.  
(beat) 
Tell me what you want.  

ROMANOV 
A public debate, then new 
elections. We'll let the 
people decide.

TWO DARK-SUITED MEN enter. One pauses by the entrance, the other goes

But life goes on, no? 

TEMPLAR sits opposite Tretiak, staring at him. He is shaved and rested, his 
eyes utterly alert.  

TRETIAK 
When Romanov gains the 
presidency Russia will be ours.  
The possibilities are, you would 
agree, endless.

You have talent. Unique talent.  
I need that talent to break into an 
impregnable facility. Be part of

TEMPLAR

Fifteen million, plus the fifteen 
you owe me.  

TRETIAK 
I owe you nothing.  
You were hired to steal 
something and you failed.  

TEMPLAR 
Thirty million,

TRETIAK 
Twenty million, and one

Templar nods in agreement. Rises. Goes to the door.  

TRETIAK 
Templar. A question.

You had feelings for 
the woman, didn't you? 

TEMPLAR 
I don't have feelings, Tretiak.  

Templar, his face hard, cold, expressionless, exits.  

Tretiak watches him.

Templar sits at a table with Harry Winston, Remy Samarkand, and Frankie.  
ARCHITECTURAL PLANS and PHOTOGRAPHS of the Admiralty's Nuclear 
Situation Facility are spread amongst room service trays.  
ILYA, and the massive ZERO sit on the couch, listening.  
Ilya eyes Templar. Templar periodically meets Ilya's eyes. These exchanged 
glances are rife with hostility.  
They've been at this a while and everyone's frustrated.  

FRANKIE 
No, no, no, Karpov's office 
is in the nuclear operations 
room. The entry hatch 
can't be activated from 
above - only below.  

REMY 
It's lead-lined and reinforced 
with eight feet of concrete.  
Explosives and drills are out.  

TEMPLAR 
Electronic by-pass? 

FRANKIE 
Negative. Understand something, 
Simon, please: this is not a bank.  
This is the former Soviet Union's 
missile command.  
Forced entry is impossible.  

A long pause. Everyone looks at each other.  
Templar examines A PHOTOGRAPH of the facility.  
He fixates on it. He sees something.  

TEMPLAR 
What's that? 

Templar points at the SMALL DETECTION UNIT next to the Nuclear Operations 
entrance hatch.  
Frankie looks at the photograph, then picks up a set of blueprints. Starts 
flipping through...  

FRANKIE 
Uhhm.. .that is the facility's...  
(comes to the relevant page and reads:) 
... radiation detector.  
In the event of nuclear 
fall-out it automatically closes 
the hatch.  

Everyone turns to Templar.  

TEMPLAR 
You're saying the system can think.  

FRANKIE 
Yes.

Romanov and Tretiak stand on one side of the lab.  
ACROSS THE LAB, ZUBOV and DR. SINGH are huddled over a hydrogen tank, 
just like the one we saw in Jillian's lab. The tank is surrounded by hundreds of 
testtubes and beakers containing chemicals.  

TRETIAK 
The world will continue to spend half 
its gross national product on oil.  

ROMANOV 
And Russia will spend none. Within five years we will be the

thousand. They carry pro-Romanov banners and shout: DOWN WITH 
KARPOV! In the b.g., we see more rioting. Gunfire crackling. An overturned 
truck.  

A MILITARY AMBULANCE careens around the corner and rolls past the 
Romanov supporters up to the Admiralty gates.  
TWO RUSSIAN NAVY M.P.'s open the gates. The ambulance pulls inside. The 
driver's window rolls down. It's Harry Winston dressed as a RUSSIAN ARMY 
PARAMEDIC.  

HARRY WINSTON (Russian) 
Two soldiers shot by looters! 

The M.P. waves the ambulance through. Harry waves back.  
The ambulance pulls into the Admiralty compound, going past to the rear, to 
the NAVAL HOSPITAL EMERGENCY WARD.  

EXT. ADMIRALTY - NAVAL HOSPITAL 
The ambulance pulls up next to the emergency ward.  
The back door opens. Remy, dressed as a PARAMEDIC, gets out. Remy and 
Harry haul out two heavily bandaged RUSSIAN SOLDIERS on stretchers.  
The stretchers expand into rolling gurneys. Harry and Remy roll the wounded 
soldiers inside.  

INT. ADMIRALTY - NAVAL HOSPITAL 
Harry and Remy roll the gurneys through the emergency ward. NAVAL 
DOCTORS and NURSES are scrambling around, attending to WOUNDED 
SOLDIERS. The scene is frenetic.  
The gurneys roll past the operating rooms, through double doors, into a 
room. No one notices.  

INT. ADMIRALTY - HOSPITAL STORAGE ROOM 
A room stocked with hospital supplies. The wounded "soldiers" spring off the 
gurneys. They are TEMPLAR and ILYA. Ilya wears the uniform of a NAVAL 
M.P. Templar wears a bulky, lead-lined anti-radiation suit.  
Templar shoulders his backpack.  
Harry Winston stands on a counter, pushing up the CEILING TILE. Templar 
and Ilya climb atop the counter.  
Harry forms a stirrup with his hands and hoists Templar, then Ilya, through 
the hole in the ceiling.  

INT. ADMIRALTY - VENTILATION DUCTS - NIGHT 
Templar and Ilya crawl through the ventilation duct to a WIRE MESH 
OPENING.  
Templar rips off the wire mesh screen.  Thirty feet below, in the recessed entrance to the nuclear situation facility, 
TWO NAVAL GUARDS are walking their shift. They walk around the corner. . . 

TEMPLAR 
We've got sixty seconds. Move.  

EXT. ADMIRALTY - SIDE OF BUILDING 
Templar crawls out of the ventilation duct, his feet finding a windowsill. Just 
three inches to stand on.  
Ilya crawls out, his feet finding the same windowsill.  
The two men are side-by-side.  
They begin inching across the sill to a STEEL-RUNGED ladder leading to the 
concrete floor below.  
Ilya's FOOT suddenly slips. His arms flail. He tries to keep his balance, but 
fails.  
Templar catches Ilya's wrist.  
A terrifying tableau: Ilya, hanging over the concrete floor below, held up only 
by Templar. If Templar let's go, Ilya's dead. They stare at each other...  

And Templar pulls Ilya back. Ilya gets his footing. Catches his breath. Nods to 
Templar. They continue to the ladder and descend.  

EXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS 
The naval guards walk their shift.  

EXT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION FACILITY - NIGHT 
Templar and Ilya hurry across the concrete floor to the entrance hatch.  
Templar kneels next to the RADIATION DETECTOR, unshouldering his 
backpack.  
Templar's anti-radiation suit has a goggled hood, which he dons. He then 
carefully lifts from his backpack a PLEXIGLASS RECTANGULAR BOX the size 
and shape of a shoe box, and a high-powered cordless BOLTDRIVER.  
The plexiglass box has two' compartments, one empty, the other filled with 
SMOKY GAS.  
Templar positions the plexiglass box over the radiation detector. He 
unpockets FOUR CONCRETE BOLTS CREWS and bolts the box tightly to the 
concrete floor with the cordless boltdriver. (The plexiglass box has a steel 
mount with holes for this purpose.) 

EXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS 
The naval guards reach the end of the perimeter wall, then turn back toward 
the nuclear situation facility...  

EXT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION FACILITY - NIGHT 
Templar turns a knob on the plexiglass box; THE DOOR separating the two 
compartments within the box OPENS.  
Inside, THE SMOKY GAS releases. It wafts into the radiation detector's 
sensors.. ..Templar watches anxiously, talking to it...  

TEMPLAR 
Radon isn't plutonium but 
you don't know that...  

The detector's EMERGENCY LIGHT begins BLINKING.  

TEMPLAR 
Boom, you just got nuked.  
(unbolts the box) 
Now it's two months later and 
the radiation's gone...  

Templar rips the plexiglass box away from the detector, releasing the RADON 
GAS into the air. A moment passes.  
The EMERGENCY LIGHT turns off and, open sesame, THE CONCRETE 
HATCHDOORS separate, revealing STAIRS.  
Templar rips off his hood. He and Ilya descend.  

EXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS 
The naval guards are nearing the rear of the Admiralty. Around the corner is 
the nuclear situation facility...  

INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION ROOM - DAY 
Templar and Ilya race down. At the base of the stairs is the HATCHDOOR 
open/close switch. Templar throws the "close" switch. Above, the hatch doors 
start to close..  

EXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS 
The naval guards come around the corner just as...  

... THE CONCRETE HATCH DOORS pull shut.  

INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION ROOM - DAY 
Templar and Ilya move through the nuclear situation room to President 
Karpov's office.  

INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS OFFICE - DAY 
Ilya and Templar enter. Ilya opens the credenza behind Karpov's desk, 
revealing ROWS OF VIDEOTAPE CASSETTES.  
Ilya rifles through the tapes.  
Templar kneels behind the T.V. and V.C.R. He switches the T.V.'s satellite link 
from "RECEIVE" to "TRANSMIT," and adjusts the satellite frequency.  
Ilya hands Templar a VIDEO CASSETTE TAPE. Templar throws it in the V.C.R.  
and hits a button. The V.C.R. transmits the tape over the satellite link to the - - 

EXT. ADMIRALTY ROOF 
-- Satellite DISH on the Admiralty's roof, which sends the transmission into 
outer space, where it bounces off a satellite and returns to -- 

INT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 
-- a V.C.R. in the hotel suite, where Frankie hovers over an array of 
sophisticated editing equipment.  
Tretiak, Romanov, and several of Tretiak's men stand to the side.  
Templar's transmission plays on a T.V. It's a tape of the Karpov/Romanov 
meeting: 

KARPOV 
Tell me what you want.  

ROMANOV 
A public debate, then new elections.  
We'll let the people decide.  

KARPOV 
(considers this) 
Agreed.  

Frankie hits "play" on A SECOND V.C.R.: Here, we see the Tretiak/Ivan 
Grachameeting, taped earlier: 

TRETIAK 
Upon what conditions would 
you accept a partnership? 
Be reasonable.  

GRACHA 
Fifty percent of the drug trade 
in St. Petersburg and Moscow.  
A third of prostitution and gambling.  

Both V.C.R.'s are connected to a VIDEO MORPHING SYSTEM not unlike those 
used by filmmakers. Frankie hits some buttons on the morphing machine.  
On the first V.C.R. MONITOR - ROMANOV'S IMAGE is lifted from the 
videotape. It simply disappears.  

CUT TO: 

INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATIONS FACILITY - NIGHT 
Templar and Ilya, waiting. Templar looks at his watch.  

TEMPLAR 
Come on, Frankie...  

INT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 
Frankie, finished, hits "play." We see an altered version of the 
Karpov/Romanov meeting. Romanov has been morphed out and Ivan Gracha 
bas been morphed in.  
ON THE SCREEN, it now looks like this: 

PRESIDENT KARPOV 
Tell me what you want.  

GRACHA 
Fifty percent of the drug trade 
in St. Petersburg and Moscow.  
A third of prostitution and gambling.  

PRESIDENT KARPOV 
Agreed.  

President Karpov shakes Gracha's hand.  

BACK TO SCENE 

Frankie turns to Tretiak and Romanov.  

FRANKIE 
Should I send it? 

TRETIAK 
Not yet.  

Romanov clicks on his cellular phone.  

ROMANOV 
General Radischev please.  
Yes, an emergency.  

Frankie, alarmed, turns to Tretiak.  

FRANKIE 
What's he doing? Templar won't 
have time to get out of there...  

Tretiak nods to ZERO who opens the door into the hall.  
TWO MOSCOW POLICEMEN enter. They stride over to Frankie, yank her up 
and handcuff her, dragging her off.  

CUT TO: 

EXT. ADMIRALTY - GARRISON - NIGHT 
The Naval Guard in the garrison looks up with wide, startled eyes at -- 

THREE RUSSIAN TANKS rumble up to the Admiralty, followed by a 
detachment of RUSSIAN ARMY SPECIAL FORCES.  

NAVAL GUARD 
(under his breath) 
Mother of God...  

The tanks smash through the gate, rolling into the Admiralty compound. The 
Special Forces Men walk silently past the startled Naval Guard, who rushes 
inside and hits a KLAXON HORN.  

INT. ADMIRALTY - NAVAL HOSPITAL STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT 
Harry and Remy, startled by the klaxon, look out the storage room window 
at...the tanks.  

HARRY 
Come on, Simon, move it...  

EXT. ADMIRALTY - COMPOUND - NIGHT 
THE TANKS roll into the Admiralty compound: a message blares from one of 
the tank's loudspeaker: 

TANK LOUDSPEAKER (v. o .) 
This is a matter of national security.  
I repeat, this is matter of national...  

The tanks roll up to the nuclear situation facility.  
The Special Forces Men walk up to the open hatch.  

INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS OFFICE 
Templar looks at his watch. He's waiting for Frankie to send back the 
morphed tape...  

TEMPLAR 
Come on, Frankie.  

Suddenly the transmission starts coming across the satellite link, recording 
over the old tape. It's almost finished...  

INT. ADMIRALTY - OPERATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
The Special Forces Men come down the stairs and across the room toward 
Karpov's office...  

INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR BUNKER - KARPOV'S OFFICE 
Templar yanks the MORPHED TAPE from the v.c.r and goes back to Karpov's 
credenza. He kneels by the drawer.  
Something fast and unexpected happens, like slight-of hand. Templar pulls A 
SECOND TAPE from inside his suit and puts it back in the drawer, sliding the 
morphed tape under the credenza. He stands, turns, and freezes...  

ILYA (remember, he is dressed as a NAVAL M.P.) has his gun leveled on Templar.  Ilya steps past Templar.  Lifts the tape from the drawer 
- the tape from Templar's waistband.  The door bursts open. The Special Forces men pile inside. The Special Forces 
MAJOR regards the situation.  

ILYA 
I found him over there.  
(holds up the tape) 
With this.  

SPECIAL FORCES MAJOR 
Give it to me.  
(turns to his men) 
Arrest President Karpov.  

Four Special Forces Men race out.  

INT. ADMIRALTY - NIGHT 
President Karpov and his wife are sleeping. The door blasts open, throwing a 
beam of light on Karpov, who sits up, staring with a confused expression at -- 

The SPECIAL FORCES MEN, glaring back at him.  

CUT TO: 

EXT. DVORTSOVAYA PLOSCHAD - EARLY MORNING 

It's 4 a.m., but revolution is in the air. Thousands of St. Petersburgers are 
pouring into the square. It is an anxious, surreal scene.  
RUSSIAN TANKS and ARMOURED VEHICLES surround the square.  
THE CROWD explodes with thunderous cheers as -- 

MICHAEL ROMANOV, escorted by soldiers, comes through the crowd.  
GENERAL NICOLAI RADISCHEV, tall, stern, career Army man, follows with a 
contingent of junior officers.  

Behind Radischev are TEMPLAR, FRANKIE and PRESIDENT KARPOV, under 
arrest, escorted by SPECIAL FORCES MEN.  
Romanov climbs atop a TANK TURRET.  
He looks out over the crowd.  
THE CROWD comes to a hush. Like Lenin's arrival at Finland Station. A 
history-in-the-making atmosphere.  

ROMANOV 
Friends, countrymen, I give you 
Major Antonin Scarpinin.  

Major Scarpinin (the Special Forces Major), climbs atop the tank turret.  

MAJOR SCARPININ 
Twenty minutes ago a team of 
Russian Special Forces, acting on 
confidential information, raided 
President Karpov's office...  

ACROSS THE SQUARE - TRETIAK and his men emerge from several 
limousines.  
As Tretiak moves through the crowd, IVAN GRACHA and twenty of his men 
approach.  

TRETIAK 
Thank you for coming, Ivan, 
it is a great night for Russia.  

IVAN GRACHA 
I don't give a damn who's president.  
I'll make my money either way.  

TRETIAK 
Maybe you should take greater 
interest in politics, Ivan Gracha.  
Tretiak and Gracha turn to Major Scarpinin, listening...  

ON THE TANK TURRET - TEMPLAR and FRANKIE are shoved by soldiers up 
next to Scarpinin. Templar and Frankie exchange a steely glance.  
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE - REMY and HARRY come through the 
crowd. Seeing Templar and Frankie atop the tank, they stop in their tracks 
and watch...  

MAJOR SCARPININ 
This man, a known international thief, 
aided by this woman, a German 
operative, were arrested stealing a 
surveillance videotape from 
President Karpov's office.  
Scarpinin shows THE SEIZED TAPE to the crowd, then hands it to Romanov, 
who climbs atop the tank.  
TEMPLAR AND FRANKIE are pulled down from the turret and led away to TWO 
ARMY TRUCKS in the background.  

ROMANOV 
One month ago I said I would 
prove that those who call 
themselves our leaders...  
(points at KARPOV) 
.. .are in league with those who we 
know to be thieves, traitors, 
rapists of our once-great country.  
Do you want to see this proof? 

THE CROWD 
(out for blood) 
YES! 

Romanov hands the tape to Major Scarpinnin, who walks it over to an army 
communications TECHNICIAN standing by a portable V.C.R. linked to the 
HUGE SCREEN (seen in Romanov's earlier speech) above Romanov.  
ON THE TANK TURRET - ROMANOV points at the HUGE SCREEN.  
The crowd waits breathlessly. .:.  

ON THE SCREEN - the tape begins playing, but we don't see Karpov's office.  
Shockingly, we see...Tretiak's.  
Simon Templar stashed the tape Frankie recorded of the Tretiak/Romanov 
meeting in Karpov's office. We see: 

TRETIAK 
Hail Michael Romanov, Czar 
of the Fatherland. How will 
that sound to the average Russian? 

ROMANOV 
The average Russian is a fool.  

IN THE CROWD there is confusion, incredulity.  
ROMANOV'S eyes widen.  
TRETIAK and MEN stare in disbelief at the screen.  
IVAN GRACHA and his men slowly back away from Tretiak.  

ROMANOV 
He exists to be dominated.  
To partnership in government.  

TRETIAK 
No Romanov  
to partnership in crime.  

MICHAEL ROMANOV looks down at the crowd and...  
. ...500,000 RUSSIANS stare back at him in silence.  

ROMANOV 
That.. . that it is a fraud...  
(turns to General Radischev) 
I can explain.  

RADISCHEV 
(motions to MAJOR SCARPININ) 
Arrest him.  

Scarpinin and his Special Forces Men close in on Michael Romanov, the 
crusading reformer.  
ACROSS THE SQUARE - TRETIAK AND HIS MEN, huddled in a protective 
circle, stare into the angry faces of half a million Russian citizens.  
Total silence. A pin could drop.  
Tretiak and his men brandish their weapons. The intimidated crowd backs off.  
They move quickly toward their vehicles, the CROWD parting for them.  

A DETACHMENT OF RUSSIAN MARINES comes through the crowd.  
They are heavily armed and ready for business.  
Tretiak aims and fires. A MARINE goes down.  
CIVILIANS SCREAM and dive away. pandemonium breaks out.  
TRETIAK'S MEN open fire. The MARINES return fire. A harrowing amount of 
ammunition is expended in seconds.  
Ten of Tretiak's men and many marines take hits. ZERO dies instantly. A 
brutal, close-quarters firefight. The outnumbered marines take the worst of it.  
Tretiak, Ilya, and Tretiak's surviving men run past the fallen marines to their 
vehicles.  
They pile into the first two cars and SQUEAL away, heading down the Nevsky 
Prospect.  

ACROSS THE SQUARE - AT THE ARMY TRUCKS 
Panic and pandemonium. Soldiers running here and there amidst panicked 
civilians. A SPECIAL FORCES SERGEANT stands guard outside one of the 
trucks. A NAVAL PARAMEDIC, supporting a WOUNDED PARAMEDIC, staggers 
up.  
Harry Winston and Remy, of course.  

HARRY WINSTON (Russian) 
Sergeant, give me a hand.  

The Sergeant gives Harry a hand. REMY stands up; whips the barrel of his 
gun across the Sergeant's head, who collapses onto Harry. Harry drags him 
off and  

REMY pulls the pin on the truck's doorlock. The door swings open. Templar 
hops down  

TEMPLAR 
Get Frankie.  

Remy and Harry hurry off to the other army truck.  
TEMPLAR gets in the truck, sliding behind the wheel. He starts the ignition 
and throws it in drive. The truck rumbles forward, hopping the curb.  
THE ARMY TRUCK ROARS out of the square, pursuing Tretiak's vehicles down 
the Nevsky Prospect as, behind him -- 

- - the TANKS and ARMOURED VEHICLES also roar out of the square, followed 
by Russian Marines, Special Forces, and the enraged crowd. They too head 
down the Nevsky Prospect for the mafia headquarters...  

CUT TO: 

EXT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 
Tretiak's vehicles wheel into the circular drive. No guards are present. Tretiak 
and men exit the vehicles and race inside -- 

INT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 
Tretiak and his men hurry in. No guards here, either.  
Tretiak's on his cellular phone.  

TRETIAK 
Get the plane running, we'll 
be there in five minutes.  
(to his men) 
Clean out the safe. Burn the 
records in my office.  

Tretiak and Ilya go quickly to the basement stairs.  
Tretiak's men go for the upstairs staircase.  

INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - ZUBOV' S LAB 
A T.V. shows a newscast from the Ploschad. Dr. Singh and Zubov, having 
seen everything that just transpired, are frantically destroying their data and 
records.  
Zubov is burning the cold fusion hardcopies in a waste basket. Dr. Singh is 
deleting the computer files.  
Tretiak and Ilya come down the stairs. Zubov pops a 3 1/4 disk from the 
computer.  

ZUBOV 
We reduced the fusion 
formula to one disk and 
destroyed everything else.  

TRETIAK 
Good.  

And Tretiak draws his gun. As does Ilya. Zubov and Dr. Singh stare at the 
guns.  

DR. SINGH 
What.. . what are you...? 

Tretiak shoots Zubov. Ilya shoots Dr. Singh. The two scientists fall, dead. So 
much for honor among thieves.  
Then Tretiak wheels on Ilya, his gun coming up. Yes, so much for honor 
among thieves...  
Tretiak freezes, startled.  
Because Ilya has his gun leveled on Tretiak.  
Tretiak tries to speak. Words won't form. Ilya FIRES. Tretiak pitches over 
backward.  
Ilya walks past Tretiak's corpse, yanks the computer disk from Zubov's 
lifeless hand and turns -- 

TEMPLAR stands across the lab, gun in hand.  
Ilya's eyes dart around the room.  

ILYA 
We can share this, Templar.  

TEMPLAR 
We don't own it.  

ILYA 
Who does? 

TEMPLAR 
(eyes glinting) 
The Jillian St. Thomas Foundation.  

There is a sudden shrill WHISTLING SOUND. Templar and Ilya look around.  

ILYA 
Don't be a fool.  

TEMPLAR 
I'm a fool? You thought you 
could get away with murder.  
Used curare didn't you? 
Induces blood-clotting.  

Templar clicks back the hammer...  

ILYA 
What do you want? 

The WHISTLING is louder. Anyone with military service knows the sound of 
incoming ordnance...  

TEMPLAR 
What do I want? 
I want.. . revenge.  
Now give me the disk.  

There's a massive EXPLOSION above. The laboratory is ROCKED. A SHELF OF 
CHEMICALS teeters over, falling on TEMPLAR, knocking the gun from his 
hand. The beakers of chemicals SMASH all around Templar 
Ilya sprints for the stairs.  
Templar grabs for his gun, lying in a puddle of CARBOLIC ACID. He grabs the 
gun; the acid burns his flesh. He drops it and races for the stairs.  

INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 
Ilya emerges from the basement stairwell and races for the front door.  
Templar comes up; sprints after Ilya.  

Ilya, with Templar hotly behind, gets to the front door, flings it open, and...  
freezes. And Ilya and Templar are suddenly staring down the barrel of -- 

A RUSSIAN TANK. Just sitting there in the mansion courtyard. Russian 
soldiers behind it.  
Ilya and Templar duck. The tank FIRES. The MISSILE PROJECTILE explodes 
from the tank's barrel, flies through the mansion's front door over Ilya and 
Templar's heads...  

... wings across the interior of the mansion...  

.. . and SLAMS into the rear wall of the mansion, exploding, blowing the wall 
down, revealing ANOTHER TANK at the mansion's rear, lumbering toward it.  
Ilya slams the door shut and whirls on Templar. They trade blows. Ilya has 
the better of this. He shoves Templar aside and races back through the foyer.  
Templar recovers and races after Ilya, tackling him in the middle of the floor.  
They roll on the floor, trading vicious blow after vicious blow, when --- 

-- A TANK SHELL RIPS into the mansion's domed cupola.  
Templar and Ilya look up in horror as -- 

THE 20 FOOT DIAMETER CRYSTAL CHANDELIER descends.  
Templar and Ilya dive away. The chandelier CRASHES 
spectacularly in the middle of the foyer, exploding like a glass grenade. A 
HUGE PIECE OF CRYSTAL hits Templar in the side of the head, opening a 
gash, dazing him.  
There's no place to go. Except up.  
Ilya races for the staircase.  
Templar recovers and takes up the chase again.  
Up the staircase they go.  
A SECOND TANK MISSLE slams into the dome, imploding it.  
CHUNKS OF STONE and MASONRY fall on Ilya and Templar, knocking them 
both backward.  

INT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT 
The lab is rocked by the explosions.  
RACKS OF CHEMICALS in beakers fall to the floor, SMASHING. The chemicals 
begin to ooze together.  
A chemical reaction is occurring. The mixing chemicals begin emitting smoke.  

INT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - CORRIDOR/TRETIAK'S OFFICE 
Tretiak's men are at the windows with automatic weapons, firing on the army 
below. Two men drag a crate into the office. They open it, revealing an  

ANTI-TANK GRENADE LAUNCHER. They pull it from the crate and set up the 
tri-pod...  

ON THE STAIRCASE - TEMPLAR AND ILYA 
continue up the staircase. Ilya reaches the mezzanine. He climbs atop the 
balustrade and jumps to the lip of the crater in the dome. He pulls himself up.  
Templar repeats Ilya's actions: climbs atop the balustrade and jumps to the 
lip of the crater. As he pulls himself up... ILYA appears.  
He compresses his foot against Templar's knuckles.  
Templar grimaces. There's no way out this time.  
There's a burst of ORANGE LIGHT as A TANK SHELL explodes on the roof, 
knocking Ilya off his feet, allowing -- 

-- Templar to pull himself up to the roof.  

EXT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS / NEVSKY PROSPECT - NIGHT 
The tanks continue firing. Russian Marines fire round after round into the 
mansion. Tretiak's men inside return the fire.  
Harry, Remy and Frankie run up, looking with alarm at the vicious firefight.  
Realizing Templar is within...  

INT. TRETIAK'S OFFICE 
The anti-tank grenade launcher is operational. One of Tretiak's men loads, the 
other fires, and -- 

EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - NIGHT 
-- an ANTI-TANK SHELL launches from the window and hits the tank in the 
courtyard, blowing its turret off.  
Tretiak's men fire assault rifles from the windows.  
No one's surrendering. It's a fight to the death...  

EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ROOF - NIGHT 
Templar and Ilya, on the mansion's roof. The view is mind-boggling: the 
nighttime St. Petersburg skyline looming in the background and, below, three 
Russian tanks firing shell after shell into the mansion.  
Across the exploding, crumbling rooftop, Ilya and Templar go. A TANK SHELL 
explodes in front of Ilya.  
Ilya falls, concussed by the shell. Templar dives upon him, wrenching the 
COMPUTER DISK from Ilya's pocket.  
Ilya slams his forearm into Templar's head. The disk flies from Templar's 
hand, scuttles across the roof shingles, falling through a crater...  

... it flutters to the mansion floor, 50 feet down.  
They get to their feet, circling each other. Their footing is not trustworthy, like 
ice in Spring.  
Tank shells SLAM into the mansion's upper architecture and roof. A shell hits 
the mansion's east wall, detaching the DRAIN PIPE running up it.  
Ilya draws a SWITCHBLADE. Backing Templar up.  
Templar's at the very edge of the building.  
There's no place to go.  
Templar's feet are unsteady. Because the cornice of the building is crumbling 
beneath him. ...  

And Templar falls. He looks over his shoulder, his wrists turning, hands 
opening, and...  

... Templar catches the detached DRAINPIPE.  
The drainpipe sags under Templar's weight, bending... And it stops. Templar 
hangs there, bobbing up and down above the alley between the mansion and 
the adjacent building, fifty feet below.  
Ilya turns back.  
He's going after the disk.  
Ilya jumps through the crater to the mezzanine and races down the 
staircase...while in the basement...  

INT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT 
Another whole shelf of chemicals falls, smashing. The chemicals continue to 
mix...  

EXT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - ROOF 
Templar dangles from the drainpipe.  
KA-CHUNG. It gives. It gives again. The drainpipe is about to break. Templar 
looks down into the flames and demolition below...  

INT. TRETIAK's MANSION - STAIRCASE/FOYER - NIGHT 
Ilya races reaches the foyer. The building is imploding, chunks of stone falling 
all around him.  
Ilya's eyes are wild. He wants that disk...  

Ilya gets to it.  
Clutches it. It's finally in his hands.  
He goes for the staircase. ...  

INT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT 
The chemicals are steaming now, in a froth, becoming more and more and 
more volatile...  

EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - NIGHT 
Templar, dangling from the drainpipe, looks wildly around for an escape. If he 
could just get to that adjacent building...  

It's too far. And his hands are slipping...  

Then, from the mansion's basement, the very guts of the building, the 
chemicals in the lab detonate and -- 

THE MANSION EXPLODES FROM WITHIN.  

INT. TRETIAK' S MANS ION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT 
Ilya's eyes bulge in terror as the staircase collapses under him. Ilya falls, 
engulfed in flame, still clutching the cold fusion disk.  

EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - NIGHT 
The drainpipe fully detaches from the collapsing mansion wall. It falls away 
from the mansion, with Templar still holding on...  

Templar releases from the drainpipe and catches the lip of the roof cornice of 
the adjacent building.  
Templar pulls himself up and looks back at...  

TRETIAK'S MANSION. The entire building comes apart at the seams. It 
crashes into a heap of rubble.

It's mid-day. People coming and going.  

INT. ROCKEFELLER - AN OFFICE 
CAMERA PANS past the office door, stenciled -- ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION - CHARITABLE DONATIONS -- to a huge desk. Two middle-aged LADIES are going through a four-foot 
stack of MAILED DONATIONS.  
They are LUCY and DELORES.  

LUCY 
Here's one from that guy who owns 
most of Brooklyn. Ten bucks again.  

LUCY 
I'll alert the media.  
Guy's richer than god...  

DELORES 
(reads a check) 
Hey, Mr. Anderson at the Met 
gave a thousand this year. Lucy? 

But LUCY'S not listening.  
She's staring at a check. Her eyes are like hubcaps.  

LUCY 
Oh my goodness gracious...  
(looks at Delores) 
Get Mr. Thomas, Delores.  

DELORES 
What is it? 

LUCY 
A check for fifty...  
(gulps) 
...million dollars.  

Delores gets up, goes to Lucy, who's hyperventilating.  
Lucy hands her the check. Delores starts hyperventilating. Lucy reads the 
letter: 

LUCY 
It's from a "Jillian St.  
Thomas Foundation," 
for the benefit of scientific research.  

DELORES 
Never heard of it. Lemme see.  

Lucy hands Delores the letter.  
INSERT - THE LETTER is printed under a letterhead with a logo design: the 
stick figure man with halo, the same design as the tiepin Jillian gave Templar.  

BACK TO SCENE 

Delores looks at Lucy. Lucy looks back.  
And over this we hear a voice. We've heard it before...  

JILLIAN ST. THOMAS 
If you're afraid of the dark, 
remember the night rainbow...  

EXT. MANHATTAN - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SUNSET 
A lone man stands on the bridge.  
The spires of Manhattan rise above him.  
The sun is setting...  

JILLIAN ST. THOMAS 
If tomorrow morning the 
sky falls, have clouds for 
breakfast. If the birds 
forget their songs, 
listen to the wind...  

CAMERA closes in on the hard, defiant face of a man who has changed a great 
deal in these months.  

JILLIAN ST. THOMAS 
And if between right and wrong...  
And Simon Templar joins Jillian here, speaking with her 
soul... 
SIMON AND JILLIAN 
...do what is right.  

And Simon whispers to himself...  

SIMON 
I will do what is right.  

PULLING BACK, we see that the sunset has cast rays through the bridgework.  
And we can't be certain, it is vague, but the rays filtering through the 
bridgework seem to cast a halo over Templar's head.  
He is, now, The Saint.  

THE END 
to be continued...
