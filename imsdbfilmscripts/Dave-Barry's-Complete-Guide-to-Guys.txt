          And we're good to go.
          TWO MEN come out of the BEACON HOTEL. Loud Hawaiian shirts,
          walking a Chihuahua. They pause; take in the scene on Ocean.

          Proceed to first checkpoint and hold.
          They thread their way to the corner... across the street.. .onto

          AGENT STEARNS has a RIFLE with a kick-ass scope. AGENT LEOPOLD
          watches through binoculars; talks through a collar mike.

          Okay sit tight. Company's coming.
          THROUGH BINOCULARS NOW, as TWO DEADLY MEN approach like
          barracudas. A THIRD GUY, BEHIND THEM, the KINGPIN they're
          protecting. Then as TREETOPS BLOCK THE VIEW --

          Oh, mama.
          She bends, twists; water streams down every delicious curve.

                         LEOPOLD
          She sure is taking her time...

                         STEARNS
          She must be really salty...

                         LEOPOLD
          (shakes his head)
          It's not just the salt. She's got
          sunscreen on. Then the sand gets on
          that, and it sticks...

          -- Shit!
          He WHIPS THE BINOCULARS back: but all that's left is the
          Chihuahua. Then, walking into the spot --

                         DAVE
          Hi, I'm Dave Barry. Has something
          like this ever happened to you?
          (bends down to pet

                         THE CHIHUAHUA)
          Because if you're a guy - or if you
          know someone who is - then what you've
          just seen should look pretty familiar.
          He picks up the Chihuahua, starts walking with it.

          Scientists call this condition "Lust
          Induced Brain Freeze." It affects
          millions of guys, every day, in all
          walks of life -- causing anything
          from a mild embarrassment, to an
          international incident.
          He stops. Finds LEOPOLD and STEARNS and SEVERAL OTHER AGENTS
          pointing GUNS at him.

          Hey. I didn't even know it was a
          dog.
          They take it from him; rush it away. Dave turns to CAMERA.

                         DAVE
          Notice I didn't say it's a condition
          that affects men every day -- only
          guys. And that subtle but important
          difference is one of the things this
          movie is about.

          A HUSBAND and his WIFE. He has suitcases by the front door.

          You'll never get away with this.
          I'll sue you down to your last penny.

                         HUSBAND
          Good luck - I transferred everything
          we own into private accounts, where
          you can't touch it. In fact, as of
          now, you're broke.

                         WIFE
          But...why?

                         HUSBAND
          I've fallen in love with another
          woman. A younger woman. Prettier,
          with no cellulite. Actually, I think
          you'd like her.

          You bastard.
          The IMAGE FREEZES. Dave walks into the room.

          She looks down; stirs her soda.

          So there's nothing left to do now,
          but leave you, forever, and only see
          you from across a shiny conference
          table with bloodthirsty lawyers all

          Well when I met him, I didn't know
          so much. About guys, or men or what
          have you -- we just didn't talk about
          such things then. In fact, I didn't

          Anyway. I thought I was marrying a
          man, but didn't know that in his
          heart, he was a guy.

          DAVE (O.S.)
          When did you first suspect?

                         LENORE
          Not long after the wedding. But it
          didn't bother me. I just didn't
          know how to recognize the signs.
          But we've learned to live with it.
          Haven't we, Albert?

          Albert. There's a person here asking
          us questions. There's a film crew
          here.

          Ten, fifteen years ago? A guy would
          call you up with some joke he just
          heard. So you wanna pass it on,
          it's by phone. One person at a time.
          Then a while later, some guy calls
          you up with the same exact joke.

          Contrary to what many women believe,
          it's fairly easy to develop a long
          term, stable, intimate and mutually
          fulfilling relationship with a guy.

          With human guys, it's extremely
          difficult. This is because guys
          don't really grasp what women mean

          the reason that dogs howl at the
          moon is because they can't go up
          there and urinate on it -- which is
          not, however, a theory which I
          embrace. But guess who gets all the
          grant money every year. The
          bastards...

          LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST
          I didn't want this job. Twenty years,
          in the social sciences? And what
          was everybody else doing -- they
          were getting laid. They were going
          to bed with women. And what have I
          been doing -- applying for matching
          grants. And not getting them.

          expert said about this particular
          anxiety that guys have regarding
          bathrooms in general and public ones
          in particular. Any thoughts?

          mean the guy was a little loopy but
          he hit the nail on the head.

          The worst kind, Dave, and in a lotta
          ways. Because a guy's main goal is
          to get in and outta there without
          having to deal in any other way with
          any other guy - and in an airport
          bathroom especially, with the turnover

                         JOHN MADDEN
          Well the crucial thing here, is makin'
          sure there's no eye contact. I mean
          none - zero. These guys'll look up,
          they'll look down, they'll look
          straight ahead -- but a guy would
          rather have you poke both his eyes
          out with burning hot fire tongs,
          Dave, than to give the next guy over
          a reason to think you might be lookin'
          at him in a public bathroom. For
          reasons that oughtta be pretty darn
          obvious.

                         DAVE
          Obvious indeed. Now here comes Guy

                         JOHN MADDEN
          Now Guy Number Two, what he's gonna
          do is, he's gonna come in, see the
          first guy in position along the wall
          and right away he's gonna line up
          wide on the opposite side. This is
          a best case scenario here, something
          both these guys can appreciate.
          Plus they've opened up the middle
          for the third guy --
          The THIRD GUY comes in. John diagrams his path to the middle

                         DAVE
          What about eye contact in this
          situation.

                         JOHN MADDEN
          Well you're still not likely to
          encounter any, but again if you do,
          that's what that buffer zone on either
          side of him's for. And all three of
          'em are feelin' pretty lucky to have
          it, I can tell you that.

          fine - and if this were some small
          commuter airport, y'know late at

          everybody's gonna be next to somebody,
          which is the last thing any of these

                         DAVE
          One of the most time honored and
          reliable mental delaying styles, is
          the Baseball Method --

          then to Dave)
          Well, the baseball thing. I mean a
          while ago I was into that - big time.
          You know, fooling around with
          different lineups, mixing up the
          batting order - like thinking about
          what would happen if you took your
          cleanup guy and made him eighth or
          something -- just something stupid
          like that, you know? Stuff you'd
          never really do.

                         DAVE

          Oh hell yeah. I mean I could go all
          night - literally all night - just
          shuffling my pitching staff around,
          or thinking about who I might try
          and sign at the winter meetings.
          Hang on --

          then comes back.

                         ROGER
          The thing is, it got stale. And I
          found after a while I wasn't enjoying
          sex or baseball that much. And you
          don't want to mess with that stuff.

          As you can see, a lot of guys are

          standards they are still, basically,
          lame as hell on almost every single
          count. The reason for this is simple:
          women set the standards.
          (takes a bite)
          And not just bedroom standards --
          all standards. Because women invented

          they'll have to do. And things
          they'll have to stop doing.

                         PRIMATE KELLY
          How about "no leaving your dirty
          smelly loincloths wherever you feel
          like it, and expecting me to do
          something about it?" Can that be a
          standard?

                         PRIMATE ELAINE
          That can be one of the first.

          during sex?"

          Most of them can't even remember

          There are social standards, about
          being sensitive - remembering
          anniversaries, listening during
          conversations, not eating soup with
          your hands, or sitting around in
          your underwear when company's over.
