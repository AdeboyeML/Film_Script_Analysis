          TITLE: SEPTEMBER 26, 1933.

           EXT. PRICK STREETS OF MICHIGAN CITY, INDIANA - A BROWN


          PONTIAC
           is parked at the curb. It waits.

          INT. PONTIAC - "RED" HAMILTON ( 34)

           looks at his watch. With his meticulously parted red hair, he
           might be a bank president. It's 6:55 a.m.

          HAMILTON
          Time.
          Thirty year old JOHN HERBERT DILLINGER is in the backseat. He
          nods. His arms are behind him. We don't know why. Red starts
          the car and drives forward.

          CUT TO:

          INT. INDIANA STATE PRISON, MICHIGAN CITY, INDIANA - LINE OF


          CONVICTS
          Its cold.-Convicts' uniforms are broadly striped and frayed.
          This is a line of hard men branded by prison: shorn hair,
          broken nose, eyes with a cold ferocity. And their aggression
          has a nihilistic edge; their spirits never surrender. There's
          nothing beaten down about these men. Like Alcatraz,
          Leavenworth, and Sing Sing, this is the end of the line.

          PRISON GUARDS
          in visored black caps, black shirts, black patent leather Sam
          Browne belts with three-foot long billy clubs watch the line,
          poised to unleash violence.

          AMONG THE HARD MEN ARE...
          HARRY "PETE" PIERPONT (32), 6 foot 1 with eerie blue eyes.
           Brilliant, violent, he hates all authority.
          CHARLES MAKLEY ( 44), squat with an anvil jaw, facial scars
           and as calm as Pierpont is volatile.
          HOMER VAN METER (27), tall, an incorrigible clown and an
          unemotional killer. He has continued to ridicule guards even
          when it cost him months in the hole.

          THESE THREE
          with an older man, WALTER DIETRICH, wait for the lam. work
          call to the prison Shirt Factory...

          INT. INDIANA STATE PRISON, GATEHOUSE - TURNKEY

          watches through a window as a Pontiac pulls into the parking
          area in front of the prison across from the streetcar tracks.
          Hamilton jerks a handcuffed Dillinger out of the backseat.
          Dillinger is shoved forward. Hamilton's wearing a star.

          TURNKEY
          (opening up)
          Afternoon.
          Hamilton flashes the badge. He shoves Dillinger inside. In an
          adjacent room FIVE GUARDS play poker. Next to them is a
          barred entrance to the prison yard. As the cage door locks
          behind him, this is the last place Dillinger wants to have
          entered. Meanwhile...

          INT. INDIANA STATE PRISON - THE SHIRT FACTORY: STACKS OF


          BOXES
          and bolts of fabric wait for the convicts. lam. A KLAXON
          sounds. Door opens. Convicts enter. Walter Dietrich goes
          right to the stacks and pulls a box with an "X" crayoned on
          the side. Its labeled "Thread."
          (Dietrich was mentored by Herbert K. Lamm, an ex-Prussian
          soldier who invented professional bank robbery by applying
          military tactics and who rode with Butch & Sundanc4's Hole in
          the Wall Gang in Utah in 1901. in prison Dietrich passed on
          Lamm's techniques. His brightest student in 1933 is..'ohn
          Herbert Dillinger.)

          DIETRICH + "THREAD" BOX
           arrive at a busy work station with Pierpont, Makley and Van
          Meter. Under spools are four Colt 45 automatics with loaded
          magazines.

          GUARD DAINARD
           is approached by Pierpont, who shoves the 45 in his face.

           PIERPONT
           Line up! Line up...
           Dietrich and Van Meter control THREE OTHER GUARDS. ED SHOUSE,
           JIM LESLIE and EARL ADAMS - three other Cons armed with
           makeshift clubs and spivs -- join the escape. Meanwhile...

          INT. GATEHOUSE - TURNKEY

          TURNKEY
          Didn't you get paroled out of here a few
          months ago?

          DILLINGER
          Yes, sir. Three months ago.

          TURNKEY
          . John... Johnnie Dillinger?

          DILLINGER
          That's right. But my friends call me
          "Johnnie". You gotta address me as
          "Mister" Dillinger.
          Dillinger's insubordination puzzles Turnkey so he doesn't see
          Hamilton bat a Thompson submachine gun across the back of his
          head and swing it onto the Two Guards...

          RED/DILLINGER
          Against the wall! Hands up! Get up!
          Dillinger's cuffs fell away. Now his Thompson covers the
          stunned pokerÂ°players. Hamilton and Dillinger are as tight as
          they come.- They share their food, money, liquor, ammunition
          and women. ,.id right now...

          YARD GATE
          is keyed open by Dainard followed by Pierpont and Makley and
          the others. Pierpont kicks over the poker table. Escapees
          throw all the Guards against the wall.

          MAKLEY/VAN METER
          (to the Guards)
          Undress. Get undressed!

          DILLINGER
          at the window checks the escape route to the Pontiac. Its
          clear.
          Hamilton conceals his weapon and starts out. Smooth. He
          crosses the front lawn, the street car tracks. So far, so
          good...

          INT. GATE HOUSE - GUARDS

          undress. One takes his time.

          SHOUSE

          This Guard gives Shouse an insolent look. Shouse slams the
          Guard's head with a length of steel pipe. Guard goes down.
          Shouse goes wild and continues to hammer his skull again and
          again, caving it in.

          PIERPONT
          Cut it out Shouse!

          DILLINGER
          (turns from open door)
          Shouse!I
          Dainard thinks that once the killing's begun, he will die...
          So, he grabs for Homer Van Meter's .45.
          Van Meter SHOOTS Dainard. Dainard's knocked to the floor.
          Blood pools. A SIREN SCREAMS.

          EXT. FRONT YARD - RED

          caught in the open, turns. He scans the guard towers on the
          East and West corners. He backs towards his Pontiac.

          the shots came from.

          DILLINGER

          ESCAPEES
          don't complete their disguises. Half-dressed in gua ds'
          uniforms, they crash outside...

          EXT. FRONT YARD - ESCAPEES

          sprint for the street in all directions.

          INT. WEST TOWER - TOWER GUARDS #1 + #2

          CRACK CRACK CRACK! Jim Leslie falls, the top of his head
          taken off.

          EXT. FRONT YARD - DILLINGER

          FIRES at the tower, forcing the Guards to cover. Hamilton's

           tumble in. Dillinger and Van Meter - outside - FIRE at the
          West Tower.

          PIERPONT + DIETRICH
          arrive.

          EXT. STREET - PONTIAC

          takes off. Dillinger's on the running board. His Thompson
          ROARS, covering Pierpont, who's hauling Dietrich into the
          backseat.

          BANG!
          Dietrich is hit in the neck by rifle FIRE from the East
          Tower.

          DILLINGER
          Walter!
          Dillinger falls away. Dillinger and Pierpont grab Walter's
          arms. He's-paralyzed now. They try to pull him onto the
          running boafd, of the moving car.
          Dietrich's"hcpeful eyes look up at them. Then his eyes glaze
          over. His feet drag down the street. He's dead and they know
          it. They let go.

          EXT. STREET - DIETRICH'S

          body remains in the center of the street. The Pontiac picks
          up speed.

          INT. PONTIAC - HAMILTON

          drives like he has no nerves. Totally focused. Hamilton is
          the best getaway, or "git" driver in the country.

          DILLIN GER' S
          Thompson empty, he grabs Red's shotgun. He shoves it into
          Shouse's chest in the backseat.

          DILLINGER
          Walter's dead 'cause you screwed it up,
          you son of a bitch!

          SHOUSE

          VAN METER
          Let him have it.

          PIERPONT
          Dietrich was your pal, up to you.
          Dillinger sees the abject fear in Shouse's eyes. And
          Dillinger's mood swings. He lowers the shotgun... Then, he
          snaps the butt across Shouse's face. Breaks Shouse's
          cheekbone. Dillinger pulls back and slams the heavy butt dead
          center, smashing Shouse's nose and orbital socket. Dillinger
          opens the door and kicks Shouse out of the moving car.

          EXT. FARM ROAD - SHOUSE

          bounces and rolls across the road into a field. The Pontiac
          races away into the distance.

          blasted house. And LANDS ON...
          JOHN DILLINGER in shirt sleeves and, a vest watchingthe roads
          for pursuit.

          INT. FARM HOUSE -- PIERPONT, MAKLEY + VAN METER

          change into double breasted suits and shovel down hot cereal
          at a kitchen table. They're in a rush. There is no ;Â£yurniture.
          A busted-out farmer, EDWIN NORRIS, hurriedly pours coffee
          from a kettle into tin mugs and a thermos. A WOMAN at a stove
          fries eggs.

          PIERPONT
          (ready to go)
          okay...?

          EXT. FARM -- A TODDLER

          wearing a torn smock approaches the Pontiac and a second car,
          a dust-covered Plymouth parked behind it.

          HAMILTON
          (from the house)
          Johnny...? Ready.

          THE WOMAN
           brings out the dozen fried egg sandwiches wrapped in
          newspaper. She looks 40 but is 20. Edwin Norris is at the
          door.

          DILLINGER
          (takes two)
          Thank you, ma'am.
          Dillinger's lopsided smile is charming.

          EDWIN NORRIS
          Its Miss. She's my daughter, Viola.
          That'll be eight dollars.
          Viola retrieves her toddler brother who's crawled into the
          Pontiac. Dellinger peels off a $20 bill.

          EDWIN NORRIS (CONT'D)
          Can't change that...

           DILLINGER
           Well, then you keep the change.
          $12 is a lot'--'of money in 1933. Grateful, Norris goes inside,
           Dillinger passes Viola and the struggling toddler on the way
          to the Pontiac,

          VIOLA

          (LOW)
          Take me with you, mister.
          She puts a hand on his forearm.

          DILLINGER
          I'm sorry, honey.
           Pierpont, Homer and Makley head towards the Plymouth.

          INT. PONTIAC - DILLINGER,

          as the Pontiac pulls away, looks back to see Viola wistfully
          watching them leave. The toddler reaches for Viola's hand.
          She pushes the child away. Dellinger hates seeing the kid
          rejected.

          HAMILTON
          Kid didn't fool with anything, did he?
          Dillinger, looking back at the boy, hasn't heard.

          Dillinger lifts the coats on the backseat: their weapons are
          as they were.

          DILLINGER
          Its all here.

          (UPBEAT)
          Let's go make some money.
          The speeding cars throw up tails of dust as they drive west

          moves quickly through the woods. They run downhill. He wears
          expensive hunting clothes. He carries an 8mm Mauser sports
          rifle with a slim forestock and wrist and a turned-down bolt
           handle. It's the best rifle made in 1933.

          HE IS MELVIN PURVIS (30)
          cleancut and handsome. A square jaw. Chester Gould modelled
          Dick Tracy's profile after Purvis. Has not big, but he's
          tenacious. He's an incarnation of the social elite of h.is
          time: white, Southern patrician and a Christian gentleman.
           With Purvis are Special Agents WARREN BARTON (31) and
          Purvis's friend CARTER DAUM (29)
          They have a harder time in the steep woods. They're chasing
          someone. They are guided by East Liverpool police chief,

          FULTZ.

          BOTTOM OF THE HILL -- PRETTY BOY FLOYD ( 29)
          is a big-boned country boy. His blue suit is mud-streaked
          from his slide down the hill. He carries a Thompson
          submachine-gun with a drum magazine, and he is running for
          his life.

          PURV I S , FULTZ, BAUM + BARTON

          of apple trees. Floyd's three hundred yards ahead. He zigzags
          for a deeper forest at the far end. If he can reach it, he
          has a chance.

          PURVIS
          breaks into the clear.

          PURVIS
          Floyd! Halt!
          Purvis aims the Mauser. Perfect form. Floyd zigzags. Purvis
          FIRES, misses. Floyd opens up with the Thompson -- wildly at
          that range.
           A few .45s splinter nearby branches. Fultz, Baum and Barton
           seek cover: Purvis works the bolt and chambers another round.
          Floyd is 10 yards from the forest.
          Purvis kneels onto his right knee. On his upraised left knee
          he braces hi left elbow. He inhales. Starts a smooth
          squeeze. Ha Tway through the exhale he FIRES. Floyd's right
          arm flies up. He's punched forward and crashes to the ground.

          FLOYD
          regains consciousness. Purvis is running in. Floyd`s left
          hand pulls a 45.

          BAUM
          Look out, Melvin!
          Purvis kicks the 45 out of his hand.

          PURVIS
          You are under arrest.
          Floyd sits up to see the massive exit wound. His right lung
          and liver are shot through. He falls back.

           ZARKOVIOH
           Johnny! How are ya?
          With him is ANNA SAGE, a 40 year old well-dressed madam. She
          kisses Johnny on the cheek.

          Good and so are you. Christmas is coming
          early this year.

          MCKELLAR
          (to Hoover)
          Why do we need this?

          HOOVER
          Because of the new breed of mobile
          outlaws who flee jurisdiction by crossing
          state lines over highways and against
          whom this government must wage a war on
          crime.
          J. EDGAR HOOVER is a physically short man but has a dynamic
          presence. He is a dapper patrician who believes in elites. He
          is completely free from self-doubt. He is youthful and 33
          years old.
          SUYDAM and TOLSON sit next to him.
          MCKELLAR iï¿½'Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Sub-
          Committee.-,He's an avuncular man of 62.

          MCKELLAR
          And so in the middle of a Great
          Depression you're looking for a budget
          increase to build up your Department? But
          by my tally your Department of
          Investigation spends more taxpayer's
          dollars catching crooks than what the
          crooks you catch stole in the first
          place...

          HOOVER
          That's ridiculous. The Bureau's
          apprehended kidnappers, bank robbers, who
          have stolen up to...

          MCKELLAR
          (looking at document)
          How many criminals you apprehended?

          HOOVER
          We've arrested and arraigned 213 wanted
          felons...

          Personally.

          HOOVER
          I've never arrested anybody.

          MCKELLAR

          You never arrested anybody?

          I'm an administrator.

          MCKELLAR

          For once Hoover is silent.

          MCKELLAR (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          In fact you are shockingly unqualified,
          aren't you, sir? You have never
          personally conducted a criminal
          investigation in the field in your life=
          Others in the room stare at Hoover. McKellar leans'-back...

          MCKELLAR (CONT Â° D )

          (CONTINUING)
          I think you are a front. I think your
          prowess as a lawman is a myth created
          from a hoopla of headlines by Mr. Suydam,
          your publicist there. You are trying to
          make a federal police force with you set
          up as its Czar. That is runnin' wild in
          my estimation...

          HOOVER
          Crime is what runs wild in this country,
          Mr. Chairman. And...

          MCKELLAR

          him...

          HOOVER
          (to Suydam)
          Find out: was he soft on the Reds in

          INT. BUICK - MAKLEY + PIERPONT

          are in. Dillinger and hostages load onto the running board.
          Pierpont grabs ANNA PATZKE's arm.

          PIERPONT
          C'mere, honey.
          Buick's moving faster. Dillinger pulls her onto the running
          board next--:o Boyard. The Buick roars away.

          INT. BUICK:.- RED

          drives with total concentration. Makley cooly reads the git.

          MAKLEY
          2 miles - turn left at the white barn.
           Right there. Now. 6 miles to the new
          bridge.
          Pierpont breaks out the rear window. He throws two five
          gallon milk jars full of roofing nails out into the road.
          They scatter.

          TWO POLICE CARS
          hit the nails, their tires blow. ROUNDS from the Buick finish
          dissuading them to pursue.

          INT. BUICK - HAMILTON

          approaches the bridge, slows.

          DILLINGER
          (to Boyard and two of the

          HOSTAGES)
          Okay. Beat it!

          Three hostages jump off. Dillinger pulls Anna Patzke and
          Weyland inside.

          DILLINGER
          sees Anna Patzke's shivering from shock and the cold. He puts
          his coat on her. He plops his hat on her head, too.

          DILLINGER (CONT'D)
          Something to remember me by.
          She laughs, nervously, and a little thrilled at being where
          she is...

          How 'bout it, honey? Can you cook?

          ANNA PATZKE
          (not disinterested)
          Uh. Sure... After a fashion.
          They start to hoot and laugh. They think this is hÂ±l iiou.s.

          ANNA PATZKE (CONT'D)
          Well, its true!

          VAN METER
          When I'm not doing this, I'm a scout for
          the movies.

          ANNA PATZKE
          Really?
          This makes them laugh even harder.

          EXT. THICK WOODS

          Pierpont has brought the hostages to a big tree.

          PIERPONT
          Face each other. Join hands.
          Pierpont binds them loosely to the tree.

          ten minutes.
          Anna looks over at Dellinger.

          DILLINGER (CONT'D)
          It's okay, doll. You're just gonna be a
          little late for dinner.
          Dillinger reaches over, snatches his hat off Anna Patzke's
          head. He leaves her his coat.

          THE BUICK WORK CAR
          is abandoned.

          watching a sexy young woman on the dance floor. He loses
          sight of her...
          He's expecting someone. Then, Dillinger sees her again: jet
          black hair in a bob, brown eyes, high cheekbones fom:her
          Indian mother and a great smile. She lights up a ro om. She is

          BILLIE FRECHETTE (27).
          She feels the stare and looks over. She studies him, then
          looks away.
          Dillinger's with Pierpont, Makley and Hamilton at a table. It
          is loaded with steaks, oysters, and frog legs.
          ALVIN KARPIS and Homer Van Meter approach and Alvin sits next
          to Johnnie... Dillinger adjusts his chair to watch for the
          girl. He's shoulder to shoulder to Karpis.

          DILLINGER
          Hiya, Alvin. You hungry? How's Freddie
          and Dock?
          (note: Alvin Karpis is cunning and careful. He will outlive
          everyone, including J. Edgar Hoover, and retire to
          Torremolinos, Spain, where he will die of heart failure in

          1979.
          Freddie and Dock Barker are the sons of Ma Barker. After the
          FBI gunned down the old woman, Hoover labeled her the "crime
          genius" of the family. According to Volney Davis, she

          We been looking to snatch two fellas.
          One's a St. Paul banker, Ed Bremer. Need
          a few more hands.

          DILLINGER
          Don't like kidnapping.

          KARPIS
          Robbing banks is getting tougher.

          DILLINGER
          The public don't like kidnappers.

          KARPIS
          Who gives a damn what the public likes?

          KARPIS
          Lawyer named Piquett. We all use him.

          DILLINGER

          million.

          KARPIS (CONT' D)
          Federal Reserve shipment. It runs only
          twice a month. This is the kind of score
          you go away on after.

          KARPIS
          Brazil. Cuba, maybe. What about you?

          They lock at each other: two pros at the top of their game.

          He's okay.

          DILLINGER
          Three rules I learned from Walter
          Dietrich. One: never work with people who
          are desperate. Two: never work with
          people who aren't the best. Three: never
          work when you're not ready.
          Billie reappears, dancing with a young man.

          HAMILTON
          Well, I got rule four: stay away from
          women.

          DILLINGER
          Without women, I might as well have
          `stayed in stir.
          Anna Sage approaches with a young girl for Red.

          HAMILTON
          What's why they invented whores.
          (getting up)
          Hamilton leaves, arms around the women. Dillinger keeps his
          eye on Billie. Music ends. Young man escorts her to her
          table. He tries to join her. She turns him down.
          Dillinger finishes his drink, approaches. He now sees how
          beautiful Billie is. She's 5 foot 5. With a straight erect
          build, she stands out in any crowd. She looks Dillinger
          straight in the eye. Clear skin, dark eyes with humor playing
          about the edges. He unexpectedly starts to feel nervous.
          He gives her his best grin.

          DILLINGER
          I don't know what you said to your
          friend, but I sure am glad you did.
          Billie looks him over: a well-made man in a good suit with a
          great smile. And, paradoxes: he easily talks to women but
          he's not a hustler. He's young, but there's a world of
          experience in his face. Open, but he's holding something
          back.

          Its easy. Follow me. This is a two-step.

          Don't look at my feet. Look at my
          shoulders.
          She stays an inch or two distant in his arms. Its slow and
          languorous. He follows her with little difficulty. He can

          Their lips are an inch apart. And then she rests her cheek on

          I feel like I know you.

          BILLIE
          Well, I haven't been any of the places
          you've been. So I don't even know what I
          don't know.

          DILLINGER
          Some of the places I been ain't so hot.
          Where I'm going is a lot better. Wanna
          come along?

          BILLIE
          Boy, you are in a hurry.

          DILLINGER
          If you were looking at what I am looking
          at, honey, you'd be in a hurry too.
          She laughs at his flattery, which she is also finding
          persuasive.

          (leans in)
          Well, its me they're looking at this
          time.

          DILLINGER
          That's 'cause you're beautiful.
          A blonde woman, elegant and ice cold, stares at Billie, a
          Depression-era child in her dress.

          BILLIE
          That's nice. But they're looking at me
          because they're not used to having a
          Menominee Indian girl in their restaurant
          in a three dollar dress.

          DILLINGER
          (takes her hand)
          Listen, doll, that's 'cause they're all
          about where people come from. Only thing
          important is where somebody's going.

          BILLIE
          Where are you going?

          DILLINGER
          To the top.
          He's irresistible.

          DILLINGER (COIN' D)
          Let's get out of here.
          Beat. She nods. They get up, get their things.
          On their way...a man intercepts Dillinger. He is GILBERT
          CATENA (42), solid with big hands. He's smiling.

          CATENA

          (WHISPERED)
          Hey Johnny...:
          Dillinger reacts, changes down, says coldly...

          DILLINGER
          (to Billie)
          Go wait outside. I'll be right there.
          Billie turns and walks out of the restaurant.

          DILLINGER (CONT'D)
          How you been, Gil?

          CATENA
          Real good. I work for Mr. Nitti now. Been
          with him since I got out of Michigan...
          Catena indicates FRANK NITTI (47) in a group at a table.
          Sober and educated, Nitti glances in their direction but has
          no interest.

          DILLINGER
          Looks like a barber.

          CATENA
          Don't go by looks.

          (BEAT)
          He's real smart. We're connected to
          everybody all over the country now...
          From Nitti's table a man gets up and walks straight towards
          Dillinger. He is PHIL D'ANDREA. Two heavy duty bodyguards are
          with him. Dillinger unbuttons his jacket. But...

          D'ANDREA
          (smiles, low)
          Everytime I read about one of your jobs,
          where you give people back their money,
          'You crack me up...

          (LAUGHS)
          Ypu need anything, Gilbert knows how to
          find me.
          D'Andrea continues to the men's room.

          DILLINGER
          See you. Gilbert...

          CATENA
          Good luck Johnnie.

          comes out onto the sidewalk. Billie isn't there. He searches

          Don't matter. It's a work. car.

          We think that's Dillinger's voice.

          PURVIS
          How did we find Berman?

          BAUM
          Dillinger's coat was bought in Cicero,
          Illinois, a few doors from Berman's
          dealership. Berman supplies cars to the
          syndicate. Since Capone. Dillinger must
          have been at Berman's switching cars when
          he bought that coat.

          (BEAT)
          Soon as they call to switch out the next
          car, we will tail them. Right to
          Dillinger.

          May I check your coat, sir?

          DILLINGER
          No, honey. You go get your coat.
          She looks up. So does May. May flashes Billie a look: if you
          don't want him, I do.

          MAY MINCZELES
          Sounds good to me.
          Dillinger has eyes only for Billie.

          DILLINGER
          You ran out on me.

          BILLIE
          `you left me standing alone on the
          sidewalk.

          swear you'll never do that again.

          Brown overcoat.

          BILLIE
          (ignoring customer)
          I am not your girl and I'm not going to
          say that.

          So am I.

          DILLINGER.

          that's a promise.

          CUSTOMER
          Well, I want to run out of here. So,
          lady, will you get my coat...?
          Dillinger lifts the man two feet off the floor and slams him
          into the wall. Real jailhouse rage. The lethally cold eyes
          tells the customer everything he needs to know. Dillinger
          swings him to the counter, grabs the man's ticket, slams thru
          the half door, finds the man's coat, tosses it at him...

          DILLINGER
          Keep the tip.
          (to Billie)
          You ain't getting other people's hats and
          coats no more either.
          He takes her coat and holds it for her. She doesn't move.

          BILLIE
          No one's ever done that for me before.

          DILLINGER
          You're with me now.

          BILLIE
          I don't know anything about you.

          DILLINGER
          I was raised on a farm in Mooresville,
          Indiana. My ma died when I was three. My
          daddy beat the hell out of me because he
          didn't know no better way to raise me. I
          used to do dumb things but I'm a lot
          smarter now. I like baseball, movies,
          good clothes, fast cars, and you. What
          else do you need to know?
          She gets into her coat. Dillinger opens the door for her.

          BILLIE
          You been living here long?

          DILLINGER
          Yeah. Since yesterday.
          From a back bedroom (Red's) a phonograph is louder as a door
          opens and Red enters the kitchen in a robe for a drink. He
          returns. Laughter. Dillinger has the boxes and drinks.

          DILLINGER (CONT'D)
          I got something for you.

          (BEAT)
          What's wrong? Open it up.
          Billie opens the boxes. She lifts out a sleeveless dress in
          dusty pink. It is beautiful. She is very touched. The second
          has a coat with a fur color. But still...

          BILLIE
          I'm drinking in a man's apartment who

          We`rob banks `cause banks is where they
          keep the money. I can make 500 dollars in
          a year or I can make ten thousand dollars
          in a morning. I'll take my chances on the
          bank. No apologies. We don't go lookin'
          to hurt anybody. But if somebody gets in
          our way, that's gotta be their problem.
          That what you want to know?

          Dillinger is an uninhibited and enthusiastic lover. They
          pause.
          He falls over onto his back and pulls her onto his chest and
          they look up out the window through the upside down elm trees
          to the Chicago moon in the cold sky.

          She sees suitcases that are packed, ready to leave in a

          She stands next to him in the bed now. He pulls her down next
          to him.. She turns her good ear towards him.

          What's wrong with the other ear?

          BILLIE
          I was married once. He was too handy with
          his fists.
          She stares at Dillinger. Will this put him off.

          Where's he now?

          BILLIE
          In prison. I divorced him. Only mistake I

          went around to churches and put on plays
          like "Little Fireface." And nothing
          exciting ever happened to me there,
          either. So I haven't been anywhere or
          done anything in my whole life except
          come to Chicago and try to make my way.

          Well baby-you're going to start a new
          and exciting kind of life from right now.
          And as they're pulled to each other and start making love

          heat do you want?

          DILLINGER

          That's not what she meant, but gently, he rolls her over on

          Purvis leaves. Barton wants to do it right. Then, he hears
          movement from Apt. 302. Objects being hurriedly shifted. He
          starts back down the hallway. Halfway between it and the
          elevator...

          PING!
          Behind him, the elevator doors open. Barton turns hi.,,back on

          Purvis does not know what to do. Then Barton's eyes drift

          quickly cross the alley from the back stairs to the Desoto.
          And Nelson immediately lays down rounds in careful short
          BLASTS of full auto. Tommy Carroll calmly, smoothly starts
          the DeSoto. Nelson's barrage punches into the wall, drives
          Daum to cover.

          INT. SHERONE APARTMENTS - PURVIS

          slams open a window. The DeSoto accelerates out of the alley.
          Purvis FIRES a few rounds. Baum FIRES his pistol. Both are

          gone.

          They are --

          CHARLES WINSTEAD, CLARENCE HURT + GERRY CAMPBELL
          Stiff from the journey, they stretch, take in the crowd.
          Winstead is in his mid 40s, 5 foot 8, body out of steel
          cable. Hurt is in his late 30s. These men are ex-Texas
          Rangers. Unlike flashier Texan lawmen of the period, they do
          not wear Western wear unless they're on a horse. That's for
          drugstore cowboys out to impress Easterners. They wear dark
          suits and ties and hats. They have "special qualifications."

          WINSTEAD
          What'd he say he looked like?

          HURT
          Didn't say.
          Their suitcases have been set on the platform. A PORTER

          Dillinger has on sunglasses. Billie is wearing a straw hat.
          They are shouting to the greyhounds along with Pierpont,

          Dillinger is surprised that her expectations are so low. She

          DILLINGER
          Get dressed. Right now.
          He turns and runs into...

          INT. ROOM 323

          He's pulling a Tommy Gun out of his case when

          CRASH!
          THREE MEN burst in. One is the Clerk. He cracks Dillinger
          across the head with the stock of his shotgun.
          Dillinger falls to his knees. Clerk hits him twice more.
          Billie rushes into the room.. She's naked. The two men from
          the street haul Dillinger, bloody and semi-conscious, to his
          feet and throw him against the wall and cuff him.

          CLERK/EYMAN

          in their suits and ties are there, too. They lounge at ease.
          A Tucson Deputy gives them coffee. Eye contact with
          Dillinger.
          But Dillinger reacts to Purvis.

          Well, the man who killed Pretty Boy
          Floyd. He might have been "Pretty,"
          'cause he sure was not "Whiz Kid Floyd."
          Deputies stifle laughter. Dillinger comes up close to Purvis.
          They are eyeball to eyeball. Only the bars separate them.

          Newspaper said you found him alive. It's

          right before they go. Then they drift
          into nothing. Keep you up nights.

          PURVIS
          What keeps you up, nights, Mr. Dillinger?
          Now Dillinger reads him like an X-ray.

          DILLINGER

          You act like a confident man, Purvis. Bu _,

          You're probably okay when there's a groupÂ°

          Purvis has nothing to say. He stares at Dillinger. Then he
          turns to leave.

          PURVIS
          Goodbye, Mr. Dillinger.

          That's Sheriff Lillian Holley's personal
          car.
          That even more highly recommends it. Dillinger starts ripping
          ignition wires out of the other cars. Dillinger, Youngblood,
          Deputy Sheriff Blunk, and Saager are herded into the
          Sheriff's Ford V-8.

          blood gushes from his head. He appears to be dead. Dillinger
          leaves him.
          Sixteen year old, JOE PAWLOWSKI -- fueled by adrenaline, runs
          across the street and jumps onto Nelson's back. Nelson,

          T h e bullet entered the back of his head.
          It is resting over his right eye. His

          FIRE only on windows from which they see muzzle flashes.

          INT. DILLINGER'S ROOM - DILLINGER + HAMILTON

          at Dillinger's window, exchange furious fire with Rice and
          Rorer at the side of the lodge, forcing them back behind out
          buildings. Splinters fly. Glass shatters. Gunsmoke is thick.

          EXT. LITTLE BOHEMIA, BARROOM - NELSON, SHOUSE + VAN METER

          fire back, forcing Purvis to cover.

          PURVIS
          Where the hell is Cowley?
          Purvis - low - runs to the Chevrolet, opens the door. The
          driver and one passenger are dead. A middle aged, unarmed man
          steps out. Bullets zing around him. He promptly sits down on
          the ground.,, dead drunk. These are not Public Enemies.

          THE TEXANS
          UNLOAD only on real targets. Bullets CUT through the trees.

          SHADOWY FIGURE
          darts from a side door and leaps over the porch FIRING a
          Tommy gun. Bullets strike the trees around Purvis.

          BAUM
          Someone got out!

          PURVIS
          Is it Dillinger?

          BAUM
          I think so.

          PURVIS
          See if you can head him off. Go!
          Purvis runs into the woods after the fleeing figure. Carter
          Baum races off in a car.

          INT. LITTLE BOHEMIA, SECOND STORY - ROOF - DARK NIGHT

          Bullets TEAR into the wooden walls. Two Men jump out of a
          back window, not clear who they are... Its chaos.

          EXT. LITTLE BOHEMIA - THE TWO MEN

          sprint down wooden steps to the beach, turn LEFT and run
          along the lake behind the lodge, trading SHOTS with Rorer and
          Rice. Rice is hit in the leg and cartwheels forward. Rorer
          stays with him.

          NOW WE SEE THIS IS DILLINGER
          running but impeded by his shoulder wound. Hamilton helps
          him. In the background, we SEE Van Meter and Shouse have also
          bailed out of the house for the beach but disappear into
          woods to the RIGHT.

          DILLINGER + HAMILTON
          run along the line of the lake, but in woods now.

          WINSTEAD
          runs through trees parallel to them but further away from the
          water. He catches sight of two figures through the :trees
          playing against the water from 100 yards away.

          DILLINGER + HAMILTON
          move fast. Not much brush to slow them. Dillinger senses,
          reacts...

          HARD CHARGING WINSTEAD,
          from 50 yards FIRES his pump-action 10 gauge shotgun FOUR

          TIMES.

          DILLINGER + RED
          in a burst of speed, cover behind heavier trees, which are
          cratered by the heavy shot. And Dillinger, never stopping,
          out the other side, is FIRING his Thompson at Winstead as.

          Winstead should be...

          DILLINGER'S POV: NOTHING
          Winstead's gone. And Dillinger knows the level of play has
          been raised by the addition of whoever these men are. As he
          and Red race across the ravine for the high ground
          advantage...

          HURT FIRES
          Hamilton's legs give way. Dillinger hauls him up, still on
          run...

          DILLINGER
          You hit, Red?

          HAMILTON
          I don't think so.
          Dillinger looks at Red's shirt. A blood stain blooms just
          above his belt. It's bad.

          DILLINGER
          Come on, Red. We can make it.

          tumbles down the bank onto the road. Nelson flags it down an

          Did they think Nelson's an agent?

          hears distant shooting. He races for the road.

          EXT. ROAD -- BAUM

          twists, turns, fires a handgun, misses. Nelson FIRES again.
          Three slugs tear into Baum's neck.
          Baum topples over a white fence, lands on his face. Nelson
          shoots Baum again.

          Purvis spills down through trees. He FIRES, ineffectually at

          BAUM
          (barely audible whisper)
          Nelson.
          Baum's eyes roll back in his head.
          Purvis runs after the car. He dives through the woods to cut
          it off at a turn in the road.

          EXT. HOUSE - A CAR

          is outside. A man's on the porch, having reacted to gunshots.

          DILLINGER

          He tosses them. Dellinger already has Red inside, starts it

          smokes a cigarette in front of a ribbon microphone. The smoke
          curls into the air. His commentary is intimate and folksy.

          WILL ROGERS
          (into ribbon microphone)
          Well, they said they were going to get
          Public Enemy #1. And they had John
          Dillinger surrounded... They was all
          ready to shoot him as soon as he came
          out. But a bunch of folks came out ahead,
          so they shot all them instead.

          EVE
          drive carefully, south on Clark St. Sidewalks are filled with
          revelers and crowds.

          WILL ROGERS(O.S.)
          They will get Dillinger someday. Probably
          when he's with a group of innocent
          bystanders they're shooting down, and
          he'll get killed by accident...

          (PAUSE)
          Meanwhile, President Roosevelt got
          Congress to pass a second crime Bill...

          WILL ROGERS(O.S.)
          .which the example of Public Enemy
          Number One has helped push through
          Congress. It will make all criminal
          enterprise across state lines a federal
          crime...
          Nitti's hand picks up a telephone and dials. He puts the
          earpiece next to his ear. And he blows up.

          head south out of downtown on Michigan Blvd. A blast of horns
          declares the death of 1933 and the birth of 1934.

          INT. TELEPHONE COMPANY EXCHANGE- PURVIS - NEW YEAR'S EVE -

          enters. They've got 15 recorders, now. It's a rat's nest of
          cloth-insulated wiring. Most of the listening stations are
          abandoned.

          PURVIS SEES: AGENT MADALA
          with headphones noting a conversation on a steno pad. Two
          stenographers are still around. Each machine is labeled.

          Purvis leaves.

          INT. PURVIS'S APARTMENT OFF MICHIGAN AVENUE - PURVIS - NIGHT

          lets himself in. He's alone. "Auld Lang Syne" is heard in the
          streets below. The apartment is dark. He stands for a moment,
          letting the darkness wash over him. He allows himself one
          shot of Bourbon. He moves to the large window overlooking the
          city. He goes out onto the balcony in the cold air.- He sees
          the sparkling lights, the traffic, the couples, the-revelers,
          the relaxed celebration. Horns blow. Cheering can be heard
          across the city. He is alone. It is 1934 in Chicago. He downs
          the shot of bourbon.

          EXT. ROAD THRU DUNES - DILLINGER + BILLIE - NIGHT

          drive across the southern tip of Lake Michigan in te`Indiana
          dunes. Dunes are lit by the silver moonlight. Her head is on
          his shoulder. She loosely holds his arm. She drifted asleep.
          Now she wakes. She realizes it is New Year's Day.

          DILLINGER
          Happy New Year, doll.

          BILLIE
          Happy New Year, baby.
          He looks at her. Its a concerned look. She reads his mind.

          BILLIE (CONT`D)
          Johnny. I'd rather live on the run with
          you, than live any other way.
          That says it all. They are both quiet for a long beat.

          DILLINGER
          For how long?

          However long.

          DILLINGER
          Next week? Next year? Alvin said this
          wasn't gonna last. He was right. The
          world has turned. Everything's different.

          (BEAT)
          And there's a sweet score. Enough money
          to go away and stay away for a long time.

          (BEAT)
          So whattya say we lit out of here? Lit
          out of here, altogether.

          BILLIE
          glows to the prospect. For the first time there's a tangible
          future.

          BILLIE
          Cuba?

          DILLINGER
          Too close. How about we fly to Caracas
          and then to Rio on Pan Am. Then an
          oanliner to Manila or Singapore. We are
          f6reign-looking to them. So they will
          ,have no idea who the hell we are. We can
          go out dancing all night and have a lotta
          laughs anytime we want...

          BILLIE
          I think that's a great idea!
           They drive on into the pre-dawn of the year 1934.

          EXT. DILLINGER FARM (MOORESVILLE, INDIANA) - SOMEHOW JOHN


          DILLINGER - DAY
          sits in plain view on a chair. His Thompson rests against the
          wall. His sister, Audrey, is giving him a haircut. His
          father, John Wilson Dillinger, drinks coffee next to him. The
          January sunlight is so direct, it's like Spring.

          DILLINGER
          Not too short on the sides.

          BILLIE
          comes out the door. Dillinger's niece comes up with a Kodak
          Brownie.

          Can we take a picture?

          DILLINGER
          Of course.
          (to nephew, approaching)
          You got an eye on those federal boys?

          NEPHEW
          Yes sir. They're over having breakfast at
          Myra's Diner. They've been hanging
          around, here, doing nothing for so long,
          they just know this is the last place
          you're going to show...

          CLOSER: BILLIE
           watches Johnny. This is who he would be if he had not had the
           troubles in this life, a charismatic young man.

          EXT. FIELD - BILLIE + DILLINGER SR. - LATER

          walk through winter wheat.

          BILLIE
          That how he was when he was a boy?
          Carefree and laughing...?

          JOHN SR.
          Not right when his mother died. But afterâ-
          awhile, yes.

          BILLIE
          You love him, don't you?
          She touches his arm. He looks back at the house.

          JOHN SR.
          He grew up a motherless child... After he
          was there he never had a woman's comfort.
          So I loved him but didn't know how to
          raise him. And that's the truth.

          (PAUSE)
          When he come out of that prison, he had
          so many worries. Restless. Bitter. He had
          a desire to get even.
          A covey of quail flush out of the wheat.

          JOHN SR. (CONT'D)
          Well, now he has gotten even. And he has
          seen the country. And he has you. So, he
          is carefree.

          (knows more)
          Well, if it goes okay, good. Whatever
          happens, he has been my boy. And I have
          loved him in my heart, always. Right or
          wrong, no matter what.
          He is as straight and truthful as the land is flat. She takes
          his hand and they walk through the fields.

          gives her an envelope.

           DILLINGER (CONT'D)

          pulls to the curb on the east side of the street. Billie gets
          out, walks through the crowds, down the sidewalk and crosses
          the street to the bar. MOVE IN on the sign. This is the
          location we saw being tapped at the Telephone Exchange.

          OVER DILLINGER'S SHOULDER
          watching the distant front of the tavern into which Billie

          .hauled towards a Bureau car by Reinecke. He tips her off

          Dillinger sees all this.

          DILLINGER
          can do nothing. Tears of frustrated rage stream down his
          face. Later, he would say he "cried like a baby."

          INT. BANKER'S BUILDING - BILLIE - NIGHT

          under a bare lightbulb.

          REINECKE
          If you tell us all about him, maybe
          you'll get a break. Maybe you end up
          doing a couple of months on a work farm.,
          like a girls' home or something.

          ANOTHER AGENT
          Where is he? Where were you meeting?
          Where were you hiding out?

          awake.

          REINECKE (CONT'D)

          Where is he?!
          Billie startles! CLOSER on her chair.

          BILLIE
          I have to...
          He kicks the chair again. She's being denied a toilet. The
          humiliation is part of the pressure. Billie's embarrassed.
          Billie urinates on the chair now and the floor. Another Agent
          makes a face...

          OTHER AGENT

          its one of theirs.

          REVERSE: THE APARTMENT INTERIOR
          It is dead empty. Reinecke looks at the dust on the floor. No
          one's been here for a month.

          CUT TO:

          INT. CELL - PROBASCO

          in a metal chair, hands at his side handcuffed to the floor.
          He shouts. A large man slams him across the abdomen with a
          lead-filled sap. Another agent waits indifferently.

          PURVIS POV: LIANE HAMILTON
          Hamilton's sister, 17, stares vacantly from the corner.
          Bruised, filthy, dress ripped, she's among a sordid group of
          30 older women: tough hookers, drunks, a couple of tough
          dykes in men's lace-up boots. Liane catches Purvis' eyes.
          He walks on...

          INT. B OF I OFFICE, INTERROGATION ROOM - REINECKE'S

          furious. He walks up to Billie, handcuffed, and slaps her
          across the face, two, three times. Hard. Her ear, her nose
          bleeds. He almost knocks her out.

          REINECKE
          Where is he!

          BILLIE
          (low voice)
          Well...
          (rising strength)
          he's way the hell away from here by
          ,Tow, isn't he?
          She looks up at him. And she drops the little girl act. She
          sent them on a wild goose chase to give her man time to get
          away.

          BILLIE (CONT'D)

          (CALM)
          You wanted to know where he is, you dumb
          flatfoot? You were too scared to look
          around. You walked right past him on
          State Street. He was at the curb in that
          black Hudson.

          (BEAT)
          You asked me "how I got there?" I told
          you I took a taxi. And you believed me?

          (LAUGHS)
          He dropped me off and was waiting for me.
          And you walked right past him.
          He's furious. Her Native American beauty doesn't soften
          Reinecke. He visualizes smashing the bones in her face with
          his fist.

          Bad idea.

          PURVIS
          Uncuff her.
          Reinecke tries to pull away. He can't. The smaller man is
          built of steel cable.

          Purvis doesn't hesitate. He picks her up in his arms and
          carries her through the office to the restroom in the
          corridor. She puts her hand over her eyes in embarrassment.

          Don't try and break me out. I am too well

          shaves. His watch is open in front of him. In the inside of
          the case is a picture of Billie. He washes the soap from his
          face. He looks at her...

          INT. BEDROOM - A LOCKED CASE

           Opens. From it Dillinger pockets a Colt 380 automatic and
          loads $3,000 into a moneybelt from rubber-banded bundles and
          puts it around his waist.

          INT. CAR: VIS

          down the street in a parked car.
          In the driver's seat is Reinecke. He's tense, trying to stay
          calm. On his upper lip sweat beads. Does he remember the
          words of Billie about what Dillinger would do to him?

          CU: PURVIS
          watches the crowds thin as showtime nears. He gets out of the
          car. Is Dillinger a no-show? Another failure? Another
          eviscerating memo from Hoover?
          THREE FIGURES BRUSH PAST HIM. A woman's orange skirt. Its
          Anna Sage, Polly Hamilton, and John Dillinger. They sweep to
          the ticket booth, pay, and join latecomers rushing inside so
          that they don't miss the start of the movie.

          PURVIS
          is stunned. Dillinger passed three feet from him.

          INT. THEATER

          It's packed. Anna Sage had to sit separately on the aisle
          some rows back.

          it started about 3 minutes ago so that
          means it will all be over in an hour,

          Purvis turns away. Agent Brown whispers in his ear...

          AGENT BROWN
          They're on their way over here from the
          Marbro.

          INT. THEATER -- DILLINGER + POLLY

          absorbed in the movie.
          ON SCREEN: District Attorney (William Powell) listens to his
           secretary. She is against her boss inviting gangster Blackie
          Gallagher (Clark Gable), his childhood friend, to his
          wedding...

          SECRETARY
          Remember what happened to that District
          Attorney in the Midwest. Just for having
          his picture taken with some gangster...?,
          The movie is referring to John Di.llinger's Crown Point photo
          session with his arm around Prosecutor Robert Estill.

          DILLINGER
          laughs out loud. The irony is that the gangster who inspired
          this Hollywood moment is sitting right here watching this
          movie.

          JOHN DILLINGER. LOOKING UP AT THE SCREEN.
          In this Hollywood version of life, the power of cause and
          effect operates on the end, as inescapably as gravity. It's a
          core truth. This is the only end for Blackie Gallagher. And
          its as true for john Dillinger in his life as it is for
          Gallagher. Actions and historical forces have made his time
          be up.
          Dillinger SLOWS the flickering images. His concentration
          slices time into component parts. Gable exchanges last good-
          byes. He warns his D.A. friend, Ronald Coleman, not to
          commute his sentence. The images play on Dillinger's face.
          They take him over-alone in the packed theater while 25
          Federal Agents and five East Chicago cops wait outside.

          theory. This is the beast. The beast is a gunfighter. The
          beast is better than you. You beat-up his girl. Your shot

          PURVIS
          H--halt!

          DILLINGER
          sees all of them RIGHT NOW. He pushes the .380 in SLOWED TIME
           towards Purvis.. .and bumps into a pedestrian named Ella
          Natasky.

          ELLA NATASKY
          starts to fall. Dillinger turns his attention to her for a
          millisecond. He's a gentleman. His impulse is to reach for
          her to steady her...

          CHARLES WINSTEAD
          shoves aside the paralyzed Reinecke, pushes past Purvis,
          leans forward and shoots John Dillinger in the back of the
          head. The heavy 45 round punches through Dillinger's,brain
          stem and exits underneath his right eye.
          John Dillinger stumbles into the alley opening and starts to
          fall. A second shot from Winstead and two more from Clarence
          Hurt hit him now. They don't matter.

          JOHN DILLINGER
          falls through the air.

          EXTREMELY CLOSE ACROSS THE COBBLESTONES: JOHN DILLINGER'S

          FACE
          crashes into the FRAME. One lens of his eyeglasses breaks.
          The brim of his straw hat snaps. The hat falls away. He
          struggles, but can't move. He breathes. He tries to speak..

          WINSTEAD
          stands over him. Purvis snatches the .380 automatic out of

          Cover his face and keep the damn
          photographers away.

          AERIAL: LINCOLN AVENUE
          Purvis starts away and we SEE the Biograph marquee, the
          trolley tracks in the cobblestone street, the alley, and the
          hundreds of people moving towards the locus of the dead John
          Dillinger.

          INT. CANAL STREET DRY CLEANERS (NEW ORLEANS) - HOOVER -


          ANOTHER DAY
          watches Tolson who is at the window. Tolson gets a sign.
          Hoover straightens his collar. He brushes lint off his pants
          leg. Tolson waits. Hoover waits.

          EXT. CANAL STREET HOTEL - DOOR

          opens. Alvin Karpis comes out. In the hot, humid New Orleans
          air, his suit coat is off...he carries it under his arm. He
          crosses the street towards his Lincoln Coupe. His eyes land
          on a man on a bench across the street looking at him over a
          newspaper. And while crossing the street, Alvin slows down.

          THE MAN IS CHARLES WINSTEAD
          The newspaper hides a sawn-off, 10 gauge Winchester lever
          action shotgun.

          ALVIN LOOKS TO HIS LEFT: CLARENCE HURT
          leans on a lamp post. His body hides a 351 Winchester rifle.

          NOW ALVIN KARPIS
          freezes. He doesn't hesitate. He opens his hands to
          demonstrate he is holding nothing and lets his jacket; fall to
          the ground. He knows instantly who they are and that.,,they
          intend to kill him. Karpis' eyes dart to the roofto isÂ°.
          Snipers on both. In this instant, Karpis knows he is done.
          One objective races into his mind: stay alive.

          KARPIS'
          stretches out his arms, wide. Winstead has dropped the
          newspaper. The sawed-off 10 gauge is aimed squarely at
          Alvin's chest. Karpis is displaying he is unarmed. Winstead
          approaches warily step-by-step. His weapon would cut Alvin in
          half. Clarence, the rifle at his shoulder, inches forward.
          The ex-Texas Ranger gunfighters with real trigger-time have
          taken Alvin Karpis.

          ALVIN KARPIS
          I am unarmed.

          WINSTEAD
          Don't even breathe sudden.

          WINSTEAD Â± CAMPBELL + HURT
          are 10 feet from him. Clarence pats him down. Karpis is
          clean.

          CONTINUED:
          The Texans cover Alvin and move him to the sidewalk near his
          car.

          HURT
          Put your hands on the roof of that
          Lincoln.
          (he does)
          Other agents come running in. Someone's yelling: We got him!
          We got him. Bring him in." While they wait...

          WINSTEAD
          Where you from?

          ALVIN KARPIS
          Canada, but mostly Chicago.
          (to both)
          You?

          WINSTEAD
          Fort Worth, thereabouts. Clarence is from
          Tyler.

          (PAUSE)
          Well, Alvin. You're a sly old dog. If
          ,you'd a even had that jacket on...
          A ring ofc tints with their revolvers out, now converge
          around Karpis.

          HURT
          (to Agent)
          Any handcuffs around here?
          They don't have any. They had not planned on needing them.
          One agent is excited. His gun pointed at Karpis shakes.

          AL V I N KARP I S
          Mind asking that man to...

          HURT
          (to Agent)
          Put that down.
          The agent drops his gun.

          EXT. STREET - HOOVER

           in his white suit and Tolson rush in from the dry cleaners
           where they were stashed. The agents part. They suddenly stand
          in front of Alvin Karpis. Hoover's 38 Chief Special is at
          his side.

          Tolson waves to an agent across the street.

          WIDE ON THE CORNER: REPORTERS + PHOTOGRAPHERS
          are now released and rush towards us.

          HOOVER
          regains his composure.

          HOOVER (CONT'D)
          I heard of your fishing prowess. i
          myself, always wanted, to catch a
          marlin...

          ALVIN KARPIS
          You're thinking of my partner, Harry
          Campbell.

          HOOVER
          Are you relieved its over? I'm sure you
          are.

          (PAUSE)
          You know you will feel much better once
          you get everything off your chest.

          (PAUSE)
          Why don't you tell me where Harry
          Campbell is?
          After a moment..

          ALVIN KARPIS
          Who do you think you're talking to?
          Hoover is silent.

          SPECIAL AGENT
          (to Winstead)
          There's no handcuffs.

          NEWSMEN
          Mr. Hoover! Director!

          HOOVER
          Karpis said he'd never be taken alive,
          but I took him without firing a shot.

          (BEAT)
          That marks him as a yellow rat. He was
          scared to death when I arrested him.

          (BEAT)
          That's all I got to say.
          Suydam and the special publicist, COURTNEY COOPER address the
          reporters.

          SUYDAM
          I'll answer any questions.

          REPORTER #1
          Mr. Hoover captured Karpis?

          SUYDAM
          Mr. Hoover personally placed Alvin Karpis
          = eier arrest today. Karpis reached for a
          rzf le, but the Director was too fast.

          INT. CLYDE TOLSON'S OUTER OFFICE - MELVIN PURVIS - DAY

          waits. It looks like he's been waiting for awhile. People who
          pass act as if he is invisible. They look right through him.

          TOLSON
          The Director will see you now.

          INT. HOOVER'S OFFICE - HOOVER - DAY

          Purvis stands in front of the desk. On the right of the desk
          is a plaster death mask of John Dillinger.

          HOOVER

          Agent Purvis.

          HOOVER (CONT'D)
          A medical student in the morgue made that
          cast of Dillinger's face. It's a reminder
          of the war we continue to wage against
          the punks and hoodlums...
          Purvis looks at Hoover. This was the golden boy who Hoover
          came to despise.

          PURVIS
          One thing I learned was that John
          Dillinger was an outlaw and my Adversary.
          But he was no punk. And he was no
          hoodlum.

          (BEAT)
          Another is that I have no future in your
          Bureau. And I don't desire one. I quit.
          Purvis tosses his badge on Hoover's desk and walks out.
          Hoover couldn't care less.

          INT. MILAN WOMEN'S PRISON - GRANITE WALL - DAY

          PAN LEFT and fall EXTREMELY CLOSELY onto the face of Charles
          Winstead. He waits.

          WIDER - WINSTEA.D
          is in an interview cell.

          INT. CELL BLOCK - TRACKING A WOMAN'S FEET

          in prison issue shoes down the cellblock corridor. ARM UP. It
          is Billie Frechette. She walks with two guards behind her.

          INT. INTERVIEW CELL - DOOR OPENS

          Billie enters. She's surprised to see Winstead.

          WINSTEAD
          How are you doing, Billie?

          BILLIE

          (SITS)
          If you come here to ask me more damned
          questions. "Where's this one or that one?
          Did I know Vern Miller? Who did what...?"
          Winstead shakes his head no.

          CONTINUED:

          WINSTEAD
          I didn't come here for you to tell me
          something. I came here to tell you
          something.

          CLOSER: BILLIE
          She sees in Winstead's face, the look of people she grew up
          with. Billie senses none of the cunning of the lawyer/special
          agents she's been dealing with. She leans forward, indicates
          a cigarette out of Winstead's pocket.
          He hands her one and lights it.

          BILLIE
          Okay, Mr. Winstead. What do you got to
          tell me?
          Winstead leans forward.

          BILLIE (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUOUS)
          They say you're the man who shot him?

          WINSTEAD
          'M'at's right. One of them.

          BILLIE
          6 why are you coming here to see me? To
          see the damage you done?

          WINSTEAD
          Because he asked me to.
          This gets Billie's attention and she looks more closely at
          Winstead.

          WINSTEAD (CONT'D)
          When he went down, he said something. And
          I put my ear next to his mouth and what I
          think he said was this. He said...

          (BEAT)
          " .tell Billie for me...Bye Bye
          Blackbird..."
          Billie has to rise and turn away from Winstead so that he
          doesn't see her overcome with emotion. Winstead knows this.
          It is the measure of this man that he respected the privacy
          of John Dillinger's message and only told her.
