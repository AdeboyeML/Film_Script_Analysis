                                                 SHOOTING DRAFT

               FADE IN

               ON BLACK SCREEN

                                     SPORTSCASTER'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         Allright, bowl bid ridin' here for 
                         E.S.U. Fourth down on the Georgia 
                         Tech 18. 4 ticks left. Kane sets 'em 
                         down.

                                                            INSTANT CUT TO:

               LINE OF TAPED KNUCKLES - NIGHT

               smashing into the mud, as a football OFFENSIVE LINE comes 
               set, frosted breath steaming across to:

               The DEFENSIVE LINE digging in, ready to explode.

               CLOSE ON JOE KANE

               E.S.U. quarterback, barking signals. The ball is snapped, 
               and we go to SLOW MOTION as the lines crash together in the 
               slop.

               Joe rolls to the right, looking downfield. A huge DEFENSIVE 
               END bears down on him. Joe jukes. The end whips on by, 
               grabbing for jersey, slipping off. But big NUMBER 75 is 
               closing the gap. On the run, Joe releases a desperation pass 
               toward the end zone, just as 75 catches him and buries him 
               face-down in the swamp.

               We FOLLOW THE BALL, spiraling through the slanting rain. RAY 
               GRIFFEN, black running back, glances back for it, two 
               DEFENSIVE BACKS with him. All three leap in unison, climbing 
               as high as they can, clutching, clawing for the ball. The 
               ball floats down, kisses off the tangle of fingers, splashes 
               to the ground, and rolls to a stop in the mud. Incomplete. 
               The BANG of the final gun snaps us back to LIVE ACTION.

               Joe on his knees in the muck, stares at the goal line, then 
               drops his head in defeat.

               ANGLE ON SAM WINTERS

               Betraying little emotion, Coach SAM WINTERS, wiry, intense, 
               early 50's, takes off his headset, lets it drop, heads across 
               the field.

                                     REPORTER #1 (V.O.)
                         Coach, this is the second year in a 
                         row you've failed to go to a bowl 
                         game. Do you feel your program's in 
                         decline?

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

               Coach Winters stands outside his office surrounded by 
               reporters, a bouquet of microphones stuck in his face.

                                     WINTERS
                              (keeping his cool)
                         No, we're just a young team on the 
                         verge. We'll be back in a major bowl 
                         next year.

               Elsewhere in the locker room, we pick up a weary, mud-
               splattered Joe Kane taking off his pads in front of his 
               locker. ALVIN MACK, black linebacker, comes by. Alvin exudes 
               danger; big, fast and hostile on the field, slightly surly, 
               a sense of repressed anger off it.

                                     ALVIN
                         Good throw, Joe. It was there.

                                     JOE
                         So was half their team.
                              (trailing off)
                         Shit, another Christmas at home.

                                     ALVIN
                         Next year, man. Next year we sell 
                         out. Next year we dominate.

               ON COACH WINTERS AGAIN

               still fielding questions.

                                     REPORTER #2
                         You still need a deep threat or a 
                         breakaway back to go with Joe Kane. 
                         What are you gonna do to address 
                         this need?

                                     COACH WINTERS
                              (a little edgy)
                         Stop wastin' my time talkin' to you 
                         guys for a start.

               As Winters gets up to go, we hear:

                                     WILSON (V.O.)
                         I'm not gonna lead you into the fog 
                         here, Sam...

               INT. CHANCELLOR WILSON'S OFFICE - DAY

               CHANCELLOR GRANT WILSON, 60, grey-haired eminence, sits behind 
               his desk. Seated across from him are Coach Winters and GALEN 
               HOWARD, 50, the Athletic Director.

                                     CHANCELLOR WILSON
                         I'm concerned about our Program. 
                         It's always been a source of pride 
                         to our students and alumni, but two 
                         straight so-so seasons are having a 
                         damaging effect on our fund-raising, 
                         both public and private.

                                     WINTERS
                              (half-joking)
                         Then stop raising the entrance 
                         requirements on me. We never could 
                         have gotten Alvin Mack in here under 
                         the new guidelines.

                                     CHANCELLOR WILSON
                         As Chancellor, my first responsibility 
                         is to the academic interests of this 
                         University.

               Wilson points to a representation of a football field affixed 
               to the wall. A football rests on the 40 yard line, which is 
               marked 160 million. The end zone (60 yards away) is 
               $400,000,000.

                                     WILSON
                         At a time when we're committed to a 
                         400 million dollar building program, 
                         alumni donations are down 15% the 
                         last two years. Because they've also 
                         voiced their displeasure to their 
                         legislators, we can expect a 
                         corresponding drop in state funds.

                                     HOWARD
                         The Athletic Fund is suffering too. 
                         Season tickets sales are off, 
                         merchandising's slow...

                                     WINTERS
                         You layin' all this at my door? 
                         There's been a recession on.

                                     CHANCELLOR WILSON
                         Yes, but the heaviest drop has been 
                         from the big donors, the 100,000 
                         dollar club. These people are 
                         recession proof. They sit in my box 
                         every game, and they're much more 
                         generous when we're ranked and going 
                         to bowl games. Two of them, as you 
                         know, are on the Board of Regents, 
                         including the Chairman.

                                     WINTERS
                         What are you trying to say to me, 
                         Grant? After 12 years, my job's in 
                         jeopardy?

                                     CHANCELLOR WILSON
                         I'm not prepared to discuss your job 
                         right now; I just want you to be 
                         aware of the situation. The alumni 
                         and the legislature are unhappy and 
                         they vote with their checkbooks. I 
                         don't pretend to be an expert on 
                         football, Sam, and I'll deny that 
                         this conversation ever took place, 
                         but I do know we need to win next 
                         year.

               INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - LATE AFTERNOON

               Coach Winters flanked by two assistant coaches, HUMES and 
               CLAYTON, walks down a cavernous tunnel beneath the stands to 
               a waiting car. At the end of the tunnel, a scarecrow EFFIGY 
               of Coach Winters hangs from an overhead pipe.

                                     CLAYTON
                              (ignoring the effigy)
                         Tickets are in your coat. Itinerary 
                         and player profiles are in your 
                         briefcase. We got a 9:00am tomorrow 
                         in Philly with this kid Darnell 
                         Jefferson.

               Coach Winters stops, looks up at the effigy. Humes and Clayton 
               fear an outburst, a display of rage.

                                     WINTERS
                         Looks like I've lost weight.

               That's it. He strides on. Humes and Clayton race to catch 
               up.

                                     CLAYTON
                         This kid's the gamebreaker we've 
                         been lookin' for.

               MUSIC STARTS. TITLES BEGIN.

               EXT. INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - EVENING

               A Boeing 737 roars into the night sky.

                                     COACH CLAYTON (V.O.)
                         Had a 108 yard kickoff return against 
                         Taft. Michigan's been down to see 
                         him twice.

               INT. ST. LUKE'S HOME FOR BOYS - MORNING

               Winters, Humes, Clayton and Joe Kane sit across from DARNELL 
               JEFFERSON and REVEREND WALLACE in a tattered parlor room. 
               Other boys of various ages and color look in from the 
               adjoining door. Darnell is black, good-looking, street-hip, 
               the letters D.J. shaved in block letters into his fade.

                                     WINTERS
                         Darnell, you have the potential to 
                         start for us as a freshman. That 108 
                         yard kickoff return you made against 
                         Taft? One of the greatest runs I've 
                         ever seen a high school player make. 
                         Now, Michigan is set at tailback for 
                         two years. You won't play till you're 
                         a junior. With Joe here gettin' you 
                         the ball, runnin' 28 Thunder right, 
                         you'll be All-American with us as a 
                         Sophomore.

                                     REVEREND WALLACE
                         Yes, but I'm really more concerned 
                         with Darnell's education. He came 
                         here late. He's got some catching up 
                         to do.

                                     WINTERS
                         Believe me, education is the first 
                         priority in our program. That's why 
                         all the players are smarter than me. 
                         After all, a football coach is smart 
                         enough to understand the game, but 
                         dumb enough to think it's important.

               This gets a little chuckle from the Reverend. It was intended 
               to.

               EXT. RURAL SOUTH CAROLINA TENANT FARM - DAY

               We see a run-down tenant SHACK on the edge of a large cotton 
               field.

               INT. TENANT SHACK - DAY

               Two rooms. Dirt floor. Two-foot Christmas tree on an apple 
               cart. Alvin Mack's MOTHER opens a Christmas present as Alvin 
               and his TWO SISTERS look on. It's an ENGRAVED LIONSHEAD 
               DOORKNOCKER, the kind you'de find on the door of an affluent 
               home. The inscription reads THE MACK'S. Alvin's mother thinks 
               it's beautiful, but isn't sure what to do with it.

                                     ALVIN'S MOTHER
                         It's real pretty, Alvin.

                                     ALVIN
                         When I turn pro, I'll get you the 
                         house to go with it.

               INT. COACH WINTERS' HOUSE - DAY

               Winters' daughter LOUANNE, 20, is on the phone with her 
               father. Louanne is sexy, clothes too tight, but good-natured, 
               somewhat needy and loyal as a labrador. She holds a hopelessly 
               out-of-style sweater her dad's given her for Christmas.

                                     LOUANNE
                              (lying)
                         It's real nice, Dad.

               INT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - DAY

               Winters sits on the bed, eating Chinese take-out, the phone 
               cradled in his neck, talking to Louanne.

                                     WINTERS
                         I knew you'de like it, Lou. Merry 
                         Christmas. Put some fresh flowers on 
                         your Mom's grave for me. I'll be 
                         home in a couple days.

               EXT. SMALL BRICK HOUSE - DAY

               Battered and old, in a declining Pennsylvania neighborhood, 
               hard by a STEEL WORKS.

               INT. SMALL BRICK HOUSE - DAY

               Joe sits on the couch with his older brother, FRANK, watching 
               the bowl game he would have been in, had E.S.U. won their 
               last game. His FATHER, a grizzled man in his fifties, nods 
               in and out in a tattered armchair. All three have been 
               drinking beer, their empties scattered around. Frank tosses 
               Joe an Iron City beer.

                                     FRANK
                         Have another Vitamin I, Joey. Didn't 
                         think we'de see you here this 
                         Christmas, little brother.

                                     JOE
                         You won't next year.

                                     JOE'S FATHER
                              (getting up)
                         Yeh, well we won't rent your place 
                         on the couch.

               As Joe's father heads for the kitchen, he hangs his empty 
               beer can, by the pull tab, on a branch of the Christmas tree. 
               We see that the whole tree is covered with cans.

               INT. PHILADELPHIA BOY'S HOME - NIGHT

               Darnell talks on a pay phone in the hall.

                                     DARNELL
                         You're from E.S.U?

                                     GIRL'S VOICE
                         Yeh. I was just sittin' here by the 
                         fire doin' my homework, and decided 
                         to give you a call. See how you're 
                         doin'.

               INT. OFFICE IN E.S.U. ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

               We see who Darnell is talking to: AUTUMN HALEY, beautiful 
               black girl, stylish, long straight hair, definitely not 
               street.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Coach Winters has been telling me 
                         about you. I'm looking forward to 
                         seeing you when you come to visit. 
                         I'll be your guide. You are coming 
                         to visit aren't you?

               We PULL BACK and REVEAL Autumn in an office with 15 other 
               telephones, a coed on every one. ASST. COACH MYERS supervises 
               with a clipboard of names and numbers.

               EXT. TUNNEL OF WOLFDEN STADIUM - DAY

               Joe leads Darnell down to the end of the tunnel, where Autumn 
               is waiting. He introduces them. She's even more attractive 
               than Darnell thought she'd be.

               She takes Darnell's hand and leads him out onto the field 
               where he's greeted by the E.S.U. BAND playing the school 
               fight song. The CHEERLEADERS whip into action, legs kicking, 
               pom-poms whirling.

               The band parts and Darnell walks out into the 90,000 seat 
               stadium, an awesome sight for any young man. Autumn points 
               to the giant DIAMOND VISION SCOREBOARD. Darnell's name and 
               picture appear. The stadium P.A. ANNOUNCER cuts in.

                                     P.A. ANNOUNCER
                         Now for the starting line-up for the 
                         E.S.U. Timber Wolves. At tailback, 
                         number 20, Darnell Jefferson!!

                                     DARNELL
                         You got that right.

               Darnell, in his excitement, does a little end-zone dance. 
               Slaps hands with Joe.

               EXT. PICTURESQUE CAMPUS WALK - NIGHT

               Romantic, Ivy-League look, lit by soft-glo footlights. Darnell 
               and Autumn walk, side by side, stopping outside Autumn's 
               dorm.

                                     DARNELL
                         Thanks for showin' me around, Autumn. 
                         I don't meet too many females like 
                         you. You got a lotta class. Real 
                         efficacious. Maybe I'll check you 
                         out in the fall.

                                     AUTUMN
                         I hope so, Darnell.

               He leans down to kiss her. She hesitates, not sure about 
               this, then comes forward, kisses him on the lips, starts to 
               let it deepen, then breaks it off.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Good night.

               As he watches her go up the steps, we go to:

               EXT. THE BOYS HOME - DAY

               Early February: It's National Decision Day and Darnell's 
               home is under seige. Reporters. Microphones. Television 
               cameras. Darnell steps out onto the porch wearing an ESU 
               jersey with #1 emblazoned on it.

                                     DARNELL
                         Now you know where I'm going and 
                         what we're indubitably going to be.

               MUSIC and TITLES END.

               EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - DAY

               A hot, late summer day. Over the deserted Quad, we see the 
               title: 6 MONTHS LATER.

               It fades and we MOVE TO REVEAL a city BUS pulling up at a 
               curb adjacent to the Quad. Off steps Darnell, carrying one 
               battered suitcase. Joe Kane and BUD LITE KAMINSKY, offensive 
               line tackle, are there to greet him.

                                     JOE
                         Hey, Darnell, Welcome to E.S.U.

                                     DARNELL
                              (shaking hands)
                         Yeh, good to see you guys. What 
                         happened to the band and the dancin' 
                         honies?

                                     JOE
                         Regular students don't come back for 
                         two weeks yet. Not that they woulda 
                         been here. Now that you've enrolled, 
                         you're just another wormshit freshman.

               INT. BROWNING ATHLETIC DORM - DAY

               A dorm devoted exclusively to football players. Luxurious 
               lounges, study halls, saunas, recreation and media rooms. 
               Spacious living quarters. A world unto itself.

               Joe and Bud usher Darnell into his room.

                                     JOE
                         Here's your room. If you need anything 
                         call the hall manager.

               Darnell looks around, taking it all in. He tries to be cool, 
               but this is easily the nicest room he's ever had.

                                     JOE
                         See ya later. Freshman Placement 
                         test tomorrow at nine. McKinnley 
                         Hall.

               Joe and Bud start down the hall. Darnell turns back into his 
               room, then starts to pace off it's dimensions, heel to toe.

               EXT. THE 911 - NIGHT

               College hang-out, bar, catering to athletes and their 
               admirers. A black HARLEY DAVIDSON, driven by Joe Kane with 
               Darnell on the back, pulls up at the curb. They get off, 
               head inside.

               INT. THE 911 - NIGHT

               Joe and Darnell pass a table of three girls, conspicuous 
               among them is Louanne Winters. Joe and Darnell give her a 
               nod and proceed on to a table where three fellow players 
               wait: Bud Lite, BOBBY COLLINS, good-looking, silver-tongued 
               ladies man and 2nd string quarterback, and STEVE LATTIMER, 
               heavily muscled, surf-punk defensive end. Between them is a 
               large pitcher of beer.

                                     BOBBY
                         Uh, oh, the Lead Dog is back. There 
                         goes my cover of the media guide.

                                     JOE
                         Hey, Bobby, Lats, how ya doin? This 
                         is Darnell Jefferson, freshman 
                         tailback.

                                     DARNELL
                         How ya' doin'?

                                     BOBBY
                         I was hopin' you'de have rolled your 
                         bike or somethin'. Nothin' serious, 
                         just enough to keep you out for the 
                         season.

                                     JOE
                              (pouring himself some 
                              beer)
                         No such luck, Backup Man. But I'll 
                         try to engineer a few blowouts. Get 
                         you get some mop-up time.
                              (studying Lattimer)
                         Shit, Lats, you look buffed, man. 
                         You put on some weight?

                                     LATTIMER
                         35 lbs. Spent the summer in the gym. 
                         I'm tired of watchin' you guys play. 
                         I intend to start this year.

                                     BUD
                         You get any bigger, you can play 
                         offense.

                                     LATTIMER
                         Yeh, but don't I have to get dumber 
                         too?

               Bud takes a good-natured swipe at him. Lattimer deflects it.

               Joe notices Bobby looking over at Louanne. She gives Bobby a 
               surreptitious little wave to come over and sit with her. He 
               gives her the "just a minute" sign.

                                     BUD
                         You still seein' Louanne?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yeh. Now and then, when the tide 
                         rises. Don't want her to think this 
                         is some kind've exclusive deal.

                                     JOE
                         Coach finds out you're nailin' his 
                         daughter, you'll be playin' dorm 
                         ball.

                                     BOBBY
                         I'll bail before that. Besides, this 
                         is what he gets for not startin' me.

               Bobby laughs and heads over to Louanne's table, as Joe pours 
               himself another beer.

               Alvin enters the bar, goes to Joe's table, plops a copy of 
               Sports Illustrated down in front of Joe.

                                     ALVIN
                         Hey, man, you seen this?

               On the cover is a picture of Joe and ONE OTHER QUARTERBACK, 
               TIM WAYMEN. The coverline reads, HEISMAN HOPEFULS: THE YEAR 
               OF THE QUARTERBACK.

                                     ALVIN
                              (ribbing Joe)
                         You must be some very bad-ass 
                         motherfucker.

               Joe stares at the cover. He's more stunned than elated.

                                     JOE
                         Jesus...

                                     LATTIMER
                         What? You didn't know?

                                     JOE
                         I knew there was gonna be an article. 
                         I didn't know it was gonna be on the 
                         cover.

                                     ALVIN
                         Shit, we do all the work. You get 
                         all the pub. Too bad we're not allowed 
                         to hit you in practice. Be fun to 
                         kick the shit out of a Heisman Trophy 
                         Candidate.

                                     JOE
                         I guess you'll have to wait till we 
                         get to the pros.

                                     ALVIN
                              (to Darnell)
                         Beer boy, get me some.

                                     DARNELL
                         Are you serious?

                                     ALVIN
                         Does it look like I'm serious?

               Joe drains his beer, pours another. Lattimer starts to read 
               form the article.

                                     LATTIMER
                         Listen to this. "E.S.U. has a solid 
                         nucleus returning, but the 
                         Timberwolves, coming off two 
                         disappointing seasons, will only go 
                         as far as the strong right arm of 
                         Heisman Candidate Joe Kane will take 
                         them." That right, Joe? You gonna 
                         lead us to the promised land?

                                     JOE
                         I'm gonna lead... but can you follow?

               Muted chuckles, but set faces. The challenge accepted. Joe 
               chugs his beer, pours another.

               EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The crowd from the 911 (Bud, Alvin, Lattimer, Darnell, Bobby 
               and Louanne) follow Joe down the hill behind the bar toward 
               a busy two-lane highway. Joe, a little drunker than the 
               others, starts HOWLING at the moon like a Timber Wolf. The 
               others join in.

                                     BUD
                         What are we doin', Joe?

                                     JOE
                              (slightly slurred)
                         There's something I wanta try. Gotta 
                         wake up our Mojo. Start settin' the 
                         tone for the season.

                                     BUD
                         This is not a good time to be settin' 
                         anything. You're in no shape...

               Suddenly Joe makes a dash out onto the highway.

                                     BUD
                         Joe, c'mon Joe, don't be an asshole. 
                         Joe! God-damnit, why's he always 
                         doin' shit like this? Coach'll fuckin' 
                         kill me. Alvin, go get him, will ya?

                                     ALVIN
                         Hell no, you go get his ass. Crazy 
                         motherfucker.

               Joe stands on the white line, cars and trucks whizzing by, 
               then lies down on his back, arms at his side.

               JOE'S POINT OF VIEW

               Cars and trucks blast toward us, roar on by, right on top of 
               us, honking, spraying grime, shaking the asphalt.

               Bud and the others on the side of the road are increasingly 
               worried now.

                                     BUD
                         Fuck this shit.

               Pissed off, Bud sprints out to the white line. The draft-
               wake of a passing truck almost blows him over.

                                     BUD
                         C'mon, Joe, that's enough. Let's get 
                         the hell outa here. What if somebody 
                         drifts or crosses the line to pass?

                                     JOE
                         What's the matter, Bud? Can't you 
                         follow?

               Bud hesitates a second, scared, but stung by this dare.

                                     BUD
                              (torn)
                         God-damnit, god-damnit. Shit.

               Bud can't fight it. He lies down on the line, his head 
               touching Joe's feet. Joe begins to HOWL again. Bud joins in. 
               Alvin and the others can't believe it.

                                     ALVIN
                         Startin' to look like a loaf of Wonder 
                         bread out there.

                                     BOBBY
                         They're makin' us look like pussies, 
                         ya know. Standin' here suckin' our 
                         thumbs.

                                     LATTIMER
                              (to Alvin)
                         Yeh, and there's nobody from the 
                         Defense out there.

               Bobby and Lattimer look at each other a beat. Time to ante 
               up. Both turn to Alvin.

                                     ALVIN
                         What are you lookin' at? You think 
                         you're bad?

               Alvin snorts in disgust and starts out onto the blacktop. 
               Bobby and Lattimer smile, go to follow. Louanne grabs Bobby, 
               holds him back.

                                     LOUANNE
                              (vaguely sexual)
                         Bobby, be careful, o.k? Please, be 
                         careful.

               Bobby smiles, grabs her ass, pulls her to him, gives her a 
               long, passionate kiss, then sprints out to the white line, 
               leaving her breathless.

               Alvin, Bobby and Lattimer lie down in front of Bud. Now 
               there's a line of five, a human highway median. Everybody 
               scared shitless, howling their lungs out.

               Louanne and Darnell watch from the side of the road.

                                     DARNELL
                         This guy do this kinda shit a lot? 
                         They never mentioned this in 
                         recruiting.

               Finally, Joe laughing wildly, jumps up and they all scramble 
               back to safety. Out of breath, but pumped up, they exchange 
               exhilarated high fives. Alvin just shakes his head.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - MORNING

               Twenty freshman football players, including Darnell, are 
               scattered at tables around the room, writing furiously in 
               test booklets, as a PROCTOR paces the room. Darnell starts 
               to write an answer, stops, stumped. Worried, he looks at the 
               clock, goes on to the next page.

               EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - MORNING

               Darnell and Joe walk across campus. Darnell carries a 
               gleaming, chromed TROPHY with a football player on top. He's 
               still thinking about the test.

                                     DARNELL
                         I don't know... I left a lot of 'em 
                         blank.

                                     JOE
                         Don't worry, you'll do all right. 
                         Lotta people don't finish.

                                     DARNELL
                              (not convinced)
                         Yeh.

                                     JOE
                         What are you doin' with the trophy?

                                     DARNELL
                         Coach Winters asked me to bring it 
                         to the meeting. I don't know what 
                         for.

               Suddenly Darnell sees Autumn walking across the Quad.

                                     DARNELL
                         I'll see ya at the meeting.
                              (handing him the trophy)
                         Take this for me, will ya?

               Joe starts to protest, but Darnell is already off, racing 
               across the Quad, quickly catching up with Autumn.

                                     DARNELL
                         Hey, Autumn, hold up! What're you 
                         doing here? I thought students didn't 
                         come back for two weeks.

                                     AUTUMN
                              (rather coolly)
                         I came back early to see a friend.

                                     DARNEL
                         You're looking fresh, Autumn. A 
                         package of pulchritudiness. What 
                         about getting together later tonight? 
                         Maybe get a pizza? They got pizza in 
                         this town don't they?

                                     AUTUMN
                         I can't tonight.

                                     DARNELL
                         How about tomorrow night?

                                     AUTUMN
                         I don't think it's a real good idea 
                         for us to see each other, Darnell.

                                     DARNELL
                         What's the matter? I'm not good enough 
                         for you all of a sudden? Too young, 
                         is that it? I'm not, ya know. They 
                         held me back a year.

                                     AUTUMN
                         No, it's not that... I've got a 
                         boyfriend.

                                     DARNELL
                         Did you have this boyfriend when you 
                         showed me around?

                                     AUTUMN
                              (reluctant to admit 
                              it)
                         Yes.

                                     DARNELL
                         Yeah, well, it didn't seem to bother 
                         you then. I'm willing to overlook it 
                         now.

                                     AUTUMN
                         I was mad at him.

                                     DARNELL
                         For what?

                                     AUTUMN
                         I caught him with another girl. A 
                         white girl.

                                     DARNELL
                         And you're still with this nigger?

               She nods, slightly embarrassed.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Look, I got to get going, Darnell. 
                         I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lead you 
                         on. I'm glad you came here.

               She starts walking away.

                                     DARNELL
                         Wait a minute. I can at least walk 
                         with you, can't I? Nothin' wrong 
                         with that.

               She speeds up. He speeds up.

                                     AUTUMN
                         I'm in a hurry.

                                     DARNELL
                         I can keep up. I run the forty in 
                         four-four.

               She's just about to say something when RAY GRIFFEN arrives. 
               Ray's the starting tailback, black, handsome, clean-cut, 
               well-spoken, middle class.

                                     RAY
                         Hey, Autumn --

               This is exactly what Autumn didn't want to happen. Ray and 
               Darnell eye each other like a couple of roosters.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Hi, Ray. This is...

                                     DARNELL
                              (cutting in, offering 
                              his hand)
                         Darnell Jefferson.
                              (pointedly)
                         Tailback.

                                     RAY
                              (shaking Darnell's 
                              hand)
                         Ray Griffen.
                              (just as pointedly)
                         Starting tailback.

                                     DARNELL
                         I know. That's why they recruited 
                         me.

               Autumn can't believe he said this. She starts to interject 
               something to break the tension, but never gets the chance.

                                     RAY
                         The two guys they recruited before 
                         you are handing out Gatorade now.
                              (making the jerkoff 
                              motion)
                         Better start strengthening your wrist.

                                     DARNELL
                         We'll see.
                              (departing, to Ray)
                         Give my best to Miss Lilly.

               Autumn's mortification is complete.

                                     RAY
                              (to himself)
                         What the hell is that supposed to 
                         mean?

               EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - DAY

               Establish the new, modern KELLER CENTER, home of the E.S.U. 
               Athletic Department.

               INT. KELLER CENTER - DAY

               The football meeting room. A quarter amphitheatre. The 
               Freshman, including Darnell, down in front. Nervous, talking 
               very little, eyes playing over the pictures of former E.S.U. 
               greats arranged on the Wall of Honor.

               Behind them, the Upperclassmen, bantering, conversation 
               punctuated with laughter.

               A door opens. The Assistant Coaches file in. The room hushes 
               immediately. Coach Winters walks in. The Upperclassmen break 
               into applause; the Freshmen quickly take their cue and join 
               in.

                                     WINTERS
                         Good to see you again, gentlemen.
                              (catching sight of 
                              Darnell)
                         Jefferson, either take off the earring 
                         or put on a dress.

               The upperclassmen hoot, as Darnell, embarrassed, takes off 
               his earring.

                                     WINTERS
                         I wanna talk a little about what 
                         we're trying to do here. There are 
                         many highly respected people who 
                         feel football is about preparation 
                         for life.

               The players nod reverentially at this established axiom of 
               the football cannon.

                                     WINTERS
                         These people are full of shit. You 
                         see, football is not like life.
                              (pause)
                         It's better. More exciting, more 
                         intense, more fun. In life, people 
                         are always wondering how they measure 
                         up; whether they're getting ahead or 
                         fallin' behind. In football, you 
                         know. Every week you get a chance to 
                         show what you're made of, a chance 
                         to demonstrate the physical and 
                         personal qualities that all those 
                         poor bastards who can't play this 
                         game are left to agonize about.

               Spreading smiles all around. It's good to be a football 
               player.

                                     WINTERS
                         Last year we didn't make enough of 
                         those chances. Last year everyone 
                         felt we let the school down. Fuck 
                         the school. We let ourselves down.
                              (pointing to the Wall 
                              of Honor)
                         We let down a great tradition, a 120-
                         year-old Line of Champions.

               The smiles are gone. Lots of set faces now. Shame. anger, 
               retribution.

                                     WINTERS
                         Any football program worth the name 
                         is a special brotherhood, an elite 
                         corps of warriors, a select group of 
                         knights. That first time our starting 
                         unit takes the field, the first time 
                         we huddle up; that's our inner circle, 
                         that's our Round Table. If I were an 
                         upperclassman, I'd be real nervous 
                         about my seat, cause we got some 
                         very talented new-comers this year. 
                         Guys who want a place at the Table.
                              (producing Darnell's 
                              trophy from behind 
                              the podium)
                         This is the trophy one of our 
                         freshman, Darnell Jefferson, won as 
                         a Pennsylvania State High School 
                         First Team All-American. You know 
                         what this says to me?

               The freshmen are hanging on every word.

                                     WINTERS
                         Not a god-damn thing.

               He smashes the trophy on the podium, breaking it in half, 
               shattering the base. Darnell and the other freshmen are agog. 
               The upperclassmen stifle laughs, particularly Ray Griffen.

                                     WINTERS
                              (to the freshmen)
                         Everybody here was a high school All-
                         American.
                              (to all the players)
                         Whatever any of you have done before 
                         is out the window. We're startin' 
                         over. Ground zero. The Table is empty. 
                         Are you ready?

               The upperclassmen nod, steely, purposeful. We go to the 
               freshmen. They're not so sure.

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. E.S.U. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

               Passing drills. Joe Kane takes a snap, fades to pass, throws 
               an out. The ball sails two feet over the receiver's head. 
               Joe's angry with himself.

                                     COACH CLAYTON
                              (to Winters)
                         He's too pumped up. Tryin' to win 
                         the damn Heisman on every throw. I'm 
                         not sure he's ready for all this 
                         hype.

                                     COACH HUMES
                         Little late to be worryin' about 
                         that. If we don't follow up the Sports 
                         Illustrated cover with something, 
                         it'll look like we didn't believe in 
                         our own player.

                                     WINTERS
                         Don't worry, Joe's a tough kid. He'll 
                         be allright.

               EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

               Scrimmage. Joe hands off to Darnell. He sweeps right, cuts 
               it up, blows past the end. In a spectacular display of broken 
               field running, Darnell breaks to the sideline, cuts back, 
               eluding the corner back, and stiffarms the safety. Alvin, 
               pursuing the play, finally tackles him from behind, stripping 
               the ball at the same time. There's a wild scramble for the 
               fumble. Darnell is crushed under the pile, as the defense 
               recovers it, ruining an otherwise brilliant run.

               The players unpile to reveal Darnell, writhing on the ground, 
               the wind knocked out of him. Ray Griffen runs by to take his 
               place.

                                     GRIFFEN
                         Hey, nice writhing, Jefferson. You 
                         got all the moves.

                                     WINTERS
                              (shouting to the team)
                         Allright, move it up. Let's go, 15 
                         yards, run the next play.

               The scrimmage moves up 15 yards leaving Darnell behind. 
               Winters sprints over to Lattimer, grabs him by the face mask.

                                     WINTERS
                         Cut the necktie tackle horseshit. 
                         You think you're in some kinda 
                         highlight reel? He left you huggin' 
                         air. Target his guts. Drive right 
                         through his abdomen. I wanta see 
                         snot bubbles in his nose. I wanta 
                         see shit in his underwear.

               Lattimer nods chastised. Winters moves over to check on 
               Darnell.

                                     WINTERS
                         You injured, Jefferson, or just hurt?

                                     DARNELL
                              (gasping)
                         What do you mean?

                                     WINTERS
                         If you're hurt, you can still play. 
                         If you're injured you can't. Are you 
                         hurt or are you injured?

                                     DARNELL
                         I think I'm just hurt.

                                     WINTERS
                         O.k., then get up.

               Winters extends a hand. Darnell grabs it, struggles shakily 
               to his feet

                                     WINTERS
                         Nice run. Think what it coulda done 
                         for us if we still had the ball.
                              (handing him the ball)
                         This is a football. I want you to 
                         carry it with you wherever you go. 
                         Never let it out of your sight.
                              (to the rest of the 
                              team)
                         Any of you see him on campus, take a 
                         swipe at the ball. Try to knock it 
                         out of his hands. Recover it.
                              (to Darnell again)
                         If anybody, but you, returns this 
                         ball to me, you'll wish you'de never 
                         been born.

               Winters wheels off leaving a wobbly Darnell alone with his 
               football.

                                     WINTERS (V.O.)
                         This isn't gonna get it, goddamnit.

               INT. WINTER'S OFFICE, LOCKER ROOM - DAY

               Winters, mad as hell, is berating his assistant coaches who 
               are sitting, cowed in his office.

                                     WINTERS
                         I see tackling, but I don't see 
                         hitting. I see effort, but I don't 
                         see ferocity. What do you think, 
                         they're gonna motivate themselves? 
                         Football's just a game to most of 
                         these kids. This is our program, our 
                         livelihood. It's our job to make 
                         them care as much about it as we do. 
                         Make them hate me if you have to. 
                         It'll bring them together, give them 
                         a focus. So get off your butts and 
                         put the fear of God in these guys.

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER AFTERNOON

               Dead tired players toweling off, dressing. The trainer's 
               room is crowded with aching, cramped-up, contused players. 
               Across the way, Lattimer lifts weights, alone in the weight 
               room. Clayton and Humes consider this from outside Winters' 
               office.

                                     CLAYTON
                         Shit, Lattimer's an animal all of a 
                         sudden. Benchin' 450. He's gotta be 
                         on somethin'.

                                     HUMES
                         What, steroids? Why do you always 
                         think my guys are juicin'?

                                     CLAYTON
                         I don't know... he's on the punt 
                         team for three years, then gains 35 
                         pounds of rip in one summer and an 
                         attitude to go with it.

               Winters, who's heard all this, comes by.

                                     WINTERS
                         We're not doctors, gentlemen. The 
                         NCAA has testing programs for this. 
                         Let's let them worry about it.
                              (to Clayton)
                         Besides, it's not that hard to put 
                         on 35 pounds in a summer, if you 
                         really hit the gym.

               Winters walks on into his office. Clayton nods, realizing 
               this subject is now closed.

               INT. DARNELL'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               Darnell walks in, wrung out from the day's practice, stumbles 
               to the bed where he sees something that stops him - lying 
               there is his PENNSYLVANIA STATE ALL AMERICAN TROPHY. Coach 
               Winters actually smashed a replica. A smile appears on 
               Darnell's tired face.

               INT. TRAINING TABLE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               For football players only. Bud Lite moves through the 
               cafeteria line.

                                     BUD
                         What you got tonight?

                                     CAFETERIA WORKER
                         Choice of three entrees. Shrimp, 
                         lasagna, T-bone steak.

                                     BUD
                         Tough choice. I'll take all three.

                                     CAFETERIA WORKER
                         What a surprise.

               ANGLE ON DARNELL

               at another table with Alvin and several other black players. 
               Lattimer is the only white.

                                     DARNELL
                         When do they give ya the scores on 
                         that Placement Test?

                                     LATTIMER
                         Who cares? I flunked it three times, 
                         before I got in.

                                     ALVIN
                         Long as you're in the program, they'll 
                         get you through. Maybe not with a 
                         degree, but they'll keep you eligible. 
                         Just don't do nothin' embarrassing 
                         they can't cover you for.

                                     LATTIMER
                         Hell, they even give Alvin copies of 
                         his tests in advance. He sells 'em 
                         for a hundred bucks a pop to people 
                         in his class. 'Course he's gotta 
                         have somebody read 'em to him.

                                     ALVIN
                         Fuck you, doughboy. I can read. See 
                         that shoe?
                              (points to his shoes)
                         That says Nike.

                                     DARNELL
                         I still don't wanna flunk that test. 
                         I wanta get a degree.

                                     ALVIN
                         What do you think, nigger? You're 
                         gonna be on the Supreme Court? All 
                         you need to know is how to sign an 
                         N.F.L. contract.

               Darnell's stung by this. He'd like to think of himself as 
               capable of more.

               Suddenly, Coach Winters appears at the door, a surprise 
               visitor to the training table. All the players wearing 
               baseball caps, quickly doff them. Winters is angry.

                                     WINTERS
                         What's the matter with you guys? 
                         You're supposed to be a team. Winning 
                         depends on thinking and acting and 
                         going to war together. But you don't 
                         even eat like a team. You eat like 
                         two teams. A white one and a black 
                         one. What do I have to do? Make out 
                         a seating chart? Now get up. Move 
                         around. Mix it up. Now!

               The players all look at each other, then reluctantly get up 
               and change tables. Darnell sits next to Joe.

                                     DARNELL
                              (mock introduction)
                         Hi there. Darnell Jefferson. I'm a 
                         young black man.

                                     JOE
                         Hey, glad to meet ya. Joe Kane, 
                         Caucasian. So what doya think a that 
                         new Garth Brooks album?

                                     DARNELL
                         I love that motherfucker.

               Coach Winters surveys the scene, sees that all the tables 
               are integrated now.

                                     WINTERS
                         That's more like it.

               He turns and walks on out. Immediately, the players begin to 
               drift back to their old tables.

               INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT

               Joe, Bud Lite and Bobby Collins, all suffering from various 
               aches and pains are getting Naperson and analgesic balm out 
               of the non-prescription drug cabinet. Joe pops a Nap and 
               looks across to the weight room where a stunning co-ed CAMILLE 
               SCHAEFFER works a knee lift. Camille's the perfect marriage 
               of Southern patrician beauty and athletic confirmation. Joe 
               leaves the others, heads over, pokes his head in.

                                     JOE
                         How ya' doin'?

                                     CAMILLE
                         Fine.

                                     JOE
                         Little late to be workin' out, isn't 
                         it?

                                     CAMILLE
                              (with a little edge)
                         Only time I could get in here when 
                         the football team wasn't usin' it.

                                     JOE
                              (trying to get a rise 
                              out of her)
                         Well, if it wasn't for the football 
                         team, might not be a weight room to 
                         use. You tryin' to firm up a little, 
                         or what?

                                     CAMILLE
                              (unfazed)
                         Don't need to firm up. I'm 
                         strengthening my knee. Had 
                         arthroscopic surgery.

                                     JOE
                         Had my knee scoped once too. When 
                         you're finished here, maybe we could 
                         get a yogurt, compare scars.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Sorry, I don't date football players. 
                         They're all full of themselves. I 
                         saw you on the cover of Sports 
                         Illustrated, so you're probably worse 
                         than most.

                                     JOE
                         That's real open minded of you. So 
                         you won't consider doin' anything 
                         with me?

                                     CAMILLE
                         No.

                                     JOE
                         Well at least tell me what happened 
                         to your knee. What'd you do? Fall 
                         outa your convertible?

               Camille stops her knee lift, turns to Joe. We think she's 
               going to fire on him. Wrong.

                                     CAMILLE
                         You know, there's maybe one thing 
                         I'd do with you.

                                     JOE
                         What's that?

                                     CAMILLE
                         Tennis. I'll play tennis with you.

               Camille starts to walk away.

                                     JOE
                         Tennis. You mean now? It's raining.

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               CAMILLE - TENNIS COURTS - NIGHT

               smashing a two-fisted forehand right at us, grunting with 
               the exertion. Joe scrambles to get it back, but Camille's a 
               world-class player. She attacks with a vengeance, blasting 
               every shot ala Jimmy Connors, as Bud Lite and Bobby Collins 
               watch, amazed.

               We begin a SERIES OF CUTS detailing Camille's relentless 
               dismantling of Joe: Camille drilling a backhand down the 
               line, Joe barely getting it back to the net. Camille hitting 
               a powerhouse service ace, Joe lunging and whiffing the return. 
               Camille crushing another forehand. Joe crushes it back, sends 
               it over the fence and into the parking lot. Camille serving 
               again at match point. Joe pops up a weak return. Camille 
               puts it away with a powerhouse overhead, the ball almost 
               knocking Joe down. He flings his racket against the fence. 
               Camille comes to the net to shake hands, but Joe hangs back.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Thanks for the game, Heisman. You 
                         took it really well.

               And she walks away along to the net. Joe goes after her, 
               pissed.

                                     JOE
                         What's this Heisman crap?

               Camille's taken aback, not realizing she'd struck a nerve.

                                     JOE
                         I didn't say anything about being a 
                         Heisman candidate. I don't go around 
                         strokin' myself about it. So what's 
                         this shit you're givin' me?

                                     CAMILLE
                         I... I'm sorry... I just figured you 
                         were probably kissin' yourself in 
                         the mirror every morning.

                                     JOE
                         You figured wrong.

               Now Joe walks away and Camille goes after him.

                                     CAMILLE
                         So what do you want, an apology? I 
                         just gave you one.

                                     JOE
                         I want a rematch.

                                     CAMILLE
                         A rematch?

                                     JOE
                         Some other sport. I took my beating. 
                         You owe me one. Either that or we go 
                         out.

               Camille considers, tries to figure out what she'd dislike 
               least, knowing it'd be cheap to choose neither.

                                     CAMILLE
                         I'll think about it.

               Camille walks off, disappearing through the gate. Joe walks 
               off in the other direction. Bud Lite and Bobby follow.

                                     BOBBY
                         Real good date, Joe. Remind me to 
                         take her out.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - MORNING

               Opening day of school. We take CUTS of students arriving, 
               football players checking out the new girls from atop the 
               wall of the athletic dorm, Louanne and Autumn greeting 
               returning sisters at the sorority, students registering for 
               classes etc.

               INT. ACADEMIC ADVISOR'S OFFICE - MORNING

               Darnell sits across from WILLIAM SMITH, Academic Advisor.

                                     ADVISOR SMITH
                         Darnell, I've reviewed your placement 
                         test and I'm afraid you failed to 
                         meet our entrance requirements in 
                         two areas.

                                     DARNELL
                         What does that mean? I can't play 
                         football?

                                     ADVISOR SMITH
                         No. It means you're going to have to 
                         take some remedial classes, what we 
                         call "zero level" courses. 
                         Specifically Math 0 and English 0.

               Darnell is clearly deflated by this painful indication of 
               his academic standing.

                                     ADVISOR SMITH
                         You won't get college credit for 
                         them, but they will help you prepare 
                         to take the Placement Test again at 
                         the end of the quarter. If you pass 
                         at that time you'll be able to 
                         officially enter the university and 
                         take college level courses. You'll 
                         still be able to take an American 
                         History survey course, but it won't 
                         count on your record until you pass 
                         the Placement Test. But first things 
                         first. To start, I'm approving a 
                         tutor for you.

                                     DARNELL
                         A tutor? I don't need no tutor.

                                     ADVISOR SMITH
                         Any tutor. And yes you do.

               INT. ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               A meeting of the football brain trust; Coach Winters, Athletic 
               Director, GALEN HOWARD, a publicist, SHARON BRAVER, and the 
               Sports Information Director (S.I.D.) LARRY NICHOLS. Also 
               present is Joe Kane, somewhat discomfited at being the center 
               of all this attention.

                                     HOWARD
                         I think both Joe and the university 
                         are best served by a straightforward 
                         Heisman campaign. Nothing too 
                         gimmicky.

                                     BRAVER
                         We've compiled a mailing list of 
                         around 1300 opinion makers; 
                         newspapers, football writers, and 
                         sports anchors. First we send them a 
                         packet on Joe and his achievements. 
                         Bio, stats, plus human interest stuff; 
                         commitment to academics, charity 
                         work, etc. Then we update it each 
                         week with a postcard. Heisman voters 
                         hate opening envelopes.

               Joe is increasingly uneasy with all this.

                                     JOE
                         I haven't really done any charity 
                         work...

                                     BRAVER
                         You're gonna start. We've got some 
                         things lined up.

                                     NICHOLS
                         Unfortunately, because we weren't in 
                         the top 20 last year, we only have 
                         one network T.V. game to give Joe 
                         national exposure. Although it's a 
                         good one; Michigan. But we'll also 
                         be taping all our other games and 
                         buying satellite time. That way we 
                         can produce our own highlight package 
                         and interview pieces and send them 
                         out to T.V. stations all over the 
                         country for their sportscasts.

                                     WINTERS
                         Any questions, Joe?

               If Joe was uneasy before, he's overwhelmed now. He tries not 
               to show it. After all, who could turn down a Heisman campaign? 
               Still it's a megaton of pressure.

                                     JOE
                         Ah, no... I just... you really think 
                         I got a shot to win this?

                                     WINTERS
                         Hell, yes. Plus it's a good thing 
                         for the program. Publicizes the 
                         school, gives a boost to recruiting, 
                         and it's a great thing for you. Jumps 
                         up your draft position, the size of 
                         your first contract, everything. 
                         It's a hell of an opportunity.

                                     NICHOLS
                         All you gotta do is back it up on 
                         the field, and we have no doubts 
                         about that, cause we know "Kane is 
                         Able."

               Nichols holds up a black CAMPAIGN BUTTON with the phrase 
               "Kane is Able" enblazoned on it in gold letters. This gets a 
               rise out of everyone except Joe, who's still not sure about 
               all this.

               INT. JOE KANE'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

               Joe lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to 
               get to sleep.

               INT. CAMILLE'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

               The phone rings. Camille, who's been asleep, rolls over and 
               answers it.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Hello...

               ON JOE

                                     JOE
                         This is Joe Kane. What did you decide?

                                     CAMILLE
                              (still drowsy)
                         What?
                              (looking at the clock)
                         It's 3:00 in the morning.

                                     JOE
                         I wanta know what you decided.

                                     CAMILLE
                         I don't know... I couldn't think of 
                         any other sports I could beat you 
                         at.

                                     JOE
                         Then I'll pick you up tonight at 
                         6:00.

               He hangs up.

                                     CAMILLE
                         What?

               INT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY

               Autumn sits at a tutorial table, looking at her notes. She 
               becomes aware of someone approaching. She looks up to see 
               Darnell.

                                     DARNELL
                         Hey, Autumn.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Hi, Darnell. What are you doin here?

                                     DARNELL
                         My advisor says I need a tutor. Ya 
                         know, just to get me over a couple 
                         rough spots.
                              (showing her a paper)
                         I saw your name on this list. I 
                         figured if you couldn't keep my 
                         attention, nobody could.

                                     AUTUMN
                         I'm sorry, Darnell, but I've already 
                         been assigned. You're gonna have to 
                         find somebody else. I'm tutoring 
                         Scott Sherman.

                                     DARNELL
                         Not anymore. I asked Coach Winters 
                         to switch us.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Coach Winters wouldn't do that.

                                     DARNELL
                         Yeh he would. I'm a bigger prospect 
                         than Sherman.
                              (pointing across the 
                              way)
                         He's a lineman on the scout team.

               Autumn looks back to where Darnell is pointing. Sure enough, 
               SCOTT SHERMAN is hard at work with another Tutor. Autumn 
               can't believe it. She tries to compose herself.

               Darnell sits down across the table from her.

                                     DARNELL
                         C'mon Autumn, you could teach me 
                         some real erudition.

                                     AUTUMN
                              (trying to whisper, 
                              pissed)
                         Will you stop using those big words. 
                         It sounds ridiculous.

                                     DARNELL
                              (serious about this)
                         What doya mean? I'm improvin' myself. 
                         I learn a new word out of the 
                         dictionary every day. Mendacious, 
                         pejorative, antithetical, 
                         commensurate...

                                     AUTUMN
                         And you don't ever use them right. 
                         Pretending to be smart is not the 
                         same as being educated. Or erudite. 
                         It's just a con. And it makes you 
                         sound stupid, no matter how big a 
                         prospect you are.

               Darnell is genuinely hurt by this dose of reality. His 
               customary bravado melts away.

                                     DARNELL
                         O.K... even more reason for you to 
                         be my tutor. You already taught me 
                         something.

               Autumn, disarmed by his sudden humility, has no real rebuttal. 
               She would have had to tutor him anyway, but now she's having 
               trouble being angry about it.

               ALVIN MACK

               At another table, looking distracted and bored as his TUTOR 
               reads his history assignment to him. Alvin takes out a walkman 
               and puts the headphones on. WE HEAR A HORN BEEP.

               EXT. CAMILLE'S DORM - LATE AFTERNOON

               Camille comes out the front door, summoned by the horn. She 
               stops at the sight of something. We REVERSE TO REVEAL Joe on 
               his Harley.

                                     CAMILLE
                         We goin' on that?

                                     JOE
                         Yeh. I thought we might take a ride.

                                     CAMILLE
                         I promised my dad I'd never get on 
                         one of those.

                                     JOE
                         What are you, one of these trust-
                         fund princesses? It's fine for me to 
                         play a game I don't know, but I ask 
                         you to try somethin' different and 
                         you hide behind your daddy.

               He holds out a motorcycle helmet toward her, daring her. She 
               burns, but her competitiveness makes it impossible for her 
               to decline this challenge.

                                     CAMILLE
                              (snatching the helmet)
                         All right. But we go slow. No cowboy 
                         stuff.

               Joe smiles and kicks the starter. Camille climbs on and they 
               roar off.

               EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               Just outside town. Joe and Camille come down the highway at 
               moderate speed. Camille's hanging on for dear life, but we 
               can tell she's enjoying it.

                                     JOE
                         This speed, o.k.?

                                     CAMILLE
                         Yeh, fine.

                                     JOE
                         Good.

               Joe immediately accelerates, throwing Camille's head back. 
               Her SHRIEK is lost in the whine of the engine, as they speed 
               away from camera.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Slow down, damnit. Joe... Joe!

               They approach a high-banked turn, beyond which appears to be 
               a long, sheer dropoff. Joe looks back at Camille, smiles 
               devilishly, not looking where he's going. Camille sees they're 
               heading straight for the edge.

                                     CAMILLE
                              (freaked)
                         Joe, look out!!!

               Too late. Joe brakes, fishtails, but goes over the top of 
               the bank, off the edge, flying out into oblivion, Camille 
               screaming.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE ON HARLEY

               As it plops down onto a wide LEDGE not visible from the road, 
               three feet below the top of the bank. Joe lands it, skids to 
               a professional stop, breaks into raucous laughter. Camille 
               jumps off the bike, scared stiff and livid with anger.

                                     CAMILLE
                         How could you do that, you stupid 
                         punk? It isn't funny, god-dammit, 
                         you coulda killed us! You're crazy, 
                         you know that...

                                     JOE
                         Take it easy. I've done that a hundred 
                         times. No big deal.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Oh, yeh? Then why are you shaking?

                                     JOE
                              (embarrassed)
                         I don't know... I guess cause I've 
                         never done it with someone else on 
                         the bike.

                                     CAMILLE
                         You just wanted to scare me. Are you 
                         happy now?

                                     JOE
                         Yeh, pretty much. And the scream was 
                         even better than I thought it'd be. 
                         Every dog within hearing distance 
                         wants to mate with you now.

               Camille's ready to throttle him, then something catches her 
               ear. Sure enough, there are SEVERAL DOGS BARKING in the 
               distance. Joe smiles at her. She looks away, still angry, 
               but amused in spite of herself.

               INT. ROADSIDE BAR - NIGHT

               Working class, sawdust floor, George Thoroughgood's "Who Do 
               You Love" on the jukebox. Camille and Joe are sitting in a 
               booth. Joe putting away the beers.

                                     CAMILLE
                         You come here a lot?

                                     JOE
                         Now and then. Why?

                                     CAMILLE
                         It's not exactly a campus favorite. 
                         This is almost like hidin' out.

                                     JOE
                         I like places where nobody knows me. 
                         This too low-rent for you?

                                     CAMILLE
                         No, my dad owned a place like this.

                                     JOE
                         Your dad? You mean he owned a chain 
                         of these?

                                     CAMILLE
                         Not everybody with a Southern accent 
                         has their own plantation. My dad 
                         could never afford to send me here. 
                         I learned to play tennis on public 
                         courts. Mighta been able to play pro 
                         someday, if I hadn't hurt my knee.

                                     JOE
                         So you're just a scholarship jock 
                         like me.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Yeh. You disappointed?

                                     JOE
                         No, I've just never been out with a 
                         jock before.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Is that what we're doin' here? Goin' 
                         out?

                                     JOE
                         I don't know. What doya think?

               Joe gets up, takes Camille's hand and pulls her to her feet. 
               They dance to a slow song.

                                     CAMILLE
                         I think you're crazy for jeopardizing 
                         your scholarship and a pro future by 
                         jumping motorcycles off of highways.

                                     JOE
                         Just tryin' to keep my edge, Camille. 
                         The other guys look to me cause they 
                         think I'll do anything. I lose that, 
                         I'm just another guy, and we all get 
                         our ass kicked.

                                     CAMILLE
                         I don't know, Joe. You scare me.

               INT. ATHLETIC DORM GARAGE - NIGHT

               Joe roars in on his motorcycle. Parks. Starts inside. Finds 
               himself face to face with a very unhappy Coach Winters. 
               Winters holds out his hand.

                                     WINTERS
                         The keys.

               Joe hesitates a second, then reluctantly hands over his 
               motorcycle keys.

                                     WINTERS
                         I told you, as long as you're in 
                         this program, you don't take 
                         unnecessary risks off the field. A 
                         man in contention for the Heisman 
                         Trophy should be able to remember 
                         that.

               Joe nods, contrite. Winters just walks on off.

               INT. STUDY HALL - CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY

               Autumn is tutoring Darnell, checking her lesson notes.

                                     AUTUMN
                         O.K., using the things we worked on 
                         yesterday, I want you to write a two 
                         or three page essay on some aspect 
                         of your life. Something other than 
                         football.

                                     DARNELL
                         Like what?

                                     AUTUMN
                         Your father, maybe. You could write 
                         about your dad.

                                     DARNELL
                         Don't know that much about him. He 
                         was off in Detroit workin' in a car 
                         plant when I was born. Got laid off, 
                         tried to rob a jewelry store to get 
                         us some money. He died in prison. 
                         Some kinda heart problem.

               Autumn wasn't ready for this level of hardship. She tries to 
               press on gamely.

                                     AUTUMN
                         How about your mother?

                                     DARNELL
                         She was always workin'. Usually two 
                         jobs. Comin' home one night she 
                         stopped to get us some root beer. 
                         Got caught in a gang crossfire. Shot 
                         three times... died on the way to 
                         the hospital. You want me to write 
                         about that?

                                     AUTUMN
                              (blown away)
                         No...

                                     DARNELL
                         Good, 'cause none of it's true.

               Autumn jumps up.

                                     AUTUMN
                              (raising her voice)
                         Jesus Christ, Darnell what a terrible 
                         thing to do to somebody. That's not 
                         funny. That's sick.

               Autumn realizes she's in the library and sits back down.

                                     DARNELL
                         Had ya goin', didn't I?

                                     AUTUMN
                              (soft library voice)
                         No you didn't. You just... How could 
                         you make up somethin' like that?

                                     DARNELL
                              (contrite now)
                         Sounded more interesting than the 
                         truth. My mom took a vacation to 
                         Chicago when I was 12. Never came 
                         back. Don't know who my dad was.

               Autumn's anger melts away in the face of this painful truth.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Who took care of you?

                                     DARNELL
                         I started hangin' with the J.B.M., 
                         gang-bangin'... Did some time in the 
                         Hall. Reverand Wallace saw me playin' 
                         football on a juvenile probation 
                         team. Took me in, got me into high 
                         school. Only reason they accepted me 
                         was 'cause I could play football. 
                         Sorta like here. Football saved my 
                         life. I'd be nowhere without football.

               Autumn just nods, still trying to take this all in.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Well, then... maybe you could write 
                         about football this once.

                                     DARNELL
                         Yeh, o.k... thanks.
                              (pause)
                         I've seen a lotta shitty things in 
                         my life, Autumn. That's why I know 
                         when I see somethin' good.

               Autumn knows this is no line. He means it. She's seeing him 
               with new eyes. Moved by his pain, engaged by his sincerity, 
               and more than a little taken by his regard for her.

               ON ALVIN

               across the room with his tutor.

                                     TUTOR
                         Let's review the chapter I read you 
                         yesterday. Which two city states 
                         fought in the Punic Wars?

                                     ALVIN
                         I dunno. Detroit and Buffalo.

                                     TUTOR
                         C'mon, Alvin. You're gonna be tested 
                         on this.

               INT. FOOTBALL MEETING - AFTERNOON

               A video projector projects various football formations on 
               the wall.

                                     WINTERS
                         Okay, Alvin, this is Mississippi 
                         State's offensive set. 2nd and 2 on 
                         our 24. What defense are you in?

                                     ALVIN
                         Eagle. Zipper. Hero. Unless the set 
                         back shifts into the I.

                                     WINTERS
                         Good.
                              (slide changes)
                         How about here? 3rd and 7.

                                     ALVIN
                         Okie. Thunder. Lion.

                                     WINTERS
                         What's your assignment?

                                     ALVIN
                         Kill the Quarterback.

               MUSIC UP - MONTAGE SEQUENCE BEGINS

               EXT. JOE'S ROOM - EVENING

               Joe watches Bud Lite, Darnell, Alvin and Lattimer file in 
               and unveil a life-size CARDBOARD STAND-UP of Joe's Sports 
               Illustrated cover pose. They whoop it up, as Joe tries to 
               muster some enthusiasm.

               INT. STUDY HALL - NIGHT

               Autumn's pointing out a figure on a graph in Darnell's math 
               book. As she explains, Darnell leans close to kiss her. Autumn 
               quickly leans away, glances around to see if anyone saw 
               Darnell's attempt. Darnell laughs.

               INT. AMERICAN HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY

               A group of football players sits in the back of the class. 
               As the HISTORY PROFESSOR lectures at the board, Darnell 
               furiously takes notes. Scott Sherman, seizing the opportunity, 
               leans forward from the desk behind him and pokes the football 
               out of Darnell's left hand. Darnell, Scott and two other 
               FRESHMAN FOOTBALL PLAYERS spring out of their seats, 
               scrambling after the loose ball. The prof and the other 
               students watch appalled as Darnell and the others dive under 
               chairs and overturn desks in pursuit of the elusive ball. 
               Finally, Darnell, winded and disheveled, comes up with it. 
               He and the others quickly return to their seats. The prof 
               looks at Darnell aghast.

                                     DARNELL
                         Sorry... I lost my football.

               INT. RAQUETBALL COURT - DAY

               Joe and Camille are locked up in a furious game of raquetball. 
               Joe makes a wicked kill shot on the last point, and pumps a 
               fist in triumph. Camille, pissed at losing, throws her racket 
               and stomps around.

               EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

               Darnell and Autumn are having a daytime tutoring session on 
               a secluded patch of lawn. Darnell holds his football. As he 
               begins to read aloud from East of Eden, Autumn pokes the 
               ball out of his hand. They both scramble for it, Darnell 
               winding up slightly on top of her. They eye each other a 
               beat. Darnell bends down to kiss her. She lets herself kiss 
               him for a second, then gets up and starts to collect her 
               books.

               INT. ATHLETIC CENTER - DAY

               Several of the players are gathered around a bulletin board 
               in the hall. The starting lineup for the first game has been 
               posted. Darnell traces his finger from the designation 
               TAILBACK over to the name RAY GRIFFEN. He drops his eyes, 
               obviously disappointed.

               Lattimer, meanwhile, is checking the defensive board. He 
               finds his name posted as a starting defensive end. Punching 
               the air, he dashes out of the building.

                                     LATTIMER
                         Yes!! Starting defense. Place at the 
                         table. Whooo!! Yes!!

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               Lattimer, in his euphoria, races out into the lot, and begins 
               head-butting car windows. He breaks out three in a row, and 
               yells in triumph, his forehead dripping blood.

               Winters, walking with the TEAM TRAINER, has seen this from 
               across the street. He knows there's something dark at work 
               here.

                                     WINTERS
                         N.C.A.A. is gonna test half the team 
                         before the game Saturday. Make sure 
                         Lattimer knows about it.

               MUSIC AND MONTAGE END

               INT. FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

               The chairs are arranged in several circles, ten players to a 
               circle, like a bunch of formalized huddles. Coach Winters 
               addresses the assembly.

                                     WINTERS
                         As the veteran players know, we have 
                         Pride Night every year before our 
                         opening game. It's a chance to get 
                         to know each other better, share 
                         some thoughts, and bring us closer 
                         together as a team. So to start off, 
                         I'd like each player to tell the 
                         others in his group what he likes 
                         best about football and then what 
                         he's most proud of off the field. 
                         I've asked some of the seniors to 
                         lead it off. Gentlemen.

                         I don't know... It's the battle. The 
                         goin' to war with the other guys. 
                         Hangin' together.

               INT. CAMPUS BALLROOM - GAME DAY

               The team walks through several plays. They wear coats and 
               ties, but no socks. Their ankles are taped.

                                     LATTIMER (V.O.)
                         Bein' different from everybody else. 
                         Havin' our own dorm, stayin' in hotels 
                         the night before games. Settin' 
                         ourselves apart.

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY

               Before the game. An NCAA OFFICIAL gives Lattimer a little 
               test tube to urinate in for his drug test. Lattimer goes 
               into one of the restroom stalls, reaches around to the back 
               of the tank, where a VIAL OF CLEAN URINE is taped. He pours 
               it in the test vial.

                                     LATTIMER (V.O.)
                         Havin' a chance to be somebody. To 
                         do somethin' that people look up to 
                         you for. Your strength and your 
                         courage. Not everybody can play 
                         football. We're the lucky ones.

               INT. FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE AGAIN

                                     DARNELL
                         The thing I'm most proud of myself 
                         for?

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY

               Darnell listening to a Walkman, is going through a pregame 
               ritual by his locker; pivoting from leg to leg, switching 
               the ball from arm to arm.

                                     DARNELL (V.O.)
                         Just that I'm here. That I'm not 
                         dead or in jail.

               INT. FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE AGAIN

                                     JOE
                         The great thing about football is 
                         you can lose yourself in it.

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY

               Joe sits off in a corner by himself, his head back against 
               the wall, staring out into space, the only movement the 
               rhythmic tapping of his feet.

                                     JOE (V.O.)
                         There's no time to think, to worry, 
                         to have doubts. Everything else fades 
                         away. You just move and react.

               INT. FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE

                                     ALVIN
                         The best thing is when you dominate. 
                         That feeling when you hit a guy real 
                         good, really stick him, and you hear 
                         that little moan.

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY

               Alvin, his ass-kicking game face on, walks over to where 
               Lattimer is finishing decorating his face with Indian war 
               paint. They chuck each other's pads, then Lattimer opens his 
               mouth. Alvin spits into it. Then Lattimer spits into Alvin's. 
               Darnell can't believe this shit.

                                     ALVIN (V.O.)
                         You know it's killin' him, but you 
                         feel great. It's just him and you, 
                         and he's the one that's hurtin'.

               We move in on the burning ferocity of Alvin's eyes and

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - GAME DAY

               The Players are bunched together in the tunnel, slapping 
               pads, yelling encouragement. Winters waves them forward. 
               They start to run down the tunnel.

               PLAYERS P.O.V.

               CAMERA runs with the players as the light at the end of the 
               tunnel becomes larger and brighter. Crowd NOISE becomes louder 
               until finally the camera emerges into the stadium and the 
               light and 95,000 VOICES ROAR. AND ROAR! AND ROAR! This is 
               Big Time College Football.

               INT. RADIO BROADCAST BOOTH

               E.S.U. announcer BRAD HARVEY and colorman, HARMON SLOAN are 
               holding forth.

                                     HARVEY
                         Welcome everybody to the Wolf Den 
                         where the E.S.U. Timberwolves, led 
                         by Heisman candidate Joe Kane, open 
                         their season against the tough 
                         Mississippi State Bulldogs under 
                         head coach Jackie Sherrill.

               EXT. THE FIELD - DAY

               The crowd stands, waving banners, as the E.S.U. kicker comes 
               forward and kicks the ball high into the fall sky. The 
               MISSISSIPPI STATE RETURN MAN fields the ball at the four 
               yard line and returns it to the 22 where he's buried. The 
               defense trots out and huddles up.

                                     ALVIN
                         All right, let's get evil. 60 minutes, 
                         balls out. Let's open a can of kick-
                         ass. Kill 'em all. Let the paramedics 
                         sort 'em out.

               The Mississippi State offense breaks it's huddle, comes to 
               the line of scrimmage. Alvin, prowling behind the line, locks 
               eyes with the tailback, No.23.

                                     ALVIN
                         Hey, 23, don't think I don't recognize 
                         you, you little fuck.

               The tailback looks away.

                                     ALVIN
                         Hey, pay attention when I'm talkin' 
                         to you, nigger. You're the guy that 
                         shot my mother aren't you?

                                     TAILBACK
                         What?

                                     ALVIN
                         You were tryin' to steal her fuckin' 
                         car weren't you, cocksucker.

                                     TAILBACK
                         Shut up. I never heard of your mother.

               On the sidelines, Darnell is watching this exchange.

                                     DARNELL
                              (to Joe)
                         What's Alvin saying to that guy?

                                     JOE
                         Just gettin' himself pumped up.

                                     DARNELL
                         He wasn't pumped up already?

               ANGLE ON ALVIN AGAIN

                                     ALVIN
                              (to tailback)
                         Thought I'd never find you didn't 
                         ya? But I got you now nigger, and 
                         I'm gonna kill you motherfucker. I'm 
                         gonna bust your guts open and watch 
                         you die.

               The ball is snapped. The quarterback pitches to the tailback 
               as Alvin charges into the hole, screaming at the top of his 
               lungs. The tailback, eyes wide with fear, cuts back, away 
               from Alvin, where he's promptly crunched by Lattimer. The 
               ball flies loose, there's a scramble, Alvin comes up with 
               it. E.S.U. ball.

               ANGLE ON

               The bench and stands erupt as Lattimer and Alvin but heads 
               and trot off the field.

                                     WINTERS
                         Atta baby, Alvin, heads up. Big pop, 
                         Steve, way to stick 'em.
                              (turning to Joe)
                         O.K. Joe, let's go up top. Take it 
                         to 'em right away.

               Joe leads the offense on. A disappointed Darnell stands on 
               the sidelines.

                                     JOE
                              (in huddle)
                         O.K. let's put the women and children 
                         to bed, and go lookin' for dinner. 
                         Don't let em up. 51 Strike, Orange 
                         left. On 4.

               Joe begins to howl like a wolf. The others join in. A pack 
               of Timberwolves. They break the huddle, come to the line of 
               scrimmage. Bud Lite begins to sing.

                                     BUD LITE
                         Bali Hi, will call you, anytime, any 
                         day. Here am I, your special island...

               Bud lines up opposite a big, black DEFENSIVE TACKLE.

                                     BLACK TACKLE
                         Shut up, snowflake. You think you're 
                         in the school play?

                                     BUD LITE
                         No, Bali Hi, the endzone is calling. 
                         And the highway runs right over your 
                         ass.

                                     BLACK TACKLE
                         Bullshit, you're gonna be my bitch, 
                         baby. You gonna be my punk bitch.

                                     BUD LITE
                              (singing again)
                         So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, 
                         good night, I hate to go and leave 
                         this pretty sight.

               Joe hits the 4 count, and the ball is snapped. Bud Lite and 
               the Big Tackle fire out. Bud drives a forearm into the stomach 
               of the Black Tackle, doubling him over. The Black Tackle 
               comes back, slamming a forearm up under Bud's chin, snapping 
               his neck back.

               Joe, meanwhile, fades to pass, pump fakes, steps up. Bud 
               Lite, chicken fighting the Black Tackle, sticks his fingers 
               in the Tackle's eyes, then cut-blocks him to the ground. The 
               Tackle falls on Bud, and smashes a fist into his ribs. Bud 
               rolls him over.

               Joe spots his flanker back, MAURICE WARD, on a flag pattern. 
               Lofts a perfect spiral to him in the corner of the endzone. 
               Touchdown.

               The crowd goes wild, as Bud Lite pushes off the Black Tackle's 
               throat getting up from the pile. Joe pumps a fist in the 
               air, hugs Ward, as the team celebrates. MUSIC BEGINS.

                                                           FADE THROUGH TO:

               ANGLE ON SCOREBOARD

               It reads E.S.U. 28, Mississippi State 20. 4th Quarter.

                                     WINTERS
                         Jefferson! In for Griffen.

               Darnell jazzed at his first chance to see action, buttons 
               his chinstrap, races onto the field.

                                     HARVEY (V.O.)
                         2:05 left. Kane hands to Jefferson...

               ANGLE ON DARNELL

               He takes a handoff, runs a trap up the middle, is hit by 
               THREE TACKLERS, clawing at the ball. They bring him down, 
               but Darnell doesn't fumble. He gets up, still clutching the 
               ball, and starts back to the huddle with it. The REFEREE 
               hustles after him.

                                     REFEREE
                         Excuse me, son, but we're gonna need 
                         that football for another couple 
                         minutes.

               Darnell, suddenly realizing, gives it up. Even Winters has 
               to laugh. We go to:

               ANGLE ON LATTIMER

               Lattimer, sacking the quarterback, tackling him high, ripping 
               his helmet off. Lattimer runs off the field, holding it up 
               like a trophy.

               The gun sounds, the game is over.

               ANGLE ON COACH WINTERS

               Accepting congratulations from his staff.

                                     WINTERS
                         Guess we'll be on the payroll for 
                         another week.

               ANGLE ON BUD LITE AND THE BLACK TACKLE

               walking off the field together, both their jerseys blood-
               stained.

                                     BUD LITE
                         Good game, man. Really enjoyed it.

                                     BLACK TACKLE
                         Yeh, you're a strong motherfucker. 
                         Shitty singer though.

               INT. PENTHOUSE HOTEL SUITE - AFTERNOON

               A reception of some sort for the players is in progress. 
               Darnell, looking a little lost, fills his cup from a punch 
               bowl. A FAT CAT ALUMNUS approaches him.

                                     ALUMNUS
                         Good to see ya in there, Darnell. 
                         Way to hold on to that pigskin.

               As he walks by, he slips an ENVELOPE into Darnell's coat 
               pocket. Darnell opens it to find a 50 dollar bill. Surprised, 
               he goes over to Alvin.

                                     DARNELL
                         Hey, some guy just gave me a 50 dollar 
                         bill.

                                     ALVIN
                         Don't worry, you'll get 5 or 6 hundred 
                         once you're startin', depending on 
                         how you play.

                                     DARNELL
                         But we're not supposed to get any 
                         are we?

                                     ALVIN
                         Hey, man, you can't live on $500 a 
                         month scholarship money. And the NC 
                         double assholes won't let us have 
                         jobs, so you take your money where 
                         you can get it.
                              (taking Darnell's 
                              envelope)
                         I'll keep it for you, till you see 
                         the light. Shit, they oughta be payin' 
                         us anyway. Athletic Department gets 
                         3 million just for goin' to a bowl 
                         game.

               INT. JOE'S ROOM - EVENING

               Joe sits alone on his bed watching T.V. He's being interviewed 
               in the locker room, a bouquet of microphones in his face.

                                     REPORTER (V.O.)
                         This performance today -- two 
                         touchdown passes, another you ran 
                         in. Where do you think this puts you 
                         in the Heisman race?

               Joe hates this question. We go to the screen.

                                     JOE
                              (uncomfortable)
                         I really have no idea. That's up to 
                         you guys.

               ANGLE ON SCREEN

               The image changes to ESPN anchor CHRIS BERMAN in the studio.

                                     BERMAN
                         Now let's turn to our Heisman watch.
                              (does the pose while 
                              remaining seated)
                         We begin with Sports Illustrated 
                         cover boy Joe Kane of E.S.U. who led 
                         his team to an impressive victory 
                         this afternoon. Well, if Joe continues 
                         to raise Kane, he may well be Able 
                         to dust off a large space on his 
                         trophy shelf. Although the real test 
                         will come in four weeks against 
                         Michigan and their Heisman hopeful, 
                         Tim Waymen.

               EXT. CAMPUS - EVENING

               Joe walks across campus, headed for Camille's dorm.

                                     BERMAN (V.O.)
                         Michigan also won big today. Timothy, 
                         "He Could Go All The Way Men", will 
                         be looking to do so against the 
                         Timberwolves. And of course the able 
                         Kane will be looking to also. I can't 
                         wait.

               INT. CAMILLE'S DORM - NIGHT

               Joe comes down the hall, knocks on Camille's door. No answer. 
               Knocks again. Nothing. Disappointed, he turns and walks away.

               INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT

               The post-game victory party is in full swing. All the players, 
               their girls and various groupies, dancing, drinking, 
               celebrating. Bud Lite and Joe stand drinking beer, watching 
               the action.

                                     BUD LITE
                         I don't know, I never seem to make 
                         out at things like this.

               Bobby, who's overheard this, walks by with Louanne.

                                     BOBBY
                         You don't make out anywhere. Or did 
                         you finally break the snatch barrier 
                         this summer?

                                     BUD LITE
                         Fuck you, Bobby.
                              (realizing Louanne's 
                              there)
                         Excuse me, Louanne.

               ANGLE ON DARNELL

               sitting across the room with Alvin but his attention is on 
               Autumn and Ray out on the dance floor. Alvin notices.

                                     ALVIN
                         Forget it, nigger. No chance for you 
                         there.

                                     DARNELL
                         Why not?

                                     ALVIN
                         Griffin's goin' to medical school. 
                         She likes that light-skinned 
                         respectable shit. You're just her 
                         ghetto toy.

               Darnell challenged by this, gets up and goes over to where 
               Ray and Autumn are standing. A slow tune plays.

                                     DARNELL
                              (to Autumn)
                         Can I have this one?

                                     RAY
                         I don't think so.

                                     DARNELL
                         What are you so worried about? You 
                         haven't lost your starting job yet.

               Autumn realizes this could quickly get out of hand.

                                     AUTUMN
                              (turning to Ray)
                         Just one.

               Ray reluctantly backs off. Darnell and Autumn start to dance. 
               Several players who've picked up on the tension, watch them 
               as they move around the floor. They try to pretend they're 
               just having a nice little chat.

                                     AUTUMN
                              (whispering)
                         Take it easy, Darnell. This isn't a 
                         good time to push things. You're 
                         putting me in an awkward position.

                                     DARNELL
                         Yeh, well, I got a little 
                         encouragement along the way.

                                     AUTUMN
                         That kiss... it was just... a kiss.

                                     DARNELL
                         Bullshit. You meant it. I wouldn't 
                         be standing here now, everybody 
                         thinkin' I'm a stupid asshole, if I 
                         didn't know you meant it. I wanna 
                         see you, Autumn. Not in study hall. 
                         Not like your student. Like somebody 
                         to be taken seriously.

                                     AUTUMN
                         I do take you seriously, Darnell, 
                         but I'm still with Ray. I can't just 
                         go paradin' around town.

                                     DARNELL
                         I don't need to go paradin'. We'll 
                         go someplace different. Someplace 
                         nobody'll see us.

               She looks at him a long beat. She doesn't need this 
               complication, this conflict, but she can't say no.

                                     AUTUMN
                         God, why am I even considering this?

               The song ends. Ray moves in to reclaim her.

                                     RAY
                              (to Darnell)
                         All caught up on your arithmetic?

               Darnell, pissed, gives Ray a shove.

                                     DARNELL
                         Yeh, you only gained 37 yards on 12 
                         carries.

               Ray lunges back at him, but quickly several players, led by 
               Joe and Bud Lite, step between them. Darnell shrugs them off 
               and leaves the party.

                                     JOE
                              (to Bud Lite)
                         Just what we need, a little team 
                         unity.

               Ray takes Autumn's arm, pulls her out onto the patio.

                                     RAY
                         I'm gettin' a little sick of this 
                         asshole, Autumn. I don't like you 
                         hangin' out with him. It's 
                         embarrassing.

                                     AUTUMN
                         I don't hang out with him. I tutor 
                         him.

                                     RAY
                         Then have him get another tutor.

                                     AUTUMN
                         I can't do that. I made a commitment 
                         to help him pass his qualifying exam. 
                         I can't bail out on him now.

                                     RAY
                         What the hell difference does it 
                         makes? They'll grease him through no 
                         matter what he does. Nobody's ever 
                         gonna see his graduation. Don't tell 
                         me you're falling for this guy. He's 
                         just another gang-banger with speed.

                                     AUTUMN
                         I just said I wanted to help him. 
                         What are you more afraid of, losing 
                         your girl or your position?

                                     RAY
                         Maybe you oughta think about what 
                         you're in danger of losing.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Maybe I will.

               Autumn rips free of his grip, and walks out of the party 
               too.

               EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

               Darnell sits alone on a bench under an old Willow, just 
               staring out at the night. He hears a voice behind him.

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         So where you wanna go?

               He turns. It's Autumn.

               INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT

               The party's still in full gear. Ray is now chatting up a few 
               of the groupies. Joe and Bud Lite sit off in a corner. Joe's 
               knocked back several beers. He's a little tipsy, and lost in 
               thought.

                                     JOE
                         Maybe she's out with some guy.

                                     BUD
                         Who? Camille? I don't think she's 
                         the type to screw around on ya. Shoot 
                         ya, maybe...

                                     JOE
                         It wouldn't be screwing around. It's 
                         not like we're going together.

               Joe's gaze falls on a sultry brunette, SHERI, at a table 
               across the way. She's eyeing Joe big time. She wants him. He 
               stares back at her. She doesn't blink.

               EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Camille, carrying an armload of books, comes down the library 
               steps, having been studying late. As she heads for her dorm, 
               she sees Joe and Sheri going across the Quad; Sheri draped 
               around Joe, nuzzling him.

               Joe looks over, spots Camille, stops; surprised, embarrassed 
               to see her. They exchange a look. Camille, upset, turns and 
               wheels off. Joe wants to say something to her, but can't get 
               it out.

               ON DARNELL AND AUTUMN

               We don't know where yet, but they seem to be slipping and 
               sliding, clutching on to each other.

                                     AUTUMN
                         You're right, nobody would ever see 
                         us here.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT

               Near closing time. Darnell and Autumn lurch and stumble around 
               the ice, collapsing against the boards now and then. There 
               are few other skaters at this hour.

                                     DARNELL
                         Yes, I figure the key is to go places 
                         only white people go. Next time we'll 
                         go bowling.

               Autumn laughs, as the house lights start to blink, indicating 
               it's closing time.

                                     DARNELL
                         Plus I saw this in Rocky. I never 
                         believed a guy who was supposed to 
                         be an athlete would skate that bad, 
                         but now I know.

               They make their way to an opening in the boards, stumble 
               over to a bench, begin to unlace.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Thanks, that was fun, sort of.

                                     DARNELL
                         You were pretty good for the first 
                         time.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Well, it's not really my first time. 
                         My dad took me skating once.

                                     DARNELL
                         He used to play ball for E.S.U., 
                         didn't he?

                                     AUTUMN
                         Yeah, how'd you know that?

                                     DARNELL
                         I saw his picture on the Wall of 
                         Fame. You got his eyes. Luckily, you 
                         didn't get his thighs.

               She laughs, looks at him a beat, starts to come forward to 
               kiss him. He puts a finger to her lips.

                                     DARNELL
                         Make sure you mean it this time.

               She hesitates a beat, then comes forward again. They fall 
               into a deep kiss. We PULL BACK to LONGSHOT. Two people alone 
               in the expanse of the ice rink. The lights flicker and go 
               out.

               INT. WEIGHT ROOM - LATE NIGHT

               Camille, unable to sleep, enters in her workout clothes. 
               Languid, melancholy, she goes to the treadmill, as Joe comes 
               out of the steam room with nothing but a towel around his 
               waist. Both are surprised to see the other.

                                     JOE
                         What are you doin' here?

                                     CAMILLE
                         Couldn't sleep.

                                     JOE
                         I was just sweatin' out some of the 
                         beer.

               Camille just nods. Long, silent pause.

                                     JOE
                         I didn't go home with her. I thought 
                         about it... but I didn't.

                                     CAMILLE
                         You drink too much.

                                     JOE
                         Yeh.

               He turns, starts toward the door.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Why didn't you?

                                     JOE
                         Why didn't I what?

                                     CAMILLE
                         Go home with her?

                                     JOE
                         I don't know... I guess I figured 
                         maybe there was somethin' goin' on 
                         between you and me.

               Camille hesitates, not sure whether to believe him, then 
               gets off the bike and walks toward him.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Then why'd you pick her up in the 
                         first place?

                                     JOE
                         I was drunk... I needed some company.

                                     CAMILLE
                              (angry)
                         Company? Yeh, I can see you havin' a 
                         real far-ranging discussion with 
                         Sheri.

                                     JOE
                         I mean, ya know, physical company... 
                         I was... I just needed to pounce on 
                         somebody I guess.

               Camille, really steamed now, snatches the towel from around 
               Joe's waist, leaving him naked.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Why can't you pounce on me? Aren't I 
                         good enough to pounce on?

               Camille snaps the towel at him, driving him back. Joe's 
               totally thrown by this reaction in her.

                                     JOE
                         Well, you're more conservative... 
                         classier... you're not that kinda 
                         girl...

               She snaps the towel again, backing him against the training 
               table.

                                     CAMILLE
                              (insulted)
                         How do you know? You've never slept 
                         with me.

               She pounds on his chest, pushing him back on the table.

                                     CAMILLE
                         What makes you think she's such a 
                         great ride?
                              (climbing up on top 
                              of him)
                         I'm prettier, my legs are longer...
                              (pulling down her 
                              leotard)
                         I've got better tits.
                              (exasperated)
                         Why would you go to her, when you 
                         have me?

                                     JOE
                         I didn't know I had you.

                                     CAMILLE
                              (softer, leaning close)
                         Well you do.

               He looks at her a beat, then pulls her mouth down to his. 
               They fall into a long, white-hot kiss.

               INT. THE TRAINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Joe and Camille are making love passionately, energetically. 
               Camille, still worked up, rolls up on top.

                                     CAMILLE
                              (between kisses)
                         You shoulda looked for me at the 
                         library, or don't you ever go there?

                                     JOE
                              (rolling back on top)
                         I go there. I got a 3.2 in Political 
                         Science. I just don't go there on 
                         Saturday nights.

                                     CAMILLE
                              (rolling back on top 
                              again)
                         I have a paper due Monday. What'de 
                         she do? Sit on your lap or just give 
                         you the nail-me stare?

                                     JOE
                         Shut up, Camille.

               Joe rolls back on top, the momentum carrying both of them 
               off the table and out of sight.

               INT. HUGE LECTURE HALL - MORNING

               Some 100 students are taking a history test in blue books. A 
               T.A., checking attendance, walks up to Louanne. She's uneasy 
               as the T.A. checks his chart.

                                     T.A.
                         What's your name?

                                     LOUANNE
                         Bobby Collins.

                                     T.A.
                         Can I see your I.D.?

               Louanne knows she's in deep trouble.

               INT. COACH'S VIDEO ROOM - DAY

               A high-tech room full of video machines and monitors used to 
               run simultaneous views of different positions during the 
               same play. A grim-looking group of assistant coaches 
               approaches Winters as he runs through and reprograms the 
               images on the screen.

                                     CLAYTON
                         Coach, we, ah... got a problem with 
                         Bobby Collins.

                                     WINTERS
                         Yeh...

                                     CLAYTON
                         He talked... a friend... into taking 
                         a test for him and got caught. They 
                         had a new T.A. in there...

                                     WINTERS
                         What's the penalty?

                                     CLAYTON
                         Well, the rules say automatic 
                         expulsion for both of them.

                                     WINTERS
                         Fortunately, we've got friends on 
                         the Board of Regents. I think we can 
                         beat this if we really go to bat for 
                         him. We got Mack off when he turned 
                         in that other guys term paper.
                              (shaking his head)
                         But what kinda idiot would do 
                         something like that?

                                     CLAYTON
                         Well, I guess Bobby figured he was 
                         gonna flunk...

                                     WINTERS
                         I don't mean Bobby. I mean what kinda 
                         guy would be dumb enough to take a 
                         test for him?

                                     CLAYTON
                         Uh, well... it wasn't a guy.

                                     WINTERS
                         A girl? Typical Collins. He must 
                         have banged her until she couldn't 
                         think straight. Who was it?

                                     CLAYTON
                              (barely able to get 
                              it out)
                         It was... Louanne.

               Winters' face goes dead.

               INT. COACH WINTERS' DEN - DAY

               Winters, enraged, is venting his spleen at Louanne.

                                     WINTERS
                         Jesus, Louanne, how could you be so 
                         stupid?

                                     LOUANNE
                         I... he was behind, he needed help. 
                         I'm sorry. I just...

                                     WINTERS
                         Sorry! You're sorry! You've destroyed 
                         my credibility at the University, my 
                         authority with the players... Christ, 
                         it looks like I'm running a dirty 
                         program. And Collins of all people! 
                         What the hell's the matter with you, 
                         Louanne?

                                     LOUANNE
                              (crying)
                         I don't know... I thought he... loved 
                         me...

                                     WINTERS
                         Loved you? He loves anything that 
                         winks back, the little rat bastard. 
                         And what are you gonna do for school 
                         now? I use my influence to get you 
                         back in, it'll stink to high hell. 
                         The press'll crucify me.

                                     LOUANNE
                         I'll get in someplace.

                                     WINTERS
                         God, Louanne, I told you to stay 
                         away from my players. That was my 
                         cardinal rule, stay away from the 
                         damn players...

                                     LOUANNE
                         They've always been good enough for 
                         you. Good enough to devote your life 
                         to. Why aren't they good enough for 
                         me? Or are they too good?

                                     WINTERS
                         You're changing the subject, Louanne. 
                         We're talkin' about you breakin' the 
                         rules.

                                     LOUANNE
                         Didn't you ever break the rules just 
                         a little? Didn't you tell me once 
                         that 90 per cent of the schools obey 
                         the NCAA rules, and the other 10 per 
                         cent go to bowl games? Was that just 
                         a joke?

               She gets up and walks out of the room. Winters closes his 
               eyes and slumps down on the couch.

               INT. STUDY HALL - NIGHT

               Darnell sits at his table waiting for Autumn. Autumn storms 
               in, obviously upset about something. She slaps a corrected 
               test down in front of him.

                                     AUTUMN
                         You seen this? You got a D on your 
                         math test.

                                     DARNELL
                         Yeh, I kinda figured that. I had 
                         some trouble on this last part...

                                     AUTUMN
                         We went over that last week, Darnell. 
                         What is this time we spend in here? 
                         Just a joke to you? I don't even 
                         think you've been listening to me.

                                     DARNELL
                         I've been listening to you, baby...

                                     AUTUMN
                         Don't call me baby. I thought you 
                         wanted to learn. But if all you wanta 
                         do is fake your way through, then 
                         get another tutor to waste time with.

                                     DARNELL
                         C'mon, Autumn, we just had a good 
                         time, and now you're gettin' all 
                         nuts behind this. It's just one test.

                                     AUTUMN
                         So far, it's the only test. I want 
                         you to study this whole chapter. By 
                         yourself, without me here. When I 
                         come back, we'll discuss it. Be ready 
                         to do problems based on it.

                                     DARNELL
                         Whatever you say, Teach.
                              (big grin)
                         I don't wish to be cast in a 
                         pejorative light, so I'm dedicating 
                         myself to achieving on a level more 
                         commensurate with my abilities.

               She shakes her head and walks away. Darnell's grin fades. He 
               looks at his test, a hint of tears in his eyes. He's 
               embarrassed and deeply worried.

               INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - DAY

               The players are dressing for Monday practice, but it's 
               strangely subdued. Bobby Collins opens his locker to find a 
               BULLET-RIDDLED PRACTICE JERSEY hanging inside. Immediately 
               the rest of the players burst into raucous laughter.

                                     BUD LITE
                         Coach'd probably shoot ya lower.

               Suddenly the room goes silent. Standing in the doorway is 
               Coach Winters.

               He says nothing, looks around the room, the players avoiding 
               his gaze. His eyes come to rest on Bobby. Bobby tries to 
               hide the shirt, but Winters has seen. Winters just stares at 
               Bobby a beat, then.

                                     WINTERS
                         You all played a fine game on 
                         Saturday. Take the day off.

               With that, he turns and walks out the door. The players remain 
               silent. Bobby throws the shirt in the trash.

               INT. LOUANNE'S SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

               Winters walks in the front door, past the desk, up the stairs 
               and down the hall to his daughter's room. She's packing her 
               things. He goes over to her, takes her in his arms and hugs 
               her tight. Neither speak. A tear rolls down Louanne's cheek. 
               Hits the floor.

               EXT. HALL OF ATHLETIC BUILDING - DAY

               A very nervous Bobby Collins comes down the hall and knocks 
               on Coach Winter's door.

                                     WINTERS
                         C'mon in, Collins.

               INT. COACH WINTER'S OFFICE

               Bobby enters and stands across from Winters' desk. Winters 
               doesn't invite him to sit.

                                     BOBBY
                         Listen, Coach, I just want you to 
                         know I'm really sorry about this 
                         whole thing with Louanne. I was real 
                         glad to hear she's gonna be goin' to 
                         junior college here...

                                     WINTERS
                              (cutting him off)
                         Shut up.

               Bobby does. Instantly.

                                     WINTERS
                         I could easily take your case to the 
                         Board of Regents. You've had no prior 
                         infractions and I could argue that 
                         you were under abnormal pressure.
                              (pause)
                         But I won't. You embarrassed me, you 
                         embarrassed my family, you embarrassed 
                         the program. As of now, you are no 
                         longer a member of this university 
                         or it's football team. Clean out 
                         your locker.

               Bobby just stands there a beat, in confusion and disbelief. 
               There is no wavering, no sympathy in Winters' eyes. Finally, 
               dazed and disoriented, Bobby turns and walks out.

               EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY

               Joe is posed in front of the school library, one of it's 
               more photogenic buildings. T.V. sportscaster LYNN SWANN and 
               his video crew wait to interview him as a MAKEUP GIRL finishes 
               applying makeup to Joe's face. Publicist Sharon Braver watches 
               like a hawk.

                                     SWANN
                              (to his cameraman)
                         We ready, Jerry? O.K., let's mark 
                         it.

               An assistant marks the take, and Swann turns to Joe.

                                     SWANN
                         Joe, this game is being billed as a 
                         potential "Heisman Shootout". Did 
                         you feel any added pressure this 
                         week...

               EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

               A phalanx of photographers crowd around, snapping away as 
               Joe goes through passing drills.

                                     SWANN (V.O.)
                         ...knowing that you're going head to 
                         head with Heisman rival, Tim Waymen?

               EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY, THE PRESENT AGAIN

                                     JOE
                         Well, ya know, you try to block it 
                         out, but it's basically impossible... 
                         Everybody seems to be talkin' about 
                         it, all the newspapers, the 
                         interviews...

               INT. T.V. STUDIO - NIGHT

               Joe is being interviewed by DALLAS PERRY on a local television 
               show.

                                     JOE (V.O.)
                         The hype on T.V., tryin' to get 
                         somethin' goin...

               EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - THE PRESENT AGAIN

               Sharon Braver steps directly in front of the video camera, 
               waves off the take.

                                     BRAVER
                         Hold it! Hold it!

                                     SWANN
                         What?! What's the problem?

               Braver takes Joe aside, talks to him confidentially.

                                     BRAVER
                         What you're saying is true, of course, 
                         but I don't think it's the message 
                         you want to send.

               INT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT

               Joe and Camille are sharing a pizza, but not alone. A video 
               spotlight shines on them, as yet another crew rolls tape.

                                     BRAVER (V.O.)
                         It makes you seem a little nervous. 
                         Like the pressure might be getting 
                         to you.

               EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - THE PRESENT AGAIN

                                     BRAVER
                         This game is nationally televised, 
                         so most Heisman voters will be 
                         watching. I think a more casual 
                         approach is better. Modest, 
                         controlled, casual.

               Joe nods and heads back in front of the camera.

                                     SWANN
                              (to Braver, irritated)
                         We all set now?
                              (gets a nod)
                         Let's mark it.
                              (the take is marked)
                         Joe, this game is being billed as a 
                         potential "Heisman Shootout."

               EXT. E.S.U. QUAD - NIGHT

               A huge bonfire burns, as a large segment of the student body 
               has gathered in front of the Timberwolf statue. The 
               cheerleaders, all wearing "KANE IS ABLE" buttons, whip the 
               crowd up, as Joe is introduced on the podium.

                                     SWANN (V.O.)
                         Did you feel any added pressure this 
                         week, knowing that you're going head 
                         to head with Heisman rival, Tim 
                         Waymen?

               The cheerleaders begin to chant, "Let's go, Joe." On "Joe", 
               they assume the Heisman trophy pose. Joe seems slightly 
               embarrassed by it all.

               EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - THE PRESENT AGAIN

                                     JOE
                         No, I don't really think too much 
                         about that kinda thing.

               Swann shoots Braver a poisonous look.

               EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

               Joe and Camille sit on a bank looking down at the railroad 
               tracks below. Neither says anything. Joe seems strangely 
               preoccupied. Camille decides to break the silence.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Your parents comin' to the game 
                         tomorrow?

                                     JOE
                         My mom's dead. My dad has never seen 
                         me play.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Why not?

                                     JOE
                         Guess he's not that interested in 
                         football.

                                     CAMILLE
                         But you're one of the best players 
                         in the country.

                                     JOE
                              (snapping)
                         He's just not into it, o.k.?

                                     CAMILLE
                              (chastised)
                         O.k.
                              (silence)
                         What's goin' on, Joe? You ask me out 
                         here, like you wanta talk about 
                         somethin', then you don't say 
                         anything. You worried about tomorrow?

                                     JOE
                         No... I'm worried about the days 
                         after that. I just. I don't know... 
                         I feel like tomorrow's gonna be my 
                         last game. I want to stay up, make 
                         the time go slow.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Why would it be your last game? You 
                         afraid of getting hurt?

                                     JOE
                         No, that'd be a relief. Then, at 
                         least, I wouldn't be a failure.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Joe, why are you thinking like this? 
                         Why would you be a failure? You're 
                         having a great year, you're a Heisman 
                         Trophy candidate, you got millions 
                         of dollars waiting for you in the 
                         pros.

                                     JOE
                              (testy)
                         How do you know what's waiting for 
                         me? You don't know me at all.

                                     CAMILLE
                              (hurt)
                         I don't know you? How can you say 
                         that?

                                     JOE
                         Because you wouldn't be here now if 
                         you did. You only know the guy that's 
                         supposed to make millions in the 
                         pros.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Is that what you think? That I'm 
                         with you for the money?

                                     JOE
                         Why else?

               Infuriated, she slaps him across the face.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Fuck you, Joe.
                              (starting to cry)
                         I don't give a shit about your money. 
                         I don't even give a shit about 
                         football. And you know what? Maybe 
                         you're right, maybe I don't know 
                         you.

               She turns and storms away up the hill, as we hear a TRAIN 
               WHISTLE. Joe watches her go, then starts down the hill toward 
               the tracks as the train comes into view.

               Camille stops, turns back, sees Joe headed for the tracks, 
               starts to worry.

               Joe reaches the grade and steps into the middle of the tracks 
               facing the oncoming train. Horrified, Camille runs down the 
               embankment toward him.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Joe! Joe! My god, Joe, what are you 
                         doing? No! No!

               As the train approaches, it's horn blaring, Joe lies face 
               down on the tracks, his hands gripping the railroad ties. 
               Camille arrives at the bottom of the hill in time to see the 
               train race over him. She falls to her knees screaming.

               Under the train, we see Joe desperately hugging the ground, 
               head down, toes dug in, hands clutching the ties. It's like 
               a tornado under there, dirt debris flying everywhere, his 
               clothes flapping wildly.

               The train passes. Camille looks up, afraid to breath as Joe 
               lies motionless on the tracks. Suddenly he stirs, pushes 
               himself up to his knees. She lets out a scream of joy, races 
               toward him, as he gets to his feet, stumbles off the grade. 
               She hugs him to her, tears streaming down her face, helps 
               him over to the embankment.

                                     CAMILLE
                         God Joe, oh god, are you allright?

                                     JOE
                              (drained)
                         Yeh, just got some dirt in my teeth. 
                         Guess you've really seen the dark 
                         side now, huh? You should've gotten 
                         out while you had the chance. Before 
                         it all goes to hell.

                                     CAMILLE
                         I don't wanta get out, damnit. What's 
                         wrong Joe? Why would it all go to 
                         hell?

                                     JOE
                         I'm a Kane, Camille. That's all it 
                         takes. We're cut out to be drunks 
                         and fuck-ups. We never live up to 
                         expectations. It's in our blood. My 
                         dad, brothers, uncles -- we all drink 
                         and sooner or later we all fuck up. 
                         My dad went the longest. Waited till 
                         he was playin' triple A ball, before 
                         he hit the wall. Sometimes I feel 
                         like I'm just waiting for my turn. 
                         The better I do, the closer it gets.

                                     CAMILLE
                         You're not like them, you can beat 
                         all that. You can stop drinking, you 
                         can break the chain.

                                     JOE
                         If I gave up that, I wouldn't be 
                         much of a football player. And if I 
                         wasn't a football player, what would 
                         I be?

               The question hangs in the air.

                                     CAMILLE
                         You'de still be Joe. And I'd still 
                         love you.

               He pulls her to him, kisses her hair, they slump against 
               each other.

                                     JOE
                         Just don't say I never warned you.

               EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - DAY

               STEVE ZABRISKIE and BO SCHEMBECKLER in the foreground, the 
               jammed to capacity stadium in the background. This shot is 
               going out on nationwide T.V., the college Game of the Week.

                                     ZABRISKIE
                         4:29 to go and it's been a great 
                         one. Two undefeated teams goin' after 
                         each other. Michigan up by four, 24-
                         20, but the lead has changed hands 
                         three times, and you get the feeling 
                         that whoever has the ball last is 
                         gonna win it.

               ANGLE ON FIELD

               Joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage. Yells 
               signals.

                                     SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)
                         Well, it was billed as a Heisman 
                         shootout, and it's been all of that. 
                         Both Waymen and Kane moving their 
                         teams up and down the field, having 
                         big days.

               Joe fades to pass, looks right, looks left, can't find a 
               receiver, decides to run for it. He sprints up the middle, 
               15, 10; a SAFETY comes at him at the 5. We see

               Joe's P.O.V. through HELMETCAM. He pushes the lunging safety 
               away, turns back just in time to be blasted by the OTHER 
               SAFETY he never saw. Joe is knocked down, over the goal line 
               and out cold. The crowd goes wild.

                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
                         Kane back to pass, can't find anybody, 
                         gonna run it himself, ten, five, hit 
                         at the goal-line... Touchdown E.S.U.!! 
                         Great run by Kane!

               Joe lies motionless as his teamates run over to him.

                                     SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)
                         He's still down. Looks like he's 
                         hurt.

               We go to Winters, worried on the sideline, as the celebration 
               around him begins to die down.

               ANGLE ON JOE

               As he's carried off the field, his arms around two linemen's 
               shoulders, and lowered onto the bench. We go to a BLURRY 
               IMAGE of a man's face waving something. We REVERSE to REVEAL 
               a DOCTOR waving smelling salts under Joe's nose. Joe begins 
               to come around. The doctor holds up two fingers.

                                     DOCTOR
                         How many fingers am I holding up?

                                     JOE
                         Four.

               EXT. THE FIELD - DAY

               Michigan comes to the line of scrimmage. As Tim Waymen gets 
               under center, Alvin begins to yell at him.

                                     ALVIN
                         Hey, powderpuff. You're the white 
                         boy that ratted my brother out. Sent 
                         him to jail, cocksucker. Ran off 
                         with the fuckin' money. Left the 
                         blood to do the time, huh?

               Waymen begins to call signals.

                                     ALVIN
                         Yeh, you're the little bastard. 
                         Account of you, my bros' datin' his 
                         cell mate. You hear me, powderpuff? 
                         Gonna make you pay. You gonna be my 
                         cellmate now. You gonna have 250 
                         lbs. of pissed-off nigger up your 
                         ass.

                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
                         E.S.U. in an eight-man line looking 
                         for the run on third and short.

               The ball is snapped. Waymen fakes a handoff to his fullback, 
               hides the ball on his hip, fades to pass. On the sideline, 
               Coach Winters yells, "Pass! Pass!"

               Alvin's not fooled by the run, he shakes his blocker and 
               takes dead aim on Waymen. Just as Waymen releases the ball, 
               Alvin blasts him, driving him into the turf.

                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
                         Waymen fakes to Simms, Mack on the 
                         blitz, Waymen is goin for it all! 
                         Hit as he throws.

               The ball, however, flies through the air, a perfect spiral. 
               The E.S.U. secondary has been fooled by the play fake and is 
               a step behind. The ball comes down in the hands of the 
               Michigan tight end, JERRY HUNT.

                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
                         Hunt has got a step. He's got it! 
                         Touchdown!

               Winters slams his headphones to the ground.

                                     SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)
                         Great clutch throw under pressure. 
                         Can't do it much better than that.

               ANGLE ON JOE

               The Doctor examines Joe, shines a light in his eyes, makes 
               him track his finger, etc.

                                     DOCTOR
                         You're vision's back to normal.

                                     WINTERS
                         You think you can go?

                                     JOE
                         Yeh, I'm fine. Just a little headache.
                              (getting up, shouting 
                              to his teamates)
                         O.K. Offense, let's get it back.

               Alvin, meanwhile, plops down on the bench in disgust.

                                     ALVIN
                         Damn tough to scare that little white 
                         boy. Either his momma dropped him on 
                         his head, or the motherfucker is 
                         deaf.

               Coach Winters goes to Darnell.

                                     WINTERS
                         Jefferson, in for Griffen.

               Griffen slams his helmet to the ground.

               EXT. FIELD - DAY

               Joe breaks the huddle as the E.S.U. offense comes to the 
               line.

                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
                         Ball on the Michigan 47, 1:02 to go, 
                         Kane brings 'em to the line of 
                         scrimmage.

               Joe fades to pass once again, lets the rush come, then flares 
               out a screen pass to Darnell. Darnell grabs it and takes 
               off, slipping tackles, cutting back, juking. Darnell finally 
               runs out of bounds at the twenty.

                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
                         Great run by Jefferson, the highly-
                         touted Freshman, the longest of the 
                         day for the Wolves. And this one is 
                         turning out to be everything we 
                         thought it would be.

               ANGLE ON DARNELL

               coming back to the huddle, pumped up. Joe kneels in the 
               center.

                                     JOE
                         O.K., time to put the women and 
                         children to bed, and go looking for 
                         dinner.

               He begins to howl, as do all the others. The Call of the 
               Wild.

                                     JOE
                         82 Strike, Eagle, Crown, on 2.

               They clap hands, come to the line. Joe looks over the defense, 
               bends under center and barks signals, The ball is snapped. 
               Action goes to SLOW MOTION.

               Joe fakes to Darnell, fades to pass. The Michigan cornerback 
               comes on a blitz, locked on Joe. Joe starts to roll, but 
               knows the corner will catch him. On the run, he launches the 
               ball toward Darnell. Darnell opens his hands to receive it, 
               but at the last second, the Michigan SAFETY steps in front 
               and intercepts it.

                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
                         Kane looking for Jefferson. It's... 
                         Intercepted! Intercepted by Freeman! 
                         And that should do it.

               Joe sinks to his knees in frustration. The blitzing cornerback 
               does a quick pit-pat on Joe's helmet. Winters looks like 
               he's been punched.

               As Michigan and Tim Waymen celebrate on the sideline, we go

               INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - AFTERNOON

               Steve Zabriskie is doing the wrap-up, the emptying stadium 
               behind him.

                                     ZABRISKIE
                         Well, it was everything we expected 
                         it to be. Fine performances on both 
                         sides of the field.

               INT. E.S.U. LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Players undress and shower in relative silence. No joy here.

                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
                         The edge in the much ballyhooed battle 
                         of the quarterbacks would probably 
                         have to go to Michigan's Tim Waymen 
                         who threw for 2 touchdowns, and ran 
                         for another. Joe Kane accounted for 
                         three E.S.U. touchdowns, but had 
                         that crucial interception in the 
                         waning moments. And that proved to 
                         be the difference.

               The door of the locker room opens, and a flood of reporters 
               enter. Joe hides back in the showers, leaning his forehead 
               against the wall, the water coursing over him.

               EXT. TUNNEL BENEATH STADIUM - LATE AFTERNOON

               Darnell comes out of the locker room, having showered and 
               dressed. He's surprised to see Autumn and her father talking 
               to Coach Humes.

                                     DARNELL
                         Hey, Autumn.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Hi, Darnell.

                                     DARNELL
                         Is this your dad?

                                     AUTUMN
                         Yes...

                                     DARNELL
                         How do you do, Mr. Haley. I'm Darnell 
                         Jefferson.

                                     MR. HALEY
                         Jefferson? Nice run you made on that 
                         screen pass. Another block and you 
                         might have scored.

                                     DARNELL
                         Thank you. We'll get 'em next year.

                                     MR. HALEY
                         How do you and Autumn know each other? 
                         You a friend of Ray's?

               Darnell is jolted by this question. It's obvious that Autumn 
               has never told her dad about him.

                                     AUTUMN
                              (filling the void)
                         Ah, I tutor him...

                                     MR. HALEY
                         Oh really? In what?

               Darnell would like to crawl under a rock.

                                     DARNELL
                         Math and English.

                                     MR. HALEY
                         Ah.

               There's a slight tone of condescension in Mr. Haley's voice. 
               He realizes Darnell hasn't passed his entrance exam. This is 
               not lost on Darnell.

                                     MR. HALEY
                         Well, stay on top of that, Darnell. 
                         I'd have been in real trouble if I 
                         hadn't gotten my degree. I played 
                         ball once. Hurt my knee.

                                     DARNELL
                         Yeh, I know...

                                     MR. HALEY
                         I used to put a copy of my report 
                         card inside the webbing of my helmet 
                         to remind me that college was more 
                         important than football.

                                     DARNELL
                              (forcing enthusiasm)
                         Good idea. Well, I gotta get goin'. 
                         Nice to meet you Mr. Haley.

                                     MR. HALEY
                         Nice to meet you, Darnell.

                                     DARNELL
                         See you around, Autumn.

               Before Autumn can respond, Ray Griffen approaches from the 
               other direction.

                                     RAY
                         Hey, Mr. Haley. Good to see you.

                                     MR. HALEY
                         Hey, Ray. You still havin' dinner 
                         with us tonight?

               Darnell embarrassed and humiliated, hears all this as he 
               walks away. Autumn wants to go explain, but can't in front 
               of her father.

               INT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

               The post-game party. Not as raucous as after the opening 
               game victory. A few players are dancing, but most are sitting, 
               drinking, commiserating.

                                     BUD LITE
                              (to Alvin)
                         Anybody seen Joe?

                                     ALVIN
                         Not yet. Probably out with Camille. 
                         Haven't seen Darnell either.

               INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Lattimer's sitting on the bed with a coed named LESLIE. 
               They're kissing softly, light necking. Lattimer starts to 
               unbutton her blouse. She begins to demur.

                                     LESLIE
                         I think we better get back downstairs.

                                     LATTIMER
                         No, Leslie, we're just getting to 
                         know each other.

                                     LESLIE
                              (starting to get up)
                         No, I think...

               Lattimer grabs her arm roughly, pulls her back to the bed. 
               She's starting to get a little scared.

                                     LATTIMER
                         C'mon Leslie, you didn't come up 
                         here to stop now.

               He tries to kiss her again, she pushes him away, starts for 
               the door. Angered, that steroid pump in his eyes, he grabs 
               her again, throws her violently on the bed. She screams.

                                     LATTIMER
                         What were you doin'? Leadin' me on?

               He gets on the bed, kneels above her. She starts to struggle. 
               He slaps her across the face, rips her blouse open. Freaked, 
               she begins to scream and kick. Enraged, Lattimer slaps her 
               around, picks her up, shakes her like a rag doll, slaps her 
               some more, throws her to the floor. Picks her up again, when 
               suddenly the door BURSTS OPEN and Bud Lite and Alvin race 
               in.

                                     LATTIMER
                              (throwing Leslie on 
                              the bed again)
                         Get outa here!

               Bud Lite and Alvin charge Lattimer, try to wrestle him down, 
               but his hormone level is so high, he fights like a bull. Two 
               other players charge in and finally all four are able to 
               shackle Lattimer. He continues to struggle a bit, then gives 
               up, a panting, sweating, shaking hulk.

                                     BUD
                         This is it, man. No more 'roids. 
                         This shit has gotta stop.

               Lattimer breaks down and cries.

               INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Joe lies on his bed, a bottle of vodka next to his coca-cola. 
               He stares at the larger than life cardboard stand-up of 
               himself. He takes a drink, then gets up and grabs his jacket. 
               The phone rings. He looks at it a beat, then walks out of 
               the room.

               INT. CAMILLE'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Camille's on the phone, waiting, the one calling Joe. She 
               listens a few more rings, hangs up, concerned.

               INT. WINTERS HIGH-TECH VIDEO ROOM - NIGHT

               Winters sits at the main console replaying the game-ending 
               interception over and over. The phone rings.

                                     WINTERS
                         Hello, yeh... What?!

               INT. WINTERS ATHLETIC OFFICE - NIGHT

               The rest of the locker room is dark except for the light on 
               in Winters' office. All the assistant coaches are there.

                                     CLAYTON
                         It looks like this will blow over. 
                         The girl's father is a big booster, 
                         contributed a lotta money. So he 
                         said they won't go to the press.

                                     WINTERS
                         He said that? The father?

                                     CLAYTON
                         Yeh, he's not exactly happy about 
                         all this, but he doesn't wanta hurt 
                         the program.

                                     WINTERS
                         We're still gonna have to suspend 
                         Lattimer.

                                     HUMES
                         What for? There aren't any charges. 
                         Nobody outside the program knows 
                         about this.

                                     WINTERS
                         He's outa control, Lyle. We can't 
                         ignore this anymore. I don't know 
                         what pisses me off more -- that he's 
                         juicin' or that he's doin' such a 
                         shitty job of hidin' it.

                                     HUMES
                         He's never tested positive. If we 
                         suspend him without proof, he could 
                         sue us for jeopardizing his draft 
                         status, his pro career.

                                     WINTERS
                         Yeh, but we can't sit and wait till 
                         he kills somebody. I hate to lose 
                         him as much as you do, but we gotta 
                         clean him up before he does somethin' 
                         that lands the whole program on 
                         probation. Plus, we have to take 
                         some action or the girl's dad is 
                         gonna start havin' second thoughts. 
                         I don't care how many checks he's 
                         written.

                                     CLAYTON
                         So what do we do?

               All eyes go to Winters.

                                     WINTERS
                         Bring him down here.

               INT. COACH WINTERS LOCKER ROOM OFFICE - 20 MINUTES LATER

               Close on a contrite, but shaken Steve Lattimer.

                                     LATTIMER
                         Three games? Why so many?

                                     WINTERS
                         You oughta be grateful I didn't 
                         suspend you for the whole year.

               Lattimer nods, he knows it's true.

                                     LATTIMER
                         What are you gonna give as the reason?

                                     WINTERS
                         We'll say you've got a hamstring 
                         pull.

                                     LATTIMER
                              (relieved)
                         Thank you, Coach.

                                     WINTERS
                         Don't thank me. During those three 
                         weeks, you better kick the roids, 
                         cause when you come back I'm gonna 
                         personally test you before every 
                         game. No N.C.A.A. shit either. I'm 
                         gonna watch the piss go into the 
                         bottle. You got that?

                                     LATTIMER
                              (barely audible, shamed)
                         Yes, sir.

                                     WINTERS
                         Start practicing your limp.

               INT. LOCAL BAR - NIGHT

               Not the 911 we saw earlier. Joe sits at a table in the back, 
               with Darnell, drinking tequila with a beer chaser. Both are 
               down in the dumps. At a nearby table there's a group of 
               TOWNIES and their GIRLFRIENDS.

                                     JOE
                         Coupla real college heroes, huh? 
                         Tearin' up the town.

                                     DARNELL
                         First time I ever lost a girl and a 
                         game on the same day. Guess I never 
                         really had the girl.

               Joe looks up to see one of the townies' girls, DEBBIE, giving 
               him the once over and a little smile. Joe smiles back, not 
               really interested. Debbie's BOYFRIEND notices.

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         You know that guy?

                                     DEBBI
                         Not really...

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         Then why you smilin' at him?

                                     DEBBI
                         I don't know... he looks like that 
                         E.S.U. quarterback guy. Joe, what's 
                         his name?

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         So what? So you go and smile at him?

               The boyfriend, drunk and looking for trouble, goes over to 
               Joe's table.

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         You been lookin' at my girlfriend?

                                     JOE
                              (a little drunk himself)
                         I don't know. Which one is she?

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         Wise guy, huh? Mr. bigtime 
                         quarterback. The one who choked his 
                         ass off today. You got nothin' better 
                         to do then look at my girlfriend?

               Joe says nothing.

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         Hey, Heisman, I'm talkin' to you. 
                         You too good to talk to me?

                                     JOE
                         I'm not even interested in talkin' 
                         to you.

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         You think you're a bad ass? You think 
                         my girl's hot for you? Take your 
                         pads off, you're just another pussy.

               Joe gets up to go. The boyfriend grabs him, Joe pushes him 
               away. The guy charges Joe. The bar owner rushes to the phone 
               as a full scale brawl begins. Joe takes a blow, knocks the 
               boyfriend back into a table, knocking beer bottles to the 
               floor. The boyfriend falls on one, opening a deep gash in 
               his shoulder.

                                     DARNELL
                              (grabbing him)
                         C'mon we gotta get outa here.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               A speeding car goes by us, weaving, crossing the yellow line 
               on the curves.

               INT. SPEEDING CAR - NIGHT

               Joe's driving, Darnell's holding on. Suddenly we hear SIRENS. 
               Joe sees flashing lights in the rear-view mirror.

                                     JOE
                         Oh shit...

               INT. COACH WINTERS' HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

               Winters is asleep. The phone rings. He picks it up.

                                     WINTERS
                         What is it now?... Oh Jesus...

               INT. COACH WINTERS' STADIUM OFFICE - DAY

               Joe sits across the desk from Winters, just the two of them.

                                     JOE
                         The guy went for me first. What was 
                         I supposed to do?

                                     WINTERS
                         Doesn't make any difference. It made 
                         the papers, all the wire services. 
                         The guy had to go to the hospital. 
                         Worst of all they got you on drunk 
                         driving. You had a blood alcohol 
                         level .50 above the legal limit. We 
                         can't smooth that over, Joe. It'd 
                         look like we were sprayin' Pledge on 
                         bird shit. We had to agree to send 
                         you to Rehab.

                                     JOE
                         Rehab? I'll be a god-damn joke. You 
                         can't do this to me.

                                     WINTERS
                         It was the only way we could get 
                         them to drop the assault and D.W.I. 
                         You go to trial on those, we lose 
                         you for a year, and risk NCAA 
                         investigation. C'mon, lotsa athletes 
                         have been through Rehab.

                                     JOE
                         Not in the middle of the season. Not 
                         in the middle of a Heisman campaign.

                                     WINTERS
                         You'll only miss four games. You'll 
                         be back in time for the last one, 
                         Georgia Tech, and a Bowl if we get 
                         there. Plus, you've still got your 
                         senior year.

                                     JOE
                         Yeh, but what will I come back as? 
                         What kinda player?

                                     WINTERS
                         Don't worry, you'll still be the 
                         Man. You'll still be the leader of 
                         this team.

               Joe doesn't believe it, but he manages a nod, as he gets up 
               to leave.

                                     JOE
                         I'm sorry, Coach.

                                     WINTERS
                         These things happen.

               Joe walks on out, Winters watches him go, then slams the 
               desk in anger. Drained, he sinks back in his chair.

                                     WINTERS
                         Fuckin' kids.

               EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

               Darnell's walking across campus toward class. Autumn sees 
               him, calls out to him.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Darnell, wait. C'mon Darnell, I wanta 
                         talk to you.

               Darnell doesn't slow up. Autumn has to run to catch up.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Where you been, I been callin' you?

                                     DARNELL
                         Been busy.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Darnell, I'm sorry about Saturday. 
                         It was an awkward situation.

                                     DARNELL
                         It wasn't awkward. It was educational. 
                         I realized how you see me. I'm good 
                         enough to tutor, to go places with, 
                         but not to tell your father about.

                                     AUTUMN
                         That's not it. It's just that my 
                         father expects me to be with somebody 
                         like Ray. He wouldn't understand us.

                                     DARNELL
                              (stopping)
                         Why not?

                                     AUTUMN
                         I don't know... he likes Ray cause...

                                     DARNELL
                         He's a good student, he acts right... 
                         he doesn't need football. He's class 
                         and I'm not, right?

                                     AUTUMN
                         I didn't say that.

                                     DARNELL
                         You don't have to, Autumn. I'm 
                         everything your dad used to be and 
                         don't want you fallin' back into.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Darnell...

                                     DARNELL
                         You were right before, Autumn. I 
                         should have another tutor. Thanks 
                         for everything you did for me.

               Darnell walks away. Autumn can only watch him go.

               INT. JOE'S ROOM - DAY

               Joe finishes packing his bags. He sees a picture of Camille 
               on the dresser. Picks it up, looks at it a beat, drops it in 
               the trash. He carries his Heisman cardboard standup into the 
               shower, pulls out a match and lights it. He watches it catch 
               fire, then grabs his suitcase and walks out of the room. We 
               hold on the burning standup, as flames lick at Joe's smile.

               INT. REHAB CENTER - AFTERNOON

               Joe is shown into his room. Bare. One cot. One dresser. He 
               drops his bag, sags onto the bed.

                                     ALVIN (V.O.)
                         Four fuckin' weeks?

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

               A tired and depressed group of E.S.U. football players undress 
               after practice. Bud and Alvin sit in their pads, Lattimer 
               standing in street clothes. Bud softly sings "Don't Cry For 
               Me Argentina."

                                     ALVIN
                         Shit, the defense is gonna have to 
                         pitch shutouts now...
                              (to Lattimer)
                         and you're gone for 3. What the hell 
                         did you take that shit for?

                                     LATTIMER
                         Nobody seemed to mind when I was 
                         knockin' people's dicks in the dirt.

                                     ALVIN
                         I bust chops too. I don't have to 
                         get all fucked up.

                                     LATTIMER
                         Not everybody has the ability you 
                         do, Alvin. You do what you have to 
                         do to play.

                                     ALVIN
                         Well, you're not playin' much now 
                         are you? Shit, whole fuckin' season 
                         down the drain.

               EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - DAY

               Winters and Galen Howard are walking across the field after 
               practice. The stadium is deserted.

                                     HOWARD
                         I been talkin' to Chancellor Wilson...

                                     WINTERS
                         What's he wanta do now, cut practice 
                         down to once a week?

                                     HOWARD
                         No, he's happy with the way the 
                         season's gone so far. The Alumni 
                         have pretty much stayed off his back, 
                         but with Joe out now, it could all 
                         be up for grabs again.

                                     WINTERS
                         He thinks he's gonna have trouble 
                         marchin' the ball down the old fund-
                         raisin' board, huh?

                                     HOWARD
                         The facts are, all we have left are 
                         freshman quarterbacks, and nothin' I 
                         saw at practice today, convinced me 
                         that any of them are ready to step 
                         in.

                                     WINTERS
                         What are you sayin?

                                     HOWARD
                         We gotta get Bobby Collins back.

                                     WINTERS
                         Wilson say that?

                                     HOWARD
                         He didn't have to.

                                     WINTERS
                         Forget it, Galen, Collins is no All-
                         Star either.

                                     HOWARD
                         Yeh, but he's good enough to get us 
                         a split of the next four games.

                                     WINTERS
                         Look, just because you're Wilson's 
                         boy all of a sudden, doesn't mean 
                         I'm gonna let him make me look like 
                         a fuckin' whore.

                                     HOWARD
                         Don't give me that high and mighty 
                         shit. There's a lotta people on the 
                         bubble here. Four straight loses and 
                         we're out of bowl contention. How's 
                         that gonna make you look? If you're 
                         too stupid to consider your own 
                         situation, then maybe you oughta 
                         think about your assistant coaches. 
                         They've got families to feed too.

               Howard walks away, pissed off, leaving Winters alone in the 
               middle of the field.

               INT. BOARD OF REGENTS HEARING ROOM - DAY

               The seven members of the BOARD OF REGENTS sit on one side of 
               a long rectangular table, the Chairman in the middle. On the 
               other side are coach Winters, Bobby Collins, the President 
               of the Faculty Senate, EDWARD LEARNIHAN, Academic Advisor, 
               ARTHUR SHANE, President of the Student Body, RICHARD FOWLER, 
               and Galen Howard. Fowler is addressing the board.

                                     FOWLER
                         Therefore, I respectfully submit 
                         that Bobby Collins should not be 
                         given special treatment just because 
                         he's a football player. Would a 
                         regular student get a reinstatement 
                         hearing if they'de been caught 
                         cheating? Nobody's talking about 
                         letting the girl who took the test 
                         back in.

               Winters could kill this kid.

                                     LEARNIHAN
                         I think it's also instructive to 
                         look at some of the courses this 
                         young man has taken. Beginning Golf, 
                         Voice and Speech Improvement...

                                     SHANE
                         I'd like to point out that Mr. Collins 
                         was still on schedule to get his 
                         degree.

                                     LEARNIHAN
                              (pointing to Collin's 
                              transcript)
                         In what, Swimming Pool Management?

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         Would you like to respond, Coach 
                         Winters?

               Winters rises, sweating, less from nervousness than from the 
               odious nature of what he has to do.

                                     WINTERS
                         I don't know much about all this 
                         other stuff, but I do know the 
                         punishment should fit the crime. 
                         Cheating's bad, but I don't think it 
                         deserves a life sentence. Here's one 
                         of those athletes who takes college 
                         level courses, who wants to graduate. 
                         I think Bobby Collins made a big 
                         mistake, but he's already been 
                         suspended for several weeks. He's 
                         served his time. I think he deserves 
                         a second chance.

                                     LEARNIHAN
                         Like Alvin Mack? We gave him a second 
                         chance and since he's had 5 
                         incompletes, 4 withdrawals and still 
                         reads at a fourth grade level. You're 
                         using his body to make money for the 
                         Athletic Department -- you, yourself, 
                         are making three times what the 
                         Chancellor is -- but obviously no 
                         one is making an effort to see that 
                         this kid gets an education.

                                     WINTERS
                         He's helpin' to pay for your physics 
                         lab too. If you're willin' to go 
                         without a new office, maybe I could 
                         hold him out a few games. Save his 
                         body.

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         Gentlemen...

                                     SHANE
                         Alvin was way behind in school when 
                         he got here. You can't make up for, 
                         in four years, what it took 18 to 
                         create.

                                     LEARNIHAN
                         Then he should never have been 
                         admitted in the first place. It's 
                         not fair to other students who worked 
                         hard to get here.

                                     HOWARD
                         Is it fair to exclude kids who come 
                         from inferior schools? You hold 
                         everybody to the same standards, 
                         you're discriminating against the 
                         poor kids.

                                     WINTERS
                         Most of my players are farm boys, 
                         inner-city kids. Football is their 
                         deliverance.

                                     LEARNIHAN
                         Deliverance from what? A valid 
                         education?

                                     WINTERS
                         You throw Bobby Collins and Alvin 
                         out, you take away their futures. In 
                         Alvin's case you probably cost him a 
                         couple million dollars in the pros.

                                     LEARNIHAN
                         But this is not a football vocational 
                         school. It's an Institute of Higher 
                         Learning.

                                     WINTERS
                         Yeh, but when was the last time 80,000 
                         people showed up to watch a kid do a 
                         chemistry experiment?

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         Gentlemen, please, let's get back to 
                         the business at hand, Bobby Collins. 
                         As you know, I played football here. 
                         And I remember how hard it was to 
                         practice and then study when you're 
                         dead tired. So I have some sympathy 
                         for this young man. But I never 
                         cheated, so the real question is his 
                         character. Since you know him better 
                         than anyone else in this room; and 
                         having talked to him and observed 
                         him over the last several weeks, do 
                         you feel he's learned his lesson? In 
                         other words, can you vouch for his 
                         character?

               Winters would rather cut off his own head with a razor blade.

                                     WINTERS
                              (it's killing him)
                         Yes, sir, I can.

               Bobby Collins breaks into a wide, triumphant smile.

               EXT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY

               Learnihan and Winters come down the steps, their faces set. 
               As they split off:

                                     LEARNIHAN
                         Another case like this, I'll take it 
                         all the way up to the Governor.

                                     WINTERS
                         Don't mess with me, Learnihan. I'll 
                         have you teachin' Study Hall.

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

               Bobby Collins walks in prior to practice. His teammates gather 
               round, slap him on the back, high five etc. Winters watches 
               from his office, disgusted.

               INT. COACH WINTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Coach Winters is in his video alcove watching footage of his 
               upcoming opponent -- it's like he's looking through it though, 
               his mind elsewhere, something boiling up inside him. Suddenly, 
               he smashes his fist into the screen, breaking it into pieces. 
               His hand bleeds. He doesn't care. He just sits there and 
               seethes.

               INT. CAMILLE'S ROOM - DAY

               Camille's on the phone.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Hello, my name is Camille Schaeffer. 
                         I'd like to speak to Joe Kane.

               INT. JOE'S ROOM IN REHAB CENTER - DAY

               Joe is aimlessly flipping cards toward a wastebasket. A NURSE 
               knocks on his door.

                                     NURSE
                         You've got a phone call. A Camille 
                         Schaeffer.

               Joe says nothing, not wanting to deal with this.

                                     NURSE
                         She says she's your girlfriend

                                     JOE
                         I don't want to talk to her.

                                     NURSE
                         You sure?

                                     JOE
                         Yeh.

               The nurse leaves. Joe gets up, goes to the wall, and starts 
               pounding it with his right hand.

               INT. CAMILLE'S ROOM - DAY

                                     NURSE (V.O.)
                         I'm sorry, he doesn't wish to speak 
                         to you right now.

               Crushed and angry, Camille hangs up.

               INT. ATHLETIC DORM HALL - DAY

               Bud Lite is watching television. Louanne enters on her way 
               to Bobby Collins' room, carrying an armload of neatly-pressed 
               laundry. But Lite gets up to bar her way.

                                     BUD
                         Hey, Louanne, how ya' doin?

                                     LOUANNE
                         Fine, Bud, ya know. Goin to J.C., 
                         hopin' to get back in here next year. 
                         Just came by to give Bobby some 
                         laundry I did for him.

                                     BUD
                         You two seein' each other again?

                                     LOUANNE
                         Yeh, he was even talking about us 
                         gettin' a place off campus together, 
                         until he got reinstated. I don't 
                         know how I woulda told my dad.

               Bud just nods blankly. Louanne starts to head for Bobby's 
               room.

                                     BUD
                         Ah, Louanne...
                              (pained to say it)
                         I wouldn't go in there right now.

                                     LOUANNE
                         Why not?

               Bud doesn't have the heart to tell her. She finally realizes 
               Bobby's with another girl.

                                     LOUANNE
                         Ah. Guess I'm pretty stupid when it 
                         comes to men. I never learn, do I?

                                     BUD
                         I think maybe men are just stupid 
                         when it comes to you. If you ever 
                         feel like, ya know, just talkin' 
                         sometime, gettin' a beer -- let me 
                         know. My schedule's pretty open.

                                     LOUANNE
                         Thanks, Bud
                              (handing him the 
                              clothes)
                         Give him these, will ya?

               Bud nods. Louanne, fighting back tears, walks back down the 
               hall with as much dignity as she can muster.

               INT. JOE'S REHAB CENTER - DAY

               Winters comes to the door, hesitates, walks in and finds Joe 
               huddled on his bed. Shivering.

                                     WINTERS
                         Get up. I wanta talk to you.

               Joe looks resentful but makes an effort and sits up.

                                     WINTERS
                         Don't sit up. Stand up. If you can.

               Joe gets unsteadily to his feet. He feels sick. Winters 
               reaches out to shake hands. Joe does not reciprocate. Hides 
               his right hand behind his body.

                                     WINTERS
                         What's the matter, Joe? You won't 
                         shake hands with me.
                              (Joe is silent)
                         You don't want me to see your hand, 
                         do you?
                              (more silence)
                         So I guess what I heard was true, 
                         huh? You been poundin' the walls 
                         with your passin' hand, right?
                              (silence)
                         I tell you what, Joe, you want to 
                         hit somethin', hit me.

               Joe doesn't move.

                                     WINTERS
                         I said hit me. I'm the one who put 
                         you in here. Don't hit the damn wall. 
                         It ain't the wall's fault. Hit me! 
                         Go on, hit me right now!

               Joe is angry but he doesn't want to do anything about it.

                                     WINTERS
                         Who else you wanta hit, huh? you're 
                         daddy maybe? Cause he's a no-show 
                         prick? Well, I'm a daddy, too, and 
                         not a very good one at that. So just 
                         hit me instead! I'll take your daddy's 
                         beatin' for him. Go on, you want to. 
                         Hit me, damnit!

               Joe shakes his head.

                                     WINTERS
                              (pushes Joe in the 
                              chest)
                         Hit me! I'm not gonna leave you alone 
                         until you hit me.
                              (shakes Joe by 
                              shoulders)
                         The guys'll thank you. They've always 
                         wanted to do it. So do it now, damnit! 
                         Do it!

               Joe sinks to his knees. Winters stares down at him, then 
               kneels also, his own anger and frustration draining away.

                                     WINTERS
                         O.K., Joe, it's o.k. I guess I need 
                         it more than you do.
                              (pause)
                         You gotta quit beatin' up on yourself. 
                         Let me see that hand.

               Joe reveals his hand. It's barked and cut, but not badly 
               swollen.

                                     WINTERS
                         It's o.k.
                              (playfully)
                         You can still throw with it, you 
                         fuckin' mook.
                              (pause)
                         Look, the nurses say this is the 
                         toughest time for you right now. I 
                         thought I'd stick around a little, 
                         case you wanta play some cards, pick 
                         a fight with the wall again, 
                         whatever...

                                     JOE
                         You don't have to.

                                     WINTERS
                         Yes I do.

               INT. STEVE LATTIMER'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Lattimer fills a bag with all his steroid paraphernalia. He 
               carries it to his bathroom where he slowly empties it into 
               his toilet. Syringes, vials and bottles of pills all tumble 
               into the water. He flushes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. JOE'S ROOM IN REHAB CENTER - MORNING

               The sun shines through the window. Joe wakes up, raises up, 
               looks over at Winters who is asleep in a chair. Winters 
               rouses. Joe gives him a little smile, he's allright. Winters 
               gives him a nod of approval.

               MUSIC UP. BEGIN A SERIES OF SHOTS

               detailing the Timberwolves progress over the next four games.

               ON FIELD

               1) Players shaking hands at midfield after the game. The 
               scoreboard reads E.S.U. 14 Boston College 10.

               INT. STUDY HALL

               2) Darnell in study hall, with his new tutor concentrating 
               on her explanation, applying himself.

               ON SIDELINE - DAY

               3) Steve Lattimer, in street clothes, paces the sidelines, 
               jumping up and down in frustration, his hamstring bandaged 
               to sell the injury ruse. He catches himself, gets back on 
               his crutches. A newspaper fades up through the shot. It reads 
               "Wolves Offense Fires Blanks in 13-0 Loss to Texas."

               INT. CAFE - NIGHT

               4) Darnell sits in a cafe, drinking coffee and studying. Ray 
               comes in, his arm around a co-ed, MONICA. They buy a pastry 
               and leave, not having seen Darnell. Darnell ponders this a 
               second, goes back to studying.

               INT. REHAB CENTER - DAY

               5) A group of patients is gathered around a T.V. set in the 
               Rehab Center, watching a pre-game show. One goes to Joe's 
               room, where Joe's lying on his cot.

                                     PATIENT
                         Hey, Joe, don't you wanta watch the 
                         game? It's on cable.

                                     JOE
                         No thanks.

               Joe leans back, staring at the ceiling.

               ON T.V. SCREEN

               6) Sportscaster DALLAS PERRY is holding forth on the local 
               evening news.

                                     PERRY
                         E.S.U. on the strength of a 62 yard 
                         touchdown run by freshman Darnell 
                         Jefferson, squeaked by the North 
                         Carolina Tarheels today, 14 to 13, 
                         keeping their bowl hopes alive.

               EXT. CAMPUS NIGHT

               7) Darnell, with his books, on the way to the library, passes 
               the frat house where the victory party is in progress. He 
               sees Ray and Autumn walking together. Autumn sees him, her 
               face lights up. He gives her a slight smile, keeps walking. 
               She watches him with a certain longing.

               INT. LIBRARY - LATE NIGHT

               8) Darnell, alone in the library, late at night, studying.

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

               9) Lattimer, carrying his gear bag, walks into the locker 
               room. His teammates come over to shake his hand, slap him on 
               the back, welcome him back to the team.

               MUSIC ENDS

               INT. JOE'S REHAB CENTER ROOM - NIGHT

               Joe sits on his bed listening to the E.S.U. broadcast.

                                     HARVEY (V.O.)
                         E.S.U. hoping to get past a tough 
                         Iowa Hawkeyes team in their last 
                         game before the return of star 
                         quarterback, Joe Kane.

               EXT. KINNICK STADIUM - NIGHT

               The E.S.U. defense is on the field. Alvin moves up opposite 
               the OFFENSIVE GUARD.

                                     ALVIN
                         I know you, motherfucker. You're the 
                         prick who got my little sister 
                         pregnant. We ain't seen you around 
                         lately. Where you been, huh? Answer 
                         me, motherfucker, or I'm gonna peel 
                         your cap.

               The ball is hiked. Iowa runs a sweep left. Lattimer tries to 
               get outside to contain, but is blocked by the fullback, who 
               goes low and cuts his legs out from under him.

                                     WINTERS
                         Shit, Lattimer...

               Alvin pursues the play as the ballcarrier heads for the 
               corner, then suddenly cuts back. Alvin has overrun the play 
               slightly. We go to SLOW MOTION as he turns and is hit with a 
               wicked CRACK-BACK BLOCK by the guard he taunted. Alvin's leg 
               flexes at a horrifying angle. We HEAR THE SNAP of bone and 
               tendon, as Alvin plummets to the ground, writhing in pain, 
               grabbing his left leg.

                                     WINTERS
                         Oh, no...

               The doctor and trainers sprint out to the field.

               INT. JOE'S REHAB CENTER ROOM - NIGHT

               We move in on Joe's face, as Harvey is heard on the radio in 
               the b.g.

                                     HARVEY (V.O.)
                         Oh, boy, this does not look good, 
                         Harmon. They're bringing the 
                         stretchers out...

               Joe's eyes close. He knows what this means.

               EXT. THE FIELD - NIGHT

               Alvin is being strapped on the stretcher.

                                     ALVIN
                              (wailing in pain)
                         Oh, shit, oh shit, I'll kill that 
                         motherfucker. I'll... Oh shit...

               EXT. KINNICK STADIUM - NIGHT

               An ambulance carrying Alvin emerges from the stadium. We 
               hear CHEERING inside, the SIREN outside.

                                     HARVEY (V.O.)
                         Twelve seconds left, Iowa driving 
                         for the winning touchdown. Fourth 
                         and goal at the one. E.S.U. trying 
                         to hold on without their star middle 
                         linebacker, Alvin Mack.

               EXT. THE FIELD AGAIN - NIGHT

               The E.S.U. defensive line digs in. Lattimer tries to suck up 
               his remaining strength.

               Iowa runs a blast to Lattimer's side. He fights through one 
               block, the ballcarrier coming right toward him. They meet in 
               a titanic collision at the goal line. The back keeps driving, 
               twisting. Lattimer tries to hold him, but weaker than he was 
               on steroids, is unable to. The back falls over the goal line. 
               Touchdown. IOWA 13 E.S.U. 10.

               As the Iowa players celebrate all around him, Lattimer sits 
               where he fell, a beaten and humiliated young man.

                                     REPORTER (V.O.)
                         Coach, you've lost two of your last 
                         four.

               INT. INTERVIEW ROOM UNDER STADIUM - NIGHT

               Coach Winters faces the press.

                                     REPORTER
                         Why do your teams seem to nose dive 
                         at the end of the last couple seasons?

                                     COACH WINTERS
                         This was a tough loss, but this ain't 
                         any nose dive. We've had some key 
                         players out, but if we win next week, 
                         we'll still win the conference and 
                         go to a major bowl on New Year's 
                         Day. I mean, I know you guys can't 
                         write, but I thought you could at 
                         least count.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

               Alvin lies on a bed, his leg bandaged and elevated. He's 
               still a little groggy from anesthetic. Coach Winters stands 
               beside him.

                                     WINTERS
                         You look good, Alvin.

                                     ALVIN
                         Yeh, I feel o.k.

                                     WINTERS
                         Any of the guys been down yet?

                                     ALVIN
                         They called.

                                     WINTERS
                         Hell, you know how football players 
                         are about hospitals and injuries.

                                     ALVIN
                         Yeh.

               Several beats of silence. Then:

                                     ALVIN
                         I'm never gonna play again, am I?

                                     WINTERS
                         Doctors aren't always right, Alvin... 
                         but I just want you to know... you're 
                         the best defensive football player I 
                         ever coached.

               Alvin nods. Winters comes forward, hugs him around the head, 
               gives him a smile, walks out. Tears brim in Winters eyes as 
               he leaves. Alvin's head goes back against the pillow. Tears 
               aren't brimming here. They're rolling down his cheeks.

               MUSIC BEGINS

               EXT. REHAB CENTER - MORNING

               Joe walks out with his suitcase. Coach Winters waits for 
               him. Shakes his hand. They get in the car.

                                     WINTERS (V.O.)
                         Congratulations. I'm proud of you, 
                         Joe.

                                     WINTERS
                         I know you had a difficult time. 
                         Michigan is easy, right? Bourbon is 
                         tough.

                                     JOE
                         Scotch.

               They share a laugh. Winters pulls out two sets of round trip 
               airline tickets.

                                     WINTERS
                         I got somethin' for ya. Coupla round 
                         trip tickets. Go see your dad. Get 
                         it cleaned up.

               Joe takes the tickets, just looks at him.

               INT. STEVE LATTIMER'S ROOM - NIGHT

                                     LATTIMER
                              (on the phone)
                         I'm gonna have to take a test with 
                         the coach right there. You sure you 
                         got somethin' better than blockers?

                                     DEALER (V.O.)
                         Much better. This guy is foolproof. 
                         See ya Saturday.

               Lattimer hangs up, picks up a HYPODERMIC. Stares at it a 
               second, sweat beading on his forehead. Then plunges it an 
               inch deep into his thigh. Pulls it out, sits on the bed a 
               beat, then picks up a barbell and begins to pump it furiously, 
               biceps bulging.

               MUSIC ENDS

               INT. COACH WINTER'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

               The coach is facing Ray and Darnell across his desk.

                                     WINTERS
                         I wanta do something different for 
                         this game. Try to maximize our speed, 
                         but keep you both in the lineup at 
                         the same time. Ray, I'm moving you 
                         to fullback. Darnell, you're startin' 
                         at tail.

               Ray is stunned, Darnell elated, but neither says a word.

                                     WINTERS
                         Ray, you'll be carrying the ball 
                         less and blocking more, but they'll 
                         still have to respect your running 
                         and pass-catching ability. Not 
                         everybody can make a transition like 
                         this. You think you can handle it?

                                     RAY
                              (tight lipped)
                         Yes, sir.

                                     WINTERS
                         Good. We can't afford any hang dogs.

               EXT. TENNIS COURTS - DAY

               Camille comes off the court, after tennis practice. She's 
               surprised to find Joe waiting for her.

                                     JOE
                         Hello, Camille.

                                     CAMILLE
                              (cool)
                         Hello, Joe. You allright now?

                                     JOE
                         Yeh... yeh, I think so.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Good, I'm happy for you.

               She starts to walk away, heading for the bike racks.

                                     JOE
                         Camille, hold on, O.K.? I'm sorry 
                         that I didn't want... that I couldn't 
                         see you.

                                     CAMILLE
                         You couldn't even talk to me. What 
                         happened to "there's somethin' goin' 
                         on between you and me"?

               Camille gets on her bike...

                                     JOE
                         C'mon, Camille, I was embarrassed. I 
                         couldn't...

               and pedals off.

                                     JOE
                              (shouting after her)
                         I couldn't understand why anybody 
                         would wanta talk to me. Camille!

               She just keeps on going.

               EXT. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL TOWN - DAY

               A bus comes up the hill toward us, on the main street of 
               Joe's sooty, little home town, the huge stacks of moribund 
               steel works filling the sky in the background. The bus stops 
               at a corner. Joe steps off. No bag. He's not planning on 
               staying long.

               EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY

               Joe goes to the front door. Knocks, gets no answer, pushes 
               the door open, walks through the messy, cluttered house to 
               the back porch. Seated in a metal folding chair, smoking a 
               cigarette, looking out at the yard is Joe's DAD. He's got a 
               couple days growth of beard, and although not drunk now, he 
               has the look of one.

                                     JOE
                         How ya doin', Dad?

                                     DAD
                              (surprised to see him)
                         Joe! What's this? They throw you 
                         out?

                                     JOE
                         No.

                                     JOE'S DAD
                         I heard about your little set-to. 
                         They had it on the news here.

                                     JOE
                         Yeh, they sent me to rehab.

                                     JOE'S DAD
                         We know what that's worth. Your 
                         brother's been through it three times.

               Joe nods sadly.

                                     JOE'S DAD
                         So what are you doin' here?

                                     JOE
                         I've been thinking about some things, 
                         Dad.

                                     JOE'S DAD
                         That's what that damn rehab'll do. 
                         Make you think about a lotta things 
                         you can't do nothing' about.

                                     JOE
                         I kinda been wonderin' why you never 
                         came to any of my games. All those 
                         years.

                                     JOE'S DAD
                         Oh, I don't know. I guess I didn't 
                         wanta make you nervous. You mighta 
                         tried too hard and screwed up.

                                     JOE
                         Or I mighta done real well. Which 
                         woulda been harder on you, Dad?

                                     JOE'S DAD
                              (sensing the anger)
                         What do you mean?

                                     JOE
                         Mighta made you feel bad. Like maybe 
                         it wasn't written someplace that we 
                         all gotta go on our ass. Like maybe 
                         you coulda done somethin' more, if 
                         you'de tried a little harder.

                                     JOE'S DAD
                         Or maybe I didn't wanta see you 
                         gettin' all excited, all pumped up 
                         with pride, when I knew one day it 
                         would all come crashin' down. Just 
                         like it did.

                                     JOE
                         I think I spent the last couple years 
                         hopin' I'd die before that day. But 
                         you know what Dad? That day came and 
                         I'm still here. And I got one more 
                         game this year. I don't know how 
                         well I'll play or even how much, but 
                         I want you there.

                                     JOE'S DAD
                         How would you feel introducing your 
                         drunk dad to all your friends? You 
                         think about that?

                                     JOE
                         I could live with it, if you could.
                              (handing him a ticket)
                         Here's a ticket. Section 2, Row 6. 
                         Fifty yard line. If you don't come, 
                         I'll never ask you again.

                                     JOE'S DAD
                         O.K., Joey. And good luck.

               They give each other a short, quick hug. Nothing sentimental. 
               Joe walks back through the house. His dad stares out at the 
               yard.

               INT. COLLEGE LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Darnell is up late again, studying at one of the tables. He 
               hears footsteps, becomes aware of the presence of another 
               person. He looks up to see Autumn.

                                     DARNELL
                         Hey, Autumn. How's Ray?

                                     AUTUMN
                         Don't know. Haven't seen him since 
                         the night I saw you. He'd been goin' 
                         out.

                                     DARNELL
                         Monica Lambert.

                                     AUTUMN
                         You knew? Why didn't you tell me?

                                     DARNELL
                         Didn't wanta win you over that way.

               Silence. Darnell looks back at his books.

                                     AUTUMN
                         I just wondered how your studying 
                         was comin'. You ready for tomorrow?

                                     DARNELL
                         The test? I hope so. I been workin' 
                         pretty hard.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Good...
                              (sitting down)
                         I talked to my dad last night.

                                     DARNELL
                         Oh, yeah? How's he doin?

                                     AUTUMN
                         Fine. We talked about you.

                                     DARNELL
                         What did you say?

                                     AUTUMN
                              (eyes brimming)
                         I told him I'd gone out with you... 
                         I told him I wished I could still go 
                         bowling.

               Darnell gets up and pulls her to her feet. He hugs her.

               MUSIC BEGINS

               INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Darnell is bent over his test booklet. He writes furiously, 
               stops to think, starts writing again.

               EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

               Joe takes a snap, fades to pass, throws an out. The ball 
               flutters badly, falling short.

                                     CLAYTON
                         He's rusty. I doubt if we can start 
                         him.

                                     WINTERS
                              (simmering)
                         He's worse than that. He's outa shape.
                              (blowing his whistle)
                         All right, that's enough for today. 
                         Practice is cancelled. Everybody off 
                         the field, but Kane.
                              (the players hesitate)
                         C'mon what the hell are you standin' 
                         around lookin' at? Get outa here.

               The players, surprised at this turn of events, begin to file 
               off. Even the coaches are baffled. Winters walks over to 
               Joe, who has no idea what this is about.

                                     WINTERS
                         Didn't do much while you were in 
                         there, did ya?

                                     JOE
                         Well, we didn't exactly have a team...

                                     WINTERS
                         You could've worked out on your own.

                                     JOE
                         I had some other things to worry 
                         about...

                                     WINTERS
                         Well, we're gonna make up for lost 
                         time. We'll start by hoppin' the 
                         steps.

                                     JOE
                         Hoppin' the steps?! What, you're 
                         gonna punish me now.

                                     WINTERS
                         Don't talk back to me, Joe. I'll 
                         kick your ass. I went easy on you, 
                         'cause you had to get through detox, 
                         but that's out to sea now. You let 
                         this team down; you let this program 
                         down. Start those steps. Right leg.

               ANGLE ON JOE - STADIUM

               Hopping up the stadium steps on his right foot, laboring as 
               he passes Winters, halfway up.

                                     WINTERS
                         Now the left.

               Joe switches to his left foot and continues hopping up the 
               steps, his quadriceps bursting with pain.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               JOE - LATER - STADIUM

               hanging by his arms, moving hand over hand along the crossbar 
               of the goalpost, panting with fatigue, Winters watching from 
               below.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               JOE - AT SUNSET - STADIUM

               Bone weary now. Winters has him run 20 yards, get down and 
               do 10 pushups, run another 20 yards, do 10 more pushups etc.

               Joe staggers the 20 yards, drops to do his pushups, can only 
               do 4. Winters yanks him to his feet, pushes him forward to 
               run again.

                                     WINTERS
                         70 guys. 70 guys who busted their 
                         butts all year. Because of you they 
                         might not win the conference. Because 
                         of you they might not go to a bowl.

                                     JOE
                              (barely able to stand)
                         I didn't wanna leave... I just screwed 
                         up...

                                     WINTERS
                         You dogged on them.

                                     JOE
                              (stopping, exhausted)
                         No, no I never dogged. I worked my 
                         ass off. I played hard...

                                     WINTERS
                              (pushing him forward)
                         Then you shoulda stayed in shape. 
                         Keep runnin', dammit.

                                     JOE
                              (wobbling, starting 
                              to break down)
                         I always played hard. I gave my 
                         everything for you. When you came to 
                         the Center, I thought you were really 
                         worried about me. But you don't give 
                         a shit. We're all just a buncha sled 
                         dogs. If you had another guy who 
                         could throw, you'da left me in the 
                         fuckin' hospital.
                              (falling to his knees, 
                              sobbing)
                         The only thing that matters is the 
                         program, the god-damn program.

               Winters pushes Joe down to do his pushups. Joe has to strain 
               mightily to do two.

                                     WINTERS
                         Nobody forced you to play football, 
                         Joe. Not me, not the program, nobody. 
                         But when you sign on, you commit 
                         yourself to pay the price, to do 
                         whatever it takes. Well, you haven't 
                         paid the price yet. You still owe 
                         this team. You owe this team big-
                         time.
                              (walking away)
                         Get a shower.

               Joe tries to get up, but collapses face down on the turf, as 
               Winters continues to walk away.

               INT. LOW RENT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - MORNING

               Lattimer lies on a table, a CATHETER TUBE going into his 
               side. A DOCTOR'S AIDE supervises. Lattimer's dealer is there.

                                     LATTIMER
                         What's this doin?

                                     DEALER
                         Takin' doped urine outa your bladder 
                         and puttin clean back in. Call it an 
                         oil change.

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - BEFORE THE GAME

               Coach Winters watches unknowingly as Lattimer pees the 
               catheterized urine into a cup.

               MUSIC ENDS

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - JUST BEFORE THE GAME

               The team is gathered around. Conspicuous among them is 
               Lattimer, who's painted his face like a skeleton. Coach 
               Winters is whipping them up with a pre-game rant.

                                     WINTERS
                         Gotta get it done today, boys. Gotta 
                         ring that bell. 60 minutes. 60 minutes 
                         of mean. No prisoners. No mercy. 
                         Nothin' but snot bubbles. Gotta ring 
                         that bell, gotta ring that 
                         Championship bell.

                                     LATTIMER
                              (shouting)
                         Ding Motherfucking Dong!!

               Pumped to the gills, the E.S.U. team explodes in yells and 
               races out into the tunnel. The YELLING continues OVER and 
               mixes with the CHEERING OF THE CROWD as:

               EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

                                     HARVEY (V.O.)
                         Wolves movin' left to right on your 
                         radio dial. Looking to generate some 
                         offense. They've been up and down 
                         the last few weeks.

               ANGLE ON BOBBY COLLINS in the huddle.

                                     COLLINS
                         28 Thunder right. On go.

               They break and the E.S.U. offense comes to the line. Collins 
               calls signals. We go to SLOW MOTION as he fades to pass. 
               Darnell fakes a block, then rolls out for a screen pass. 
               Georgia Tech's defensive line comes hard. Bobby flips the 
               ball over the charging defenders. Darnell catches it, gets a 
               good block from Bud Lite, then tucks in behind Ray who is 
               out ahead blocking.

               There's only one linebacker to beat and Darnell will be into 
               the secondary. Figuring Ray will block the guy, Darnell begins 
               to look for the safeties. Ray, however, barely brushes the 
               linebacker, who doesn't even break stride. He lowers his 
               head, and drives into Darnell, his helmet hitting the 
               football. Fumble! There's a scramble. The Yellow Jackets 
               free safety comes up with it.

               REGULAR SPEED

               The crowd and the E.S.U. bench, quickly deflated, sit back 
               down. Darnell gets to his feet, glares at Ray, but says 
               nothing. He knows Ray tanked the block.

               INT. ALVIN MACK'S SHACK - DAY

               Alvin sits alone in the "living room", listening to the E.S.U. 
               game on the radio, his leg propped up on an apple crate. His 
               mother mends a pair of jeans in the b.g.

                                     HARVEY (V.O.)
                         So the Wolves defense has held after 
                         the fumble, and the Yellow Jackets 
                         will opt for the field goal. Around 
                         a 34 yarder. Ball is down, it's away, 
                         it's long enough. And good! Georgia 
                         Tech jumps out on top 3-0.

               Alvin's mother looks to see if there's any reaction from 
               Alvin. There's none.

               EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

               Bobby Collins fades back to pass, is rushed, throws a quick 
               sideline, but it's a little short. The Yellow Jackets' 
               CORNERBACK sprints up, intercepts it and runs 30 yards down 
               the sideline for a touchdown.

                                     HARVEY (V.O.)
                         Collins back to pass, rushed, now 
                         fires out in the flat. It's picked 
                         off by Hill. Down the sideline. He's 
                         gonna go in untouched. Touchdown, 
                         Georgia Tech.

               INT. E.S.U. LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON

               A discouraged bunch of E.S.U. players drag into the locker 
               room. Some swear, some bang their lockers.

                                     LATTIMER
                         C'mon guys, we're only down ten. 
                         Let's get our fuckin' shit together.

               Darnell marches over to Ray's locker.

                                     DARNELL
                         You missed that block on purpose, 
                         didn't you, asshole.

                                     RAY
                         You're full of shit. You fumble, you 
                         try to blame me.

                                     DARNELL
                         It's Autumn isn't it? That's what 
                         this is all about.

                                     RAY
                         The hell with Autumn. You just can't 
                         take a hit.

               Infuriated, Darnell goes for Ray, and they start swinging. 
               Darnell tackles Ray, they roll on the floor, still swinging, 
               trying to beat the shit out of each other. Finally, several 
               players manage to pull them apart. Coach Winters charges 
               over.

                                     WINTERS
                         Don't tell me who started it. I don't 
                         care. All I care about is this 
                         football team. We win together. We 
                         lose together. So whatever your 
                         problem is, get over it. I don't 
                         want any more of this shit. 
                         Understand?

                                     DARNELL AND RAY
                         Yes, sir.

                                     WINTERS
                         As for the rest of you guys. Here's 
                         what I think of the way you played.

               Winters walks over to a table set up with 75 cups of Orange 
               Juice and Gatorade. He swipes the cups off the table creating 
               a small flood on the floor. Then turns the table over. The 
               players are shocked. They've seldom seen him like this.

                                     WINTERS
                              (pointing toward the 
                              Yellow Jackets' locker 
                              room)
                         They're laughin' at you over there. 
                         Makin' plans for the evening. They 
                         never dreamed it'd be this easy. You 
                         guys are nothin' but bugs splattered 
                         on their windshield. You better stock 
                         up on potato chips, 'cause you're 
                         gonna be watching a lotta T.V. on 
                         New Years Day.

               Winters walks away, as the players are left to contemplate 
               their mistakes. Winters goes over to Joe.

                                     WINTERS
                         Get warm, Joe. You're startin' the 
                         second half.

               Joe nods, excited but uncertain. Winters moves on to Ray 
               Griffen.

                                     WINTERS
                         By the way... don't let me see you 
                         miss anymore blocks.

               EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

               The E.S.U. players return to their bench for the start of 
               the second half, gather in a circle. Joe looks up in the 
               stands to the seat he reserved for his father. It's empty.

               BEGIN A SERIES OF SHOTS:

               1) Joe takes the snap from center, fumbles it, falls on it.

               2) Joe looks to throw over the middle, waits too long, is 
               sacked.

               3) Joe underthrows Darnell coming out of the backfield.

               EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

               Clayton approaches Winters on the sideline.

                                     CLAYTON
                         Joe's too tentative, too cautious 
                         out there. He seems flat. Maybe we 
                         oughta give Collins another shot.

                                     WINTERS
                         Joe just needs to get the feel back. 
                         He'll be allright.

                                     CLAYTON
                         Sam, we can't afford to wait...

                                     WINTERS
                              (snapping)
                         I said he'll be allright.

               ANGLE ON JOE

                                     HARVEY (V.O.)
                         5:51 to go. Georgia Tech up 10 to 
                         nothing. The Wolves are gonna have 
                         to find some offense in a hurry here. 
                         Their defense has been keepin' them 
                         in it.

               As he starts off the bench for the field, Coach Winters comes 
               up to him.

                                     WINTERS
                         Joe, I know that Rehab was good for 
                         you. Got rid of a lotta bad habits. 
                         But what about the rest of you? What 
                         happened to the Joe Kane that used 
                         to take command of this team, the 
                         Joe Kane these guys i'd run through 
                         a bulldozer for? They put him out 
                         with the trash? What are you waitin' 
                         for, somebody to feel sorry for you 
                         cause you've had some problems? Nobody 
                         in this stadium gives a shit. It's 
                         time to step up, Joe. Time to sit at 
                         the head of the Table.

               ANGLE ON THE E.S.U. OFFENSIVE HUDDLE

               As Joe comes into the huddle. He's all business now.

                                     JOE
                         All right, we've held these guys up 
                         long enough. Give me time back here, 
                         and I'll rip 'em apart. 16 shift, 
                         green, bolt. First sound.

               Joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage, yells "Go!" 
               The ball is snapped, Joe drops back, hits Darnell on the 
               sideline. First down. In quick succession, we see Joe:

               1) Complete a 15 yarder to Ray over the middle.

               2) Fades to pass, is rushed. Forced out of the pocket, 
               scrambles for his life, manages to get down to the 4 yard 
               line. He gets up, surveys the distance to pay dirt.

                                     HARVEY (V.O.)
                         Nice bit of scrambling by Kane to 
                         get it to the four, but it's gonna 
                         bring up fourth and goal. No doubt 
                         about it, with 3:45 they've gotta go 
                         for it here, if they're gonna get 
                         back in this game.

               ANGLE ON THE SIDELINE

               Winters puts his arm around Ray who will take the play into 
               the huddle.

                                     RAY
                         Give it to me up the gut, Coach. 
                         They've been ignoring me. I know I 
                         can score.

                                     WINTERS
                         No, we're gonna go with the sweep.

               Winters gives Ray a shove and he runs onto the field. Ray is 
               upset, angry. He swears to himself.

               ANGLE ON FIELD

               Ray enters the huddle, whispers in Joe's ear.

                                     JOE
                         28 Thunder right. On 2.

               The team breaks out, comes to the line. Joe looks over the 
               defense, screams signals as the CROWD NOISE is building.

               We go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped. Ray takes one 
               step forward then turns right, leading the play. Joe pitches 
               to Darnell who follows Ray. Georgia Tech's outside linebacker 
               comes up to stop the play. Ray stumbles before he can make 
               the block. He drops out of our picture.

                                     DARNELL
                         Shit!

               Darnell is forced to go wider toward the sideline. The 
               linebacker and cornerback are closing, both have the angle 
               on him. Darnell starts to cut back. He lowers his shoulder 
               to take the linebacker's blow. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Ray 
               reappears and throws a devastating block on the linebacker, 
               knocking him back into the cornerback, taking them both out. 
               Darnell cuts it up and blasts over the safety at the goal 
               line. Touchdown, E.S.U.

               The stands erupt. It's the first thing they've had to cheer 
               about all day. Winters just looks at the clock, goes over to 
               talk to his defense.

               Darnell foregoes his touchdown dance. He runs over to Ray, 
               grabs him by the helmet.

                                     DARNELL
                         Monster block, man. Monster 
                         motherfuckin' block.

               Ray smiles. They butt heads and run off the field

               INT. ALVIN'S SHACK

                                     ALVIN
                              (softly to himself)
                         All right, defense. Let's get evil. 
                         Kill 'em all, let the paramedics 
                         sort 'em out.

               EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

               Georgia Tech has the ball. They break their huddle.

                                     HARVEY (V.O.)
                         1:11 and counting. Third and one. 
                         The Wolves have got to stop them on 
                         this play if they're gonna get the 
                         ball back. A first down here and 
                         it's all she wrote. E.S.U. is out of 
                         timeouts.

               The Georgia Tech quarterback fakes to his fullback, hands 
               off to his TAILBACK on the countertrap. The tailback runs 
               behind his big, pulling tackle, both right at Lattimer. 
               Lattimer takes on the tackle, sheds his block. The back lowers 
               his head, starts to power into Lattimer. Lattimer lets out a 
               fierce yell.

               Smash! Lattimer explodes into the tailback, the collision 
               lifting the back off the ground, whiplashing his neck, 
               vibrating his helmet. Lattimer's legs churn, driving the 
               tailback back and into the ground. We see the back's face. 
               There are snot bubbles in his nose. No first down. No way.

               Lattimer jabs both arms in the air. The crowd goes nuts, as 
               the defense slaps helmets, and runs off the field, windmilling 
               their arms, whipping up the crowd.

               ANGLE ON SIDELINE

               Winters congratulates the defense as it comes off the field. 
               He meets Lattimer, looks into his eyes. Sees the steroids 
               there. He knows it's the only way the kid could have done 
               it. Decides not to bust him. Lattimer knows it. Winters gives 
               his helmet a little slap, more in sympathy than praise.

               ANGLE ON THE YELLOW JACKET PUNTER

               He catches the snap, boots the ball away.

               Darnell fields it at his 12, starts toward the right sideline, 
               where hemmed in, he looks like dead meat. Suddenly, he 
               reverses his field, racing for the opposite sideline, where 
               a picket line of blockers awaits him, if he can get there. 
               He turns on the jets, barely beating two tacklers to the 
               corner, and then turns it up the left sideline, picking up a 
               wicked series of crack-back blocks, until he's finally run 
               out of bounds at the Yellow Jacket 35 yard line.

               ON STANDS

               The E.S.U. fans are on their feet. Winters races over to 
               Joe.

                                     WINTERS
                         Time for 2 plays. If it's not open 
                         in the end zone, take the sideline. 
                         As the offense runs onto the field, 
                         Winters checks the scoreboard. 17 
                         seconds left. Georgia Tech 10. E.S.U. 
                         7.

               INT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

               Joe brings the Wolves up.

                                     HARVEY (V.O.)
                         Ball on the Yellow Jacket 35. 17 
                         seconds left. Kane barking signals.

               Joe takes the snap, drops to pass, finds no one, rolls away 
               from the rush. Just as he's about to go out of bounds, he 
               fires a bullet down the sideline. Ray Griffen catches it and 
               goes out of bounds at the twelve.

               ANGLE ON SIDELINE

               Joe runs over to Coach Winters, knowing they have no more 
               time outs, as the refs move the chains.

                                     HARVEY (V.O.)
                         Field goal here ties it, but a tie 
                         may not get the Wolves into a bowl. 
                         Tough decision for Winters.

                                     WINTERS
                              (to Joe)
                         You want me to send in the kicking 
                         team or you think you can handle it?

                                     JOE
                         Give me the ball.

                                     WINTERS
                         O.K., let's do 24 inside slot, left 
                         blue lightning.

               ON FIELD

               Joe races back out onto the field and into the huddle, as 
               the crowd's roar goes off the charts.

                                     JOE
                              (in huddle)
                         O.K., 24 inside slot, left blue 
                         lightning. Let's put the women and 
                         children to bed, and go lookin' for 
                         fuckin' dinner. On 2.

               He starts the wolf howl. The others join in, howling for all 
               they're worth, eleven jacked-up warriors. They clap and break 
               the huddle.

               The crowd is standing, waving fists in unison toward the 
               Georgia Tech end zone. Joe looks up in the stands again at 
               the seat he left for his father. It's still empty.

                                     JOE
                         This one's for you, Dad.

               Joe starts to call signals as Bud Lite sings "Bali Hi." We 
               go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped.

               The Georgia Tech defense fires off the line, throwing 
               everything at Joe. Joe drops back five steps. Bud Lite picks 
               up a blitzing linebacker, knocks him over a fallen player. 
               Joe looks for Darnell in the corner, but another pass rusher 
               breaks through, forcing Joe out of the pocket. It's wartime 
               as tackles and blockers collide, hand-fight, go down, scramble 
               up, collide again, all in pursuit of Joe.

               Darnell, realizing Joe's in trouble, breaks off his pattern 
               and heads to the center of the end zone. Joe dodges one 
               tackler, shakes free of another's ankle tackle, heads back 
               for the center of the field. He spots Darnell breaking between 
               defensive backs. Just as he's buried by two massive linemen, 
               Joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open 
               space that Darnell is heading for.

               The ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker. 
               Darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close 
               on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral. 
               Darnell dives. The two defensive backs dive. The ball passes 
               between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch, 
               landing in Darnell's. He clutches it to his chest, rolls 
               over, holds the ball up for the ref to see. Touchdown! This 
               time Darnell does go into his touchdown dance.

               ANGLE ON STANDS

               Pandemonium. The crowd including Autumn and her dad goes 
               crazy. Winters just gives a few quick nods, watching almost 
               wistfully as the players and coaches hug each other, knowing 
               none of them will hug him. Joe, Bud and the others mob 
               Darnell.

               INT. ALVIN'S SHACK - DAY

               Alvin listens to the celebration a few beats, then switches 
               off the radio, knowing this is an experience he'll never be 
               a part of again. We leave him staring off into an uncertain 
               future.

               INT. CHANCELLOR'S SKY-BOX - DAY

               The Chancellor and his guests are celebrating the victory, 
               congratulating each other. Conspicuous among them are the 
               Fat Cat Alumnus who gave Darnell the money, and the Chairman 
               of the Board of Regents.

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         Looks like the Timberwolves are back. 
                         Probably brought the library with 
                         them.

                                     CHANCELLOR
                         Hope so.
                              (turning to Galen 
                              Howard)
                         Give my sincere congratulations to 
                         Coach Winters.

                                     HOWARD
                         He'll be delighted.

               The Fat Cat Alumnus goes to a replica of the Building Fund 
               football field and starts advancing the ball.

                                     FAT CAT ALUMNUS
                         15,10, touchdown!

               This brings applause all around.

               EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

               As Darnell comes off the field, Autumn runs out and hugs 
               him, leads him to her dad.

                                     AUTUMN
                         Daddy, you remember Darnell.

                                     MR. HALEY
                         Yes, I do. Great catch, Darnell.

                                     DARNELL
                         Thank you, sir. I got somethin' for 
                         you.

               Darnell reaches into his helmet and takes out a sweat-stained 
               piece of paper.

                                     DARNELL
                         My entrance exam. Got a 92. Coach 
                         Winters said you got an 87. He looked 
                         it up.

                                     MR. HALEY
                              (laughing)
                         I'll kill him.

               ANGLE ON JOE KANE

               walking toward the tunnel, acknowledging the plaudits of the 
               fans. He looks for Camille, doesn't see her. Coach Winters 
               comes up next to him.

                                     WINTERS
                         Hell of a throw, Joe. Good to see 
                         you back.

               Winters gives him a quick, but firm hug.

                                     WINTERS
                         And don't worry about the Heisman. 
                         We'll gear up for it next year.

               Joe manages a weary smile.

               ANGLE ON BUD LITE

               coming down the tunnel, Bobby Collins next to him. Both stop 
               as Louanne walks toward them. Bobby smiles to himself in 
               anticipation of her fawning over him. She walks right by him 
               and up to Bud.

                                     LOUANNE
                         You still feel like gettin' a beer?

               Bud smiles. Bobby quickly looks around for someone else to 
               hit on, hails a cheerleader. Bud and Louanne walk off 
               together. Louanne stops when she sees her father, fearful of 
               his reaction.

                                     LOUANNE
                         He's not a football player any more. 
                         He's graduating this year.

                                     WINTERS
                         He's still got a bowl game.

               Louanne waits, not sure whether her father's angry or not.

                                     WINTERS
                         So make sure he doesn't violate 
                         curfew.

               Louanne smiles. Winters returns it, and walks away.

               ANGLE ON STEVE LATTIMER

               Sitting on the bench, his head in his hands, weeping.

                                     HARVEY (V.O.)
                         An amazing conclusion to a great 
                         season. We can see Steve Lattimer 
                         down on the bench weeping tears of 
                         joy as E.S.U. goes back to a bowl 
                         for the first time in three years.

               These are not tears of joy, but a man/boy who knows he'll 
               never be able to play pro football without steroids.

               EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - LATE AFTERNOON

               Joe sits on a bench at the intersection of four converging 
               Quad paths. Camille approaches from the opposite direction, 
               stops when she sees Joe.

                                     CAMILLE
                         What are you doin' here?

                                     JOE
                         Waitin' for you. I figured you'de 
                         have to come through here on your 
                         way to dinner.

               This softens, relaxes her a bit.

                                     CAMILLE
                         Shouldn't you be out celebrating? 
                         You played real well.

                                     JOE
                         I need your help with somethin'. I 
                         know I'm not your favorite guy right 
                         now, but it's all startin' again. 
                         The expectations, the pressure, the 
                         talk about the Heisman next year. I 
                         was wonderin' if you'de like to go 
                         somewhere, maybe share a six-pack 
                         with me?

               Camille's shocked that he might be drinking again. He pulls 
               a six pack of 7-Up out from behind his back. She laughs in 
               spite of herself. They settle again.

                                     JOE
                         I miss you, Camille. I don't like 
                         bein' without you.

                                     CAMILLE
                         I'll think about it.

               They look at each other a beat, come forward into a long 
               kiss and embrace as we pull up and back.

               CREDITS BEGIN TO ROLL AS

               EXT. STADIUM TUNNEL - DAY

               Coach Winters, flanked by Humes and Clayton, walks down the 
               tunnel to a waiting car. No effigy this time.

                                     HUMES
                         Tickets are in your coat. Itinerary 
                         and player profiles in the briefcase. 
                         We got a 9:00am tomorrow in Baltimore 
                         with the kid from Park. Then we're 
                         on to...

               They continue down the tunnel toward a new recruiting season, 
               another year in the annals of The Program.

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                         THE END
