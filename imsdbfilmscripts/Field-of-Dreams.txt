          My fathers name was John Kinsella.

          Its an Irish name. He was born in
          North Dakota, in 1896...

          Chicago. Tenement. Comiskey Park. Ballgames.

          RAY (V.O.)
          He settled in Chicago, where he quickly
          learned to live and die with the White
          Sox. Died a little when they lost the
          1919 World Series...

          eight members of the team were accused

          Dad (a catcher) playing ball. At work. Weeding.

          RAY (V.O.)
          He played in the minors for a year or
          two, but nothing ever came of it. Moved
          to Brooklyn in 35, married Mom in 38,
          and was already an old man working at
          the Naval Yards when I was born in 1949.

          My names Ray Kinsella. Mom died when
          I was three, and I suppose Dad did the
          best he could. Instead of Mother Goose,

          Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig...and the great
          Shoeless Joe Jackson. Dad was a Yankees
          fan then, so of course I rooted for
          Brooklyn. But in '58 the Dodgers moved
          away, so we had to find other things to
          fight about. We did. And when it came
          time to go to college, I picked the
          farthest one from home I could find.

          RAY (V.0.)
          This, of course, drove him right up the
          wail, which I suppose was the point.
          Officially my major was English, but
          really it was the Sixties.

          I marched, I smoked some grass, I tried

          Annie: blue jeans, T-shirt, freckles. Their courtship.

          RAY (V.0.)
          The only thing we had in common was that
          she came from Iowa and I had once heard
          of Iowa. We moved in together. After
          graduation, we moved to the Midwest, and
          stayed with her family as long as we
          could.

          We rented an apartment and I took a job
          selling insurance. I also drove a cab
          and worked in a pizza parlor. Dad died
          in June of 1 74. Annie and I got married
          that fail.

          A few years later Karin was born. She
          smelled weird, but we loved her anyway.
          Then Annie got the crazy idea that she
          could talk me into buying a farm.

                         2
          It is dusk on a spring evening. The sky is a robin's-egg
          blue, and the wind is soft as a day-old chick. Ray
          Kinsella is working in the cornfield when a voice -- like
          that of a public address announcer -- speaks to him.

                         THE VOICE
          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Ray looks up and around, but sees nothing that could be the
          source of this sound. All around him are empty fields.
          He stands quietly for a few moments, then goes back to
          work.

                         THE VOICE
          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Ray jerks his head in all directions to see where this
          voice is coming from, but again, he sees nothing unusual
          -- just the furrowed fields and a few hundred feet away,
          the massive old farmhouse with a sagging veranda on three
          sides. On the north veranda is a wooden porch swing where
          Annie and Karin sit, sipping lemonade and dreaming.

          Just now. Like an announcement.
          Annie confers briefly with Karin, then calls back to Ray.

          Ray thinks for a second, then shakes it off, trying to
          dislodge that thought from his mind, and gets back to work.

          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Again, he bolts upright and looks around. Again, he sees
          nothing. This is beginning to bug him. He calls:

          Ray is out in the fields again, hard at work. A breeze
          picks up. He stops fora moment, cocks an ear and looks
          around. All he sees are the empty fields. Insects make
          the only sounds. He goes back to work. Then:

          there is no apparent source of the voice. Ray is pissed.

          causes Ray to turn his head deliberately toward a portion
          of the cornfield between him and the house.

          For the briefest of moments, the dreamlike image of a
          baseball field at night, illuminated by floodlights, flares
          in over the lawn. Standing on the edge of the field, is
          the figure of a man with his back to us. Before we can see
          anything else, the image disappears.

          The dream image flares in again, this time closer to the
          man. He stands in the middle distance, silhouetted by the
          lights, and we see he is wearing a uniform of some kind.
          He starts to turn slowly towards us, but before we can see
          his face, the image disappears.

          I never forgave him for getting old.
          By the time he'was as old as I am now,
          he was ancient. He must have had
          dreams, but he never did anything about
          them. For all I know, he may have even
          heard voices, too, but he sure didn't
          listen to them. The man never did one
          spontaneous thing in all the years I
          knew him. Annie, I'm scared that that's
          what growing up means. I'm afraid of
          that happening to me. And something
          tells me this may be my last chance to
          do something about it.

          bought a new pair of spikes and they
          hurt his feet. About the sixth inning
          he took them off and played the outfield
          in just his socks. The other players
          kidded him, called him Shoeless Joe, and

                          49
           There is a Man standing on the edge ofthebaseballfield.
          Hi es wearing a baseball uniform.
          Anold-fashionedone.

                         50 INT HOUSE

                         50
          Ray turns to Annie. She looks out and nods thoughtfully.
          Annie stays very calm in emergencies.

                         ANNIE
          We'll put up some coffee. You go ahead.
          Ray takes a breath and steps out onto the veranda. The
          night sky seems close enough to touch.

          51 EXT. HOUSE


                         51
          On the porch wall, Ray finds the switch, holds his breath,
          flicks it and the floodlights sputter to life.

                         52 THE MAN

                         52
          steps onto the field. On his uniform is a large "S" with
          an "O" in the top crook, an "X" in the bottom, and an
          American flag with forty-eight stars on his left sleeve.

                         53 RAY

                         53
          walks through the swirling ground mist toward the field.

          54 RAY'S POINT OF VIEW

                         54
          Moving closer to the field we see the Man standing out in
          left field. Feet spread wide, body bent forward from the
          waist, hands on hips, he waits.

                         55 RAY

                         55
          Ray's mouth is dry. He reaches home plate and picks up one
          of the bats lying beside the pail of hard balls. The back
          of his neck tingles. Then, he picks up one of the balls.

          56 IN THE OUTFIELD

                         56
          The Man spreads his feet, pounds his small, old-style
          glove, and waits to field the ball.

          57 AT HOME PLATE 57
          Ray tosses the ball a few feet into the air and swings at
          it. And misses. His face reddens, he clears his throat,
          and tries again. This time he connects.

                         58 THE FIELD 58
          He has hit a grounder that would be easily fielded by a
          shortstop had there been one, but it bounces through and
          falls into left field. The Man runs in for it, scoops it
          up cleanly and throws it back to the plate.
          Ray is thrilled. He hits another ground ball, and this
          too, is fielded cleanly. Then another, which the Man
          deftly short-hops. Ray hollers out to him.

                         RAY
          How's the field play?

                         THE MAN
          It's good. The ball bounces true.
          Ray smiles with pride. He tosses up another ball, gives
          it his best swing, and is thrilled to see he has actually
          lofted one into the air. But into center field. The Man
          sprints across the outfield, and makes a lovely catch in
          short center. Instead of throwing the ball in, the Man
          runs it in, loping toward home plate. Ray's heart thumps.

                         RAY
          Hi.
          The Man nods at him, takes the bat, and tests it to feel
          its weight.

                         RAY
          Ray Kinsella.

                         THE MAN
          Joe Jackson.
          Ray is thrilled to hear the words spoken. It is Shoeless
          Joe Jackson after all, who stands not five feet away from
          him, trying out all the bats now. Ray isn't quite sure if
          he should talk, or ask questions, or just stand there.
          Finally, he can't help himself.

                         RAY
          I bet its good to be playing again,
          huh?

          Joe looks over at Ray, now, his dark eyes evincing the pain
          his steady voice tries to conceal.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          I've heard that old man wake up and
          scratch itchy legs that've been dust for
          fifty years. That was me. I'd wake up
          in the night with the smell of the
          ballpark in my nose and the cool of the
          grass on my feet. The thrill of the
          grass...
          He has found the bat he likes.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Can you pitch?

                         MODESTY)
          Yeah, I'm not bad.
          Joe hands Ray the bucket of balls. Ray can barely contain
          his excitement as he races to the mound. He stands on the
          rubber and faces Joe at the plate.

                         RAY
          Don't we need a catcher?

                         SHOELESS JOE
          Not if you can get it near the plate,
          we don't.
          Ray smiles, takes a breath and starts his windup, during
          which he says aloud to himself:

                         RAY
          I am pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson.
          He makes a pitch. It's not a very good one, and Joe has
          to step across the plate to make contact, but his swing is
          graceful, compact and effortlessly powerful. He drives the
          ball against the fence.
          Ray watches it with wonder and when he turns back, Jackson
          is gesturing with the bat for him to make the next pitch.
          Ray makes the standard pitcher's gesture for a curve ball.

                         RAY
          See if you can hit my curve.
          °He goes into an elaborate windup, throws it, it does not
          curve much, and Jackson whistles it right by Ray's ear.

                         RAY
          You bet.
          Ray makes another pitch, and Jackson hits a line drive down
          the third base line. Then a smoker down the first base
          line. Ray is mightily impressed.

                         RAY
          Wow.

          Damn, this feels good. Put it right
          here, huh?
          Joe holds the bat out low over the plate and Ray pitches
          it reasonably close to that spot. Jackson hits it out of
          the park, and beams. Ray brightens up with remembrance.

                         RAY
          Right, you were a low ball hitter.

          I'd have played for food money. it was
          the game, the sounds, the smells. You
          ever held a glove or a ball to your
          face?
          Ray smiles as he walks in from the mound.

          Yeah.

                         SHOELESS JOE
          And it was riding the trains from town
          to town. And the hotels with brass
          spittoons in the lobbies and brass beds
          in the rooms. And it was the crowd
          getting to their feet when the ball was
          hit deep. Shoot, I'd have played for
          free.
          The sound of a screen door turns their. attention to the

          Karin and Ray sit on the bleachers, eating peanuts while
          Shoeless Joe and his seven teammates practice. (Three,
          including Shoeless Joe, are in the outfield, two more in
          the infield, one pitches, one catches, and one bats.)
          The men are all in their twenties or thirties, but show the
          sheer enjoyment of returning after an absence of sixty-five
          years to the game they love.
          Ray directs Karin's attention to the left fielder.

                         RAY
          Watch Joe. Watch his feet as the
          pitcher gets the sign and starts to
          pitch. A good left fielder knows what
          pitch is coming, and he can tell from
          the.angle of the bat where the ball's
          going to be hit.
          At the sharp crack of the bat Shoeless Joe whirls, takes
          five loping strides toward the fence, turns again', reaches
          up, and the ball smacks into his glove.
          Karin cheers. One of the players good-naturedly boos.

          Excuse me, madam, but you're speaking
          of something about which you don't know
          squat. Terence Mann was a warm and
          gentle voice of.reason during a time of
          great madness. He coined the phrase
          'Make Love, Not War.' When others were
          chanting 'Burn, baby, burn,' he was
          writing about love, and peace, and
          understanding. He helped define an era.
          And a generation. And he helped us
          laugh at ourselves. I cherished every
          one of his books, and I dearly wish he'd
          write more. And if you had experienced
          even a little bit of the Sixties, you
          might feel the same way, too.

          hallway in which he sees the door to the storefront, as
          well as stairs to the apartments above it.
          There are half-a-dozen mail boxes on the wall. Ray checks
          the names. He smiles.

          Ray turns to the storefront door. Instead of a buzzer
          there is a long wire with a weight on its end hanging from
          a hole at the top of the door. Next to the wire is a
          handwritten note taped to the door, which reads: "You
          better have a goddamn good reason for ringing this bell."
          Ray laughs. This guy is great. He pulls on the wire. On
          the other side of the door, a bell rings.
          Ray has to struggle to control his nervousness. He takes
          a breath. He hears footsteps inside, approaching the door.
          He cannot help but smile with delight at the thought of
          meeting one of his cultural heroes.
          The door opens. Terence Mann is menacingly huge. He
          glares at Ray and roars:

                         MANN
          Who the fuck are you???-
          Ray is momentarily taken aback, but he figures maybe the
          guy is joking, so he just smiles and plunges ahead.

                         RAY
          Sir, my name is Ray Kinsella, and it's
          a great pleasure 'Co finally ---
          The door slams in his face. It takes Ray a few seconds to
          realize the interview is over.
          He rings the bell again. The door opens. Mann°s large
          frame fills it.

          It is hardly fashionable, but it's roomy and comfortable.
          There are tables stacked high with mailing envelopes and
          a postage scale. A few workbenches have software and
          spread sheets strewn across them. In the back are a couple
          of personal computers.
          On a side wall there are book jackets and newspaper photos
          in cheap frames: pictures of Mann with Martin Luther

          The message does not just glow, it pulsates. It looks
          almost otherworldly, phosphorescent; clearly unlike
          anything ever seen before on a ballpark scoreboard.

          95 RAY AND MANN

                         95
          Ray looks around him. The sounds of the game return, and
          from the unconcerned faces of the people near him, he
          realizes that no one else can see the message. He opens
          his program and starts writing it down. Mann notices this,
          but cannot see what Ray is writing.
          Then Ray hears The Voice.

                         THE VOICE
          'Go the distance.'

          If you want to go, we can go.
          Mann looks at Ray curiously, trying to read this new
          attitude.

                         MANN
          Then let's go.
          Mann rises and heads up the aisle. Ray looks down at the
          program -- at the handwritten legend of Moonlight Graham,
          who played one game fifty-seven years ago, but did not get
          to bat -- and follows Mann out of the ballpark.

          They ride in silence.

          I wish I had your passion, Ray. However
          misdirected it may be, it's still a
          passion. I used to feel that way about

          I already think you're crazy. What did

          After a little thought, Ray smiles sadly.

                         RAY
          It said 'The man's done enough. Leave
          him alone.'
          Ray puts the car in gear, makes a wide turn, and starts to
          head back up the street. But he stops short when Mann's
          form looks out of the darkness into the glare of the
          headlights..
          Ray does not know why Mann is blocking his path. Or why
          he appears tense, almost frightened.

          Ray opens the passenger door of the Datsun and Mann jumps
          in. Ray releases the brake and peels out, burning rubber.

          gloves dangling, on their way to a sandlot.

          I never got to bat in the major leagues.
          I'd have liked the chance -- just once
          -- to stare down a big league pitcher.
          Stare him down and then just as he goes
          into the windup -- wink! Make him
          wonder if I know something he doesn't.
          That's what I wish for. The chance to
          squint my eyes when the sky is so blue
          it hurts to look at it, and to feel the
          'tingle that runs up your arms when you
          connect dead-on. The chance to run the
          bases, stretch a double to a triple, and
          flop race-first into third, wrapping my
          arm around the bag. That's my wish, Ray
          Kinsella... that's my wish.
          Ray begins to smile. Graham is staring intently at him.

          rumble, crosses the metal cattle guard that keeps livestock
          from escaping to the roadway.
          He eases the car to a stop in front of the house, and as
          the three men unfold themselves from the car, Karin bolts
          from the back door of the house, a blur of white blouse and

          of the two bats he has been swinging in the on-deck circle,
          and advances on the plate, slashing the air with a
          brand-new bat the color of vanilla ice cream. He plants
          himself in the batter's b.ox, then cocks the bat, the top
          end of it trembling as if he were stirring something, and
          waits for the pitch.'
          The pitcher looks in for his signs. Archie stares back.
          As the pitcher goes into his windup, Archie winks at him.
          There is a moment of confusion and then anger on the
          pitcher's face, and when the ball speeds to the plate it
          is aimed right at Archie's head. He dives out of the way
          and hits the dirt hard. The Catcher chuckles through his
          mask.

          Good thing for you that wasn't his
          fastball.
          Archie digs in again at the plate, but backs up just a
          little. Now his look to the pitcher is one of
          determination.

          Come on, let's see your fastball.
          The pitcher smiles, winds up and throws. Very fast. And
          right at Archie's chin. Again, he has to dive out of the
          way. This time, however, he gets right up and immediately
          appeals to the Umpire.

          Both benches laugh at that. Archie holds up his hands to

          Archie takes his place in the batter's box again. He still
          looks determined, but a little less cocky. The next pitch
          is a curve that looks as if it's heading right for him.
          But he holds his ground, and when the ball breaks down and
          away, he steps in, snaps the bat forward, and hits it.
          The ball sails in a high arc to right center. The center
          fielder backs up a couple of steps, lopes a few strides to
          his left, and makes the catch.
          Archie is out, but the runner on third tags up and scores.
          As Archie curls across the diamond from the first baseline
          to the Giants' bench, he hears cheering.
          In the stands, Ray, Annie, Karin and Mann are giving him
          a standing ovation. In return, he touches the brim of his

          has marked the time. This field, this °
          game... it's a piece of our past. It
          reminds us of all that once was good.
          And that could be again. People will

          Some people,have gotten out of their cars and wait
          patiently. One or two families sit on their hoods, or have

                         RAY
          Is there a heaven?

                         164 JOHN

                         164
          takes time to answer that. He looks up at the night sky
          and searches it.

                         JOHN
          Oh, yeah...
          Then he looks square into Ray's eyes.

                         JOHN
          Heaven's where dreams come true.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         116

                         165 RAY

                         165
          looks toward the house and sees his wife and daughter on
          the veranda, a moon bright as butter silvering the night
          above them. He smiles. He finally understands. He turns
          back to John and nods.

                         RAY
          Then maybe this is heaven.

                         166 JOHN

                         166
          smiles wisely in return.

                         JOHN
          Well...good night, Ray.

                         RAY
          Good night.

                         167 MASTER

                         167
          John starts to walk off toward the door in the outfield
          fence.

                         RAY
          Hey!
          John turns back. Ray is holding a ball.

                         RAY
          You wanna have a catch?
          John closes his eyes for a second, and when he opens them;
          there is the hint of moisture. Does he know Ray is his
          son?

                         JOHN
          I'd like that.

          Ray tosses him the ball, picks up a glove lying there, and
          puts it on.

          They throw the ball back and forth.

          And as we pull up higher and higher we see a father and son
          bathed by white floodlights and car headlights... on the
          silent, satiny green of a baseball diamond at the edge of
          a cornfield.

                         FADE OUT

                         THE END
