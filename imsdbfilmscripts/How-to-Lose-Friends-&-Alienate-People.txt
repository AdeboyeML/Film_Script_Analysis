           ...British, fifties, a melodrama. We're looking at an
           ACTRESS - glamorous, young - but very much in the back
           ground of the scene - a secretary typing at her desk.

           A YOUNG BOY sits watching the film, his clothes and the
           room around him telling us this is England in the 1960s. He

           journalist...a hack. (Beat) Yeah,
           that...that isn't me.
           We PAN right and down to our hero - SIDNEY YOUNG -
           thirties, an odd-ball with a knack for getting people to
           dislike him.

           This is me at the Golden Globe
           Awards in L.A. this year. That's
           my Armani tuxedo. That's a Rolex
           Sea-Dweller 4000 watch I'm
           wearing.
           Still in SLOW-MOTION we TRACK BACK and see that Sidney is
           at a table with several other people, all staring raptly
           past us to the stage which is out of shot.

           would let me have sex with her if
           she won the Best Actress Award.
           Still in SLOW MOTION, Sophie suddenly covers her face with
           her hands and begins to stand.

           I used to pretend it was
           different for me because I was
           getting paid by a magazine or
           newspaper, whatever. But that's,
           you know...I just loved watching

           in through the window and think
           what it would be like to somehow
           get inside. But there was only
           one way to get past the thin red
           line that separates the

           Look, I was told to bring him,
           hand him over to the producer,

           The Looky-Loos dream is that one
           day they will somehow get to
           mingle with the stars. But the
           Industry can't allow any
           mingling. Stars have to be kept
           away from civilians, have to be
           quarantined, so they don't become
           normal. Like us.
           They pass a ravishing HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS walking the other
           way. She looks curiously at the pig as she passes. Sidney
           stares after her, longingly.

           presence. As we watch she greets an approaching CELEBRITY
           gushingly. Seizing his chance Sidney darts towards the door
           and, tray held aloft to cover his face, slips through into

          notice - he is staring past her to where there is something
          of a COMMOTION amongst the guests. The PR Woman is hurrying
          across the room, hissing into her ear-piece. Somebody
          screams. Then to Sidney's horror a group of guests scatter
          in panic and the cause of the commotion is revealed: the
          Pig charges into view, heading straight for him.

           A drunken Sidney dances frenetically on a small dance floor
           made of squares of flashing color, compensating with
           enthusiasm for what he lacks in coordination. The women on
           the floor shuffle further and further away from him.

           Sidney walks down the street, staring bright eyed at the
           city around him, in love with New York. A SEXY WOMAN in a
           short dress passes him. Sidney ogles her as she walks into
           a BAR.

          Sidney gestures to the Barman to make it two. He sits
          trying to think of something to say. The barman returns
          with their drinks.

          The Woman looks at him without expression. Sidney sips his

           is it? That's not...put a dash of
           beer in that.
          A young woman has been sitting on the other side of Sidney.
          This is ALISON OLSEN (20s) smart, attractive, dressed in an
          elegant but no-nonsense suit. She is writing in a NOTEBOOK.
          She looks up and notices Sidney.

           Is he? He's fucking small isn't
           he?
          He smiles at the Sexy Woman, hoping to get a laugh. Alison
          examines Sidney coolly, points to the drink on the bar in
          front of Sidney.

                          ALISON

           The lift stops and a TALL WOMAN enters. She is expensively
           dressed, wears Chanel dark glasses, an expression of
           granite and an air of superhuman froideur.
           Alison exchanges the slightest of nods with her and stares
           tensely ahead. Only Sidney, busy chewing, is oblivious to
           the plunge in temperature.
           For a moment there is only the soft whir of the lift. Then
           Sidney begins to choke on some burger. He wheezes for a
           moment, gagging.
           The Woman stiffens slightly but shows no other sign of
           having noticed the revolting noises coming from behind her.
           Alison closes her eyes.
           Sidney gives a violent cough and a chunk of chewed burger
           and coleslaw flies out of his mouth and lands on the back
           of the oblivious Woman's Prada jacket.
           Sidney notices and raises a tentative hand to brush the
           offending item away.
           Before he can move Alison silently takes his wrist in a
           vice-like grip.

           They turn to see a young woman standing across the pool

           statuesque, no make-up, hair simply pulled back.
           Sophie tries to walk around the pool to join them but finds
           she can't work her way through the crowd. She turns to her
           right but finds her way similarly blocked.
           She hesitates for a moment and then with a shrug climbs
           down into the pool, the water up to her chest, and begins
           to walk through the floating flowers towards them.
           Sidney stares at her, TRANSFIXED. Alison notices this with
           some contempt.
           Gradually everyone notices Sophie and stops to look.
           Having reached the other side, Sophie ascends the pool
           steps, laughing, her dress clinging to her: Venus rising

           Sidney walks down the corridor. He slows, his expression
           changing suddenly.
           SIDNEY'S P.O.V - Elizabeth Maddox is walking down the
           corridor towards us, face set.
           Sidney keeps on walking, staring to one side of Elizabeth.
           As they draw level, the heel of one of Elizabeth's shoes
           snaps off and she lurches sideways, colliding with the wall
           before sprawling onto the floor in front of Sidney.
           Sidney hesitates. He notices Alison watching with baited
           breath from the other end of the corridor. For a moment
           nobody moves then Sidney steps over Elizabeth's prone form
           without a word and keeps on walking.
           Alison gives a sigh of relief, nods in approval and walks
           on.

           Harding stalks out of the room. Blushing, Sidney stares
           after him, nodding vaguely. As he gathers his notebook he
           becomes aware of the smirks on the faces of Maddox and the
           others as they leave.

           in a blonde wig, whips off his/her panties. There is a
           collective gasp from the room. Sidney can't stop laughing.
           Suddenly he notices everyone in the room is now staring at
           the door. He turns to see Mrs Harding and her girls
           standing, shell-shocked, in the doorway. Alarmed, Sidney

           discussing a mock-up of a new cover for Sharps. After a

           celebration is in order.

           Snow falls. Sidney climbs out of a limousine with Eleanor
           and Sophie.
           The women breeze past the Doorman and into the club. Sidney
           hesitates on the thresh-hold, staring up at the sign above
           him as if it's a magic portal.
           Sidney walks in.

          He takes some papers from a shelf and hands them to her.

           Sophie and her entourage, including Sidney and Eleanor,
           climb out of a line of limousines and walk into the Hotel.
           Sidney stands for a moment, looking around him. Hollywood.

           We hear the opening of Virgina Plain by Roxy Music.

           We are swooping in towards the hotel and an enormous
           BILLBOARD ADVERTISEMENT for Sophie's new film - in pre-
           production. It's a re-make of Singing In The Rain - with
           Russel Crowe.
           We BOOM down from Sophie's fifteen foot laughing face to
           find Sidney standing on a slim ledge outside his hotel
           window. He is drunk and wearing only his underwear. He is
           also yelling with fear.
           The window behind him is crowded with people shrieking with
           laughter.
           Gingerly he edges back to the window and climbs back
           into...

           high.
           Sophie calmly unzips her dress and steps out of it,
           standing in her underwear. There is applause from the on-
           lookers. Calmly she steps out of the window onto the ledge
           and disappears from sight.
           The on-lookers crane out of the window, yelling
           encouragement.
           After a moment Sophie appears at another window further
           along the wall and climbs back into the room to ecstatic
           applause. She stares imperiously at Sidney.

           Beside him Sophie covers her face with her hands and starts
           to stand, having just won Best Actress.

           Sidney stares at her hands - she is wearing his gold ring.
           We move back into real time, sound swells up, thunderous
           applause. Sidney claps along with the others.
           Then he stands up and goes after Sophie.

           Sophie turns back to him, her smile fixed.

                          SIDNEY (CONT'D)
           I need my ring back.
           As if puzzled by her inability to make it to the stage,
           Sophie, still smiling, tries to pull her arm free. Eleanor
           is instantly beside them, trying to disengage Sidney's
           hand.

           She isn't the One. My mother gave
           me that ring and told me I had to
           give it to the One. She isn't the
           One.
           The applause is still going strong. TV Cameras move in on
           Sophie as she starts to struggle, her smile slipping.
           Sidney tries to pull the ring free from her finger.
           Officials move in.

           KILLED CUBA!
           Sophie stares at him for a moment then with a shriek
           launches herself at him. They tumble backwards.
           The Officials rush upon them. There are gasps from the
           other tables, people standing up to see what's going on.

           run across the room, overturning a table in the process,
           Officials racing after him.
           Sidney sprints for the doors. He notices Vincent Lepak's
           startled face as he passes it. He stops, ducks back and
           slaps the back of Vincent's head, knocking the SHADES onto
           the floor. Sidney stamps on them and runs on. Vincent gapes
           after him.

           momentarily stopped by the sight of the massed PAPARAZZI 
           ahead, behind the red rope. The Paparazzi stare back at 
           Sidney - his face bruised, shirt collar ripped - equally 
           nonplussed. There is a frozen moment then Sidney plunges 
           forward, ducking under the red rope, back amongst his own 
           kind, pushing through them until he disappears amongst the 
           crowd.

           Sidney sits in the almost deserted terminal waiting for the
           flight back to New York. He is still wearing his
           dishevelled tux. He looks down at his tightly clenched hand
           and slowly opens his fingers to reveal his RING.

           Sidney is in a cab, still wearing his tux, his travel bag
           slung over shoulder. He stares out as the cab passes the
           entrance to a PARK. A sign advertises an outdoor screening
           of La Dolce Vita.

                          SIDNEY

          151 EXT. NEW YORK PARK - EVENING 151

           An outdoor CINEMA has been set up. LA DOLCE VITA is playing
           on a large screen. A crowd sits around the park, watching
           the movie.
           Sidney stands scanning the crowd. He locates Alison sitting
           near the back.

           112.

                         

                         
          She is holding her notebook, watching the movie. Beside her
          is the remains of a picnic, with lit candles.
          Sidney smiles and starts towards her, then stops. She is
          sitting next to a MAN. As Sidney watches she rests her head
          on his shoulder.
          Sidney watches, numb, then turns to walk away...
          BOB stands in front of him in full drag, waving
          frantically. He starts to run towards Sidney, who sighs and
          closes his eyes - as if things weren't bad enough.
          Then Bob runs straight past him. Sidney turns to see the
          Man next to Alison standing up to embrace Bob. The two
          kiss.

          ON THE GRASS
          Alison watches Bob and her friend embrace with a touch of
          sadness. Suddenly she realises someone is standing beside
          her. She looks up and sees Sidney.
          She stares at him. Long Beat.
          Sidney holds out his hand.
          Alison hesitates and then takes his hand and stands up.

                          ALISON
           Finished.
          Sidney smiles. He takes the notebook from her and tosses it
          back onto the picnic blanket. Then he kisses her. As he
          does so he takes the RING and slips it into Alison's coat
          pocket.
          Then they begin to dance, cha-cha-chaaing happily at the
          back of the park, as the music swells, lit by the
          flickering light from the screen.
          Suddenly Sidney freezes, staring over Alison's shoulder to
          where we can see he has accidentally thrown her NOTEBOOK
          onto a lit candle.
          It is now ON FIRE.
          Sidney shoves Alison aside and dives for the book...
