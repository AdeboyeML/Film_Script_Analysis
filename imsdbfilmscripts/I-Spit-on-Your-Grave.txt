           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 

          JENNIFER HILLS races down from a stoop, a suitcase rolling
          along behind her. Even dressed down, this city girl can't
          hide her natural beauty and panache.
          She makes her way across the street and to an SUV. she opens
          the trunk and tosses in the suitcase among several other
          bags.

          She closes it, and walks to the driver's side. We see that
          the entire cargo bay of the SUV is filled with boxes and
          personal affects.

          Al INT. SUV, CITY STREET - DAY Al

          Jennifer gets in and slams the door shut. she takes a moment
          to think, to breathe. Something is weighing heavily on her
          mind.

          After a beat, she glances up to the rearview mirror and looks
          at herself. She take a long, deep, cleansing breath, and
          then she turns the key in the ignition and starts the car.

          The SUV drives off down the city street.

          C1 EXT. CITY OVERPASS - DAY C1 

          The SUV carves its way through traffic as the city looms in
          the background, growing more distant by the second.

          2 INT. CAR, RURAL ROAD - DAY 2 

          The midday sun bakes the landscape as Jennifer drives through
          a country road. A stark contrast from the city, and
          absolutely breathtaking.

          Turn right up ahead.


          Jennifer squints out the front windshield. The streets are
          all unpaved and none of them are marked with street signs.

          Finally, Jennifer pulls into the driveway of a small house.
          She picks up a piece of paper from the passenger seat, checks
          the address on the house, and gets out of the car.

          3 EXT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 3

          Jennifer walks up the crumbling steps of the house. On the
          screen door, a wire holds a wooden sign that reads; OPEN.
          The screen door SQUEAKS loudly as Jennifer pulls it open.

                         JENNIFER
          Hello?

          Jennifer cautiously steps inside.

          4 INT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 4

          The sunlight shines through the dirty curtains. Dust clouds
          hang motionless in the air, as if suspended in a solution.
          Scattered across the floor are a variety of electronics in
          various stages of disrepair. A handful of old, picture tube
          TVs with their plastic casings cracked.

                         JENNIFER
          Hello?

          Jennifer walks in further, trying to not step on anything.

          EARL (O.S.)
          I'm a coming, I'm a coming.

          From out of the back walks the proprietor, EARL (late-50's),
          takes a double take at Jennifer, surely the prettiest thing
          he's seen in a long while. He sees her standing in the
          middle of the mess, suddenly aware of it. He bends down to
          pick something up in a futile attempt to clean.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          Sorry about the mess.

                         JENNIFER
          It's fine, really. I'm Jennifer

          Earl's surprised.

                         EARL
          Oh, you're Miss Hills.

          Earl walks over to a cabinet against the wall, opens a small
          drawer and takes out a key.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          Don't suppose you know how to get
          out there?

                         JENNIFER
          Afraid not.

          Earl hands her the key. Earl pulls a map with some hand-drawn
          arrows already on it.

                         EARL
          Alright, listen up 'cause it's a bit
          tricky.

          These here arrows will get you
          through town. Over here, it's more
          dirt road and woods so it can get
          kind of dicey. We're a tad short
          on street signs.

                         JENNIFER
          Well if I get lost I'll just ask
          for directions.

          Jennifer looks at the map.

          5 EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY 5

          Jennifer drives down the two lane road, barely passable by
          two cars. She swerves as she glances down at map.
          Then, up ahead she spots a small SERVICE STATION with a
          single gas pump. She pulls up to the pump.

          EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY 6 

          Jennifer gets out of the car and fumbles to fold back the map
          as she twists the knob off her gas tank and reaches for the
          pump. A HAND comes down on top of her own.

          Jennifer spins around. 

          Standing there, smiling, is JOHNNY. He takes the pump from
          Jennifer and inserts it into her gas tank.

                         JOHNNY
          Didn't mean to frighten you.

          Johnny is good-looking in a rugged sort of way. He's sinewy,
          but athletic and strong. Jennifer regains her composure.

                         JENNIFER
          No, it's fine. I'm sort of lost
          anyway. Looking for Mockingbird
          Trail?

                         JOHNNY
          You are definitely lost.

          Really? I thought--

                         JOHNNY
          Nah, you sure missed it. It's a 
          good ten miles back, left turn 
          after the big red mailbox.

          Johnny flashes his smile, picking his teeth with a toothpick.
          Jennifer stands there uncomfortably.

                         JOHNNY
          You, uh... staying at the cabin?

          Jennifer hesitates for a second. Just as Jennifer opens her
          mouth to respond, the shrill notes of a HARMONICA shatter the
          silence. Jennifer turns quickly to the garage.

          In the garage, ANDY, one of Johnny's employees, sits on the
          fender of a broken down car. He holds a harmonica to his
          lips. He's in his mid-30's with shaggy hair and arms that
          look like they could bend steel.

          STANLEY, one of Johnny and Andy's buddies, walks up behind
          Andy. He's balding and overweight, and digs into a bag of
          pork rinds.

                         STANLEY 
          Howdy ma'am. 

          He leans into Andy who continues playing his harp. 

                         ANDY
          I'd sop that up with a biscuit real
          good.

          Jennifer turns away from the garage and looks back at Johnny,
          who is still awaiting her answer.

                         JENNIFER
          Uh... no. I mean yes.

          As she glances to the gas pump, Johnny looks her up and down.
          She is definitely something to look at.

          Johnny places his hand on the hood of the car. Glances to
          the guys, then back to her.

                         JOHNNY
          You know, you're running a little
          hot. Want me to uh... maybe I
          should check under your hood?

          Jennifer almost laughs at the way that sounded.

                         JENNIFER
          How's that line working for you?

          The gas pump clicks off interrupting. But Johnny just stands
          there looking at her.

          you?

          Johnny saunters over to the pump and in a phallic manner,
          pulls the pump out. It gets laughs from the peanut gallery.
          Jennifer looks away, a line has been crossed. She looks to
          the pump again. $19.78.

          Jennifer fumbles into her purse when the map falls from her
          hands.

                         JOHNNY
          I'll get that.

                         JENNIFER
          No I got it--

          Johnny gets uncomfortably close to Jennifer at the rear door
          of the car when--
          HONK -- HONK -- HONK - The SUV's deafening alarm blares out.
          Johnny's startled, stumbles backwards, trips and goes
          sprawling to the ground.

          Jennifer, controlling laughter, holds up her keys and clicks
          the alarm off.

          Johnny is covered in dust and oil, struggling to get to his
          feet while maintaining a shred of dignity. Jennifer
          chuckles.


                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Sorry. I accidentally hit the
          panic button. Are you okay?

                         JOHNNY
          I'm fine.

          Johnny looks away, angry. He's certainly not the type of guy
          who can laugh at himself easily, if at all. From the garage,
          Stanley and Andy point at him and guffaw.

                         ANDY
          (from the garage)
          Hey! You better check your
          underwear, Johnny.

          Stanley smiles and elbows Andy, but his mouth is too full
          with pork rinds to actually laugh.

                         STANLEY
          Yea... Check um' for skidmarks...
          Johnny shoots him a harsh look. 

          Jennifer hands Johnny a twenty. Trying to contain her
          laughter.

          Suddenly, Jennifer grows uneasy. She smiles uncomfortably,
          gets in the car and drives away.

          Johnny takes a bandana from his pocket and wipes his brow.
          He watches Jennifer's car disappear and spits on the ground
          as the laughter escalates in her absence. Johnny spins.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          What the hell are you two dipshits
          laughing at?!

          7 EXT. CABIN - DAY 7

          Jennifer arrives at the cabin. She gets out of her car and
          stands there, looking up at it. In slight disrepair and in
          need of a paint job but the quaint charm makes you quickly
          forget its shortcomings.

          8 TNT. CABIN - DAY 8 

           Jennifer walks in with her bags, looks around the cabin.
           It's rustic, but she's hardly roughing it.

          9 INT. CABIN, THE KITCHEN - DAY 9 

           She starts unpacking. A few cardboard boxes with non-
          perishable food items sit on the counter next to cases of
          bottled water. Also, there's a large wine case with
          different liquor bottles in the sections. Jennifer takes out
          a bottle of top shelf vodka and puts it in the freezer.
          Then she begins to grab the wine bottles, taking an extra
          second to look at one, the hell with it, she grabs an opener.

          A9 TNT. CABIN - DAY A9 
          Jennifer sets up her laptop at a make-shift workstation.
          Throws some freshly cut flowers in a small vase, a few lucky
          figurines from her travels... it all feels very ritualistic.

          Jennifer site at the end of the boat dock. Laptop and glass

          CLOSE ON: Words fly across the screen as Jennifer types at a
          furious pace. Blocks of text keep scrolling away.
          Her fingers effortlessly swipe away at key after key, a
          writer's high if you will.
          Finally an exclamation point is stabbed with emphasis. Then 
          she hears a sound off in the trees. 
          She looks out and hears a very distant few notes of a 
          harmonica. Then a few even more distant "heeeeeeweeeee". 
          After a beat she innocently smiles figuring it's just some 
          boys off in the distance having a party or something. 
          Jennifer leans back, smiles briefly and pour herself a glass
          of wine.

          11 EXT. CABIN, FRONT PORCH - DUSK 11 

          Jennifer sits at the table, her laptop propped open in front
          of her. She's talking away on the phone as she stops for a
          moment to take a sip from a glass of red wine.

          The wind kicks up and a in the distance a door is slammed
          shut. It startles jennifer. She looks in the direction of the
          sound.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Sorry, something just...

          Jennifer sets down her lap top and puts the glass of wine on
          the arm of the chair. She gets up and looks off into the
          dusky woods. Then back to the house.
          A light breeze kicks up and SLAM. Again.

          the front porch.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Hello?
          In response, she gets the frantic CHIRPING of crickets as
          night encroaches.
          Jennifer walks down a path and in the near distance she see a

          SHED. SLAM!
          The SHED DOOR is kicking open and closed in the breeze.
          She makes her way towards the shed.
          All EXT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK All
          Jennifer gets to the shed. The door is wide open. She steps
          inside.

          B11 INT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK B11

          Inside there is an array of old gardening tools. Pots,
          garbage cans. Some different chemical bottles including a jug
          of LYE.
          Jennifer thinks she hears something from deep inside the
          shed. She moves in further as--

          SLAM!
          The door shuts behind her -

                         JENNIFER
          Shit!

          C11 EXT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK C11

          Jennifer exits, and securely closes the shed door. After a
          beat she smirks at the thought that she thought this was more
          than just a door blowing in the wind, then heads back to the
          cabin.

          D12 EXT. CABIN, FRONT PORCH -DUSK D12 

          Jennifer walks up to the chair, moves her laptop, sits and
          then as she grabs her phone she knocks the glass of wine off
          the arm of the chair into her lap.

          She get up, looks at the red wine stain all over her lap, and
          picks up her things to heads in the cabin.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Way to go Jennifer...
          The last of the days light is disappearing.

          12 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 12

          Jennifer stands at the sink, in panties and tank top - pre-
          soaking her sweater and pants.

          POV THROUGH KITCHEN WINDOW:
          Jennifer continues at the sink, her beautiful, partially nude
          body is framed perfectly in the window for all to see... but
          no one's around for miles...

          14 EXT. WOODS - DAY 14 

          Jennifer jogs through the trees. She wears a tight pair of
          running shorts and a out off T-shirt.
          Jennifer stops in a small clearing. With her hands on her
          knees, she struggles to catch her breath.
          She stands and walks in a circle, looks around. Checks her
          watch.
          Then notices something in the distance hidden behind the
          trees.
          ANGLE ON: A dilapidated shack, rotted from decay and neglect.
          Jennifer's curiosity gets the best of her.

          15 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 15 

          She walks up to the shack, looks around. She then enters
          through what is left of the front door.

          A15 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY A15

          The place hasn't been occupied in quite a while, but it was
          once. An old, dirty mattress in the corner... a sawhorse-for-
          a-counter with old cans and bottles... even a rusty old
          garden tool or two.
          Near the window she sees an old, mold covered BIBLE propped
          open.
          Jennifer suddenly gets the chills, she shakes it off and then
          gets the hell out of there.

          16 EXT. CABIN - DAY 16

           Jennifer finishes her jog and returns to the cabin, leans 
           over on the porch and catches her breath. 

          17 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM - DAY 17 

          Jennifer stands in front of the mirror. She looks at her
          reflection and pulls out the band that was holding up her
          ponytail. Her sweat-soaked hair falls across her shoulders.
          She turns on the faucet and is met with a dirty spray.

                         JENNIFER
          Eww!
          The spray only lasts a few seconds before sputtering out.
          However, then the toilet starts to GURGLE. Jennifer lifts
          the lid up with her foot. The toilet water bubbles up and
          then disappears down the drain.

          Again, Jennifer tries the sink, but now nothing comes out.

          18 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 18

          Jennifer picks up her cellphone from the counter. She takes
          a small piece of paper out of her purse and punches in some
          numbers on the cell. After a few rings, voicemail picks up.

          Jennifer snaps the phone shut in frustration, when her eye
          catches the water-damaged remnants of a service sticker
          hanging to the refrigerator door.
          Amazingly, the phone number is still visible. She shrugs to
          herself and dials the number.

          She lifts the lid and looks inside - dry - and flushes a few
          more times to no avail - then dirty water begins to gurgle
          up.

          I'm not going anywhere.
          As Jennifer snaps her phone shut, the handset gets caught on
          her chin, and tumbles into the toilet. PLOP!

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Oh shit!
          Jennifer reaches down into the toilet and immediately fishes
          it out. She shakes it off vigorously.

          20 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 20 

          Jennifer stands next to the kitchen counter. She holds her
          hair dryer which is going at full blast. Her cell phone is
          propped open on the counter in front of her. She's doing her
          best to dry it out.
          Suddenly, a hand reaches out and taps her on the shoulder.
          Jennifer SCREAMS and spins around, turning the hair dryer on
          her assailant.
          An equally frightened MATTHEW throws his hands up in front of
          his face and SCREAMS just as loudly. He has several think
          colored rubber bands on his wrist.

          Jennifer breathes a sigh of relief, especially after she gets
          a look at Matthew. He's in his mid-30's, but could pass for
          a good ten years younger. Awkward and shy, he can barely
          make eye contact with her.

          Matthew works away underneath the sink. Jennifer watches him
          from the bedroom sitting on the end of the bed, trying to
          make small talk.

                         JENNIFER

          Matthew continues his work, you can tell he is uncomfortable
          with the conversation.

          Matthew comes out from under the sink. He snaps nerviously
          at one of the rubber bands on his wrist.

                         MATTHEW
          My... my whole life...
          Jennifer looks to his wrist. It's all red.
          Matthew turns on the faucet. Out comes a hard stream of
          cold, clear water. He flushes the toilet and then turns on
          the shower to the same result.

                         MATTHEW (CONT'D)

          Jennifer squeals with excitement. She wraps her arms around
          Matthew and plants a kiss on his cheek.

                         JENNIFER
          Thank you!
          Matthew blushes furiously and fumbles his tools as he packs
          up. For him, the kiss was more embarrassing than enjoyable.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. I just... you saved me
          from having to bathe in the pond. 
          Once his tools are all packed away, Matthew dashes out of the
          cabin. Jennifer follows him to the front door.

          What do you mean like on the toilet

          Stanley pulls a tape out of his pocket and loads it.

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          Matthew hasn't had a girl since he
          was sucking his mama's titties.

                         STANLEY
          Not true, my friends. And the
          evidence is right here.

          This gets Johnny's attention. Matthew is snapping on of the
          rubber bands. It's a bit loud. Johnny looks to him as if it
          is annoying him.

                         JOHNNY
          What babe from the city?

                         STANLEY
          You know, the one who stopped for
          gas the other day. The one who
          dumped you on your can. She had
          Matty here fixing her pipes.

                         JOHNNY
          Bullshit.
          Matthew snaps the rubber band more. Johnny turns quickly to
          him.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Cut that shit homo! How many times
          I gotta tell you.
          Stanley gets the camera ready.

                         STANLEY
          She even gave him a kiss for
          "servicing her." Look, here's
          Matthew running from the cabin like
          a schoolgirl.
          They all gather around.
          POV CAMERA: Matthew runs from the cabin, dropping tools as
          he goes. Jennifer stands in the doorway calling after him.
          The camera goes closer on Jennifer --
          The guys break up. Johnny is a bit more serious.

                         ANDY
          Now that's some fine camera work,
          even better than the time you
          filmed yo' self hangin' your nana's
          cat.

          If you all don't shut the hell up
          you'll miss the encore.
          All eyes turn to Stanley as Stanley pushes some buttons on
          the MINIDV cam. Andy comes over and looks at the LCD screen.

                         STANLEY
          Get ready for it.
          ON MINIDV: The footage that Stanley shot is obviously the
          previous night through Jennifer's kitchen window.

                         ANDY
          I'll be. Look at the rack on that
          pony.
          Andy punches Stanley in the arm. Johnny just stares at the
          screen.

                         ANDY
          Sure is something to look at.
          Matthew is clearly uncomfortable, but he desperately needs to
          be one of the guys.

                         MATTHEW
          Yeah, and she likes me... she was
          nice to me.
          Stretching a rubber band.

          Nice? To her, you're nothing but a
          shitter fixer. Hell, she wouldn't
          even give Johnny the time of day.
          Johnny snaps his head up and looks at Stanley.

                         JOHNNY
          Bullshit. I could tame that ass if
          I wanted to.

          You don't think I could have her

          Andy looks away and begins to reel in his line. Stanley
          stuffs his face with some crap so he doesn't have to answer.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Bitch like that comes up here for

                         MATTHEW
          Nah... She's not like that, Johnny.
          Johnny snorts, condescendingly.

          cock-teasing whore is all she is.
          He flicks his cigarette and it sizzles out in the water. Then
          he gets right up in Matthew's face.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          You'd have no idea what to do with

          23 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 23

          Jennifer writes away at the dining room table. She's on a
          tear. A "writer's zone" where everything she types is gold.
          She hits the "return" key hard, as if to punctuate a
          particularly good sentence. She picks up some lip gloss and
          puts it on.

          She leans back to take a break when her eye catches the cell
          phone sitting on the table. She picks the phone up, flips it
          open - It's still completely dead.
          In frustration, she throws the phone across the room. It
          hits the couch right next to the duffle bag. She smiles
          mischievously to herself.
          Jennifer reaches inside and withdraws a sandwich bag filled
          with pot and rolling papers. She expertly rolls herself a
          joint and lights it up. She closes her eyes. Bliss.

          24 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT -- LATER 24

          From a distance, the cabin looks like a star twinkling in the
          night sky. Trees sway in the breeze, dappling the light.

          25 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 25

          Jennifer's head is slouched over her desk. She passed out.
          Suddenly, A SCRATCHING NOISE at the front door.
          CLOSE ON: Jennifer's eyes flit open as -
          Jennifer jumps awake and walks over to check the door,
          glancing at the clock as she goes. 4:14 am.
          Jennifer gets to the door and listens, Nothing. She tries
          to look out... nothing.
          She turns to walk back when the scratching returns -
          Jennifer takes a few steps back toward the door. Again, the
          noise stops.

                         JENNIFER
          Hello?
          Silence. Jennifer rises up on her toes and looks out the
          glass window of the front door. The porch is deserted.
          Jennifer opens the door slowly.

          26 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 26

          Jennifer looks outside but nothing is there. Just a gentle
          breeze and the sway of the trees. Satisfied, she walks out
          onto the front porch, then down the steps. She hugs herself
          and shivers, then she returns inside.

          Jennifer shuts the front door and locks it. Then she yanks
          on the door, just to make sure.

          28 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 28

          She walks back in grabbing her glass and bottle when --

          29 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 29

          The SCRAPING sound again, but this time, from UPSTAIRS.
          Jennifer looks up, hoping that she imagined it. But there it
          is again. She sets the bottle and glass down on the end table
          next to the couch and then grabs a can of MACE from her purse
          on the couch.

          30 INT. CABIN, STAIRCASE - NIGHT 30 

          She walks slowly, holding the mace directly in front of her.
          Eventually, Jennifer gets to the top of the stairs.
          At the far end of the hallway is an open window. A branch
          from outside scrapes against the windowsill.
          Jennifer lets out a sigh of relief. She closes the window
          and heads back downstairs.

          31 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - NIGHT 31 

          She puts the mace back in her purse, and then picks up her
          drink walking to the kitchen when--
          BANG! Something smashes into the sliding glass door--
          Jennifer SCREAMS dropping the glass. It SHATTERS.
          With more than a hint of trepidation, Jennifer heads towards

          THE SIDE DOOR.
          With all the courage she can muster up, Jennifer unlocks the
          door and steps outside.

          The side porch light acts as a spotlight, illuminating the
          culprit -- a lone bird lies motionless on the ground.
          Jennifer bends down and picks up a small branch from the
          porch. She gives the bird a small poke... nothing. But her
          uneasiness is growing. Suddenly... SLAM!
          She jumps and looks to the shed, the door is open again and
          swinging. She looks to it thinking, "I shut that already..."
          She moves off the porch and toward the shed.

          33 EXT. CABIN, SHED - NIGHT 33

          Jennifer walks to the shed, it feels longer in the dark. She
          looks around to the tree line, could be something out there,
          an animal, who knows.
          She reaches the shed and shuts the door again. She searches
          the ground and sees a large stone.
          She picks up the stone and shoves it against the door.
          Satisfied, she heads back.

          34 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 34

          Jennifer immediately goes over to her table where the laptop
          is set up. She shuffles some papers around when-
          Something on her laptop screen catches her attention. She
          leans forward, brow furrowed.
          ON LAPTOP SCREEN: A picture of Johnny, Stanley, and Andy
          leering into the laptop's camera. Like a nightmarish photo
          booth snapshot.

                         JOHNNY
          Nice shot huh?
          Jennifer shrieks and spins around only to find --
          Standing there, right inside the front door, is Johnny. He
          smiles.
          Johnny shrugs calmly and continues milling about the room.
          Jennifer spins around, looking for a way out.

          Then, the wooden stairs creak under Andy's steps as he walks
          down -- around his chest is one of Jennifer's bra stretched
          to the limit. He's twirling a thong panty on his finger. The
          guys get a good laugh at Andy.

          Johnny slaps the bat against his hand punctuating his point.
          Jennifer puts her fingers in her mouth. She pulls her lips
          away from the gums, spreading them grotesquely. It's
          completely humiliating. Jennifer stops.

          his thumb and forefinger.

          Nah, not like the peck you gave
          Matthew... let's see a real kiss.
          He slides the barrel into Jennifer's mouth. Jennifer gags
          instinctively. Johnny holds the back of her head, not
          allowing her to pull away, and offers some "encouragement."

          Breathe through your nose. Breathe
          through your nose like it was your

          Johnny pulls the gun out just a tiny bit and pushes it back
          into her cheek, causing it to bulge out.
          Naturally, Stanley and Andy both find this hysterical.

          Jennifer has no choice. She begins to fellate the gun, as
          deep as she can take it without gagging.
          Johnny closes his eyes and feigns pleasure. Finally, he's
          had enough. He retracts the gun as Jennifer recoils, gags.
          Her eyes begin to scan the cabin for any way out of this hell

          eye catches a large shard of glass next to Andy's boot.
          As soon as Andy turns around to smile at his friends,

          seconds, she's in the woods.

          Jennifer runs for all she's worth. Every few yards, she
          looks behind her, just to make sure that no one is chasing
          her. The morning light now fully visible. Then, just as she
          turns back around, Jennifer smacks right into something and
          goes sprawling.
          When her vision comes into focus she sees the side of a shiny
          black boot. Next to it, the long slim barrel of a shotgun.
          Jennifer looks up at the figure.

                         FIGURE
          Whoa, whoa, whoa there. Easy
          darlin'.
          The Figure extends his hand. As Jennifer reaches for it, she
          sees his jacket pull away from his chest, revealing a silver
          badge. She's found SHERIFF STORCH, a small town sheriff with
          a small town charm that can easily be confused as smarmy.

                         JENNIFER

          Standing next to the Sheriff, also holding a hunting rifle,
          is Earl. Earl looks over at the Sheriff.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Okay, okay, I gotcha.
          The Sheriff helps Jennifer to her feet.

          down.
          But Jennifer is hysterical, desperately holding back tears.

          tell me what happened.
          Jennifer forces herself to take a deep breath and manages to
          pull herself together.

          Sheriff Storch and Jennifer pull up to the cabin. They both
          get out of the cruiser. With his double barrel shotgun in
          hand, Sheriff Storch begins walking up toward the porch.

          Sheriff Storch and Jennifer enter the cabin. It appears

          Sheriff Storch disappears into the kitchen for a second...
          then back out as he makes his way over to the foot of the
          stairs. He looks up the staircase.

          Sheriff Storch heads up the stairs. Jennifer, uncomfortable
          at being left alone, backs away to the wall. Every noise,

          Storch holds up the roach. Jennifer notices the lipstick
          smear on the rolling paper. She casts her eyes downward.

          This ain't the big city.
          Sheriff Storch stands uncomfortably close. Slowly, he walks
          closer up to Jennifer's face, stares into her eyelids. Pulls
          down one of them. Then the other. Then his gaze falls down
          to her chest... her ample cleavage. His stare lingers a bit
          too long.

          Sheriff Storch brings the gun back up to her mouth - slides
          it under Jennifer's top lip and pushes it up.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Whinny.
          With her top lip forced up by the barrel of the shotgun,
          Jennifer can only make a GRUNTING noise. Sheriff Storch
          takes the shotgun out of Jennifer's mouth and places it flush
          against the side of her head. He pushes her to the floor.
          Jennifer lets out a YELP as she falls.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          I said, whinny.
          Jennifer makes a pathetic SOUND. Not really a whinny, but
          more of a half-cry, half-snort. Naturally, this amuses Andy
          and Stanley -- who is, of course, filming it -- to no end.

                         STANLEY
          Oh, man. Oh, man.

                         (TO JENNIFER)
          On your knees. And keep going.
          Jennifer gets to her knees. As instructed, she whinnies,
          interspersed with sobs. Johnny slaps her ass viciously.

                         JOHNNY
          Keep whinnying!
          Jennifer looks up at Sheriff Storch with pleading eyes.
          Sheriff Storch picks her up by her hair but--
          Jennifer comes up swinging -- connecting with the Sheriff's
          face. The slightest scratch across his lip.
          Sheriff Storch turns beet red. He backhands her across the
          face sending her back down to the floor. A thin line of
          blood flows from her nose. The Sheriff looks over to Johnny,
          licks his lip and nods his head.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Think you outta tame this little
          mare of yours.
          Johnny takes the Sheriff's lead.

                         JOHNNY
          Alright, come on, Show Horse. Get
          up. Or you won't get a sugar cube.
          Jennifer struggles to her feet. She stands in front of them,
          defenseless. Johnny grabs her hair and pulls her head far
          back. She lets out a half-moan.

          Take off your clothes. We're about
          to pop your cherry.
          Matthew shakes his head. His wrist is not beat red from the
          rubber bands. Snap!

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          I'm not asking, now cut that rubber
          band shit faggot.

                         STANLEY
          Come on, Matthew. You want to talk
          the talk, then walk the walk, you
          virgin.
          Johnny flicks open a pocket knife. He tickles Jennifer's
          bottom lip with the blade, then gently runs it down her chin,
          past her neck, and between her breasts, just before stopping
          at the waistband, then he slices the waistband of her pants -
          her pants drop to the floor.

                         JOHNNY

                         (TO MATTHEW)
          Do it now. Or else I slice her
          chin to cunt.
          This gets Matthew moving. A few seconds later, he's in his
          boxer shorts, with his hands crossed in front of his crotch.
          Johnny grabs him and throws him up against the wall. He then
          yanks his boxers down. Matthew immediately covers up his
          crotch.

                         STANLEY
          Matthew, what the hell? It's not
          even hard!
          Matthew sweats profusely.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Well, maybe it's not totally his
          fault. After all, she's not doing
          much to get his motor running.
          Sheriff Storch looks back to Jennifer.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Dance.
          Jennifer begins to cry again.

          Stop it. Or else I'll really give
          you something to cry about. Now
          dance for the boy...
          Jennifer starts to dance in the middle of the room. It is
          sad, pathetic, and downright frightening.

                         JOHNNY
          Come on. Move that rear of your's
          Show Horse. Prance for us.
          Sheriff Storch stalks around her, taking it all in, then he
          walks back in closer to her, in her face.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          You dance like that in those city
          clubs?
          Jennifer closes her eyes. Tears stream down her face.

                         STANLEY
          She dance like that they'd throw
          her butt to the curb.

                         JOHNNY
          Prance like you mean it. Like you
          do when you want to get laid.
          With a swift, hard backhand, Sheriff Storch smacks her ass
          and hard.

                         ANDY
          That'll get her moving.
          The guys hoot and holler. Except for Matthew, who looks as
          if he too is about to cry.

                         MATTHEW
          Ok..kkay, I'll d...do it.
          Matthew walks slowly over to Jennifer. With no warning,
          Matthew takes Jennifer's face in his hands and kisses her.
          The men HOWL with sadistic glee. Jennifer slaps him right
          across the face, then she tries to run but--
          Sheriff Storch forces her to the ground. He walks up to
          Matthew.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Don't waste my time you thickheaded
          prick.

          Johnny pushes Matthew down on top of her.
          Jennifer instinctively swings and connects with Matthew's
          face - He recoils in pain - but the guys cheer him on as they
          decide to help him out. Andy tears open her shirt, Johnny
          yanks down her panties. Jennifer claws and kicks at all of
          them as she desperately tries to fight him off.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Get her legs!
          Sheriff Storch kneels down and holds Jennifer's arms above
          her head. Johnny takes one leg; Andy takes the other.
          Matthew moves on top of her. Jennifer lets out an inhuman
          SCREAM, the vocal culmination of it all.
          ON JENNIFER'S FACE: Her eyes are tightly shut as she goes in
          and out of focus.
          Suddenly, a cell phone RINGS. Sheriff Storch looks down at
          his pocket, then over to Stanley.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Put that thing down and hold her
          arms, keep her quiet.
          Stanley places the CAM on top of the table - it's still
          getting everything.
          Sheriff Storch walks a few paces away from the rape. He
          looks down at the screen of his phone.
          On the PHONE is a photo of an angelic little girl with the
          banner of CHASTITY. Storch presses a button.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)

          Hi, Daddy. You at the station?
          Jennifer SCREAMS out. Sheriff Storch keeps his attention on
          the phone call.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (INTO PHONE)
          No, Angel. Out on a call.
          WIDESHOT: In the foreground, Sheriff Storch speaks casually
          to his daughter. In the background, Jennifer's legs are the
          only visual cues of the struggle that goes on right behind.

          It's okay. You need something?

          CHASTITY (V.0.)
          Daddy it's Sunday. You always make
          breakfast before church.

          Yeah, yeah... well, Daddy's busy,
          Angel. Tell mother I'm running a
          little late.
          Sheriff Storch stares at the phone for a second, then slides
          the phone back into his pocket. As he turns back around
          Jennifer, with all her strength, bucks Matthew off.
          The guys start laughing hysterically.
          She finally gets her hands free and lands a barrage of
          punches in Matthew's face.

                         JOHNNY
          Jesus, Matthew. You're getting
          your ass whooped by a girl!
          Matthew snaps: He wraps his hands around her neck and begins
          pumping away like a lunatic. For some reason, the anger
          allows him to perform.
          Jennifer struggles to breathe. Luckily, before all oxygen to
          her brain is cut off, Matthew stops. He SCREAMS as he
          finishes. His hands fall from her neck as he collapses on
          top of her.
          The MEN all cheer as Matthew staggers to his feet -- weak.
          He looks like he could throw up -- and he does - right off to
          the side as the others just lose it!
          Jennifer curls herself into a ball and SOBS.

          Matthew recovers, gets up and runs to the bathroom. Johnny
          points to the vomit.

          Just do it you piece of shit!
          Jennifer grabs the end of the coffee table and forces herself
          up. She steadies herself, keeping one hand on the wall, and
          stumbles to the back door. Surprisingly, none of the men
          attempt to stop her. They don't even look in her direction.
          Jennifer staggers out the back door, trying to catch her
          breath as she fearfully stumbles off into the woods.

          42 EXT. WOODS - DAY 42 

          Like a zombie, Jennifer shuffles through the woods, oblivious
          to the cold air, rocks, thorns, mud, as her bare feet move
          her along.
          She desperately continues on through, looking for a way out.
          But in her state, she has no sense of navigation. She
          continues to lose herself further and further into the
          forest.
          As she finally steps into the clearing, the melancholy notes
          of a harmonica shatter the stillness... She's made her way to-

          43 EXT. FISHING HOLE - DAY 43

          Andy sits on a log blowing softly into the harmonica as the
          rest of the guys lounge around casually as if they
          instinctively knew she'd end up here. Jennifer is too
          shocked to move, too tired to cry.
          Jennifer tries to escape but Johnny stops her. He grabs her
          by the shoulders and throws her to Andy who smacks her down
          in the shallow water. Andy pounces down on her back.
          Stanley kneels down right in front of Jennifer's face. He
          places the MiniDV cam only a few feet in front of her. He
          then turns the LCD so it's facing Jennifer -- so she can
          actually watch herself being abused.
          Andy pulls her eyelids wide open and holds them there.

          Sheriff Storch approaches Jennifer. Although she can't even 
          turn around, she senses their presence.
          Storch gets down into her face.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          I hope you got some fight left in

          Not to worry Darlin'. I'm an ass

          Sheriff Storch takes off his belt and unbuckles his pants.
          He kneels down behind her..
          Jennifer SHRIEKS as her face contorts with a completely new
          level of pain as her head is thrust back down.
          Then, out of the corner of her eye, Jennifer catches a
          glimpse of the Sheriff's GUN, still sitting in its holster.
          Her eyes immediately go to Stanley who's busy swapping out
          the MINI-DV tape and replacing it with a new one--
          Then she sees Matthew leaning against a tree, a vacant look
          in his eye twisting a rubber band through his fingers.
          Andy site on is ass, playing his harmonica... Her eyes
          continue to scan the area for Johnny who's nowhere in sight.
          Then immediately her eyes dart back to the GUN.

           Cruel laughter brings Jennifer back to. Somehow she manages
           to lift her head to see Stanley pulling up his pants.

          I clocked you at just over two
          minutes.
          Jennifer musters up her last ounce of strength and gets to
          her feet. The men all stare, impressed at her resolve.
          Jennifer's torn clothes hang loosely off her body as she
          staggers away and wanders aimlessly away from them. It's a

           Ahead of her a dirt road leads to a small bridge and an open

          Painfully she staggers towards the bridge, her beaten and

          Jennifer doesn't bother to turn around. She continues down
          the bridge, looking at the rushing water on both sides.
          She moves to one of the railings.
          The Sheriff looks at her and cocks the shotgun.

          Yeah, too bad we have to put you
          down, Show Horse.
          in a final act of defiance, Jennifer falls back off the
          bridge and into the murky, moving water.
          immediately, the men rush to the edge of the bridge.
          The Sheriff's gun cocked and ready-- Tracking down the water -
          Not a sign.
          They all look down, waiting, still nothing.

          then heads into the kitchen.

          Earl's bent over one of the tanks, elbow-deep in fetid water.

          Sheriff Storch reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of
          keys. He holds them in the air and JINGLES them. Earl
          finally looks up, confused.

          Hendersonville. It's serene, peaceful and lonely. 
          Matthew sits in a small boat. He's been patrolling for
          Jennifer's body, but now the boat just sits in the middle of
          the swamp where the river runs out.
          He stares out into the water as we slowly creep closer, and
          closer until we're extremely close on his face, his eyes
          unmoving.

          POV: A car with two women pulls up to the gas pump. Johnny
          comes out of the garage and saunters over to them.
          Johnny playfully harasses the women. To a casual observer,
          it would seem harmless. But we know it could be the prelude
          to something unspeakable.
          Finally, the women pull away. Johnny walks back into the
          garage, a smug, self-satisfied smile on his face.

          Andy is bent over Jennifer's car, or at least what's left of
          it. At this point, it's nothing more than a shell. He wears
          a welding helmet and is hard at work with a blowtorch.

          Johnny looks up as Stanley stumbles into the garage, holding
          a six pack of beer.

          Johnny cracks open the beer and takes a gulp. He wipes the
          back of his hand across his mouth.

          Andy holds up his beer in a mock toast.

          To your moma.
          Johnny points to Andy, his beer still in his hand.

          Heck, just let Matthew take all the

          off. Immediately, the room goes dark. But the second it
          does...

          Stanley is completely out of breath.

                         STANLEY
          It's gone. My camera. It's gone!
          Andy looks at him, visibly annoyed.

          Maybe you accidentally ate it?

                         STANLEY

          Storch smashed to bits. That tape?

          Johnny kicks him in the ribcage.

          You can't tell him Johnny. You

          Johnny ponders for a second.

          66 INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 66 

          Johnny reclines on his couch, watching TV. One hand is down
          his pants and the other holds a bottle of whisky.
          Suddenly, there's a CRASH at his front door. Johnny looks up
          and puts down the bottle, not overly concerned.

                         JOHNNY
          Hello?
          No answer at the door. Johnny groans and gets off the couch,
          annoyed at being disturbed. He walks over to the front door
          and yanks it open.
          The front porch is empty. Just as he's about to close the
          door, he glances down. There's a dead bird on the stoop.
          Johnny narrows his eyes and looks out into the night. Then
          he closes the door and returns to the couch.

          at the front door. Johnny, now pissed, races to the front
          door and swings it open.
          A second dead bird has joined the first. Without closing the
          door, Johnny backs up into his house.
          A few seconds later, he returns to the front door, pistol in
          hand. He steps out onto the porch.

          67 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 67

          Johnny holds the gun in front of him. He pivots slowly from
          side to side, scanning the entire property. No more birds.
          In fact, nothing at all. Dead silence.

          Shit ain't funny fuckers!!! See

          When there's still no response -- Johnny finally backs up
          into the house and closes the door.

          68 INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 68

          Again, back to the couch. And again, the second his ass hits
          the cushion, another CRASH.

                         JOHNNY
          Got dammit!
          This time, Johnny races to the door and yanks it open,
          cocking the gun on the way and fires into the night.

          69 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 69

          Johnny causally looks down - but this time it's not a bird.
          It's a shoe... Jennifer's shoe.
          Johnny bends down and picks it up. He studies it. Frowns.
          Someone's gone too far. Then he hears something scurry off
          in-the distance.

          Johnny spits and turns around to walk back and as he does, he
          notices one of Matthew's colored RUBBER BANDS lying in the
          mud.

          MINIDV tape and hands it to him.

          MRS. STORCH
          it came this morning...
          But as Storch looks over the tape, the color, the markings...
          no, it couldn't be, he smashed that tape.

          Storch wipes his face with his hand, then shoves the tape
          into his shirt pocket.

          I'll... I'll be back...
          Sheriff Storch quickly turns away from his wife and hurries
          out the door.
          Mrs. Storch stands at the door and watches with growing
          curiosity as the cruiser peels out of the driveway, a cloud
          of dust in its wake.

          Ah shit. This ain't good.
          Johnny picks the shoe up.
          Storch blasts out of his car, shotgun in hand. He cocks his
          shotgun and levels it directly at Stanley as he backs him up,
          planting the shotgun into his cheek.

          Hey, I just found out myself.
          Storch swings the gun back to Stanley.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Eat that tape fatboy.
          Andy starts to laugh as Starch trains the gun back on them-

                         STORCH
          Shut your pie hole. Think this is
          funny?! I'll have him shit it down
          your throat when's he done eating
          it. Got that boy?
          .LAM; The Sheriff fires a shot into the air. They all jump,
          Stanley covers his ears like it hurt.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          See, there's two kinds of crazy
          people. One likes to get buck
          naked and howl at the moon. The
          other kind does the exact same
          thing, only in my backyard. The
          first kind'I don't have to deal
          with, you know?
          The Sheriff walks right into Stanley's face as he continues
          to chew the plastic.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          The second kind, well... you're in
          my yard. 

                         JOHNNY
          It's Matthew, Sheriff. Stanley kept 
          the souvenir, but Matthew's the
          one that took it.
          The Sheriff backs off a beat, sizes up the situation.
          Johnny brings forth the shoe. Sheriff's eyes seethe with
          rage.

          Storch takes a deep breath. He looks at all of them, fuming.

                         ANDY
          We don't know. Isn't coming around
          much.

          Much? At all. Kid's fucked three

          and trust me, we been looking.

          He fixes them all with a steely gaze and loads the shotgun
          again.

          72 EXT. CABIN - DAY 72 

          Matthew, disheveled and weary, stumbles up the steps of the
          cabin. We get the feeling that this is almost a daily
          pilgrimage, as if he returns here to assuage his guilt.
          He rests his head on the wooden railing of the porch, for a
          moment it looks as if he's about to cry.

          VOICE (O.S.)

          Matthew's head snaps up. He's almost certain he imagined it,
          just like he's been imagining many things these days.

           But there is no one in sight. Matthew looks around from side
           to side, his eyes wide, filled with madness... . and then, he
           hears it again.

           VOICE (O.S.)
           Math...eeeeeee... . you...
           It's coming from upstairs - Matthew sprints up.

          74 INT. CABIN, UPSTAIRS - DAY 74

          Matthew, wild-eyed and panicked, gets to the top of the
          steps. He takes a heavy breath and then moves into the lone
          bedroom. seconds later he comes out, obviously empty.

                         MATTHEW

                         (SCREAMS)
          Where are you?!
          Barely a second later, he receives his answer.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Matthew...
          This time, it's definitely coming from downstairs. Matthew
          glances down the staircase. When he sees that nobody is
          waiting at the bottom, he heads down there.
          But once his foot touches the third step, the board gives out
          as Matthew crashes down the steps, ass-over-tea kettle.

          75 INT. CABIN - DAY 75

          MATTHEW'S POV: His vision is completely blurry. He
          struggles to get his bearings as he lays at the bottom of the
          stairs; the side of his head rests on the floor. A thin
          line of blood has already started to run down his cheek.
          Matthew's vision starts to come back into focus as a BLURRY
          IMAGE starts to move away from him. As the IMAGE gets
          further away - it comes into focus - JENNIFER
          We see her now, wounds healed, only the faintest hint of the 
          beating and trauma she went through.

                         (STAMMERS)
          I... I knew you were alive. I knew it.
          Jennifer turns to him now.

                         JENNIFER
          How do you know, Matthew?
          Matthew props himself up with his hands and manages to get
          into a sitting position.

                         MATTHEW
          Huh?

                         JENNIFER
          How do you know I'm alive? Are you
          sure you're'not dreaming again? 
          Matthew shakes his head quickly from side to side. He's not
          sure of anything any more.

                         MATTHEW
          I...am I dreaming?
          Jennifer pats the couch next to her.

                         JENNIFER
          Come here. Come sit down.
          Matthew staggers to his feet. He's overcome with emotion.

                         MATTHEW
          I... I... need to tell...
          Jennifer holds a single finger to her lips.

          Shh... it's all okay, Matthew. I
          know that none of this was your
          fault. You tried to help me.

                         MATTHEW
          I did... I really did.

                         JENNIFER
          I know that, Matthew. Now come.
          Matthew sits down next to Jennifer. It's almost as if some
          force is controlling him. Matthew looks into her eyes.
          He leans forwards and rests his head in Jennifer's lap. He 
          finally lets himself go, like a child having a meltdown.

                         MATTHEW

                         (SOBBING)

          (stroking his head)
          Shh...I know. I know you are.
          Matthew's so caught up in the moment, that he fails to notice
          A ROPE from the tool shed with a good SLIT KNOT being snaked
          around his neck.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          But tell me again, Matthew. I want
          to hear how sorry you are.
          Matthew's eyes fly open. Jennifer's hands jerk backwards.
          The rope digs into his flesh. He tries to speak but his
          windpipe can't produce any sound.
          Matthew rolls to the floor, Jennifer never loses her grasp.
          She stands over Matthew, twisting the rope as hard as she
          can. His eyes bulge, the veins in his face protrude--
          Realizing he's about to slip away forever, Matthew displays
          one last burst of strength but Jennifer uses her leverage to
          get her foot on his chest and pulls harder.
          Frightened and furious, Matthew whips Jennifer around again.
          But she refuses to let go.

          Finally, Matthew's body has had enough. He feet stop kicking
          and just twitch. Then he just gasps like a fish dying out of
          water.
          Jennifer bends over Matthew. She's only inches from his
          face. He's alive, but in terrible shape.

          CLOSE ON: Matthew's mouth. He can't actually speak; his
          voice box shattered. But he mouths the words.

          enough.
          She pulls the slip knot around his neck again and begins to

                         CHOKE HIM--

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Now I want you to cry like a little

          Matthew begins to wail.

          A75 EXT. CABIN, DAY A75

           Matthews screams echoes out through woods, but his, much like
           Jennifer, go unheard.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

           Silence. A full moon hangs low in the night sky, casting an

          But in her eyes --- her eyes still tell the whole story. This

           ANGLE ON: A BIBLE, the old moldy one from the dilapidated 
           shack. It rests on the windowsill - opened to a passage. 
          CZrO$E ON: Exodus 21:23-25: .And if any mischief follow,

          Andy and Stanley make their way to the falls. They carry

          Stanley shovels pork rinds into his mouth, and offers some to

          there... nothing.

          Matt.
          Andy picks up his pace as he nears the tree line - right
          where he saw the movement.
          Out of the corner of his eye, he sees another branch swinging
          unnaturally. He races over--
          CLOSER: He can actually hear breathing - it's getting louder-

          Stanley laughs so hard he starts to cough -- Just as they're
          about to continue on - the sound of a harmonica breaks
          through. The same eerie tune.

          Andy and Stanley run through the woods, trying to find the
          source of the sound.

                         ANDY
          You're ass is grass Matthew!! 
          Branches and leaves fly by as Andy barrels through the
          foliage. Stanley tries to keep up, but it's no use.

          They continue on - Stanley doesn't look too good.

          Don't you pass out on me. I ain't
          dragging your ass back.
          Suddenly, the tune stops. Andy stops in his tracks, trying
          to figure out which way to proceed. Suddenly, Stanley hears
          another sound. Crying.

                         STANLEY
          Hear that?
          They're off again. About fifty yards away, hidden behind the
          trees, is the SHACK. Something slips around the side of the
          structure. Stanley immediately spots what he thinks is
          Matthew.

                         STANLEY (CONT'D)

          Good, cause he's coming out in pieces.
          Andy races ahead leaving Stanley trying to catch his breath
          behind him.

          81 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 81

          Andy enters. The shack appears as we first saw it, only now
          there are remnants of recent life.

          Under the table is a pile of filthy old clothes. It almost
          looks like... a makeshift pillow.
          He picks up a moldy tin can which once contained some
          preserved meal. He tosses it to the ground.

          82 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 82 

          Stanley waddles out the back of the shack. He stops. About
          twenty yards away and sees JENNIFER leaning against a tree.

                         STANLEY
          Why you little bitch...
          Stanley races over - Just as Stanley gets close - SNAP!! A
          hidden BEAR TRAP clamps down on Stanley's leg - the pain is
          intense as he screams out - He staggers backwards and falls
          to the ground in agony

          Oh, God! Oh, my fucking God!

          writhing in pain.

                         STANLEY (CONT'D)
          Please! Andy! My fucking leg!
          Andy races over to assist him. As he offers Stanley his
          hand, he notices Stanley's eyes catching a glimpse of someone
          behind him. But as soon as he turns, the wooden BAT, the one
          from the fishing hole, catches him flush across the face!
          He's down and before Stanley knows it she cracks him in the
          back of the head.

          83 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 83

           Andy's eyes flicker open. He sees a hand wrapping a rusty 
           wire around the contact of an old car battery. Then he looks 
           up and sees a bare light bulb flicker on. 
          He's draped lengthwise over a horse trough so his torso is
          completely over the basin. His arms and legs are secured
          with ropes.

          Suddenly, the sound of RUSHING WATER from inside the trough.
          Andy looks down. A dirty hose hangs over the mouth of the
          trough. Brown water flows from it... Filling it.

                         ANDY

          His nose and face are busted - it hurts to scream.
          With the trough filling up quickly, Andy realizes it won't be
          long until the water is above his head.
          He cranes his neck upwards. After all, were he to stay face
          down, he would drown -- just like Jennifer would've.

          84 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE DAY 84

          STANLEY'S POV: It's Jennifer and in her hand is his video
          camera.

                         JENNIFER
          I know. You like to watch. Don't
          you. Don't you worry, I'll give 
          you quite a show.
          She sets the camera on top of a tri-pod right in front of his
          face, frames up and hits record. She looks up to him.
          Stanley's arms are tied behind a tree, his head is held in
          position, duct tapped back against the tree.
          His legs are anchored to the ground. The bloody mangled one
          still in the bear trap that bites and gnaws at his leg with
          every move.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Since you like to watch.
          She flips the monitor of the camera toward him just like he
          did to her.
          She stands in front of Stanley's face. Stanley wants to say
          something but his pain is too intense.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D) 
          Can't talk, can you? Well, maybe
          it's because you're hungry.
          Jennifer goes to grabs something behind her.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          You know, you have to eat some real

                         STANLEY
          Bbbb... bitch! Let me go!
          She grabs his nose and pulls open his mouth shoving a MAGGOT
          INFESTED RODENT into his mouth.

          What's wrong, you don't like it? I
          prefer the maggots to the meat.
          Jennifer site down next to Stanley. She glances over to the
          monitor to see what he is looking at. Then she reaches over
          and into a burlap sack.
          Stanley stares straight ahead, at the monitor in front of
          him.
          Jennifer reaches into the burlap bag and takes out a roll of
          fishing line. Then she takes out a pack of fish hooks.
          Stanley's eyes go wide.
          Jennifer removes the hooks from their package. She holds one
          between her thumb and forefinger and studies the barbed tip.
          Smiling to herself, she threads the hooks with fishing line.

                         STANLEY
          Wh...what are you doing with that?

          Oh... just some fishing. I know
          how much you guys like to fish.
          Finally, when she's finished, she scurries behind Stanley's
          head. From behind him, she grabs his eyelid and pulls it
          away from the eyeball itself.

                         STANLEY
          What are you.. Please don't...
          Then she pops the hook through the lid and pulls the fishing
          line back over his head.
          Stanley screams something fierce as she continues to thread
          his eyelid open, slowly, methodically, delivering as much
          pain with every pull of the line, from one eye to the next.
          His eyeballs bulge unnaturally, twitching wildly--
          All Stanley can do is stare ahead and watch himself on the
          monitor.

                         JENNIFER
          I'll be back before you have a

          That's an awfully big head you got.

          Every vein in his neck now bulges. Andy's eyes start to
          water with tears.

          Andy's neck gives out dunking his head in the lye bath. He

          Andy's body continues to writhe in pain. With yet another

          revealing a face burnt red, puffy, oozing puss, skin flaking
          off and his eyes are a ghastly, milky white, pussy, and

          No Sheriff, I ain't heard from 'em.
          Johnny notices something in his small surveillance TV.
          ANGLE ON TV: A truck pulls up to the station, a hot woman in
          a skimpy outfit gets out of the truck. She pops the hood
          obscuring her once she does.
          Johnny sits up in his seat.

          87 EXT. SERVICE STATION - MORNING 87

          A truck is parked at the pump. Its hood is up and a woman
          leans over the engine. Her ass is perfectly framed in a
          tight miniskirt, from which two, long flawless legs descend
          into a pair of blood-red high heels.
          Johnny walks over to her, wiping his hands on his bandana as
          the woman shimmies her hips, almost inviting him to approach
          her. And Johnny, being Johnny, doesn't need much.
          Johnny is close enough to touch her. He snickers a bit,
          never taking his eyes off her ass.

                         JOHNNY
          Can I fill it up for you, ma'am?
          The woman wears sunglasses and slowly turns to Johnny.
          Johnny takes a long look from bottom to top - and when he
          gets to her face - it registers - but before he can do
          anything, Jennifer swings a tire iron and catches him right
          across the jaw.
          A handful of teeth, ejected by a spurt of fresh blood as
          Johnny falls face-first into the ground.

          88 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 88

          Johnny is buck-naked. His hands are tied tightly together
          and pulled above his head, running through an eye hook that
          has been screwed into one of the shack's wooden beams. His
          eyes flicker.
          Jennifer walks up to him, right to his face.

          JENNIFER (O.S.)
          It's date night.
          Johnny cranes his neck and twists his body to see who's there
          as Jennifer walks out of the shadows. She saunters up to
          Johnny.

          Oooh, you're an ornery stallion,

          Bithh...
          With a bunch of teeth missing, Johnny's lisp is pronounced.
          Jennifer saunters around him seductively. She removes
          something from behind her back and brings forth a rusty pair
          of pliers.
          Jennifer steps closer.

                         JENNIFER
          Oh, that's the problem. You still
          have some teeth left. We're gonna
          have to fix that.
          Jennifer clamps the.pliers down tightly on Johnny's tooth.
          He tries to move but between the bridle cutting into his
          mouth and the pressure on the tooth, it's sheer agony.
          Jennifer jerks her hand from side to side, squeezing the
          tooth as hard as she can in the pliers. Finally, the root
          breaks free of the pulp and Johnny's tooth is extracted.
          Johnny flails around in severe agony.

          Save your strength. You got a few
          more races to run.
          Johnny screams something unholy. Jennifer holds the tooth up
          in the air and inspects it.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          I have to admit, I didn't think it
          went that far down.
          Jennifer sticks the pliers in again, latching it onto another
          tooth.

          The squad car screeches to a stop right in front of Sheriff

          Hearing the commotion, Mrs. Storch walks out onto the porch.
          She's almost knocked to the ground as her husband comes
          barreling up the steps.

          He turns and runs back to his squad car, gets inside, and
          pulls away even faster than he came.

          94 EXT. PARK - DAY 94

          The squad car skids to a stop on the grass of the park. It's
          a modest recreation area that has seen better days.
          Sheriff Storch jumps out of the car, still leaving it
          running, and sprints into the park.
          A few feet away, an empty swing blows gently in the breeze.
          The metal brackets screech loudly with every movement.
          Sheriff Storch spins around in circles, a maelstrom of
          confusion. He looks around frantically for anything that
          will give him a clue as to the whereabouts of his daughter.

          Sheriff Storch gets back inside. He immediately picks up the
          CB. But just as he opens his mouth to speak, lie glances in
          the rearview mirror. His eyes meet Jennifer's.
          Before he can turn, Jennifer pistol whips him in the temple.
          He falls forward, his head smacking into the steering wheel.
          The HONKING of the horn echoes throughout the empty park.

          96 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 96

          Sheriff Storch comes to. Blood trickles down from the side of
          his head.
          He's bent over the table, pants at his ankles. His SHOTGUN
          propped up behind him with the barrel inserted into his ass.
          With every move, a scorching pain courses through his body.

          Jennifer slams the gun deeper. The Sheriff's body goes stiff.
          The Sheriff screams again.

          Jennifer walks behind the Sheriff. She wraps her fingers
          around the barrel of the gun and shoves it in, deeper.
          The Sheriff's expression is one of unbridled agony. Jennifer
          continues to sodomize him with the shotgun.

          site tied up in a burlap sack. Jennifer removes it revealing
