    A strange ROARING sound...


    CLOSE ON A YOUNG WOMAN

    ...in darkness. Light begins to spill on her from the right
    - revealing her face, lost in thought. This is RACHEL
    SINGER - pretty, painfully young looking. A surgical
    dressing covers half her face.

    As we pull back a little we see that two YOUNG MEN sit
    either side of her. They are STEPHAN GOLD (thirties) thick-
    set, capable, and DAVID PERETZ (late twenties), dark-haired
    and pale-faced.

    The three faces in the darkness, each looking straight
    ahead - something from a Caravaggio painting.

    The roaring, which we realise is the sound of ENGINES,
    gradually runs down into silence.

    The light from the bay door which is opening off-screen
    begins to flood the scene with HARSH DAYLIGHT, revealing
    the inside of a CARGO PLANE.

    Stephan turns to look at the growing light. Then he turns
    to Rachel.

                         STEPHAN
              Breathe.

    He stands. Rachel turns to look at David but he is standing
    too, his face a mask.
    Rachel gathers herself, then stands and turns to follow the
    other two, walking towards the light.

    As the three approach the opening and descend the ramp of
    the bay door, we hear a woman's voice:

    against the sunlight, takes out a pair of sunglasses and
    slips them on.

    Rachel's daughter - SARAH - stands at a podium, reading the
    Dedication to a rather large audience who have come for the
    launch of her first book.

    She's 31, and clearly her mother's daughter.

    The cover image from the book is projected on a screen
    behind Sarah - a black and white photograph of a young
    Rachel, David and Stephan. Above their faces, the title -
    In Our Hands.

    People around Rachel begin to applaud, the sound almost
    startling her. Automatically she gives the same bob of the
    head, acknowledging the applause.

    Sarah, cheeks burning with a mixture of embarrassment and
    emotion, hasn't finished yet. She locks eyes with her
    mother.

    She emerges onto the empty patio, slides the glass door
    shut behind her, muffling the chatter from the room beyond.
    She lights a cigarette, inhales greedily, trying to calm
    down. She stares at the sun blazing over the Mediterranean
    ahead of her. Her glasses darken against the reflected
    glare.

    As if sensing something she turns to see a SMALL BOY - her
    GRANDSON - watching her from behind the glass of the patio
    door, something UNNERVING in his direct gaze.

    Rachel stares back at him in silence.

    Sarah appears behind the boy, her son, and scoops him up
    into a hug. Still the boy stares at his grandmother, who
    gives a tight smile and turns back to the sea.

    Another guest walks up to Sarah and she nods, smiling, at
    what he is saying to her but her eyes slide back to her
    mother, standing on the other side of the glass.

    A shabby, dimly-lit stairwell in a run-down section of the
    city.

    A YOUNG MOSSAD AGENT knocks at one of the apartment doors.
    After a moment it is answered by OLDER DAVID, now 62.

              Would you come with me sir?

    David stares at him, then walks back into the apartment.
    The door almost swings shut and the Agent catches it,
    considering walking in after him. But before he can, David
    re-emerges carrying his jacket.

    is piled around the columns supporting the building.

    Still on David as the two men walk out from the darkness
    into the street that services the run-down estate. David
    follows as the agent moves ahead towards a larger road.

     They cross a busy carriageway, and wait for a moment on the
     central reservation for a break in the traffic.

     Parked on the far side of the road, two identical cars,
     their windows tinted.

     The Agent moves to the leading car, opens the driver's door
     and gets in. David stops in the road, opens the rear
     passenger door and throws his jacket inside.

     He pauses for a moment and turns to look back at the second
     car.

     He stands like that for a moment and then suddenly STEPS
     OUT INTO THE ROAD in front of an on-coming TRUCK. The
     impact sweeps him out of the frame.

     The shocked Agent scrambles out of the vehicle as other
     cars screech to a halt in front of David's lifeless body.

has no idea what that means.

Miriam laughs obligingly but Sarah instantly regrets the
remark.

There is a sudden excited MURMUR from the table. The women
look over to where Stephan approaches the table. He is in a

in the background.

Rachel takes a sip of water and notices Stephen's hands,
crumbling some bread - they're SHAKING.

She looks up at his face, reads the hidden STRAIN there.

He senses her gaze and meets it, and for a second his smile
falters and SOMETHING LIKE PANIC flickers in his eyes.

      radiator, is DIETER VOGEL, now 50. He's bound, his mouth
      taped, apparently asleep.

      Rachel doesn't, of course, react to this sight. Instead
      she begins to clear away some pieces of BROKEN GLASS BOWL
      from the floor. We TRACK with her as she walks back down
      the short hallway into the kitchen, drops the pieces of
      bowl into the bin. From the living room comes the three
      distinct PINGS of rainwater dripping in the pots.

 She stops suddenly, puzzled. It's a moment before she works
 out what she's noticed - something has changed in the sound
 of the rainwater next door.

 There are only two drips instead of three.

 She walks back towards the living room...

 RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see
 that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a
 stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn
 but...it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's
 been standing in so that he is directly in front of her.
 Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open
 with a SHARD OF GLASS.

 Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel
 grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to
 worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her
 throat with the glass.
 Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to
 grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her
 and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops
 the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the
 fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face.

 Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden
 pain of the blow.

 Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by
 blood from her wound washing into her eyes.

 As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a
 small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her
 face. She falls.
 Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and
 desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at
 him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards
 the front door.

 Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down
 on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps
 free and kicks her hard in the head.

 Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a
 rest, losing consciousness.

 RACHEL'S P.O.V - LOW ANGLE - Fluttering in and out of
 darkness - Vogel's feet as he stands beside us, breathing
 hard. Then he turns and hurries to the front door...and
 out.

      Nobody   moves. The air of bonhomie has been replaced by an
      uneasy   silence. Not knowing what else to do, one of the

      David sighs, blows on the steel strip and holds it up for
      Stephan to examine.

      We hear the bathroom door open and there is a quick glimpse
      of Rachel wrapped in a towel as she slips past the door
      heading for her room. The two men watch her pass. Stephan
      turns and catches David's expression.

      Rachel sits on her bed drying her hair. She stops,
      listening to the indistinct murmur of the men's voices from
      the room next door. Rachel leans towards the wall, trying
      to hear more but the voices fall silent.

      back.

 There's an element of showing off and Stephan uses a
 little more force than is necessary. David winces but
 doesn't say anything.

 Stephan turns to Rachel who has been watching.

                        STEPHAN
           Yes?

 Rachel nods and they change places. David picks up the
 knife and repeats the "attack" move on her. She disarms him
 easily.

           Now an attack from behind.

 David takes his position, grabbing Rachel from behind, but
 he's so awkward with her the attack seems a little
 tentative.

 Stephan talks as Rachel practises breaking free from the
 hold.

                So, first time in the field.
      Rachel feels herself blush a little angrily. Stephan grabs
      her from behind and Rachel executes a perfect break,
      twisting Stephen's arm. Stephan winces, surprised.

      A tram trundles down the wide Berlin street.

      Rachel and David are walking to Vogel's surgery, holding
      hands. She's pale, very frightened. David walks, trying,
      and failing, to think of anything to say to her.

      He suddenly notices an odd sound. It's Rachel, humming
      tunelessly to herself, very low. Something about this
      pierces him. He gives her hand a squeeze.

      to the frosted glass door to the doctor's surgery.
      Indistinct shadows move on the other side.

      She turns to look at the other two women sitting looking
      through magazines, then back to the door. A shadow darkens

      leans out.

      Rachel stands behind a SCREEN, trying to control her
      nerves. All we can hear is the sound of RUNNING WATER and
      Rachel's tense breathing. Finally she takes off her skirt
      and unbuttons her blouse with trembling fingers. She puts
      on the gown, and slips out of her underpants, stumbling as
      she steps out of them.

      We TRACK with her as she walks out from behind the screen
      into the large brightly lit room. She walks towards the
      GYNAECOLOGICAL CHAIR at the centre of the room. On the far
      wall, behind a screen, someone stands washing their hands
      at a basin.

      As she walks, Rachel passes a tray of MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS,
      her glance lingering on it.

      She reaches the chair and climbs onto it. A pause and then,
      tentatively, she lifts her feet into the stirrups, tugging
      the gown to cover herself as best she can.

      She tries to steady her breathing, focussing on the
      ceiling. A bright LIGHT shines down on her.

      We hear footsteps approach.

      Rachel closes her eyes.

      taking a speculum from the tray of instruments, his back to
      us.

           Alright, this is my hand... and
           this is the speculum. It's going

 opens it and begins the examination. She stares up into the
 light.

 fiddle with it.

           Really?
 The angle from which we next see VOGEL, and the way the
 image of his face freezes in black and white, tells us
 clearly that this locket conceals a CAMERA DEVICE.

      He looks up at her and Rachel instinctively moves her hand
      away from the locket. She finds herself nodding.

      Vogel looks away again. Rachel bites down on a wave of
      panic.

      drop. Stephan dips down to pick them up and hands them back

       Stephan and David are walking towards it.

       Stephan stops by the van, shielding David as he drops the
       length of thin steel we saw him working on earlier, from
       his sleeve - an improvised SLIM JIM. With professional ease
       he slips the Jim between the window and the weather shield.

       Rachel comes out of the bathroom in her nightclothes, with
       her hair wet around her. She looks into the kitchen. David
       is sitting smoking. Rachel pauses in the doorway and then
       walks in. A small two bar electric fire provides the only
       light in the room. Rachel kneels down in front of it to dry
       her hair.
       David looks at her as Rachel spreads her hair around her
       shoulders. She looks very beautiful. She starts to comb her
       hair. On impulse, Rachel HOLDS OUT the comb to David.

       David takes it. He starts to comb, pulling it slowly
       through her hair. Then stops. The atmosphere is suddenly
       charged.

      Rachel turns round and stares at him, overcome with
      longing. She leans in to KISS HIM. For a moment David
      hesitates, but then it's as if something inside him closes
      and he pulls back from Rachel, his face cold.

      Without a word he gets up and walks out. Rachel sits,

      doorway, holding a drink - something slightly predatory
      about him.

      Stephan watches her. He continues to play, moving the
      melody up in octaves until his hand is beside hers, then
      covering hers. Rachel brushes him away. He puts his hand
      back and starts to caress her wrist.

 Vogel looks up in shock.

 Rachel grabs a fistful of his hair and pulls his head to
 one side. With her other hand she jams the needle into the
 side of his neck, and begins to depress the syringe.

 Vogel gives a grunt of surprise, opens his mouth to speak
 but no sound comes. He grabs vaguely for Rachel's throat
 with one hand, struggles with the needle with his other,
 eyes dull with fury, fighting the drug racing through him.

 Rachel fights to hold him, bucking on the chair, pinned
 beneath his weight, struggling for breath...

 drops to the floor...

       The two men open the van doors and run at a crouch to the
       base of the foot-bridge stanchion, as the train roars from
       the darkness and begins to pass them, screening the two men
       from the GUARDS ON THE PLATFORM.

       Rachel closes the rear door behind them and runs along the
       line of the fence to the other end of the yard and crouches
       down by a junction box, screened from the platform,
       standing watch.

       Rachel suddenly hears FOOTSTEPS echoing in the car park.

       Through the window of a van, she can see a POSTAL WORKER
       emerging from the depot and crossing the car park.

       As she watches he takes out a cigarette, starts to light it

        On the road ahead a Border Guard Jeep appears, driving
        directly towards them.

        Stephan has no choice - he floors it.

        At the last second the jeep tries to pull right but the van
        catches its rear side and barrels straight through, the
        jeep spinning off and smashing into the wall.

       ...three POTS have been placed under drips from the ceiling

       water drops.

       Rachel stares dully at the water dripping, feeling
       exhausted and numb.
       A key scrapes and Rachel turns to the door as Stephan and
       David walk in, hair soaked from the rain.

                 Maybe the Americans. Two weeks...
                 maybe three.

       Rachel reacts with dismay. Rachel moves after David towards
       the living room. The camera continues after her.

                 We work four shifts guarding him.

       The three turn to stare at something off-screen.

       The camera continues into the room to find Vogel's body
       slumped on the floor, bound to the radiator, mouth taped,
       slumped, unconscious.

       Rachel sits in the armchair near the end of her shift,
       watching Vogel who is slumped asleep. He looks dishevelled,
       the oatmeal he refused to eat smeared down his chin. She
       can't delay the moment anymore.

       She takes a bowl of prepared oatmeal from the table beside
       her and walks towards Vogel, stirring the bowl with an
       unsteady hand.

       She kneels down in front of him.

       In the silence, we hear rain falling heavily outside.

       Vogel wakes, stays slumped, staring at her with dull eyes.
       She takes the napkin that was covering the bowl and wipes
       the food from his chin. Finally she removes the tape from
       his mouth. Vogel watches her without moving. She offers him
       a spoon of oatmeal, waiting for the sudden yelling and
       abuse. He says nothing, just opens his mouth obediently.

       Rachel feeds him a spoonful of oatmeal. He speaks to Rachel
       in German, subtitled.

       closes his eyes, a look of such genuine suffering it stops
       Rachel.

       Rachel puts the tape over his mouth and stands. David walks
       in and takes his place in the ARMCHAIR facing Vogel.

       Rachel begins to leave. She looks back at Vogel who is
       staring after her, eyes pleading. She hesitates then gives
       a small nod and turns to walk out of the room, passing
       Stephan who has been standing in the doorway, watching her.

       Rachel picks up a bowl of shaving cream, strips the tape
       off VOGEL's mouth, and begins to brush the cream over his
       face. She produces a RAZOR and carefully begins to shave
       his cheeks.

       She stops suddenly, a TEAR is running down Vogel's cheek,
       cutting a line through the soap. He turns his eyes to her.

       Vogel slumps back against the wall, the tension in his body
       easing away. He gives her a long, calculating look.

       And as we watch some CHANGE seems to come over him, some
       new fire beginning to kindle in him - a sense of cold
       contempt for Rachel and with it, perhaps, a fresh

       Rachel uncovers the dish of prepared oatmeal and kneels
       down beside a sleeping Vogel.

       She removes the tape. Vogel wakes, breathes out, watches
       her. After a moment...

                 One of the great regrets of my

                 have children. My wife would have
                 made a wonderful mother.

       Rachel shovels in another mouthful. He chews it
       thoughtfully, examines her face.

                 Yes. I understand you perfectly.

       show any emotion.

                 I'm very sorry for your loss.
       It almost takes her breath away. She tears the tape and
       puts it over his mouth, gets up and walks away, determined
       not to show him any emotion.

       Vogel watches her go.

 Her face contorts as she tries to compose herself. David
 reaches out to hold her.

           It's alright. It's alright. It's

 He pulls her close, holds her, rests his forehead against
 hers. They stand like that, eyes closed. The moment hangs.

 She looks up at him. He stares into her eyes. Beat. Then,
 suddenly he kisses her. It's what she's waited so long for
 and she's stunned for a moment, then puts her arms around
 his neck, returning the kiss hungrily. They are helpless
 with desire for one another.
 There is a sudden scratch of a key at the front door and,
 instinctively, the two break apart.

 Stephan enters, hair wet from the rain. He stops, seeing
 them, sensing the atmosphere. They stare back at him.
 Rachel steps away a little, wiping her face.

 three FREEZE, staring at each other. Silence.

 at each other, the tension building. Abruptly Rachel turns
 and walks down the hallway towards the door. Stephan calls
 after her.

 From the hallway we hear the sound of the door being opened

 hard through his nose.

       Then she slumps against the door, her back to them. She's
       crying brokenly.

       A beat as the two men stand over her, not attempting to
       comfort her any further.

       Stephan turns and walks away.

       David leans his head against the door, waiting for her to
       stop.

       It's raining heavily outside and water is dripping through
       the cracks in the ceiling.

       David kneels next to VOGEL with a bowl of oatmeal and
       strips the tape from his mouth.

                 Thank you. David.

       David doesn't react.
       Vogel hums a tune to himself in between spoonfuls, watching
       David, his mood strange.

 David stirs the oatmeal, trying to think about what he's
 just discovered. Vogel doesn't take his eyes off him...

 triumph.

           This isn't medicine. This is
           disease. This is sickness.

 Vogel seems to consider this.

 He forces himself to be silent, tries to regain control of
 himself. He offers Vogel another spoonful, but his hand
 trembles a little with the violence of his emotions.

                     VOGEL
           You're trembling.

 David pushes the spoon into Vogel's mouth, starts to load
 another spoonful.

                     VOGEL (CONT'D)
           Yes. Do you know why it was easy
           to exterminate you people?
           Your weakness. I saw it. Every
           day I saw it. Every one of them,
           thinking only of how to avoid
           being flogged, or kicked, or
           killed. Only thinking of
           themselves.

 David looks up at him with a strange, crooked smile, eyes
 glittering.

                     VOGEL (CONT'D)
           Why do you think it only took
           four soldiers to lead a thousand
           people to the gas chambers?
           Entire families? Because not one,
           out of thousands, had the courage
           to resist, the courage to be the
           first to fall. Not one would
           sacrifice himself. Even when we
           took their children from them. I
           knew then that you people had no
           right to live, no right to...

 He may have begun his speech hoping to get a reaction from
 David but he has lost himself in his rant and so rather
 than triumph we see only a moment of startled fear in his
 eyes as David suddenly swings the bowl violently at his
 head, SHATTERING IT on the pipe to which he is tied.

 He grabs Vogel by the collar and begins to punch him, hard,
 again and again.

 Vogel slides sideways, limp. And still David punches him in
 a murderous rage, possessed, wanting to break his skull
 open, to kill him.

 Rachel and Stephan run in, with Rachel reaching him first.
 She throws her arms around him, trying to stop him, but -
 instinctively - he throws a punch behind him. It connects,
 splitting her lip and sending her flying to the ground.

 Stephan runs at him, knocking him to the floor, and remains
 lying on him, the two of them breathing hard, the assault
 finally over.

 VOGEL slumps forward, held up only by the rope at his
 wrists binding him to the pipe on the wall.

 Stephan is still struggling with David, who's panting,
 adrenalised, staring wildly at Vogel's slumped body.

       She tears off a new strip of tape and places it over
       VOGEL's mouth, gently.

       She notices the rain leaking in through the ceiling and
       walks off towards the kitchen. We hold on Vogel, apparently
       sleeping. Then his tied hand reaches out, straining and
       manages to reach one of the SHARDS of broken bowl.

       We TRACK with her as she walks into the living room and
       begins to place the pots on the floor to catch the

 ...as she finishes with the pots and notices the pieces of
 shattered bowl scattered around Vogel. She kneels down in
 front of him and collects up the pieces. She glances up at
 Vogel, checking him. He is still slumped, eyes closed.

 We TRACK with her as she walks back into the kitchen. From
 the living room comes the three distinct PINGS of rainwater
 dripping in the pots.

 She drops the pieces of bowl into the bin and stops,
 puzzled. It's a moment before she works out what she's
 noticed - something has changed in the sound of the
 rainwater next door. There only two drips instead of three.

 She walks back towards the living room...

 RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see
 that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a
 stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn
 but...it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's
 been standing in so that he is directly in front of her.
 Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open
 with a SHARD OF GLASS.

 Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel
 grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to
 worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her
 throat with the glass.

 Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to
 grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her
 and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops
 the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the
 fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face.
 Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden
 pain of the blow.

 Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by
 blood from her wound washing into her eyes.

 As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a
 small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her
 face. She falls.

 Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and
 desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at
 him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards
 the front door.

 Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down
 on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps
 free and kicks her hard in the head.

       There is a lurid flash of fireworks from nearby and for a
       moment we see Vogel lit, as he passes the point where
       earlier we saw him drop to the ground.

 Rachel turns to David, waiting, expecting him to say
 something. But David looks like he's been barely listening,
 lost in his own thoughts. He notices Rachel staring at him.

       A DOORBELL rings downstairs. He walks out to answer it,

       Rachel finishes her glass, starts to apply some eye makeup.
       She senses something and turns to find YOUNG SARAH (four)
       watching her from the doorway. She stares back at her
       dully.

       A cocktail party in progress - Stephan is mingling with the
       guests - Mossad high-fliers, Military, politicians. She             *
       watches him handle them - just the right mix of deference
       and charm.
       Rachel stands against a wall, drunk, watching him as he
       laughs sycophantically at something one of the politicians
       has said.

       He crosses over to an attractive BLONDE WOMAN and greets
       her. As Rachel watches he runs a hand down the woman's back
       - an unmistakably INTIMATE gesture.

       Rachel watches - depressed by how little this makes her
       feel. She begins to mix herself another drink, sees someone
       across the room, and her face changes...

       We're looking through the glass doors to the shadowy
       mezzanine level beyond. A DARK FIGURE stands silhouetted at
       the door. We hear the scrape of tools working on the lock.
       There is a click, the doors open and Rachel slips inside.

       The alarm begins to BEEP. Rachel takes out a TORCH. A quick
       twist and the beam becomes ULTRAVIOLET.

       As Rachel moves swiftly towards the alarm box, the beam
       from the torch sweeps across the girl's desk, and we see
       Rachel's envelope glowing a deep PURPLE. We may also notice
       that the desktop drawer unit where the girl placed the
       money is smudged with purple FINGERPRINTS.

       Rachel opens the alarm box and shines her beam onto the
       keypad. We see four PURPLE FINGERPRINTS, one deeply
       pigmented, the other three progressively less so.

       Rachel takes a deep breath and punches the four marked keys
       in what she hopes is the correct order. The alarm falls
       silent.

       She moves quickly out of the lobby, down the corridor...

       Using her torch on its regular setting, Rachel scours the
       desks for information.

       On one desk is a photograph of the journalist we just met -
       YURI - HOLDING A LARGE FISH in triumph. Rachel dives into
       the desk's FILING UNIT and begins to rifle through the
       files.

       Presently, she finds an OLD PICTURE OF VOGEL. He wears SS
       uniform, the same shot we have seen before.

       Behind it, a stack of SCRIBBLED NOTES. She begins to scan
       them.

       to the newspaper office, trying to open them. It takes them
       a moment, as - unaware that it was unlocked - the girl has
       accidentally locked it. Her boyfriend tussles with her
       playfully, keen for her to let him try instead, but she
       swats him away, turns the key again and finally they're in.

       The receptionist stands by the alarm box, drunk and
       confused, as the Boyfriend, impatient and equally drunk,
       comes up close behind her and reaches round to clumsily
       unbutton her coat.

       Boyfriend stagger into sight.

       Rachel stands frozen, COMPLETELY VISIBLE.

       The girl and boyfriend stand kissing, too engrossed in each
       other to see the woman standing only ten feet from them.

       The Receptionist pulls free, laughing, makes it back to the
       entrance and switches the lights off, plunging the room
       into darkness.

       Rachel moves behind a column.

       Laughing softly, the Boyfriend leads the girl over to a

       produces a PETTY CASH TIN.

 ...as we realise he is staring STRAIGHT THROUGH the torch,
 lost in the moment.

 Next moment the couple change positions and some books and
 the torch are swept from the desk and clatter to the floor.
 The TORCH ROLLS across the carpet to the shadowy entrance
 of the cubicle.

 Rachel stares at the torch, wondering if she can reach it
 before they can see her. But at the moment the desktop
 tryst reaches its noisy conclusion.

 The Boyfriend does up his trousers and pulls on his coat.

 The Receptionist adjusts her dress. She notices the fallen
 items and begins to pick them up, following the trail to
 the torch.

 Rachel stands frozen as the Receptionist stoops down
 directly IN FRONT OF HER and picks up the torch.

        Rachel's eyes alight on A MOTION SENSOR, blinking in the
        corner of the room.

        She waits. And eventually - no choice - she runs for the
        door.

       of times and has a carefully rehearsed answer to.

                 I'll tell you something. At that
                 moment, when I was on the floor,
                 I wasn't thinking about myself at
                 all. I was thinking about my
                 mother. And what she had suffered
                 in Europe. I think that was what
                 gave me the strength to get up
                 again.

        The LAUNDRY VAN is driving through the doors. It stops,
        engine idling, and the DRIVER begins to climb down to close
        the doors after him.

        Before he clears the side of the truck, Rachel slips into
        the darkness.

        The DRIVER, oblivious, reaches the doors and begins to
        swing them shut...

        stretching away from her in different directions, like a
        nightmarish maze.

        She stares about her, picks a corridor and begins to run

        trying to locate the room she needs.

        She hurries on to an ancient looking ELEVATOR and gets in,

        Rachel sits in a CUBICLE. She takes the BLACK CASE from her
        handbag and opens it. Inside is a pen. She lifts this and
        the false bottom of the case away to reveal a HYPODERMIC
        NEEDLE and an AMPULE of a clear liquid. With trembling
        hands she begins to prepare the injection.

        She can't quite believe what she is about to do.

        Rachel enters the room. The curtains are drawn and Rachel
        hesitates for a moment, her eyes adjusting to the gloom.
        A MAN sits in a chair, angled towards the window, his back
        to us. An IV drip hangs on a stand, its tube running into a
        cannula on the back of a withered hand which hangs from the
        chair.

        The only sound is the faint, rasping breath of the man.

        Rachel moves a little closer. On the bottom of the bed
        hangs a medical chart. The name reads Ivan Schevchuk.

        Rachel moves closer, carefully taking the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE
        from her pocket.

        Rachel stands by the IV drip and tube. She can inject
        directly into the tube - and it will be over. She holds the
        tube, rests the tip of the needle against it. She struggles
        with herself. Just one tiny push...

        She can't do it.

        She stands frozen for a moment then slowly lowers the
        needle.

        Beside her, the steady breathing alters. The Man stirs and
        a cadaverous face half turns towards us.

        She FLASHES through DOUBLE DOORS into a junction area - a
        long, empty corridor leading away from her on the right,
        ahead another set of double doors...

        She bursts through these doors and finds herself in...

241     INT. LOCKER ROOM/BATHROOM - DAY                              241

        A long, white tiled corridor of a room. A row of windows
        down the right, under which sit WASHBASINS. There's a row
        of LOCKERS and DOORS along the left.

        Rachel walks on, feeling increasingly as if she's in a
        dream.

        She's deep into the room before she realises it's a dead-
        end - there's no exit ahead of her.

                            VOGEL
                      (a dull rasp)
                  Why did you come...?

        She turns and freezes.

        Vogel has emerged from one of the doorways on the left. Now
        he's between her and the doors on the far side of the room.

                      VOGEL (CONT'D)
            Why did you have to come? You
            didn't have to follow me.

  He begins to advance slowly towards her.

                      VOGEL (CONT'D)
            Was it Schevchuk? Did he talk?

  Rachel stands frozen as he creeps closer. He reaches out a
  hand as if to reassure her, a ghastly attempt at
  reasonableness.

                      VOGEL
            I can stop him. I won't tell him
            anymore. (Almost pleading) Nobody
            needs to know.

  As if the spell has broken Rachel makes a sudden dart for
  the doors. But before she can pass him, Vogel has moved
  with surprising speed and, almost before Rachel has seen
  the SCISSORS in his other hand, he has stabbed them into
  her shoulder.

  She reels over against the opposite wall, dislodging a
  GLASS SHELF which shatters into a WASHBASIN behind her.

  Vogel goes after her, pinning her against the basin, one
  hand on her throat, the other hand trying to stab her
  again. Rachel manages to grab the scissor hand and the two
  struggle frantically.

  The scissors inch closer to her FACE, to her EYE.

  Her other hand emerges from the basin behind her holding a
  piece of the broken glass shelf, which she whips across
  Vogel's face.

  He gives a horrible shriek and lets her go, clutching at
  his cheek.

  Rachel collapses gasping to the floor.

  Moaning, Vogel stumbles to a basin, blood dripping down
  onto the white porcelain from his slashed face.

  He suddenly notices Rachel has made it to her knees and is
  trying to crawl towards the door,

  He walks after her, pulls back her head, gets ready to stab
  the scissors into her throat.

                      VOGEL
            You Jews never knew how to kill.
            Only how to die.

        Then he gives a gasp of pain, eyes closed, his whole body
        doubling with the pain, hands weakly scrabbling at the
        PIECE OF GLASS Rachel has stabbed into his thigh.

        He falls, almost on top of Rachel, and she finds herself
        pressed against his contorted face as he hisses and spits
        in agony.

        His hand searches blindly for the dropped scissors.

        Rachel grapples with him, almost embracing him, apparently
        trying to prevent him for reaching it.

        His searching hand locates the scissors and his eyes open
        in triumph, staring straight into Rachel's. He raises the
        scissors above his head.

        Then he stabs Rachel in the stomach.

        Rachel jack-knifes, as if she's been punched.
        Then...nothing. Both lie still. The only sound is Vogel's
        rasping breathing.

        Slowly Vogel gathers himself, drops the scissors, gets onto
        his knees - the victor.

        He climbs to his feet and begins to limp towards the door.

        PULLING VOGEL

        ...as he walks down the corridor, breathing hard, trying to
        make it back to his room, back to safety.

        Suddenly he staggers against the wall.

        Something's wrong, something in his back. He twists around
        trying to locate the source of the strange sensation. And
        there it is - the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE Rachel has stuck
        between his shoulders.

        He touches it with his fingertips, eyes wide with horror,
        feeling the rush of lethal chemicals through his blood. He
        twists again trying to pull the needle free but his legs
        are already giving way and he collapses to the floor.

        Moments later he's dead.

        As the music continues we see Yuri putting his coat on.
        He's evidently finished his fruitless interview with
        Schevchuk, who is sitting slumped by the window. Yuri
        turns, about to leave, when he suddenly notices a NOTE upon
        the desk, ADDRESSED TO HIM.

        Surprised, he picks up the note and begins to read it.

        We see the first line - "My name is Rachel Singer."

        The road at the back of the hospital.

        The music continues as we TRACK with Rachel, staring
        steadily ahead, walking slowly down the long road, her coat
        pulled around her.

        In the distance, framed between the arches, her abandoned
        car.

        Blood begins to spot the ground behind her.

        We are in darkness. Then a DOOR opens ahead of us and
        slides to one side revealing an oval of brilliant white
        light.

        Slowly we TRACK FORWARD towards the harsh light.
