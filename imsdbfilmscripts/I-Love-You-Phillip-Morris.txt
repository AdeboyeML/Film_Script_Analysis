2   INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY    2

    Startled, STEVEN RUSSELL (40) opens his eyes. Gaunt and
    pale, he seems to be on death's door. The whine we once
    heard is now the high-pitched ALARM of medical equipment.

    The door BURSTS open. NURSES enter, rushing toward him.

    The nurses pass him and attend to the PATIENT in the next
    bed over, frantically administering CPR.

              Where's the crash cart!?

    He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard-
    the sound of a sternum CRACKING can be heard.

    Steven returns his gaze to the ceiling. A CHEERY VOICE
    counterpoints the bleakness of this scene.

3   EXT. MARSHLAND - CHESAPEAKE BAY, VA - 1966 - DAY              3

    A group of FOUR NINE YEAR OLDS lie in the grass atop a
    hill. They stare up at the clouds, playfully arguing.

    Young Steven sits in the middle of the couch. His PARENTS
    and 11 year old BROTHER stand before him. He stares at
    them- innocent and doe-eyed with a big smile on his face.

                           STEVEN'S MOM
              Are you a happy little boy Steven?

              You've always been such a happy little

              thing.

          Shut up!

He glares at his brother, then turns back to his mother.
Her face says it all.

                       STEVEN'S MOM
          It's true.

WHACK! She SWATS his brother in the head. Steven starts
putting things together.

                        STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D)
          Your brother overheard your Dad and I
          talking and well, we didn't want you to
          hear it from anybody but us.
                 (then)
          It's true. You're a special little boy.
          You know why? Because we chose you. Not
          like your brother here who's natural.

                       STEVEN'S DAD
          Your Mother's right. It's cause we love
          you. So we put some money in a brown
          paper bag and gave it to your real mom in
          the hospital parking lot so you could
          come home with us. Okay?

                       STEVEN'S MOM
          It doesn't change a thing honey. We love
          you just as much as we love your brother
          here...
                 (best of intentions)
          ...and he's natural.

          So son, are you okay?

Steven smiles wide.

                       YOUNG STEVEN
          Yes Daddy.

As his parents prattle on, Steven's VO comes full.

                       STEVEN (V.O.)
          It hurt a bit, but I decided I wasn't
          gonna let it get me down. No way. I was
          gonna be the best son- No, the best
          person I could be.

     A joyous Sunday. OPEN ON the LETTER BOARD of THE VIRGINIA
     BEACH CHURCH OF GOD. The date reads, MARCH 1984.

     A congregation packs the church to the rafters as a
     Lawrence Welk-ish CHOIR praises Jesus to the tune of
     Hallelujah! We Shall Rise.

     Amidst this white-man's paradise sits a smiling and
     healthy STEVEN- playing the organ with a happy-stick
     planted firmly up his ass.

     As the joyous flock whoops it up, Steven winks to his
     wife (DEBBIE) and their 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER (STEPHANIE)
     who sit in the first row.

     Steven, oblivious, hits a sour note or two-- but keeps on
     playing with happy abandon. The crowd continues to enjoy
     the inspiring hymn.

               Virginia Beach Police Department, how may
               I direct your call?

     Steven enters in UNIFORM, smiling wide. Mandi waves
     happily. She covers the receiver and whispers.

                            MANDI (CONT'D)
               Something came for you.

     As he nods and moves on he's greeted by a VARIOUS
     POLICEMEN. We can tell he's well liked.

                             STEVEN

              ...and if it wasn't for you Jesus, I
              would have never found that last coffee
              filter and Prayer-Girls would have been
              ruined. So thank you for that.

                            STEVEN
              Amen.

    Steven moves to get up but settles back in when she
    continues.

                           DEBBIE
              And thank you for Steffie's allergy
              screen coming back all negative. I always
              knew it was in your plan for her to enjoy
              nuts. And finally I want to thank you
              for this man Jesus. This man who works
              so hard to make us happy without even a
              thought for himself.

    Steven smiles at that sentiment. Again he moves to get up
    when--

                           DEBBIE (CONT'D)
              This man who pursued me to the ends of
              the Earth and promised me a life of
              eternal happiness. A promise he has kept
              oh Lord. Every day. Amen.

    CLICK. In bed with Debbie, Steven switches off the light
    and lets out a hearty YAWN.

                           STEVEN
              I'm absolutely bushed.

                           DEBBIE
              Me too.

    They turn on their sides, back to back in the bed. After
    a few moments of SILENCE, Steven rolls over and puts his
    arm around her, gently feeling her breasts.

    Debbie turns on her back and they kiss quietly as Steven
    quietly gets on top. In moments, they are rocking with
    the gentle rhythm of everyday sex.

    Just as things are peaking, Steven suddenly STOPS and
    strikes a conversational tone.

               I swear honey- getting around the system's
               so easy. No one would even know I did it.

                            DEBBIE
               I know you want to find her Steven, but
               you need to think about this.

                            STEVEN
               You're right, I shouldn't have done it.

               Really? Well let's go!

     She moves to get up. Steven takes umbrage.

                            STEVEN
               Well hold on- let me finish.

               My goodness Steven, that's wonderful.

     He reads on, his smile ever widening until-

     He comes across something that concerns him and his voice
     trails off. His smile fades, replaced by a look of dread.

     screen door. A kindly woman (MRS. BASCOMBE) arrives
     behind the mesh wearing a birthday PARTY HAT.

     An ashen look overcomes Mrs. Basham's face. She removes
     her hat.

     store aisle with a basket slung over his arm.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               So I had no choice--
                      (beat, giddy)
               I became a con man!

     SLIP-WHAM! Steven throws himself in the air and falls
     flat on his back with a scream.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               Of course that was easy for me, every
               closet case is a con anyways.

     And as people gather around, he grasps his neck and moans
     litigiously--

     With great difficulty, Steven gets on his crutches and
     makes his exit.

                            STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Now it didn't happen all at once. It was
               sort of a gradual thing...


28   EXT. GROCERY RECEIVING DOCK - MIAMI, 1992 - DAY             28

     An OLD WAREHOUSE MANAGER emerges from a darkened AMITY
     FOODSERVICE trailer with a crate of tomatoes in hand. As
     he steps out onto the dock, he passes Steven, who is
     talking with a 500 pound PRODUCE MANAGER.

     Tomato crates are all around.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               It started with work. Tomatoes. I used to
               buy low grade tomatoes in the field and
               sell them to clueless chain stores as
               higher grade.

                            PRODUCE MANAGER
               These are gorgeous. U.S-1 right?

     And as they talk-

                            STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               It's called `field buying'. I could clear
               three thousand dollars in a good week
               doing that. But frankly it wasn't enough.

     Steven stands atop a escalator, looking around.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               But when money got really tight, the slip
               and fall always came in handy.

     He throws himself down the escalator, out of frame to the
     floor below. Painful tumbling is heard.

     At the BOTTOM of the escalator a hard THUD is heard.      A
     beat later, Steven's feet slide into frame.

          Don't blame yourself Jimmy... I did the

     Phillip looks at the spare roll of toilet paper and turns
     it over. A small chocolate bar is stuck in the tube.

     tries to pull him off the bed.

     Steven stumbles his way through the slow dance for a

     the music.

83   INT. PASSABLE APARTMENT, 1995 - HOUSTON - NIGHT             83

     A PARTY to celebrate Phillip's release. Steven and
     Phillip stand at the door as FRIENDS file in and greet
     him boisterously.

     Another friend enters.

                            BLAKE
               Oh my God! You look great. Prison agreed
               with you. How do I get on that diet?

                            PHILLIP
               Oh you couldn't handle it- not unless we
               smuggled an espresso machine in a cake.

                            BLAKE
               Throw in a Sicilian Barista and I'm

               Much better than the guy who had you
               kidnapped. What was his name?

     Steven looks to Phillip, perplexed.

84   INT. PASSABLE APARTMENT KITCHEN, 1995 - LATER THAT NIGHT 84

     Steven works his way through the crowded apartment
     struggling to hold a few cocktail glasses for guests.

     He eventually arrives next to Phillip, who is having a
     great time with another friend- and older woman named
     EUDORA MIXON.

                            STEVEN
               We gotta get a bigger place.

                            PHILLIP
               Steven I want you to meet my old neighbor-
               Eudora Mixon. She is just the sweetest.

                            EUDORA
               Pleasure Steven.

               Eudora...

                            PHILLIP
               Eudora owns a little building in Montrose
               and she's having a hell of time with the
               builder. He sounds like a real asshole.

                            EUDORA
               His plans were useless and he's trying to
               sue me to pay him! I need your expertise
               Steven. Phillip says maybe you can help.

                            STEVEN
               I could certainly try.

                            EUDORA
               Can you still practice law, having been
               to prison?

                            STEVEN
               Sure- why not?

                            EUDORA
               I just thought- Oh what do I know? I'd
               just be glad to have someone I could
               trust. I'll pay your normal fee.

     Steven doesn't miss a beat. He smiles wide.

                            STEVEN
               It would be my pleasure. Litigation is my
               speciality.

     Phillip beams with pride over Steven's decision.

85   INT. HOUSTON COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR, 1995 - DAY               85

     Eudora waits on a bench in the corridor, nervously
     glancing at her watch. Steven stands behind a column
     down the hall hiding and watching. He looks at his
     watch, then approaches her.

                            STEVEN
               Sorry I'm late but I've been hung up in
               court all day. Let's go in.


86   INT. HOUSTON COURTROOM, 1995 - DAY                         86

     STEVEN'S POV: A beautifully ornate courthouse LIGHT
     FIXTURE hangs from a courthouse ceiling.

     ON STEVEN, staring up at it with admiration.

                            JUDGE (O.S.)
               Mister Russell?

     Steven snaps out of it and responds to a waiting JUDGE.

                            STEVEN
               It's a beautiful fixture.

                             JUDGE
               I know.   It's your turn.

               Your Honor, Ms. Mixon engaged Mr. Gage
               service in good faith and was given an
               inferior product. She is entitled to deem
               that work to be unacceptable according to
               the contract that Mr. Evans signed.

                            LAWYER
               The terms of that contract were ambiguous
               at best. The truth is, defendant engaged
               my client for three years without full
               payment.

               fourteen other contracts, all on public
               record, in which Mr. Evans entered into
               litigation with past clients of his!

     Eudora glances into Steven's opened BRIEFCASE. It
     contains only a SANDWICH and a PHOTO OF PHILLIP.

                            LAWYER
               You're making me look like an idiot.

     He regroups and addresses the judge.

                            LAWYER (CONT'D)
               Your honor, I don't have to tell you that
               none of this is admissable or applicable
               to the case at hand. Mr. Russell's
               histrionics do not erase the fact that
               his client is in breech of contract.

                            JUDGE
               He is right Mr. Russell- what do you have
               to say?

     Steven is stonewalled. He looks to Eudora as if to say,
     "What do I do now?" and it terrifies her.

     Desperate, Steven bangs his fist on the table and looks
     resolutely to the judge.

                            STEVEN
               I demand to be seen in chambers!!

     The judge and lawyer seem mystified by this response.

87   INT. HOUSTON JUDGE'S CHAMBERS, 1995 - DAY                  87

     The Lawyer sits impatiently while Steven peruses a wall
     of plaques, photos and diplomas. He focuses on a law
     school DEGREE from INDIANA COLLEGE OF LAW. Next to it, a
     PHOTO of the judge as a YOUNG MAN on a farm. He's from
     humble roots.

     A moment later, the Judge enters.

                            JUDGE
               Okay gentlemen, let's get this over with,
               the two for one at the Crab Boiler ends
               at five o'clock.

                       LAWYER
          This seems to be cut and dried here, sir.
          I don't even know why we're back here.
          Mister Russell is treating this like an
          episode of Matlock.

                       STEVEN
          I'll admit your honor- I'm a plain spoken
          man. I didn't go to Princeton. I didn't
          go to Yale. My education was modest. I
          went to a small school. I grew up on a
          small farm. But I passed the same bar
          exam as my colleague here and I am not
          going to let him push around this humble
          woman.

This scores with the judge.

                       JUDGE
          Point taken Mister Russell...

He glares at the other lawyer with scorn.

                       JUDGE (CONT'D)
          ...but where are you going with this?

                       STEVEN
          I think it's obvious where I'm going with
          this sir.

A long SILENCE. The Judge waits and waits until something
occurs to him.

                       JUDGE
          Are you talking about Marshall vs. Chao?

Steven doesn't know what this means... But the other
lawyer does. And he's not happy.

                       LAWYER
                 (sotto)
          Shit...

Seeing this, Steven puffs with confidence.

                       STEVEN
          Your honor, that's exactly what I'm
          talking about.

The Judge slowly nods to himself as he considers this.

     AFTER they've been there.

     - A Hammock blowing in the breeze.

     - A quaint COTTAGE nestled in the vegetation.

     - Half empty glasses of beer on the porch.

     - Dirty dishes in the cottage sink. The remains of a
     romantic meal on a table. The swaying palms are visible
     through the windows.

     - Footsteps in the sand.

     - Two beach chairs facing the surf.

                             STEVEN (O.S.)
                Actually- I was in the yard once. Another
                guard asked him to pay him back five. He
                opened his wallet and I saw this picture
                of a little girl about Steffie's age. So
                I brought it up to him once, just to get
                him talking. That's the thing about
                having kids, you know? Gets people
                talking. Shared experience. Builds
                bridges. Something I learned. Anyway he
                tells me he's worried about her- mamma
                was gone. We talked awhile. You know, I
                just listened. That's all. I brought up
                the candles just one time but mostly just
                listened... And the next day, bedtime,
                there they were.

     An empty 21-foot MOTORBOAT bobs atop placid seas, fishing
     poles dangling over the side. The SOUND of two men
     enjoying themselves can be heard.

     After reaching their inevitable conclusion, the VOICES
     gasp for air.

               With Phillip I felt strong. I felt
               invincible. I promised myself he would
               never want for anything ever again. That
               meant I needed a real job. Something
               dependable. And- no more scams.

     A bored Steven waits in the middle of a big wig's office.
     He looks at PHOTOS on a nearby wall of a broad-shouldered
     all-American man dressed in a NASA jump suit performing
     various astronautical training tasks.

     He picks up a small ASTRONAUT FIGURINE and examines it.

          Yep. Never got out there though. NASA's
          a real political place. Never could
          figure out whose ass to kiss to get a
          mission.

          With the popularity of HMO's in today's
          health care system, doctors need help
          managing their billing-- so they can
          focus on their patients. That's where
          USA Medical Management comes in. Hundreds
          of millions of dollars pass through our
          system from the HMO's to the doctors.
          It's a critical business. A powerful
          business...

          So when I read your resume, I wasn't sure
          what to think. Your level of education
          and your past experience would factor
          heavily into this decision and frankly...

Steven deflates in expectation.

     new office.

      She leads him to his new desk which is stacked with
      folders, files, printouts and reams of data.

                I pulled all the claims for the last two

                transfers and confirmations from the
                bank. Most of it's routine and I think
                you can get up to speed in a day or two.

                really.

      Steven nods and turns his attention to the sea of numbers
      before him. He looks concerned as he begins to leaf
      through.


100   INT. USAMM BOARDROOM - 1996 - DAY                         100

      Steven sits in a board meeting, surrounded by all of the
      company honchos. Dan Lindholm lords over the gathering
      at the head of the table while a suit (MARK) reads from a
      report to the group.

                             MARK
                Crossover from traditional markets shows
                declination and inverse diffusion seems
                commensurate with net-trade trending. HMO
                penetration still leads PPO, NMO and FMO
                as usual but attenuation is growing more
                prevalent in Q4 as projected... As for
                Q3, well Q3 is what Q3 always is: Q2 with
                training wheels.

      Everyone LAUGHS, but no one quite as hard as Steven who
      desperately tries to fit in.

      Larry Birkheim, the CEO of USAMM sits beside Dan
      Lindholm. He chimes in.

                             BIRKHEIM
                Okay Steven, your turn. I know you've
                only had the one quarter to play catch up
                but I tell you, we can't wait to get some
                insight here.

          Oh.   Okay. Ummm...

Steven fumbles through some folders and vamps a while.

                       STEVEN (CONT'D)
          Well I did a lot of work here and uh... I
          think maybe... well I could just read it
          to you but uh... it might be better to
          just uh...

The group looks at him quizzically.     Just as it seems
Steven has been up to nothing--

                       STEVEN (CONT'D)
          Well, I'll just show you. Todd?

TODD, an incredibly hot assistant unveils an easel full
of detailed tables. Steven walks the board through an
incredibly well prepared presentation.

                       STEVEN (CONT'D)
          If you look here at Mark's projections
          again for Q3, you'll see- well you'll see
          they're just that- projections.
          Projections based on a model set by my
          predecessor. I decided to reject that
          model and do things a little differently.
          I want to show you my results. This is
          what we actually made in Q3--

Todd flips to the next card. The graphs GROW
exponentially. The group is intrigued.

                       STEVEN (CONT'D)
          Now let me tell you how I did it...

Todd unveils another card, the men are impressed by the
unseen image.

And as Steven explains himself, Dan and Birkheim smile
broadly and turn to each other with smug assurance.

      the candy revealing an INSPIRING MESSAGE printed inside
      the wrapper- "When two hearts race, both win."

      ON PHILLIP. He's deeply touched by the sentiment as he
      chews on the candy. He puts the wrapper on the
      REFRIGERATOR with a MAGNET.

      He opens ANOTHER. He chews and reads- "Commit random acts
      of kindness"

      Again he's touched and puts it on the refrigerator.

      He opens ANOTHER and pops the candy in his mouth.    He
      reads- "A smile is a flower on your face"

      He's disgusted by the trite sentiment and THROWS THE
      WRAPPER IN THE TRASH. A beat later, he REMOVES THE CANDY
      from his mouth and THROWS THAT IN THE TRASH TOO.

      Just then Steven walks by in a TUXEDO, adjusting his tie.

                             PHILLIP

                              STEVEN
                We're always going to be together. And
                there is nothing going on. I promise.

                I wouldn't lie to you, baby.

      Steven stares back and convinces Phillip with a look.
      They kiss.


121   INT. USAMM PARKING GARAGE - 1996 - DAY                     121

      Birkheim emerges from his parked MERCEDES C-CLASS. After
      locking it he notices a little smudge and buffs it out
      with his handkerchief.

      As he admires his car proudly, the building volume of the
      MIAMI SOUND MACHINE gets his attention.

      He sees as Steven arrives in his NEW and MUCH MORE
      IMPRESSIVE SL500 and parks a few spots down.

      He watches as Steven tries on several watches and tosses
      them back in the glove compartment before settling on one
      and exiting the car.

      Birkheim raises a brow.


122   INT. USAMM ELEVATOR - 1996 - A SHORT TIME LATER             122

                Yeah.

      DING! The door opens. Steven exits, leaving a disgruntled
      Birkheim in his wake.


123   INT. BIRKHEIM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                         123

      Birkheim pores over spreadsheets, taking notes and
      comparing numbers. CLOSE UPS on headings like "INTEREST
      EARNED" and "DEPOSIT" indicate he's looking for something

      He continues to make notes, growing ever more suspicious
      until something catches his eye.

      In the margin of one of the pages is a DOODLING of a
      SMILEY-FACED PENIS.

      Birkheim doesn't quite know what to make of this... but
      it seems to stare at him mockingly.

124   INT. USAMM HALLWAY - 1996 - DAY                            124

      Steven whistles happily and takes a draw off his coffee
      mug. As he passes an office, something catches his ear.

                             BIRKHEIM (O.S.)
                I have some questions about these new
                accounts we've opened.

      Steven slows to a stop.


125   INT. BIRKHEIM'S OFFICE - 1996 - CONTINUOUS                 125

      Birkheim, his back to the door, is on the phone as Steven
      eavesdrops outside.

                             BIRKHEIM
                Yeah... I was wondering if we could
                compare some numbers. I know you usually
                talk to our CFO but this is a delicate
                matter and I'd like keep it secret for
                now.

      Steven is worried.


126   INT. USAMM CUBICLE - 1996 - DAY                            126

      OPEN CLOSE on blank copies spitting out of a copier.
      Steven stands over the machine, his finger on the button
      as he keeps surveillance on Birkheim's office door.

      A SECRETARY arrives with a stack of papers.

                             SECRETARY
                Hi Mister Ru--

                             STEVEN
                I'M MAKING COPIES!!!

      She leaves, terrified.

      Finally, Steven spots Birkheim leaving his office.


127   INT. BIRKHEIM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                        127

      Steven runs into Birkheim's office and scans the papers
      on his desk. Nothing.

      He turns his attention to Birkheim's briefcase, but he
      can't get it open.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages    5-23-08     77.


      Eventually he spots a blank legal pad and looks at it
      closely. He grabs a pencil and does the old detective
      trick of shading in the page to reveal what was written
      on the now missing page above.

      The embossed text reads, "837,502.12"

      He stares at it a moment. This number looks familiar.
      He grabs the phone and dials. An AUTOMATED VOICE answers.

                             AUTOMATED TELLER
                Hello, you've reached the Automatic

                enter your personal account number
                followed by the pound sign.

      Steven quickly enters some numbers. As he listens he
      flips through Birkheim's desktop calendar.

                             AUTOMATED TELLER (CONT'D)

                hundred and two dollars and twelve cents.
                To repeat this-

      It's the SAME NUMBER as on the pad. He hangs up. And
      turns his attention to the calendar. He spies an entry
      that reads, "Harris County Police, 12:30"

      He leaps out of the chair and exits the office.


128   INT. USAMM COPIER ROOM - 1996 - DAY                        128

      Steven furiously shreds documents in the company's PAPER
      SHREDDER. Moments later the same SECRETARY enters the
      room with an armload of work- enraging Steven.

                             STEVEN
                CAN'T YOU SEE I'M SHREDDING!?

      Terrified, the woman runs away.

      He hangs up, tortured by this news. His eyes catch a
      glimpse of a DETECTIVE exiting the cell block, banging on
      the GUARD BOOTH glass with his walkie-talkie.

      He just stares at the door, long and hard.

                  Lunch is served.

      As the Guard goes through the bag, Steven reaches over
      the counter and swipes a WALKIE TALKIE- revealing a

      an aura as he can.

      He gets to a glass security door, where two JAIL GUARDS
      stand. Steven taps on the glass confidently with the
      WALKIE TALKIE and signals them to open the door.

      all is   lost--

      PUSH BAR to open the door. And with a gentle PUSH, the
      door OPENS ...and he's gone.

      Steven heaves a sigh.


160   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL PHONE BANKS, 1996 - DAY            160

      Steven, in a fresh prison jumpsuit, paces while talking
      on the phone.

                              STEVEN
                C'mon Phillip, pick up, it's me.    I'm
                sorry. C'mon.
                       (then)
                Dammit!

      He hangs up.   A nearby inmate chimes in.

                             NEW CELLMATE
                How long you in for?

                             STEVEN
                Not long.
                       (picks up phone)
                Can you hit me in the face with this?

      And off the inmate's quizzened expression--


161   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL - 1996 - INFIRMARY - DAY           161

      OPEN CLOSE on Steven's BLOODY FACE. A PRISON PHYSICIAN
      is examining it closely. We notice Steven is wearing
      WHITE SCRUBS (as opposed to the doctor who wears GREEN
      SCRUBS).

                             PHYSICIAN
                That's a pretty big gash. Just stay
                still...

                             STEVEN
                It sure hurts...
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08    92.


      As Steven talks and the doctor looks, Steven stealthily
      plucks the doctor's ID BADGE and slips it in his pocket.


162   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL CELL - 1996 - DAY                  162

      Steven finishes filling the sink in his cell and pulls
      out a GREEN MAGIC MARKER. He breaks it open and drips the
      ink into the water.

      And as the water turns GREEN, Steven removes his white
      scrubs and plunges them in the sink.


163   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL GUARD STATION - 1996 - NIGHT       163

      The NIGHT GUARD watches his monitors when a rap on the
      glass gets his attention. He looks up to see Steven in
      newly (and badly) dyed GREEN SCRUBS, awaiting exit on the
      other side, holding the stolen ID BADGE against the
      glass.

                              NIGHT GUARD
                `night Doc.

      He pushes the buzzer and Steven pushes open the door.


164   EXT. TEXAS MOTEL - 1996 - DAY                              164

      Seven State and Local police cruisers sit in the parking
      lot, a shirtless Steven is removed from his motel room by
      a pair of OFFICERS. His skin is stained green but his
      expression is pure resolve.


165   INT. HOUSTON COURTROOM - 1996 - DAY                        165

      OPEN CLOSE on a GAVEL striking. Steven stands before the
      judge flanked by his attorney and a bailiff.

                             HOUSTON JUDGE
                Set bail at 900,000 dollars.

                             ATTORNEY
                Your honor...

                             STEVEN
                Nine hundred thousand!? It's a white
                collar charge.

                              ATTORNEY
                Your honor-
"I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages     5-23-08   93.


The judge begins FILLING OUT A FORM. He barely looks up
at them.

                       HOUSTON JUDGE
          Mister Russell is a flight risk. The
          bond is set. Nine hundred thousand.

                       STEVEN
          This is bullshit.
                 (sotto to attorney)
          Set a reduction hearing.

                       ATTORNEY
                 (off this)
          Your honor we'd like to set a reduction
          hearing.

                       HOUSTON JUDGE
          That's your right, but I strongly advise
          you don't.

The judge finishes filling out the form and PLACES IT AT
THE EDGE OF HIS BENCH for Steven to see.

It clearly reads his bail amount, his charge, everything.
As the Attorney PRATTLES ON in the background, Steven
just STARES AT THE FORM LONG AND HARD.

                       HOUSTON JUDGE (CONT'D)
          Fine. You can have your hearing tomorrow.

Steven interjects.

                       STEVEN
                 (sotto to Lawyer)
          Next week.

The attorney looks at him quizzically and turns back to
the judge.

                       ATTORNEY
          We'd like next week if that's okay.

                       STEVEN
                 (sotto)
          On the thirteenth.

                       ATTORNEY
          Oh the thirteenth if possible.

                       HOUSTON JUDGE
          Fine. Friday the thirteenth. Now go away.

166   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL CELLS - 1996 - NIGHT               166

      A block of holding cells well stocked with men waiting on
      the legal system.

      We soon come upon Steven who is furiously SKETCHING OUT A
      COPY of the form from the judge's bench from memory.


167   INT. HOUSTON APT BEDROOM (TYLER) - 1996 - DAY              167

      OPEN CLOSE on an opened envelope next to Steven's sketch
      and a letter.

                             STEVEN (V.O.)
                Dearest Tyler. Long time no talk. I won't
                beat around the bush. I got into a spot
                of trouble here in Houston and find
                myself needing help. That's right, jail
                again. Anyway I was wondering if you
                could type up this thing for me on your
                computer just like I sketched out...

      As Steven `reads' the letter we reveal a MAN hacking away
      on a computer nearby. As we move closer, we see that
      he's the MOUSTACHED MAN from the night of his car crash
      and he's not wearing pants.


168   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL CELL - 1996 - DAY                  168

      Steven opens a letter and pulls out the FORGED FORM.

                             STEVEN
                Great!

      He grabs a pen and begins filling it out.


169   INT. HOUSTON COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - 1996 - DAY              169

      Manacled to a line of prisoners, Steven shuffles through
      a crowded hallway. Courthouse staff are everywhere.

      Steven spots a HARRIED woman approaching with an armful
      of paperwork.

      He reaches into his jumpsuit and pulls out the FORGED
      DOCUMENT and as she passes- HE DROPS IT.

                             STEVEN
                Ma'am?!

      The woman turns back, annoyed.

                             STEVEN (CONT'D)
                Dropped something.

      She picks it up and puts it on her pile. He smiles as he
      watches her walk away.


170   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL PHONE BANK, 1996- DAY               170

      Steven dials the phone.


171   INT. HOUSTON COURTHOUSE - CLERKS OFFICE, 1996 - DAY         171

      INTERCUT, a CLERK answers her RINGING PHONE.    Her desk
      CALENDAR reads: "September, Friday the 13th"

                             CLERK
                This is Julie.

      Steven puts on his best SOUTHERN BELLE VOICE.

                             STEVEN
                       (as woman)
                Hi, I have Judge Charles Hearn for the
                clerk's office.

                             STEVEN
                I'll put him through.

      Steven switches to an authoritative JUDGE VOICE.

                       (gruff)

                Good, I need that to go through right
                away. Because if it don't, I'm gonna have
                to chug about a quart of Tidee Bowl on
                account of all the shit I'll be eating.

                and connect me to a good bail bondsman?

172   EXT. GALVESTON HOUSE - 1996 - DAY                          172

      A LIMOUSINE pulls up outside a modest Galveston house.
      The CHAUFFEUR opens the door and Steven emerges dressed
      in new linen suit and clutching champagne and flowers.

      He approaches the door and just as he's about to knock--

                             PHILLIP (O.S.)
                Go away Steven!

      Steven is surprised.

                Don't say that.

                They probably have a psychic after you
                right now! Did you see any bunnies!?

                             STEVEN

                       PHILLIP (O.S.)
          You opened a bank account for Doctor
          Phillip Morris! Now they think I'm in on
          everything! I'm facing real time! You
          know I can't go back to prison.

                       STEVEN
          I'm sorry about that- they weren't
          supposed to find that. It was for your
          own good. So we could be together.

                       PHILLIP (O.S.)
          Fuck off! I'm in enough trouble.

                       STEVEN
          C'mon Phillip, just trust me-

                       PHILLIP (O.S.)
          FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING LIAR! Do you realize
          how bad you've fucked me over!! You made
          me an accomplice! You fucking liar! I
          don't want to see you. Go away! I never
          want to see you again!

                       STEVEN
          Phillip don't say that.

No response.

                       STEVEN (CONT'D)
          Well what am I supposed to do?

                       PHILLIP (O.S.)

This time, it's Steven who remains silent.

          Oh my God...

                         STEVEN
          Well...

He slams the door shut again.

                Open the door Phillip.

                                 PHILLIP (O.S.)
                No.

      Steven walks up to the door and pleads gently.

                       (quietly)

                That's all. Please.

      A long silence. Steven waits longer than he should with
      the certainty that it will open. And eventually it
      does... slowly and tentatively.

      Through the screen door, their eyes are just inches
      apart. Steven looks into Phillip's soul. He opens his
      mouth and--

                             SWAT COMMANDER (O.S.)
                Down on the ground faggots!!

      Steven and Phillip are shocked to see a small SWAT team
      surrounding the front porch with automatic weapons.

                                 SWAT COMMANDER (CONT'D)

      And as they comply and the armed men descend--


173   INT. GALVESTON POLICE STATION - 1996 - DAY                     173

      Steven and Phillip sit manacled, side by side. They stare
      at the floor in miserable uncomfortable silence.

                                 STEVEN
                Phillip?

                                 PHILLIP
                Don't.

                                 STEVEN
                I love you.

      No response. Phillip can only sit and stew.       And stew.
      Until finally, he's had enough.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages     5-23-08   99.


                             PHILLIP
                From the moment we met, you've done
                nothing but lie. Our whole
                relationship... just lies. I'm such an
                asshole. You took advantage of me- just
                like all the rest of them. You were
                supposed to protect me- but you've done
                nothing but make a fool of me. And you
                expect me to love you? How can I love
                you? I don't even know who you are. And
                you know what's sad? I don't even think
                you know who you are. So how am I
                supposed to love something that don't
                even exist? You tell me.

      Eventually a POLICEMAN stands before Phillip.

                                POLICEMAN (O.S.)
                Morris.     You're up.

      Before he stands up, Phillip manages a terse statement.

                             PHILLIP
                I will never forgive you Steven. Never.

                 task, believe me. But after watching
                 Jimmy die, I thought I could make it
                 convincing. First, you have to starve
                 yourself- I ate half as much every day
                 for ten months. After that, you have to
                 fake all sorts of symptoms.

       FLASHBACK. Steven kneels over the toilet in his cell,
       sticking his finger down his throat until he pukes.

                              STEVEN (V.O.)
                 You gotta keep this up for months until
                 you lose about, say, 80 pounds.


196    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1998 - MICHAEL UNIT CELL - MORNING 196

       FLASHBACK. Months later, Steven sits up in his bed. He
       now has a grey beard and with his shirt off we can see he
       has lost an unhealthy amount of weight.

                              STEVEN (V.O.)
                 But the hardest part is falsifying your

       Steven enters an inmate's cell (LAWRENCE) with a BIG BAG

       Lawrence sweeps up in an empty office. He looks to see
       if the coast is clear and bolts for some file cabinets.

       After some searching, Lawrence pulls out a file entitled
       "Russell, Steven A". Reading from a scrap of paper, he
       scrawls something with a pen.

       Lawrence then reaches into his pants and pulls out some
       forged forms- stuffing them into the folder.

       FLASHBACK. OPEN CLOSE on the gaunt and grey-skinned
       Steven. A MALE NURSE places a thermometer in his mouth
       and looks at Phillip's medical history.

       CLOSE ON THE FILE- a doctor's entry reads "HIV+ since 91"
       A few flips of the pages reveal FORGED BLOOD TEST
       DOCUMENTS. Buzzwords like T-CELL COUNTS and other terms
       catch the Nurse's eye.

       He looks concerned.

                 I'll be right back.

                 ...you have AIDS.

       Steven sits expressionless.

201    INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY 201

       Steven lays in his hospital bed. A FAT NURSE puts a pill
       in his mouth and follows it with some water. She exits.

       Once she's clear, Steven reaches into his mouth and pulls
       out the pill. He secretly places it into a small HOLE in
       his mattress for safe keeping.


202    INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY 202

       FLASHBACK. Again, we are at the first hospital scene of
       the movie. The cardio ALARM blares. Steven watches as a
       DOCTOR appears and pushes the nurses aside.

                              DOCTOR
                 Where's the crash cart!?

       He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard-
       the sound of a sternum CRACKING can be heard.

       With the staff distracted, Steven reaches into his
       mattress hole and pulls out scores of pills. He stuffs
       them into his mouth as fast as he can.

                              STEVEN (V.O.)
                 But the hardest part by far is getting
                 transferred to a private care facility.
                 It's standard procedure for late stage
                 patients, but convincing them I was about
                 to die would involve taking a few risks.

       He chases the pills down with a glass of water.


203    EXT. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER, 1998 - DAY                 203

       Steven is helped from a corrections van into a wheelchair
       outside the Restful Acres facility.

                              STEVEN (V.O.)
                 After a four day coma, they were convinced.


204    INT. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER, 1998 - DAY                 204

       In his bed at the care facility, Steven looks around and
       picks up the phone. He talks with a FOREIGN ACCENT.

                              STEVEN
                 This is Doctor Rios from the Hamblin
                 Center, Houston. I'm looking for AIDS

                               STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 And once I got settled in, I just called
                 the Department of Corrections and
                 convinced them I was a state-sponsored
                 doctor looking for late stage AIDS
                 patients for an experimental treatment.
                        (then)
                 As luck would have it, they had one
                 patient that was eligible...

       Steven continues his Dr. Rios imitation on the phone.

                              STEVEN
                 Oh you do? Steven Russell? Could you
                 spell that?

       CAMERA SETTLES on a nearby CALENDAR.    It reads: "MONDAY,

       Later that day, Steven is helped out of his wheelchair
       into a waiting taxi.

                              STEVEN (V.O.)
                 And for all that time- all those doctors,
                 all those nurses and all those
                 facilities... not one of them ever
                 thought to give me an AIDS test...

       The door SLAMS and off he drives.

                  I had a special request when I ordered

                  Yeah- right here.

       He lifts a GREASY BROWN BAG into view.

                                STEVEN
                  Thank God.

       Steven grabs it and begins to gorge himself on BURGERS.

                               STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  A week later, the hospice was to get a
                  call from Doctor Rios, telling them
                  Steven Russell had died undergoing
                  treatment. And after all that hard work
                  dying? Where's the first place I go?

                  Funny, huh?

       The guard pushes Phillip past the threshold.    The door
       SLAMS SHUT behind him.

       He staggers toward Steven as a kaleidoscope of emotions
       plays across his face. Bewilderment, relief, sorrow, joy
       and finally, anger-

       WHACK!   He slaps Steven across the face.

                               PHILLIP

                  know that. I couldn't. But Phillip, I
                  only did it so I could get here to you.

           You're so skinny.

 Phillip is listening.

           I know you thought we were nothing but a
           lie- but underneath all those lies there
           was always something that was real. I
           thought about what you said to me. You
           said you don't know who I am. But I have
           to tell you- I know now. I know who I
           am. I mean- I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a
           CFO, I'm not a cop. Hell I'm not even an
           escape artist. Those Steven Russells are
           dead. And now, all that's left is the man
           that loves you. That's all. Nothing
