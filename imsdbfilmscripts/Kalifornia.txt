               EXT. - NIGHT

               It's raining like hell. Flashes of lightning reveal momentary 
               glimpses of a decayed urban/industrial landscape. Far below 
               us, a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the 
               drowning earth. We descend toward the rock. Sporadic flashes 
               of lightning distort our perspective of the stone. It looks 
               strangely beautiful, like a diamond stuck in the dark mud... 
               Closer... Closer...

               Suddenly, STRONG MALE HANDS cut across the frame and wrench 
               it free from its muddy grave. Even closer... And we discover 
               that the underbelly of this beautiful rock is teeming with 
               every kind of slithering repulsive insect... FLASH!!* 
               Lightning obliterates the frame.

               (* FLASHES OF LIGHT from lightning, car headlights, 
               photographic strobe units and flashlights are used throughout 
               the following sequences as recurring transitional devices.)

               CITY STREET EXT. NIGHT

               We can barely see the darkened street in a run down part of 
               an inner city -- what we can see looks half demolished. 
               Flash!!

               Through chain link fencing, the blinding headlights of a 
               70'S CHEVY arc into frame. For an instant we see the fleeting 
               image of a PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL. On her feet a pair of bright 
               red high heeled shoes. The Chevy pulls up next to her.

               INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT

               FLASH!! An oncoming car's headlights streak across the beat 
               up Chevy's windshield... revealing... THE DRIVER, 45ish, as 
               he leans across the passenger seat and opens the car door.

               The pretty teenage girl slides into the car. Dressed only in 
               a skirt and T-Shirt, she's soaked to the skin. Make-up runs 
               down her face and her hair sticks to her bare shoulders. She 
               seems nervous... scared even.

                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
                         Thanks.

               As she closes the car door the man notices that her hand has 
               been injured. It's bound with coarse white toweling and 
               stained with blood. In her other hand, she clings tightly to 
               a cheap yellow leather purse. He reaches forward and puts 
               his hand on the gear-shift, the back of his hand brushing 
               against her leg, she moves away. He slides the gear-shift 
               into drive.

               Another car's headlights flare the windshield as he pulls 
               out into the night.

               INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Suddenly... a powerful photographic strobe light ignites! 
               Revealing a decrepit warehouse interior. Silhouetted briefly 
               against the paint chipped walls are two figures: A man, BRIAN 
               KESSLER, 25, short chopped hair dressed in black on black, 
               and a woman, CARRIE LAUGHLIN, 25, short black hair and tight 
               black clothes. Carrie holds a 35mm still camera, an umbilical 
               cord runs to a strobe light. Brian holds a flashlight in one 
               hand, a tape recorder in the other. He begins speaking into 
               the tape recorder.

                                     BRIAN
                         Her father worked the night shift 
                         here. Most nights he'd bring her 
                         with him.
                              (pause)
                         She was eleven years old.

               His flashlight scans the ominous environment. Carrie takes 
               flash photo.

               EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

               Emerging from the blackness... The same strong male hands 
               that unearthed the rock now pulls his rain soaked jacket 
               clear of his torso. A crude bandage wrapped around one of 
               the fingers. The rock is slipped up under his jacket... up 
               against his bare chest. The jacket is pulled down to conceal 
               the rock and the faceless figure drifts away.

               INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The beam of Brian's flashlight sweeps through the darkness, 
               revealing another room.

                                     BRIAN
                         This is it. This is the where he'd 
                         take her whenever he had the urge to 
                         molest her.

               The flashlight finds the corner in question. Flash!! The 
               warehouse lights up again, revealing a huge machine room.

                                     BRIAN
                         Of course! Nobody would have heard 
                         her cries over the noise of the 
                         machines.

               INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT

               A male hand wipes the steamy condensation clear of his car's 
               front window. The windshield wipers swipe incessantly at the 
               constant sheet of rain beyond.

                                     DRIVER
                         Damn! This defroster never works...

               The driver fidgets blindly with the various levers and knobs. 
               He finally manages to get the defroster and heater to work. 
               The girl leans forward into the stream of warm air.

                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
                         ...Mmm... feels good.

               She closes her eyes, lets it blow across her face. He watches 
               her. His eyes linger on her body.

                                     DRIVER
                         Have a problem with your car?

               She pulls her wet hair off her bruised face and gives him a 
               nervous smile.

                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
                         No.
                              (beat)
                         My problem's with men.

               He throws a curious look at her, then back to the highway.

               INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Brian's flashlight moves around the room.

                                     BRIAN
                         This is where she murdered her first 
                         victim. They found his body over in 
                         the corner, shot through the head.

               The flashlight continues to search through the darkness.

                                     BRIAN
                         They found her second victim over 
                         there.

               Another flash!!!!!

               INT. 70'S CHEVY

               Very close on the girl's yellow purse... as the metal zipper 
               is pulled open. The driver notices her opening the purse.

                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
                         Okay if I smoke?

                                     DRIVER
                              (unconvincingly)
                         ...sure.

               The driver watches as she reaches into the purse... out a 
               soggy pack of matches. She looks at them... I look to the 
               driver.

                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
                         My matches are all wet. You got a 
                         lighter?

                                     DRIVER
                              (scans the dashboard)
                         Yeah. It's here somewhere. It's my 
                         wife's car. Ah... there it is.

               He pushes the cigarette lighter in to heat. Out of the corner 
               of his eye, he sees the girl's hand slip back in her purse. 
               And stay there. She stares at the car lighter and... waits. 
               The driver glances at her, then back to the lighter.

               INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE

               FLASH!! As another strobe light ignites. Tape recorder hand, 
               Brian continues...

                                     BRIAN
                         She lured them here with the promise 
                         of sex.
                              (beat)
                         Imagine the anger and hatred she 
                         must have felt returning to this 
                         place. Did she use that to help her 
                         pull the trigger?

               Carrie snaps another shot. Flash!! The blinding flash 
               illuminates the night rain streaming in through the fractured 
               remains of the ceiling.

                                     CARRIE
                         Shhhhhhhhh.

               Brian stops talking. Carrie scans the darkness. From the 
               quiet...

               A Thunderous Roar!!

               INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT

               A Blinding Flash!!

               As... a semi-trailer crosses paths with the 70'S CHEVY.

               Close on the girl. An intent expression on her face as she 
               watches and waits... for the cigarette lighter to eject. His 
               hand reaches deeper into her purse. The Driver tenses as he 
               sees this. Suddenly...

               POP!! The lighter ejects.

               The Driver reaches for the dash. The girl hurriedly lifts 
               something out from inside the bag. The Driver yanks the 
               lighter out... and whips a look to the girl.

               INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE

               Brian's flashlight sweeps across the shadowed remains of the 
               rafters and catwalks. Scanning... Listening... Brian and 
               Carrie glance tentatively at each other... Then slowly Carrie 
               lifts the portable strobe unit upward until it is pointing 
               into the rafters. Carrie fires a shot, triggering a brilliant 
               Flash!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Flash! Out of the inky black... The glistening wet rock 
               emerges, hurtling downwards... Tumbling end over end through 
               the night rain...

               INT. 70'S CHEVY

               The girl pulls a pack of cigarettes out of her purse. She 
               looks curiously to the driver whose hand is trembling 
               slightly.

                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
                         What's the matter?

                                     DRIVER
                              (unconvincingly)
                         ...nothing.

               The girl reaches out, steadies his trembling hand... and 
               pulls the red hot coil to the cigarette between her lips.

               When... in a THUNDEROUS CRASH!! The glistening wet rock comes 
               smashing through their windshield!!!!

               EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

               The CHEVY brakes... Skids across the rain-slicked pavement 
               and turns a somersault, landing upside down on its hood.

               ANOTHER ANGLE: CLOSER

               The CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the fractured front end of the 
               overturned CHEVY. The twisted hunk of metal hisses... 
               steams... groans. The front tire spins lazily to a halt on 
               its mangled axle.

               IN THE BACKGROUND - HIGH OVERHEAD

               We see a man standing on a highway overpass. He's leaning on 
               the railing and calmly looking down at the wrecked car.

               CLOSER

               EARLY GRAYCE, 25, athletic build, big watery eyes, jet black 
               hair, stands by the railing. Rain streaks down his 
               expressionless face. He dropped the rock.

               EARLY'S POV - THE 70'S CHEVY

               Lying in the deserted highway. The Driver crawls out covered 
               with blood. Still clutched in his hand is the car cigarette 
               lighter. Its red hot coil extinguishing quickly to a faint 
               glow.

               ANGLE: CLOSER ON EARLY

               Calmly looking down with no pity. Even closer... Water running 
               down his face. Closer yet... On his eye... And right into 
               the dilated pupil.

               As we enter it -- it's like being in a dark winding tunnel 
               filled with the hum of dynamos and the loud rhythmic pumping 
               of powerful machinery.

               FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE BLACKNESS

               The distant echo of a Woman's voice.

                         Are you dead or alive?

               INT. APARTMENT - BRIAN'S EAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Still hearing the whine from some tremendous dynamo, we emerge 
               from the inside of BRIAN'S RIGHT EARDRUM, pulling back far 
               enough to see his face.

                                     KIM (O.S.)
                         Brian?

               Brian is distracted, distant, not paying attention to the 
               game of "Twenty Questions" that he is playing.

                                     BRIAN

               A small party in progress. Graduate student types, smoking, 
               drinking. The usual. Carrie and Brian stand out in this group, 
               their look is more stylized, their attitude less complacent. 
               Carrie, in particular, looks restless.

               Brian's eyes dart to Carrie. The look on his face tells 
               everyone she nailed it. Brian gets up to get another drink. 
               Several people laugh, amazed that Carrie knows Brian so well.

                         He's probably been researching Ted 
                         Bundy all week.

                                     PETER
                         Carl, you are the world's worst loser!

               Carl looks over to Carrie. She gives him the finger and a 
               cheeky smile.

               CAROL, sitting next to Carrie, asks...

                                     CAROL
                         Any word from that gallery?

                                     CARRIE
                         Not yet.

                                     CAROL
                         Nervous?

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Apprehensive. Let's not forget 
                         these are the people who banned the 
                         Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, 
                         California's loaded with galleries.

                                     CAROL
                              (nods toward Brian)
                         You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed 
                         to leave?

               Carrie watches Brian disappear into another room.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Soon as he finishes his thesis.

                                     CAROL
                         Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his 
                         for over three years now.

               Carrie lights a cigarette. Her frustration is showing.

                                     CARRIE
                         Yeah, well Brian's got 'til the end 
                         of the summer, then I'm outta here.

               She gets up and begins weaving her way through the crowded 
               room. Carol follows.

                                     CAROL
                         I'm sorry, but I just can't see you 
                         veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.

                                     CARRIE
                         Oh, I don't know... I think that 
                         once I dye my hair blonde, buy a 
                         string bikini and cultivate that 
                         tan... I could be veggin' out with 
                         the best of 'em...
                              (does a valley-
                              girl/beach bunny)
                         Like fer shurr!

               Carrie and Carol share a strained laugh.

               INT. APARTMENT KITCHEN - FEW MOMENTS LATER

               The room's crowded with people. There's a lot of noise -- 
               "shop talk," banter. Clipped conversations overlap, as we 
               find Brian with his friend Eric. They are in the midst of 
               making a blender of margaritas.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm talking about the mind and 
                         culpability of a serial killer. 
                         Someone who has no ability to 
                         distinguish between right and wrong 
                         should not be imprisoned, let alone 
                         executed.

               Eric dumps in a handful of ice cubes as Brian pours in the 
               booze.

                                     ERIC
                         Oh, here we go again. Let's just lay 
                         it all at the altar of misfiring 
                         synapses, amok biochemicals and 
                         horrendous childhoods.

                                     BRIAN
                         Look, it's a fact, most of these 
                         people suffer from a severe chemical 
                         brain imbalance.
                              (beat)
                         That enough Tequila?

                                     ERIC
                         Probably not...

               Brian pours in the rest of the bottle.

                                     BRIAN
                              (to Eric)
                         The answer is research and treatment 
                         under hospital supervised conditions, 
                         not the electric chair!

               Eric looks for triple sec in the cupboards. PETER overhears 
               them on his way to the refrigerator.

                                     PETER
                         Yeah, until it's your mother's head 
                         they find in the refrigerator.

               He pulls open the refrigerator door and grabs two beers. 
               Carrie steps up behind Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Executing the killer wouldn't bring 
                         my mother back.

                                     CARRIE
                         Thank god!

               Brian turns to see Carrie now behind him. She wraps her arms 
               around his neck.

                                     BRIAN
                              (sarcastic to Carrie)
                         Ha, ha.

                                     ERIC
                         Yeah, but it'd sure make you feel 
                         better, wouldn't it?

                                     BRIAN
                         No, it wouldn't make me feel better.

               Peter finds triple sec in the refrigerator.

                                     PETER
                         ...Looking for this?

               Eric takes the triple sec from Peter and pours some in the 
               blender. He turns it on. It whines.

                                     CARRIE
                              (to Brian)
                         If I have to listen to one more 
                         "tweed" talk about his dissertation, 
                         I'm going to throw up.

                                     ERIC
                              (to Brian)
                         Label it anyway you want, the bottom 
                         line is these people are evil, plain 
                         and simple.

                                     BRIAN
                              (continuing with Eric)
                         Okay, now you want to talk about 
                         good versus evil? Well then let's 
                         start with Adam and Eve and the snake.

                                     CARRIE
                         Who do I have to blow to get out of 
                         here?

                                     BRIAN
                              (reconsiders)
                         A... I gotta go.

               EXT. LUCKY STREET GRILL

               A relic from the fifties with large glass windows. The rain 
               has stopped but the streets are still wet. Early's piece of 
               shit Grand Prix pulls into the lot. He gets out and walks 
               into the diner.

               INT. DINER - NIGHT

               The place is almost empty. Early, still wet from the rain, 
               walks to the counter and sits down. He calls out to the 
               kitchen.

                                     EARLY
                         Coffee and a bowl of chili, please.

                                     WAITRESS (O.S.)
                         ...Be right there.

               The only other customer is an OLD MAN, sitting at the counter 
               nearby nursing a cup of coffee. His face half hidden under a 
               rain soaked hat. Early selects a tune from the countertop 
               juke box.

               OLD MAN'S POV

               Out of the corner of his eye he sees a bug (from the concrete 
               block) crawl out of Early's sleeve and onto the counter.

                                     OLD MAN
                              (from beneath his 
                              shadowy brim...)
                         The Antichrist'll be a woman, in a 
                         man's body. Seven heads and seven 
                         tails.

               Early gazes at the Old Man curiously, then calls out to the 
               waitress...

                                     EARLY
                         Make that to go.

               Early notices the small bug crawling across the counter. He 
               leans closer to it and watches it. After a moment, he THWACKS 
               it off the counter with his thumb and finger. The bug lands 
               on the hot iron griddle with a SIZZLE!

               EARLY glances at the Old Man again... then scoots over one 
               stool closer to him. Early seems curious to want to get a 
               glimpse under the brim of the Old Man's hat.

               IN THE BACK KITCHEN AREA

               The waitress is bagging Early's order to go... when the front 
               door slams shut!

               FRONT DINING AREA

               The waitress re-enters the room. It's empty. Neither the Old 
               Man nor Early are there. With Early's food in hand, she makes 
               her way along the rear of the counter toward the front door. 
               She glances around curiously. On the griddle, the remains of 
               something black and charred smoulders. Closer to the entrance, 
               she stares at the front door. The sign that hangs in its 
               window has been turned... the backside which faces her reads 
               "OPEN."

               AT THE FRONT DOOR

               She wonders about the sign for a moment, then stares curiously 
               out the window... not a soul in sight. She locks the door 
               and begins closing up for the night. She turns to make her 
               way to the rear of the diner then notices something. Slowly 
               she moves along the side wall, past a number of highbacked 
               booths.

               HER POV

               Sitting on one of the funky old leather seats in a booth are 
               a pair of RED HIGH HEELED SHOES (the same pair worn earlier 
               by the Pretty Teenage Girl). The Waitress glances nervously 
               about the interior. No one in sight.

               AT THE BOOTH

               She reaches down slowly and picks up the pair of shoes. Looks 
               at them closely. Stares at the inside lining. Then suddenly 
               out of the quiet... a voice.

                                     EARLY
                         ...Size 6.

               The Waitress spins a startled look to the booth beyond hers! 
               Early leans out from behind the highback partition.

                                     EARLY
                         That's right ain't it, size 6?

               The Waitress... smiles, nods shyly.

                                     EARLY
                         Happy birthday Adele.

                                     ADELE
                         Early, you are so sweet.

               This is ADELE CORNERS. She's 17, pretty, uneducated and 
               Early's girlfriend. She steps over to him, gives him a kiss, 
               then sits down on the seat across from him. She starts to 
               try on her new shoes.

                                     ADELE
                         I feel kind of like the wizard of 
                         oz, you know when she gets the red 
                         shoes.

                                     EARLY
                         Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me 
                         that chili there.

               She passes the bag to Early. He digs in. Between bites, he 
               glances over to Adele who's enthusiastically pulling on the 
               new shoes.

               INT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S LOFT APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

               A door swings open spilling light into a darkened room. Brian 
               and Carrie, a little drunk, return home from the party.

               Their apartment is in an old converted industrial building 
               in a funky low rent part of town.

               Brian walks ahead, Carrie trails behind him, peeling off her 
               clothes. She begins unzipping her dress, unnoticed by Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Tonight turned out to be pretty 
                         interesting.

                                     CARRIE
                         The party?

               She grabs a leather cap that sits on a chair.

                                     BRIAN
                         The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.

                                     CARRIE
                         It was definitely the high point of 
                         the evening.

               Carrie's dress falls to the floor.

                                     BRIAN
                              (getting excited)
                         Just being there where it really 
                         happened. It was different... more 
                         visceral.

                                     CARRIE
                         Mmm... I love it when you talk like 
                         that.

               Brian is at the foot of the bed, he turns to see... Carrie 
               has transformed. She has stripped down to her black bra and 
               panties, fishnet stockings, a nightporter style leather cap. 
               A surprised Brian stands there a moment. Looking at Carrie. 
               She looks great.

               OMITTED

               Carrie pushes Brian back onto the bed.

               Carrie climbs on top of him. She kisses his neck. Slowly 
               starts working her lips across his chest and down his stomach.

               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - MORNING

               A solitary trailer sits alongside a run down house.

               INT. EARLY'S TRAILER - MORNING

               Through the soot tinged atmosphere, sunlight filters in past 
               the curtained windows. Early is lying face down in bed, his 
               right arm extended over the side. Adele is in the kitchen 
               half dressed, and unsuccessfully attempting to iron one of 
               Early's shirts. She realizes the iron is out of water, she 
               sets it down and steps to the sink and fills a glass with 
               water. As she does she glances at a cactus on the counter.

                                     ADELE
                         You thirsty Lucy?

               OMITTED

               She waters her small cactus (Lucy).

                                     ADELE
                         Bet that feels good, don't it?

               NEW ANGLE - THE REFRIGERATOR

               Adele smiles then notices that a photo held to the fridge by 
               a decorative magnet has fallen to the floor. She picks it 
               up.

                                     ADELE
                         Now if that ain't Momma's little 
                         angel.

               Adele puts it back onto the fridge. It is a photo of a young 
               Early with his mother. In the photo Early appears to be about 
               ten or eleven. he stands next to his mother. Her arm is draped 
               over his shoulders, she is holding a drink. A cigarette butt 
               dangles between her fingers. Nearby a portable radio is tuned 
               to music, when the local radio jingle comes on and segues to 
               the news.

               NEW ANGLE ON EARLY

               A handkerchief bandana is tied around his head and over his 
               eyes.

               The NEWSCASTER'S voice gets louder.

                                     NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                         ...two more victims last night, when 
                         a twenty pound rock smashed through 
                         the windshield of their car...

               CLOSER - EARLY'S FACE

               Slowly he reaches to his face and lifts the bandana up off 
               one eye. Even closer on his left eyelid. It flutters... pops 
               open and blinks. Now... his eyeball stares right at us. The 
               pitch black pupil contracts in the morning light. The 
               newscaster's voice continues to amplify...

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         This was the third such attack in 
                         the past month and while an extensive 
                         police operation is underway... no 
                         arrests have yet been made.

               The newscaster's voice quickly fades away. Early calmly closes 
               his eyes and drifts back to sleep.

               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE MORNING

               Early emerges from the trailer drinking a bottle of beer. He 
               looks around the yard, it's full of various kinds of useless 
               junk. He walks over to his car. Adele appears in the doorway 
               of the trailer in her bathrobe.

                                     ADELE
                         Early...

               She glances around to make certain that no one's looking, 
               then 'flashes' her body to Early with a giggle.

                                     ADELE
                         Have a good one.

               Early smiles. Adele turns back into the trailer then, 
               remembers...

                                     ADELE
                         Oh... I forgot to tell you, Mr. 
                         Diebold was by again yesterday.

               Early looks at the run down house next door where Diebold 
               lives. A beat up red pick-up is parked in front.

                                     ADELE
                         He said, if he ain't got the rest of 
                         his money by the end of the month, 
                         he's gonna "kick us the...
                              (spells the word fuck 
                              to avoid saying it)
                         F-U-C-K outta here."

               Early works his jaw, thinking.

                                     EARLY
                         He said that, huh? Cursed in front 
                         of you?

               Adele nods.

                                     ADELE
                         You gonna talk to him?

               Early gets in his car.

                                     EARLY
                         If he comes back, don't answer the 
                         door.

               Early revs the raspy engine.

                                     ADELE
                         Suppose he hears me inside?

               Adele's words are unheard as Early pulls away flinging his 
               beer bottle at a couple of chained PITBULLS in Diebold's 
               front yard.

               INT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S LOFT - AFTERNOON

               Brian enters the darkened loft interior.

                                     BRIAN
                         I picked up some Chinese. Did you 
                         hear from the gallery?

               Brian turns the corner, he's immediately greeted by a series 
               of erotic images being projected on the far wall. They are 
               slides of Carrie's photographic work. In regard to the nature 
               and content of Carrie's photographic work, her photographs 
               address the sexual collision of opposites. "What if's." The 
               subjects of her photographs are hypothetical and highly 
               unlikely partners. Studies in contract. Moments of passion.

                                     BRIAN
                              (tentative)
                         You got your slides back.

               From across the room, he hears Carrie's disembodied voice. 
               He drifts toward the couch.

                                     CARRIE
                         Yeah, same old shit. Too graphic... 
                         not suitable for mass consumption... 
                         one of those... I forget. Who cares.

               Brian finds her slumped down on the couch. He sits down. 
               She's got a drink in her hand. A bottle on her lap. She 
               continues to click through the slides. As she rambles on, 
               it's obvious that she's definitely under the influence of 
               something 90 proof.

                                     CARRIE
                         Christ Brian I'm dying here... you 
                         are too, you just don't know it yet. 
                         You're too busy working on that damned 
                         thesis... And, thing is... when you 
                         finally do finish it, it's just gonna 
                         get filed away on some shelf at the 
                         University Library... then what?

               Brian can see she's upset. Drowsy from the booze. He just 
               watches her. Listens. Her words linger in his head.

                                     CARRIE
                              (continues)
                         I thought you wanted to be a writer.

                                     BRIAN
                              (quietly)
                         ...I do.

                                     CARRIE
                         Then you can write anywhere. Let's 
                         get out of here, while we still can.

                                     BRIAN
                         Carrie, come on... we can leave 
                         anytime we...

                                     CARRIE
                         No we can't. We can never leave once 
                         you start talking about tenure... 
                         and vacation pay... and parking 
                         privileges and... oh shit! let's 
                         just go to California now, right 
                         now, before it's too late.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...just like that?

                                     CARRIE
                         Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... 
                         point it West... stop when we hit 
                         the fucking ocean.

               The bold graphic sexual photographs of Carrie's continue to 
               accentuate her comments.

                                     CARRIE
                         That's half the kick anyway. Doing 
                         something you've never done before. 
                         Experiencing something... different. 
                         Something... unpredictable.

               Brian notices an envelope on the floor nearby. He picks it 
               up. Opens it. Inside, he finds the photographs Carrie took 
               at the warehouse. Interested, he shuffles through them. He 
               becomes more and more intrigued with what he sees.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...These are great.

               He glances over to Carrie... she's fallen asleep. He reaches 
               over and quietly pulls the drink glass from her hand.

               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE AFTERNOON

               Early's Grand Prix has a head of steam up as it tears across 
               the drive and hangs a hard right into his parking space next 
               to the trailer. Suddenly, Early hits the brakes hard! Another 
               car is parked there.

               INT. EARLY'S TRAILER

               Early spills through the doorway.

                                     EARLY
                         Adele, who's car's that out...

               Early spots his PAROLE OFFICER standing in the bedroom area 
               snooping around. He has a prosthetic hand which he uses to 
               search through Early's things.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         She's not here.

               The Parole Officer hiccups throughout the scene.

                                     EARLY
                         What are you doin' here? I ain't 
                         supposed to be at the Parole Office 
                         'til tomorrow, two o'clock.

               Early notices the man looking through some of his letters 
               and papers.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         Social call.

               The Parole Officer opens one of the closet doors, pilfers 
               through things inside, as if searching for something. Early 
               is getting pissed off but says nothing.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         You're supposed to call me when you 
                         lose your job Early. I stopped by 
                         the mirror factory today, you left 
                         quite a mess behind there.

                                     EARLY
                         Wasn't my fault...

               He lifts his crudely bandaged middle finger.

                                     EARLY
                         ...It was dangerous there and they 
                         treated me like shit.

               Parole Officer steps over to the refrigerator, opens it, 
               snoops around inside.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                              (swallows a hiccup)
                         Yeah... Well you never have been 
                         'treated right'... Have you?
                              (hiccup)
                         Your father was pickin' on you when 
                         he threw you out of the house for 
                         stealing the tires off his truck. 
                         The Marines misunderstood you when 
                         they gave you that dishonorable 
                         discharge.

               He finishes with the refrigerator and continues his search 
               through the drawers and cabinets of the trailer.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                              (hiccup)
                         ...The police were way out of line 
                         when they stopped you from beating 
                         that bartender half to death. And no 
                         doubt God'll be pickin' on you on 
                         Judgement Day...

                                     EARLY
                         I ain't got nothing against God. 
                         It's the people he let come into the 
                         world... lot of them should have 
                         been stopped at the door. What are 
                         you looking for?

               The Parole Officer ignores the question. He steps up to a 
               sink overflowing with dirty dishes.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         That girlfriend of yours ain't much 
                         for housekeeping, is she.

               Early dismisses the place with a glance.

                                     EARLY
                         I'm thinking about moving...

               Early opens the refrigerator, grabs a bottle of beer.

                                     EARLY
                         Maybe down to Texas... Probably get 
                         some work on them offshore oil rigs. 
                         Hear the pay's good... hell, the 
                         weather's got to be better'n here.

               Early sits down at the table. The Parole Officer steps over 
               to him.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         What are you talking about? You know 
                         you can't leave the state.
                              (hiccup)
                         What you can do is get a job.

               The Parole Officer pulls a slip of paper from his shirt 
               pocket, sets it on the table.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         You be at this personnel office, 
                         Friday, three o'clock sharp.

                                     EARLY
                         What is it?

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         ...Janitor's job.

                                     EARLY
                         Oh man... come on, I don't want no 
                         janitor job.

               Early lifts his beer for another drink. The Parole Officer's 
               prosthetic hand snaps tight around the neck of the beer 
               bottle, just inches from Early's lips.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         Hey, I don't give two shits about 
                         what you want or don't want... I'm 
                         telling you to be there Friday, three 
                         o'clock sharp or the sheriff will be 
                         here for dinner. You understand?

               With that Early looks up at the man, almost defiantly, then 
               stands up. The Parole Officer hiccups again. Early stares at 
               him for a moment.

                                     EARLY
                         You oughta think about putting a bag 
                         over your head... Might cure them 
                         hiccups.

               The Parole Officer shakes his head in disgust and walks out 
               of the trailer to his car.

               BRIAN'S DESK IN ANOTHER PART OF LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Brian's in the midst of working his way through pages and 
               pages of thesis notes scattered atop his desk. Using 
               chopsticks he shovels Chinese straight out of the carton as 
               he studies Carrie's warehouse photographs.

               CARRIE'S POV

               As we approach Brian from behind, moving closer, closer.

               NEW ANGLE - BRIAN'S DESK

               Carrie steps up behind him. She's rubbing her eyes, having 
               just awakened. A hangover beckons. Brian notices her.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake 
                         you.

                                     CARRIE
                         Thanks. What are you doing?

                                     BRIAN
                         Well, I sat down with my tapes and 
                         your photographs, which are great by 
                         the way... and I started writing.

               Carrie grabs his container of Chinese and takes a few bites. 
               Listens.

                                     CARRIE
                         So how's it going?

                                     BRIAN
                         ...I think it's the best stuff I've 
                         done.

               Carrie glances over his shoulder at his writing.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...and I think I know why.

                                     CARRIE
                         Why?

                                     BRIAN
                         Because I was there. And for a moment 
                         that night I understood how she came 
                         to pull the trigger.

                                     CARRIE
                              (sarcastic)
                         This mean your finally going to finish 
                         your thesis?

                                     BRIAN
                         Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's 
                         a book here. Your photographs and my 
                         research, together.

                                     CARRIE
                         A book on the warehouse murders?

                                     BRIAN
                         A book on some of the most infamous 
                         murderers in America. I want to go 
                         to where they lived and where they 
                         killed and I want you to photograph 
                         it.

               Brian reaches down to the floor and pulls a large map of the 
               United States up and lays it out on his desk. He traces a 
               route West. Along the way, specific locations have been 
               circled.

                                     BRIAN
                         What I'm thinking is, we can drop 
                         down through Tennessee, across 
                         Arkansas and into Texas, from there 
                         it's a straight shot into California.
                              (pause)
                         "We don't stop... until we hit the 
                         fucking ocean."

               OMITTED

                                     CARRIE
                         It's about fucking time, Kessler! 
                         I'd just about given up on you.

                                     BRIAN
                         We don't have enough money, but we'll 
                         figure something out.

               Carrie steps up to Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...It's either the best idea I've 
                         had in a long time... or there's way 
                         too much MSG in this stuff.

               Brian looks at the container of Chinese in his hand. Carrie 
               takes it from him, sets it down on the road map. Kisses him.

               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - DAWN

               Early exits the trailer and climbs into his Grand Prix.

               INT. GRAND PRIX

               Early tries to get the engine to tick over. Then... He sees 
               JOHN DIEBOLD, his landlord, emerge from his house and begin 
               lumbering toward the Grand Prix. The two panting ugly-ass 
               pitbulls trot alongside their master.

                                     DIEBOLD
                              (shouts)
                         Hold on a minute there boy!

                                     EARLY
                         Shit!

               Early tries the engine again. Still won't start. Diebold, 
               getting closer. The dogs are barking.

                                     DIEBOLD
                         Goddamit, you're gonna settle up 
                         that rent here and now.

               Hurriedly, Early tries the engine one more time. It starts. 
               Grinning from ear to ear, Early pulls away before Diebold 
               and his dogs reach him.

               Pissed, Diebold grabs a rock and hurls it, hitting Early's 
               car.

               The car stops, dead in its tracks.

                                     DIEBOLD
                         I've had it with your bullshit boy. 
                         I want my money.

               INT. GRAND PRIX

               Early looks in the rear-view mirror and sees... Diebold 
               standing there confrontational.

               Early throws the gearshift into reverse...

               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER

               Tires screeching, the car surges toward Diebold and the dogs. 
               Scared shitless... Diebold begins back peddling. Confused, 
               the pitbulls bark, then follow suit.

               Early laughs as he stalks Diebold.

               Diebold jumps out of the way of the Grand Prix just as it 
               pulverizes his portable barbecue.

               Early shifts it into drive and barrels out of the drive.

               NEW ANGLE - DIEBOLD

               As soon as the Grand Prix is out of sight...

                                     DIEBOLD
                              (hollering)
                         You sonofabitch! Come back here!

               Furious, he turns to find Adele staring at him from the window 
               of her trailer.

                                     DIEBOLD
                         That's it! You tell him... I want 
                         you both the fuck out of here by 
                         Sunday or I'm gonna call the Police.

               Adele starts laughing, she tries to hide it with her hand.

                                     DIEBOLD
                         ...You won't be laughing come Sunday 
                         little girl.

               Muttering to himself, he turns back toward his house. He 
               then notices what Adele is laughing at. One pitbull is trying 
               to hump the other.

                                     DIEBOLD
                         Elvis! Get the fuck off him!

               NEW ANGLE - ADELE

               Peering out at him from the trailer window laughing at the 
               dogs.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - UNIVERSITY

               Brian pulls up in his BLACK '62 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL. The 
               suicide doors and leather interior have seen better days. 
               Brian locks his car and walks into the building.

               INT. LOBBY OF THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - AFTERNOON

               Brian steps up to a large bulletin board. He sees several 
               'Ride-Share' notes to various cities on the board. He pins a 
               Ride-Share note onto the board. We see the note is headlined 
               in red - "CALIFORNIA"

                                     CAROL
                         You know, they say one of these 
                         days...

               Brian glances over his shoulder.

                                     BRIAN
                              (sarcastic)
                         ...the whole thing's going to slide 
                         into the ocean... Yeah, I know.

               Carol peers over Brian's shoulder and reads the note.

                                     CAROL
                         "Looking for someone to take turns 
                         at the wheel and share expenses... 
                         on a week long cross country blue-
                         highways tour of historic murder 
                         sites..."
                              (beat)
                         You gotta be kidding. Who in their 
                         right mind would want to do that?

                                     BRIAN
                         ...I would.

               Brian smiles at her and walks away.

                                     CAROL
                              (watching Brian walk 
                              away)
                         Like I said...

               She shakes her head.

                                     EARLY
                         Where's the personnel office at?

               Carol turns to see Early.

                                     RITA
                              (points down the hall)
                         First door on the left.

               She walks away. Early's eye catches the bulletin board, he 
               sees in bold red marker - "CALIFORNIA."

               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE THAT NIGHT

               Adele steps out of the trailer.

                                     ADELE
                         Early?

               She walks carefully around the junk piles. It's dark; hard 
               to see. She comes to the edge of a deep dark hole and peers 
               in... She can't see anything but hears the rustling of a 
               shovel digging.

                                     ADELE
                         Early? You down there?

               The sound of digging stops.

                                     EARLY
                              (from inside the hole)
                         What's up Adele? Dinner ready?

                                     ADELE
                         Almost.

               After a moment's hesitation, Early resumes his digging.

                                     ADELE
                         Early...

               The digging stops again.

                                     ADELE
                         Tell me more about California.

               The moonlight illuminates his face when he looks up at her.

                                     EARLY
                         Well... for one thing... They think 
                         faster out there, on account of all 
                         that warm weather they got; cold 
                         weather makes people stupid, that's 
                         a fact.

                                     ADELE
                         I guess that'd explain why there's 
                         so many stupid people around here.

                                     EARLY
                         Yeah, and in California you never 
                         have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on 
                         the trees everywhere you turn...

                         limit out there, and all drugs are 
                         legal... And I heard your first 
                         month's rent is free; state law. I 
                         figure 'til we get settled we can 
                         just move around month to month...

                                     ADELE
                         What'll we do out there?

                                     EARLY
                         Well... the very first thing we're 
                         gonna do... is get us a couple of 
                         six packs of Lucky Lager and climb 
                         up on toppa' that famous Hollywood 
                         sign and howl at the moon...

               Early lets out a playful howl, as Adele looks up over her 
               shoulder at the moon.

                                     ADELE
                         You know... I read once... Ain't 
                         nothin' on that big old moon 'cept 
                         some old golf balls those astronauts 
                         left behind.

                                     EARLY
                         Bull. That ain't right... Government 
                         sends people there all the time, 
                         just don't want us to know about it.

               Adele smiles and begins walking back to the trailer.

                                     ADELE
                         Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout 
                         ready.

                                     EARLY
                         I heard that.

               After a moment, Early climbs out of the hole and stands in 
               the moonlight for a moment. We see that he's completely naked 
               except for a pair of high top steel toed work boots. Early 
               gazes up into the night sky, looking at the cold white moon.

               EXT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S LOFT - DAWN

               Brian exits loft carrying two bags. Carrie is also carrying 
               a bag, and smoking a cigarette, as they walk to the car.

                                     CARRIE
                         What did he sound like on the phone?

                         Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'

               Brian throws the bags in the open trunk with the other bags.

                                     BRIAN
                              (grins)
                         I like that.

                         I still think we should have met 
                         them first.

                                     BRIAN
                         Beggars can't be choosers. They were 
                         the only ones who answered the ride 
                         share note, remember?

               Carrie bows her head and folds her hands in mock prayer.

                                     CARRIE
                         Please God, we're gonna be stuck 
                         with these people for a week, don't 
                         let them be as boring as Brian's 
                         friends. Anything... but that.

               Brian throws a needling glance to Carrie and slams the car 
               hood shut. They both get into the car, Brian behind the wheel.

                         right outta "Deliverance."
                              (quotes from the movie)
                         "Still? Who said anything about a

                         Funny, very funny.

               Brian starts the car. It backfires loudly startling Carrie. 
               Brian laughs.

                                     BRIAN

               EXT. LINCOLN ON STREET

               The engine revs again and the Lincoln pulls away down the 
               street.

               EXT. BUS STATION - DAWN

               PAN UP from Adele's new red high-heeled shoes. We hear Adele 
               speaking with an unfamiliar tone of authority to her voice.

                                     ADELE
                         We shouldn't be doin' this, Early. 
                         You leavin' the state, ridin' around 
                         with strangers... besides, what kinda 
                         people would want to stop at places 
                         where other people was murdered.

               The camera slowly reveals Adele... and the fact that she is 
               alone as she voices her concerns. Then from behind her Early 
               approaches. Just in time to hear...

                                     ADELE
                         What if they're dangerous?

                                     EARLY
                         They ain't dangerous Adele. They're 
                         writers.

               Startled, Adele drops her shoulder bag. It lands on top of a 
               couple of cardboard boxes and a beat up old duffle bag -- 
               all their possessions. A few personal items spill out of it.

                                     ADELE
                         Early Grayce!

               She kneels down to pick things up.

                                     ADELE
                              (changes subject)
                         Did you settle things with Mr. 
                         Diebold?

                                     EARLY
                         Yeah I left him with the car... We're 
                         all squared up now.

               EARLY'S POV

               As Adele picks up her spilled personal possessions, Early 
               notices her prized cactus in the bag.

                                     EARLY
                         What's this?

               He angrily reaches in and grabs it.

                                     ADELE
                         Early!

               She reaches for the cactus but misses.

                                     EARLY
                         What kind of a person would carry a 
                         cactus in her purse!

               Adele bites her lip almost crying. Suddenly, Early looks 
               past Adele to see something, Adele turns too.

               NEW ANGLE

               The Lincoln comes gliding into view.

               INT. LINCOLN - PULLS INTO BUS STATION - DAWN

               Through the windshield we see Early... Adele by his side.

                                     CARRIE
                         You've got to be kidding me, they 
                         look like Okies!

               Brian honks the horn, Early waves back.

                                     CARRIE
                         Jesus... They've probably got five 
                         bucks between them. Turn around.

                         Lighten up...

               ON EARLY AND ADELE

                                     ADELE
                         Geez, they look kinda weird.

                                     EARLY
                         You just smile, let me do all the 
                         talking.

                                     ADELE
                         How many times you gonna tell me 
                         that?

                                     EARLY
                              (smiling at Brian)
                         As many times as it takes.

               EXT. BUS STATION

               Brian stops the Lincoln and gets out. He approaches Early 
               and shakes his hand, then Adele's.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hi I'm Brian... Early, and you must 
                         be Adele.

               An awkward moment as everyone just stands there... until 
               Brian reaches for Adele's bag.

                                     BRIAN
                         Let me help you.

               Brian picks up her bag and carries it to the Lincoln. Adele 
               is instantly won over by the gesture -- Early leery of it.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Carrie watches as Brian and Early carry their things to the 
               trunk. Carrie leans forward and sets the trip odometer to 
               zero. When she sits back up, Adele is standing at her window.

                                     ADELE
                         Hi, I'm Adele.

                         Carrie.

               She turns away from the window...

                                     ADELE
                              (shyly)
                         I like your hair.

               Carrie turns back, rolls down window...

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Pardon?

                                     ADELE
                         ...I said, I like your hair.

                         ...Thank you.

               She turns and sees Early reflected in the side mirror watching 
               her. He grins at her, Carrie looks away.

               NEW ANGLE: FROM INSIDE THE TRUNK OF THE LINCOLN

               Brian crams the last of the bags in, as Early watches.

                         Best kind.

               Brian looks to him, Early grins and winks. Brian slams the 
               Lincoln trunk lid shut.

               From the blackness... The camera rises from a pile of rubble. 
               As it ascends we reveal Diebold's pitbulls howling and digging 
               at a mound of fresh earth where Early's hole used to be.

               The crackling flames of a nearby fire illuminate the scene. 
               Deep in the distance, the wail of approaching sirens.

               On the Lincoln as it exits the Bus Station. The camera 
               descends toward a lone trash can, to find there, lying amidst 
               the debris inside... Adele's cactus.

               The Lincoln passes through on its way out of town.

               Brian behind the wheel, Carrie riding shotgun. Early and 
               Adele are sitting in the back seat. An awkward silence 
               prevails. Brian clears his throat.

                                     BRIAN
                         Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and 
                         Adele haven't had time for breakfast, 
                         Early.

                                     EARLY
                         Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.

                         Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't 
                         eat much in the mornin', never have. 
                         Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky 
                         Lager's my favorite.

               Brian raises his eyebrow a tad, but is not really curious 
               about it.

                                     ADELE
                         It's because of what he read in a 
                         book once... That folks needin' 
                         breakfast is a myth, or whatever, 
                         put out by those cereal people.

               A glance passes between Brian and Carrie. Is she for real?

                         Karma.

               Adele and early show no sign of understanding the word.

                                     ADELE
                         What?

                                     CARRIE
                         Karma...
                              (beat)
                         You know, if you do something bad to 
                         somebody fate will pay you back by 
                         something bad happening to you.

                                     ADELE
                         That French ain't it?

               Carrie glances at the odometer on the dash... THE FIRST MILE 
               clicks over.

               EXT. LINCOLN - OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY

               Everyone takes a last look at the familiar countryside. Carrie 
               is snapping photos of the twisting concrete overpasses and 
               the gloomy grey sky beyond.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Adele watches Carrie, intrigued by the obvious skill Carrie 
               shows with the camera. Brian glances into the rear-view mirror 
               at Adele.

                                     BRIAN
                         So Adele, did Early happen to mention 
                         the places we'll be stopping at?

               ON ADELE'S REFLECTION IN MIRROR... then Early leans in front 
               of her.

                                     EARLY
                         Yeah Bri' I did.

               Adele leans against Carrie's front seat.

                                     ADELE
                              (to Carrie)
                         Are you takin' the pictures?

                                     CARRIE
                              (surprised)
                         ...Yeah.

                                     ADELE
                         Is it hard to learn?

                                     CARRIE
                         Not really.

               Early pulls Adele back toward the back seat.

                                     EARLY
                              (to Brian)
                         You gonna talk to the people who did 
                         those murders?

                                     BRIAN
                         That's a good idea. Unfortunately 
                         most of them have been executed.

                                     EARLY
                         ...Too bad.

               EXT. LINCOLN

               Lincoln drives off down the highway.

               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATER

               Police and Firemen sift through the smoking ruins of Early's 
               trailer. The Parole Officer pulls up in his car, he gets out 
               and approaches a Police Officer.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         What happened?

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         Who are you?

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         His Parole Officer.

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         Right, I talked to you on the phone. 
                         They say it's a torch job, that sound 
                         like your boy?

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         Could be.

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         Where would we find him?

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch 
                         said he was thinking of moving to 
                         Texas.

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         Without his car?

               We see the smoldering remains of Early's Grand Prix. In the 
               background Diebold's pitbulls are being dragged away by a 
               Dog Wrangler.

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         What about the owner of the house...
                              (reads from note pad)
                         ...this John Diebold, any idea where 
                         he might be?

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         No, but I can tell you he's not gonna 
                         be too happy about this.

               From inside Early's hole we hear a voice call out.

                                     LABORER (O.S.)
                         Jesus Christ!

               Parole Officer and Police Officer turn back toward the 
               trailer, as people rush to the site.

               NEW ANGLE - OVERHEAD

               The camera aerials down past those gathering around the 
               freshly dug hole to... a Laborer standing at the bottom of 
               the pit. Alongside his shovel, we see that a man's arm has 
               been unearthed.

               LOW ANGLE UP TO THE TOP OF THE HOLE

               The Police and Parole Officer join several others standing 
               there.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         ...Diebold?

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         ...That'd be my guess.

                                     PAROLE OFFICER
                         Looks like somebody cut off his ring 
                         finger.

                                     POLICE OFFICER
                         Well now I'd say that's the least of 
                         Mr. Diebold's problems.

               The two men look to one another... as others begin to unearth 
               the body.

               EXT. MOVING LINCOLN DRIVING DOWN COUNTRY ROAD

               Close up, Diebold's ring on a hand twisting open a bottle 
               cap. Pull back to reveal that it is Early as he opens a bottle 
               of Lucky Lager beer and takes a sip. On the back seat between 
               them sits a brown paper bag. Adele reaches into the bag and 
               pulls out a cheap pocket camera. Excitedly she rips open the 
               box and pulls out the camera. She leans over and kisses Early.

                                     ADELE
                         Thank you.

               Early reaches in the bag and pulls out a small plastic bottle 
               of mineral water and an orange juice.

                                     EARLY
                         All right, who gets the...
                              (can't pronounce name)
                         ...water.

               Carrie turns around, Early hands her the water. Early leans 
               forward and hands Brian the orange juice.

                                     EARLY
                         Here you go Bri'. Got a couple a 
                         bags of chips and some jerky, just 
                         holler if you want some.

               Then Early reaches past Brian to the rear-view mirror and 
               hangs a plastic St. Christopher statue around it.

                                     EARLY
                         Can't hurt.

                                     BRIAN
                         How much do I owe you?

                                     EARLY
                         Forget it.

               Adele struggles to understand the camera instructions on the 
               side of the box. She leans forward and shows Carrie her 
               camera.

                                     ADELE
                              (embarrassed)
                         Guess I don't know the first thing 
                         about cameras.

               Carrie deliberates her response for a moment, then...

                                     CARRIE
                         Well, the first thing... is you need 
                         film. Preferably black and white.

               Carrie pulls a roll of film out of her bag and takes Adele's 
               camera to load.

                                     ADELE
                         You wouldn't have any color film, 
                         would ya?

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Yeah, sure.

               She pulls a roll of color film out of her camera bag and 
               quickly snaps it into the camera.

                                     ADELE
                         I like things in color, pink, purple, 
                         and red. I dunno, black and white is 
                         kinda... boring.

               Carrie points the camera at a smiling Adele and snaps the 
               first picture.

                                     CARRIE
                         You just aim and press the button.

               Adele takes the camera.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Adele focuses her camera at the scenery out the side window 
               of the car.

                                     ADELE
                         Look, Pigeon Forge!

               ADELE'S POV

               Road sign to Pigeon Forge.

               EXT. LINCOLN

               Adele leans out the side rear window to get a better view.

                                     ADELE
                         I've heard of that! It's where Dolly 
                         Parton has her park. "Dollywood". I 
                         just think that's so clever. 
                         Hollywood. Dollywood. Get it?

               With that, she plops back down into the back seat.

               INT. LINCOLN

                                     EARLY
                              (under his breath)
                         Shush, Adele.

                                     ADELE
                         Early, can we stop there... just for 
                         a little while.

               EXT. HIGHWAY

               As we see the car disappearing into the distance, we can 
               still hear Adele rambling on.

                                     ADELE (O.S.)
                         ...I've always wanted to go there... 
                         It could be such fun.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. LARGE ISOLATED OLD FARM - AFTERNOON

               The Lincoln approaches on a dirtroad and passes a mailbox 
               with the name "BAXTER" on it. The Lincoln turns into the 
               long driveway.

               INT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME

               Brian begins talking into a small portable tape recorder.

                                     BRIAN
                         The Novaks are all gone but the fence 
                         that Michael Zaruba was hired to put 
                         up is still here.

               He glances to Carrie, who fires off several photos of the 
               fence and yard.

               The Lincoln continues slowly down the long drive... Up ahead 
               through the windshield Brian sees a beautiful old farm house.

                                     BRIAN
                         The Novaks embraced the young drifter 
                         as one of their own.

               EXT. LINCOLN

               The Lincoln slows to a halt. Carrie and Brian exit the car 
               and begin walking toward the house. Early follows. Adele, 
               uncertain about what's transpiring, trails behind.

                                     ADELE
                         Hey you two.

               Brian and Carrie turn to see... Adele training a camera on 
               them.

                                     ADELE
                         Give me a smile now.

               Brian and Carrie look to one another then force a weak smile. 
               Early jumps in and throws a pair of devil's horns up behind 
               Brian's unsuspecting head as... the shutter clicks.

               Brian and Carrie quickly turn their attention back on the 
               house.

                                     BRIAN
                              (continues into tape 
                              recorder)
                         Neighbors said he was a quiet young 
                         man, who was often seen pushing the 
                         children on the swing set.

               An unusual bird house and a tricycle sit in the front yard. 
               To the side of the house are the remains of an old swing 
               set. Carrie finds an interesting angle on the swing set, 
               with the house in the background, SNAP! She fires off a shot.

                                     BRIAN
                              (continuing)
                         Everything was fine until the day 
                         the family ran out of work for 
                         Michael, and had to ask him to leave.

               As Carrie frames up another shot, Early crosses in front of 
               her camera. Realizing he is in Carrie's photo he stops and 
               poses. Carrie looks to Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Sorry, Early... Could you step out 
                         the way, for a second?

               Early is surprised that they don't want him in the photograph. 
               He wanders away from the front of the house. Meanwhile, Adele 
               photographs the moment.

                                     BRIAN
                         The first one to die was the nine 
                         year old daughter...

               Just then... A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL comes running from around 
               the side of the house. She stops dead when she sees all of 
               them. Carrie snaps a final photo.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hello.

               The little girl scans all their faces.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...My name's Brian, what's yours?

               The little girl remains silent. Brian rolls a look to Carrie 
               then back to the little girl.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...Could I speak to your parents?

               After an awkward pause, the little girl silently crosses the 
               yard to the porch and opens the front door.

                                     GIRL
                              (rudely)
                         Pa! There's more of them.

               EXT. REAR OF HOUSE - SAME TIME

               Looking into the house through a kitchen window we can see 
               into the entrance hall and through to the open front door. 
               Brian waits outside on the porch, as the little girl enters 
               the house looking for her father. Inside the kitchen, right 
               next to the window, is a side table with a telephone and a 
               purse on it.

               Suddenly... Early's reflection appears in the window; he has 
               obviously seen the purse.

               AT THE FRONT DOOR

               Brian motions for Carrie to join him.

               AT THE SWING SET

               Adele watches Brian and Carrie for a moment, then loses 
               interest. She stands on the seat of the swing and begins 
               swinging.

               AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE

               Early tries to push up the kitchen window. It barely lifts 
               three inches before jamming. Through the room we see the 
               little girl and her father step to the front door.

               EXT. FRONT DOOR

               A MIDDLE AGED FARMER with tanned leathery skin. He is not 
               happy. Brian extends his hand...

                                     BRIAN
                              (friendly)
                         Hi, my name is Brian Kessler.

               The father says nothing and does not respond to the extended 
               hand. Brian retracts his hand.

                                     BRIAN
                              (continues -- less 
                              confident)
                         I'm a writer, I'm working on a book 
                         about famous murderers.

               AT THE SWING SET

               Adele swings higher. Her summer dress ripples in the wind. A 
               smile on her face.

               EXT. KITCHEN WINDOW

               Early's entire arm is through the opening. His shoulder 
               presses against the window pane. But still he can't reach 
               the purse. So, he grabs the tablecloth and begins pulling it 
               toward him. The purse slides closer, inch by inch. All the 
               while, he keeps one eye on the Farmer across the room.

               EARLY'S POV (ACROSS THE ROOM) The Farmer's back is turned to 
               the kitchen as he listens silently to Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...I'm sure you're aware that this 
                         is the Novak house...

               AT THE SWING SET

               Adele swings even higher. She's lost in the moment. Euphoric.

               EXT. FRONT DOOR

                                     BRIAN
                              (corrects himself)
                         ...I mean, this was the Novak house...
                              (pause)
                         With your permission I'd like to 
                         come in and photograph...

               Before Brian can finish, the man slams the door in his face.

               INT. KITCHEN (ANGLE ON FARMER)

               The Farmer turns away from the front door.

                                     FARMER
                              (muttering)
                         Goddamned ghouls...

               IN THE KITCHEN

               We see that Early and the purse have gone.

               EXT. FRONT DOOR

               Brian is surprised. He just stands there a moment. He's not 
               sure whether to knock again.

               EXT. SWING SET

               The empty swing sways back and forth.

               EXT. LINCOLN

               Brian and Carrie walk back to the car.

                                     BRIAN
                              (upset)
                         We could have been in and out of 
                         there in less than ten minutes...

                                     CARRIE
                         Hey, I got some great stuff... it's 
                         okay.

               Brian continues on in a huff until Carrie breaks stride and 
               stops. She pulls him next to her.

                                     CARRIE
                         It's okay... okay?

               Brian glances back at the house. She interrupts his glance, 
               kisses him.

                                     BRIAN
                              (continuing on the 
                              heel of the kiss)
                         ...That house is part of American 
                         history now, whether he likes it or 
                         not.

               They enter the car.

                                     EARLY
                         Forget about it Bri'. I wouldn't be 
                         surprised if that Karma thing don't 
                         come back and get him.

               Carrie, surprised at Early's new found philosophical belief. 
               She looks into her side view mirror... And sees Early smiling 
               back at her. Carrie looks away...

               CARRIE'S POV

               Shifts from the mirror to the house in the background... as 
               the car pulls out of the driveway, the little girl watches 
               from her porch.

               EXT. - LINCOLN PULLS UP TO MOTEL AND PARKS.

               INT. MOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A small roadside diner. A fair number of people inside having 
               dinner. Adele, Early, Carrie, and Brian are seated at one of 
               the tables.

               AT THEIR TABLE

               Carrie watches Early eat with a kind of horrible, rude 
               fascination. He has no table manners at all. He eats with 
               his elbows on the table, fork wedged in the fist of his right 
               hand. All the while, he chews with his mouth open. He's 
               serious about his "eating."

                                     BRIAN
                              (studying his map)
                         Well we've come three hundred miles 
                         so far. Not a bad day's haul.

               Early doesn't bother to respond. He keeps eating.

                                     BRIAN
                         You got any family or friends in 
                         California, Early?

               CU ANGLE ON EARLY

               With a piece of bread he mops up the gravy on his plate.

                                     EARLY
                              (chewing)
                         Nope... You?

               ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE

               Early's foot itches... He tries to scratch it but it doesn't 
               do any good.

                                     BRIAN (O.S.)
                         No.

                                     ADELE (O.S.)
                         Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?

                                     CARRIE (O.S.)
                         No.

               ANGLE - THE GROUP

               As Brian folds up the map. Early takes off his boot, then 
               his well-worn sock. Carrie's look of disgust grows as Early 
               brings his foot up onto his lap and scratches it while he 
               eats. Carrie puts her fork down: dinner is over for her.

                                     ADELE
                         ...Well, least we got each other. 
                         That's somethin'.

               OMITTED

               OMITTED

               Brian looks up, sees Carrie's expression... Then what's 
               causing it... Early mops up the last bit of food on his plate. 
               He notices Brian and Carrie staring at him and slowly puts 
               his foot back down on the floor -- then the sock.

               Brian picks up the check to see the total... Starts pulling 
               his wallet out... Isn't quite sure how to bring up the tab 
               to Early.

                                     EARLY
                         Thanks Bri', I'll get the next one.
                              (prompts Adele)
                         Think it's time we hit the sack.

               Early winks at Brian, Carrie catches the wink. Early and 
               Adele get up and head for the door. Adele waves goodnight.

                                     ADELE
                              (to Carrie)
                         Sweet dreams.

               INT. CARRIE AND BRIAN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Close on Carrie, she is reflected in a mirror. Reveal, Carrie 
               wearing only a T-shirt is at the vanity angrily brushing her 
               teeth. In the bathroom next to her, a bath is running. In 
               the adjacent bedroom, Brian is in the bed working on his 
               notes.

               INT. BATHROOM

                              of water)
                         You mean because I object to having 
                         somebody take off their shoe and 
                         scratch their foot while I'm eating 
                         I'm prejudiced?

                         He can't help the way he was raised. 
                         I kinda feel sorry for him.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Carrie pauses in brushing her teeth.

                                     CARRIE
                         Feel sorry for him? Obviously you 
                         didn't get a whiff of that sock?

                                     BRIAN (O.S.)
                         Bitch, bitch, bitch!

                              (under her breath)
                         Up yours.

                                     BRIAN
                         I heard that.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Carrie finishes brushing her teeth. Secretively she gives 
               Brian the finger...

                                     BRIAN (O.S.)
                         ...heard that too.

               Carrie glances at the bath water running in the tub. It's 
               rusty brown and disgusting. She pulls the plug on the bath 
               idea.

               INT. EARLY AND ADELE'S MOTEL BATHROOM ROOM - SAME TIME

               The tap is running at the sink as Early empties the stolen 
               purse. He adds the last few coins to a small pile of cash.

                                     EARLY
                         Can you believe thirty bucks for 
                         this room... for what? A lumpy 
                         mattress, that crummy TV and a 
                         crapper.

                                     ADELE (O.S.)
                         Early, sing me a song.

               Early continues to sift through all the items from the purse.

                                     EARLY
                         Which one.

               INT. EARLY AND ADELE'S MOTEL ROOM

               Adele starts to sing a song.

               OMITTED

               Early start sing with her... As the song ends.

                                     ADELE
                              (laughs)
                         Hey can we go to that Chinese 
                         restaurant when we get to Los Angeles? 
                         You know, to see all them famous 
                         footprints?

               ON EARLY IN BATHROOM

               Early reaches down into the bottom of the purse and pulls 
               out a pair of glistening stainless steel scissors.

                                     EARLY
                         Only if they let me put mine down 
                         too.

               He stares at the scissors curiously, then switches off the 
               bathroom light.

               Brian has turned on the nightstand light. He and Carrie are

                         with somebody else.

                                     BRIAN
                         Carrie.

                                     CARRIE
                         I don't want to talk about it.

               Brian turns the light off. From the blackness...

                                     CARRIE
                         Pretty smooth how he stiffed us on 
                         dinner?

               Brian switches the light back on.

                                     BRIAN
                         He didn't stiff us. He paid for the 
                         gas remember.

               Silence... Brian reaches out for the light... when

                                     CARRIE
                         I'm telling you he's nearly broke 
                         and we're going to end up paying for 
                         those two.

               Brian decides to leave the light on. He moves closer to 
               Carrie. He slides up against her backside. He reaches for 
               her under the sheets. Kisses her neck.

                                     BRIAN
                         You finished?

               Carrie pushes her body up against his in response.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Um, maybe... maybe not.

               Brian's mouth moves down along her back. He slips beneath 
               the sheets. From the expression on her face, she obviously 
               approves... Yet she can't resist slipping in another remark...

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Um... Funky fucking sock.

               Carrie rolls over on her back. Brian moves on top of her. 
               Kisses her stomach.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...and what's with that hair? Is 
                         that grease or motor oil or what?

               Carrie reaches down and grabs two fists full of Brian's hair. 
               She pulls him to her. He slides up along her chest, kissing 
               her. Things heat up. She reaches out, grasps his arms. Pulls 
               him closer.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...you believe that tattoo? Looks 
                         like he had another girls name there 
                         and carved it out.

               Brian bites at her neck. She stops talking. His sweating 
               shoulder presses against her face. She turns her head to 
               encourage him.

               In the dresser mirror... she sees their shadowy reflections. 
               Their bodies atangle under the sheets.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...and that body odor.

               Their reflection in the mirror intrigues her. Intoxicates 
               her. His aggression excites her. She pulls him into her. The 
               metal bedframe bangs against the motel wall repeatedly as 
               they make love.

               Then slowly, the camera bisects the plaster and lumber divider 
               and emerges in the next room...

               TO FIND

               Early leaning quietly against the same wall. Listening to 
               them. As he does, he uses the scissors to cut through the 
               crusty bandage on his finger. Then, across the room he notices 
               Adele in bed asleep... the scissors stop.

               EXT. EARLY'S MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

               Early exits his motel room, opens a bottle of Lucky Lager 
               against a soda dispenser, and walks over to the motel diner.

               INT. MOTEL DINER

               Early enters the diner drinking his morning beer. Adele is 
               not with him. He spots Brian and Carrie seated opposite one 
               another in one of the booths. He walks up to their table and 
               drops down uninvited on the seat next to Carrie.

                                     BRIAN
                         Morning...

               Early lifts his beer bottle in salute.

                                     EARLY
                         Bri'.

                                     CARRIE
                         Where's Adele?

                                     EARLY
                         She wasn't feeling so good.

               The WAITRESS arrives with a menu, offers it to Early.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Breakfast?

                                     EARLY
                              (burps)
                         Nah... Don't eat breakfast. Never 
                         have.

               The Waitress notices Early's bottle of beer.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Ah sir... sir.

               She gets Early's attention.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (concerned)
                         We ah... don't have a liquor license 
                         here. So I'm afraid...

                                     EARLY
                         Well don't be, I got plenty more 
                         where this one came from.

               The Waitress gives him a curious look and walks away.

               Just then, Brian look past Early... A surprised expression 
               crosses Brian's face. Early turns to see... Adele approaching 
               the table. Her hair has been crudely chopped to resemble 
               Carrie's. It looks like shit.

                                     CARRIE
                              (at a loss for words)
                         You cut your hair.

               Adele smiles, pleased with Carrie for noticing. She sits 
               down next to Brian.

                                     ADELE
                         Early cut it.
                              (smiles at Early)
                         ...Once he gets an idea in his head 
                         there's no holding him back.

               Carrie looks to Brian curiously. Adele is distracted by a 
               small cactus on the window near the table.

                                     BRIAN
                         Nice job Early.

               Carrie notices Adele's 'new' (stolen) purse... We see the 
               wheels turning in Carrie's head. How? Where?

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               EXT. MOTEL - LATER

               Early walks toward the Lincoln. It is parked outside Brian 
               and Carrie's room. The front door is ajar, he pushes it open. 
               He sees Carrie's reflection in the bathroom mirror, she's in 
               her underwear, pulling on her jeans. Early watches her for a 
               moment. There's no mistaking what's on his mind... as his 
               eyes scan her body. Carrie pulls on her T-shirt, steps out 
               of the bathroom and sees Early just outside the door.

                                     EARLY
                         ...Need a hand with those bags?

                                     CARRIE
                         No, thanks, I can manage.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

               Carrie turns back to the dresser and gathers up the last few 
               things. She glances into the dresser mirror looking for 
               Early's reflection at the door, but he's gone. Relieved, she 
               turns the corner to grab her bags and finds Early standing 
               right there! Looking at her. He startles her.

                                     EARLY
                         I got 'em.

               He picks up her bags and walks out of the room. Carrie watches 
               him, then she steps to the doorway.

                                     BRIAN (O.S.)
                         All set?

                                     CARRIE
                              (startled)
                         Fuck!

                                     BRIAN
                         Take your time.

               CARRIE LOOKS BACK TO EARLY

               CARRIE'S POV - EXT. MOTEL

               Early places the bags in the Lincoln's trunk. Adele sees 
               Early carrying Carrie's bag, Adele looks jealous.

               EXT. MOTEL

               In the foreground Carrie's door closes.

               TO BLACK.

               EXT. LINCOLN/HIGHWAY - LATER

               Lincoln passes through frame.

               INT. MOVING LINCOLN - NOON

               Brian at wheel, Carrie next to him loading her camera. Early 
               in the back seat, Adele next to him pulls out some make up 
               from her bag, we see the little cactus from the motel lobby. 
               She begins to put on some lipstick. Early reaches into the 
               frontseat and grabs the manuscript that sits between Brian 
               and Carrie.

                                     EARLY
                              (starts to read)
                         This the book your writing?

                                     BRIAN
                         It's just a work in progress, kinda 
                         rough.

                                     EARLY
                         This guy killed a mess of people.

                                     BRIAN
                         Who?

                                     EARLY
                         Henry Lucas.

                                     BRIAN
                         Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only 
                         convicted of killing eleven but he 
                         claimed to have killed over three 
                         hundred.

                                     EARLY
                         Wonder what all them people done 
                         made him so mad?

               Brian looks to Early in his rear-view mirror.

               BANG!!

               The front tire blows... the car lurches. Brian reacts, pulling 
               the Lincoln to the side of the road in a dusty halt.

               EXT. LINCOLN/HIGHWAY - NOON

               Brian and Early unload the trunk to get to the spare tire.

               AT THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE

               Brian struggles with the wheel and the jack.

                                     EARLY
                         Here Bri' let me do that.

               Early takes over. He pulls off his shirt, jacks the car up 
               and begins replacing the wheel with ease.

                                     EARLY
                         How did he get away with it for so 
                         long anyhow?

                                     BRIAN
                         He almost always killed strangers. 
                         Spent years moving on from one place 
                         to another. That made it real hard 
                         to track him down.

               Carrie scans the landscape with her camera. She sees Adele 
               walking around a small roadside graveyard. She is reading 
               the epitaphs on the headstones. Carrie fires off a few shots. 
               Then she sees Early, she can't help but notice Early's lean 
               body. She zooms in on his muscles and prison tattoo. Click!!

               Early completes the task. Together he and Brian begin putting 
               everything back in the trunk.

               Suddenly, from behind, Adele jumps onto Early's back, 
               surprising him. He gives her a "horsey ride" around the 
               Lincoln.

               ON CARRIE

               She notices Early's wallet on the ground.

               ON EARLY AND ADELE

               She's riding him, covering his eyes playfully.

               ON CARRIE

               She picks up the wallet.

               BENEATH THE LINCOLN

               Early's feet galloping.

               ON CARRIE

               She opens the wallet to find two one dollar bills inside.

               WITH EARLY AND ADELE

               As they come around the side of the car and to a stop in 
               front of Carrie. She holds up his wallet... watches his eyes.

                                     CARRIE
                         You dropped this.

                                     ADELE
                         Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky 
                         day.

               She hands the wallet back to him. Something between them 
               goes unspoken.

               EXT. A GAS STATION - LATER THAT DAY

               The Lincoln pulls in.

               INT. LINCOLN

                                     BRIAN
                         I guess it's your turn to pay Early.

               Early nods and Brian looks over to Carrie, making sure she 
               heard. The four of them get out of the car.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Early starts toward the gas station store. He checks his 
               wallet, two dollars left. Carrie and Adele lean against the 
               car. Carrie lights up a cigarette. She watches Early to see 
               what his next move will be. Brian removes the gas cap and 
               sticks the gas pump nozzle in. It pumps away.

               CLOSE ON THE GAS METER

               It starts turning over... $$$$$ Click... Click... Click...

               EXT. GAS STATION

               (crossing the tarmac)... with Early. His face expressionless. 
               His mind racing...

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Brian walks around the Lincoln; checking the tires. Carrie 
               watches Early intently.

               CLOSE ON EARLY

               He walks toward the entrance.

               HIS POV

               Inside the store he sees a video surveillance camera. It 
               worries him. Distracts him momentarily.

               Suddenly from behind him... o.s. A car horn HONKS LOUDLY!

               Early turns to see a late model Mercedes behind him. He just 
               gazes at the driver. Aggravated, the driver leans on the 
               horn and motions Early out of his way. Early stares at the 
               man a moment longer, then steps to one side and lets the car 
               pull past him.

               WIDE ON THE GAS STATION

               A FAT MAN in his late thirties exits from behind the wheel 
               of the Mercedes. Early watches him as he takes a money clip 
               from his pocket and walks toward the entrance to the mini 
               market.

                         I used to smoke before I met Early. 
                         But he broke me of that.

               Her remark gets Carrie's attention.

                                     CARRIE
                         Broke you?

               ON EARLY

               He watches the Fat Man inside the office.

               EARLY'S POV - EXT./INT. GAS STATION

               The Fat Man pays THE ATTENDANT for gas and is handed the 
               restroom key.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Brian walks to the front of the Lincoln. He passes Carrie 
               and Adele...

                                     ADELE
                         Early don't think women should smoke 
                         or curse or drink liquor.

                                     CARRIE
                         So you don't do any of those things.

               Carrie takes a quick look to the mini-market. She's lost 
               sight of Early.

                                     ADELE
                         Better not, or Early'd whip me.

                                     CARRIE
                              (back to Adele)
                         He whips you?

               INT./EXT. BATHROOM

               The Fat Man turns the key and enters the bathroom. The door 
               starts to swing shut behind him, but...

               TWO FINGERS catch it before it does.

                                     ADELE (O.S.)
                         Only when I deserve it.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Brian lifts the hood of the Lincoln... Reaches for the 
               radiator cap.

               INT. BATHROOM

               The Fat Man is standing at the urinal. He has a ureterostomy 
               bag he's emptying, when...

               Early's hand hits the blow dryer. A whirring sound fills the 
               room. The Fat Man turns his head. Early lunges at him from 
               behind, yanks his head back and rips a switchblade across 
               his throat!

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND - CU

               A BLAST of steam from the radiator startles Brian!

               INT. BATHROOM

               The Fat Man clutches at his throat. Sees the blood on his 
               palms. He looks up in shock. Early pounds the man's head 
               into the wall.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Brian checking the oil, pulls out the dip stick.

               NEW ANGLE: CU

               Black oil runs down the metal blade.

               INT. BATHROOM

               The Fat Man falls to his knees against the urinal. His hand 
               grasping the lever. The urinal flushes. Water flows. The Fat 
               Man's blood mixes with it. The urinal overflows. The blood 
               tinged water spills onto the white tile floor. Early pries 
               the dead man's fist off the lever.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Brian slams the Lincoln's hood shut.

               Early struggles to turn the fat corpse over.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Brian steps up to the gas nozzle and pulls it out of the 
               car.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Early reaches in the dead man's pocket and removes his money 
               clip.

               The gas meter stops turning.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Early calmly washes his hands in the beat up ceramic sink. 
               He pulls a comb from his pocket and combs his hair in the 
               mirror.

               EXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND

               Brian pulls a squeegee across the front windshield. Water 
               washes the dirt away.

               Early exits the bathroom... and runs straight into Brian, 
               about to enter.

                                     EARLY
                              (friendly)
                         Hey Bri'... ah... You don't want to 
                         go in there. It's a real mess, if 
                         you know what I mean.

               Brian glances at the bathroom door. Down below, a thin stream 
               of the Fat Man's blood begins to trickle out from under the 
               door... just barely touching the toe of Brian's shoe.

                                     BRIAN
                         That bad?

                                     EARLY
                         ...Then some.

               Early puts his arm around Brian and turns him back toward 
               the car.

               AT THE CAR

               Adele takes a photo of them, approaching. The attendant steps 
               up to Carrie.

                                     ATTENDANT
                              (to Carrie)
                         Comes to twenty eight dollars.

                         Talk to him.

               Carrie points to Early. As Brian and Early approach the car, 
               Early pulls out the money clip.

                                     EARLY
                         Call it an even thirty.

               Early peels off thirty bucks from the money clip. He sees 
               Carrie watching him, Early smiles.

                                     EARLY
                         I'll drive Bri'.

               Hearing that, Carrie climbs into the back seat. Adele climbs 
               over the backrest into the frontseat.

                                     EARLY
                         Adele, get in the back.

               She climbs again into the backseat.

               Early is driving. Brian riding shotgun, is making some notes 
               in his manuscript. Adele is teaching a reluctant Carrie to 
               play a card game called "SNAP."

                                     ADELE
                         ...Hey you're good. Thought you said 
                         you never played before?

                                     CARRIE
                         I haven't... I'm a fast learner.

               ON EARLY AND BRIAN

                                     EARLY
                         ...They never caught that Black Dolya 
                         Killer, huh?

                                     BRIAN
                         Dahlia, no.

                                     EARLY
                         Now why is that?

                                     BRIAN
                         Some people think it's because he 
                         never killed again. He just 
                         disappeared back into society.

                                     EARLY
                         You don't sound too convinced 'bout 
                         that?

                                     BRIAN
                         I always thought it was the work of 
                         a serial killer. Anyone who took 
                         that much time and care bisecting 
                         another human being must have been 
                         enjoying it and would have done it 
                         again. And again. Until someone 
                         stopped him.

                                     EARLY
                         That your... "theory", ain't that 
                         what they call it?

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah.

                                     EARLY
                         You wanna hear mine?

               Carrie listens in as she continues to play cards with Adele.

                                     BRIAN
                              (amused)
                         Sure.

                                     EARLY
                         Ain't you goin' to record it?

               Brian picks up his tape recorder.

                                     BRIAN
                              (into tape)
                         Early Grayce, June twenty third.

               Brian hands Early the hand held tape recorder.

                                     EARLY
                              (into tape)
                         Well I'll just bet he's still alive. 
                         Old, livin' in some trailer park or 
                         somethin' somewhere, but still alive. 
                         Thinkin' every night 'bout what he 
                         done. Goin' over and over it in his 
                         mind. How smart he was for getting 
                         away with it.

               Carrie is chilled by the intensity of Early's remark. She 
               watches him out of the corner of her eye. SMACK! Adele's 
               hand hits the pile of cards and she wins the game. Startled, 
               Carrie turns back to Adele.

                                     ADELE
                              (to Carrie)
                         You lose!

                                     BRIAN
                              (to Early)
                         I suppose anything's possible.

               Brian puts one leg across the other and goes back to his 
               notes.

               A high angle looks down on the modest cluster of rooms below. 
               The motel sign pulses erratically in foreground. Moths flicker

               CLOSER

               The Lincoln is parked in front of Brian and Carrie's room. 
               The horn honks. Early is behind the wheel, engine running. 
               Brian steps out of the motel room.

                                     CARRIE (O.S.)
                         Hey Minnesota Fats!

               Carrie appears at the door holding her camera.

                                     CARRIE
                              (sarcastic)
                         Don't forget your key.

               She hands Brian the key.

                                     BRIAN
                         Why'd I open my big mouth?

               Brian takes the key and walks to the car.

               Carrie sees Adele standing outside her door. Brian enters 
               the Lincoln.

                                     CARRIE
                              (to Adele)
                         Why didn't you go with them?

               The Lincoln pulls away.

                                     ADELE
                         I told you how Early feels 'bout a 
                         woman drinking.

                                     CARRIE
                         How'd you meet Early?

               Carrie swings the camera around to Adele, and snaps off a 
               shot.

                                     ADELE
                              (grins)
                         I was hitchhiking' one day and he 
                         picked me up. At first I wasn't gonna 
                         get in on account of his car was in 
                         such sorry shape. I said, "I ain't 
                         never seen a white man drivin' a car 
                         like this."

               Carrie snaps another shot of Adele. Every once in a while 
               Adele feels like she should be "posing" for the shots that 
               Carrie's taking of her. So, occasionally, as she carries on 
               her conversation with Carrie, she does.

                         Hey! Wouldn't it be something if we 
                         all ended up sharing a house together 
                         in California?

               ON CARRIE

               She lowers the camera from her eye and studies Adele.

                                     CARRIE
                         You know I can fix that haircut for 
                         you, if you want?

                                     ADELE
                         You can?

               EXT. BOWLING ALLEY BAR - NIGHT

               A nondescript "joint" on the outskirts of town. American 
               cars. American pickup trucks parked outside. The Lincoln 
               pulls into foreground and parks. Early gets out of the Lincoln 
               and looks around.

                                     EARLY
                         I wonder if there's any "doors" out 
                         here?

               Brian exits the Lincoln and looks at Early questioning.

                                     EARLY
                         You know... "openings" to other 
                         dimensions.
                              (pause)
                         I read there are a lot of them out 
                         West, mostly in the desert. They say 
                         if you know what you're doing, you 
                         can travel anywhere in the Universe 
                         in a matter of seconds. Wouldn't 
                         that come in handy?

               Brian looks at him blankly. He can't think of a thing to say 
               in response. Early walks toward the entrance of the bar. 
               Brian joins him.

                                     BRIAN
                         By the way, I'm not much of a pool 
                         player.

                                     EARLY
                         Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I 
                         can teach you everything ya need ta 
                         know.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah?

                                     EARLY
                         Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few 
                         points first game.

                                     BRIAN
                         Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle 
                         me?

                                     EARLY
                         Nah... how much money have you got?

               They both laugh and enter the bar.

               CARRIE'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

               Adele is sitting in a chair in front of the dresser mirror 
               drinking a beer. Carrie is cutting her hair. In the mirror 
               Adele watches Carrie for a moment. She notices the cigarette 
               dangling from her lips.

                                     ADELE
                         How do you get your cigarette to 
                         stay there like that.

               Carrie looks in the mirror.

                                     CARRIE
                         I'm cool.

                                     ADELE
                         Could I try that?

               Carrie takes out a fresh cigarette and hands it to Adele. 
               Together they stare into the mirror with their dangling 
               cigarettes. Adele drops her cigarette, as she reaches down 
               for it she notices Carrie's portfolio.

                                     ADELE
                         What's this?

                                     CARRIE
                         It's a portfolio of my work.

                                     ADELE
                         Your pictures. Can I see 'em?

                                     CARRIE
                         Sure.

               Adele grabs the black leather binder and sets it in her lap. 
               Carrie continues to cut Adele's hair. Adele opens the binder 
               and takes a look at the first erotic image and slaps the 
               cover back down. She's embarrassed.

                                     ADELE
                         Jesus!

               Carrie watches her in amusement. After a moment, Adele 
               reconsiders, and opens the book. She gazes at the shocking 
               photograph.

                                     ADELE
                         You took this picture?

                                     CARRIE
                         Took 'em all.

               Carrie resumes cutting Adele's hair. Adele thumbs through 
               several photographs.

                                     CARRIE
                         That's me.

                                     ADELE
                         No it is not!

                                     CARRIE
                         Hold still.

                                     ADELE
                         Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early 
                         found a picture of me like that I'd 
                         be black and blue for a week.

               Adele notices Carrie's scowl in the dresser mirror. Carrie 
               stops cutting.

                                     CARRIE
                              (suddenly serious)
                         You shouldn't let him do that to 
                         you...

                                     ADELE
                         Do what?

                                     CARRIE
                         Adele... are you serious?

                                     ADELE
                              (defensive)
                         You think Early's bad to me, don't 
                         you?

                                     CARRIE
                         Yeah.

               Carrie starts cutting Adele's hair again.

                                     ADELE
                         Well... You're wrong. I ain't saying 
                         Early ain't never hit me... but he 
                         never hurt me.

               When Carrie doesn't respond, Adele grabs Carrie's scissor 
               hand and stops her from continuing. Carrie looks at Adele's 
               reflection in the dresser mirror.

                                     ADELE
                              (continues)
                         ...When I was fourteen years old 
                         three boys raped me in the back of a 
                         truck, and beat me so bad I was in 
                         bed for almost four months...
                              (beat)
                         ...I feel safe with Early, most the 
                         time he treats me pretty good. And I 
                         know he wouldn't let nothin' like 
                         that ever happen to me again...

               Carrie is speechless, Adele looks in the mirror at her new 
               haircut.

                                     ADELE
                         Hey, that ain't so bad now.

               INT. BOWLING ALLEY BAR

               The patrons are young men and women. Eighteen to thirty. The 
               River's Edge kids today. Leather. Ludes and Beer. Wasted. 
               Rowdy.

               We follow one of the waitresses through the bar... As she 
               passes by a pool table one of the players, A LARGE YOUNG 
               CRACKER, makes a grab at her...

                                     LARGE YOUNG CRACKER
                         When you gonna give me so o' that!

               She spins safely out of his reach.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Maybe when you grow up a little sonny.

               Some guys, close enough to hear her over the noise, laugh at 
               her put down. She moves on until she reaches...

               Brian standing near a small high table. Early's not with 
               him. She sets four beers down on the table. Brian tries to 
               talk to her over the music. He leans in close. His mouth to 
               her ear.

                                     BRIAN
                         These aren't Lucky Lager, I ordered 
                         Lucky Lager.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Sorry honey, 'ain't nothin Lucky 
                         around here.

               The waitress laughs. Brian smiles and glances around the 
               room. He notices the Large Young Cracker staring at him.

               ACROSS THE ROOM

               Early steps out of the bathroom and makes his way back to 
               Brian.

               NEW ANGLE ON BRIAN

               He watches the waitress disappear into the crowd, then turns 
               to find the Large Young Cracker in his face!

                                     YOUNG CRACKER
                         What did you say to her city boy!

               The Young Cracker is obviously very drunk.

                                     BRIAN
                         Nothing, I jus...

                                     YOUNG CRACKER
                              (cuts him off)
                         What's a jism gargling cum drunk 
                         fairy like you looking at a pretty 
                         girl like that for anyway?

               The Young Cracker doesn't notice Early return from the 
               bathroom. He moves in next to Brian. Early is relaxed and 
               nonchalant as he looks over the Young Cracker. He leans closer 
               to Brian.

                                     EARLY
                              (matter of factly)
                         You'd better hit him first Bri', 
                         'cos it's comin'.

               With his eyes on Brian, Early grabs a beer. Brian is scared, 
               and confused, with one ear and one eye on the Young Cracker, 
               the other on Early.

                                     YOUNG CRACKER
                         This yur' boyfriend?

                                     BRIAN
                              (dumbfounded)
                         What?

                                     EARLY
                         Hit him.

               Early looks at the beer.

                                     EARLY
                              (angry)
                         Bri' this shit ain't Lucky Lager!

               Early takes a swig off the beer, grimaces and sprays it out. 
               It hits the Young Cracker. The Cracker looks down at his 
               shirt in shock. Early is oblivious.

                                     YOUNG CRACKER
                              (to Early)
                         Hey Asshole!

               Brian is frozen, confused, doesn't know who to address. Early 
               continues to ignore the Young Cracker.

                                     BRIAN
                         They don't stock it here Early.

                                     YOUNG CRACKER
                              (to Early, furious)
                         Why you fuckin'...

               The Young Cracker moves to hit Early. Early swiftly smashes 
               his beer bottle into the oncoming face. The Young Cracker 
               doubles over clutching his face in agony. Early kicks him in 
               the face, sending the Young Cracker to the ground. Early 
               finishes him off with several more kicks from his heavy work 
               boots.

               Two large tough guys approach Early and Brian. Brian's heart 
               racing, Early cool as a cucumber. Instead of taking on Early, 
               they stop, reach down and drag the unconscious man away. The 
               waitress returns to their table.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Sorry about that, he's always causing 
                         trouble.

               She sets down two beers and two shots, doubles.

                                     WAITRESS
                         These are on the house.

               INT. CARRIE AND BRIAN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Carrie and Adele split the last bottle of beer between them. 
               They are sitting on the floor and Adele has Carrie's foot in 
               her lap. She's painting Carrie's toenails bright red. Neither 
               of them is feeling any pain.

                                     ADELE
                         My momma's a beautician. Guess that's 
                         where I get it from. She wouldn't 
                         hear of my moving in with Early... 
                         on account of his just getting out 
                         of jail and all. Ain't seen her in 
                         nearly a year now. I wish she'd call 
                         me, just once.

                                     CARRIE
                              (interrupting)
                         What's Early been in jail for?

                                     ADELE
                              (reluctantly)
                         Carryin' a gun.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Anything else?

                                     ADELE
                         An' resistin' arrest... At least 
                         that's what the Police said.

                                     CARRIE
                         Jeez... Adele!

               Adele realizes she has said too much, looks at her watch.

                                     ADELE
                         I'd better be goin'. It's late.

               Adele hastily weaves her way out the door.

                                     CARRIE
                         Great.

               Carrie stares down at her feet. Red toenails. Cottonballs 
               between the toes.

               EXT. THE BOWLING ALLEY BAR

               Early and Brian exit the bar. They make their way to the 
               Lincoln. On the way...

                                     EARLY
                         Got to see a man about a mule.

               Brian looks at Early, doesn't understand.

                                     EARLY
                         Gotta take a piss.

               Early branches off behind the car.

                                     EARLY
                         Any reebs left in the back seat?

               Early starts to take a leak.

                                     EARLY
                         Aaahhhhh...
                              (relief)
                         That's what we used to call a beer 
                         when we was kids... Beer spelled 
                         backwards.

               Brian reaches in the back seat and grabs the last Lucky Lager. 
               He crosses to the other side of the car and hands Early the 
               beer.

                                     BRIAN
                         Last one.

               Early stares at the last of the Lucky Lagers.

                                     EARLY
                         ...Well I probably drunk more than 
                         my share, anyway... you go on an' 
                         have it.

                                     BRIAN
                         No, it's all yours. It's on me... 
                         for saving my ass back there.

               Early takes the beer.

                                     EARLY
                         Hey, that's what buddies are for, 
                         right...?

               Early polishes off the rest of the bottle and heaves it into 
               the woods.

                                     EARLY
                              (voice drops almost 
                              to a whisper)
                         You know those doors I was talking 
                         about? Found two of them back in 
                         Kentucky. Shit, I wasn't even looking 
                         for one the first time. Me and the 
                         boys are just swingin' our sickles 
                         by the side of the road, and I turned 
                         around and there it was... this door 
                         with this bright blinding white light 
                         all around it... course I'm thinkin' 
                         I must be sunstroked or somethin'... 
                         so I close my eyes figurin' I'll 
                         count ten and it'll be gone right... 
                         so I'm countin'...
                              (he closes his eyes)
                         ...1-2-3-4-5... an' I'm 'bout ta 
                         piss myself right... -6-7-8-9... 10. 
                         An' I open my eyes slow, spectin' it 
                         won't be there right...

               When Early opens his eyes, he sees a concerned look on Brian's 
               face.

                                     EARLY
                              (unconvincingly)
                         ...and it wasn't.

               An awkward silence.

               Then Early starts laughing. Brian follows suit. They both 
               climb back in the car. Their forced laughter trails off.

               Brian shifts the Lincoln back into gear and segues 
               awkwardly...

                                     BRIAN
                         What were you "swinging a sickle" 
                         for?

               Early stares at Brian. For a moment Brian is unsure what 
               Early will say, or do? Then Early grins...

                                     EARLY
                         For... 'bout three years.

               Brian brakes their eye contact, looks back out onto the 
               highway and just drives off.

               INT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S MOTEL ROOM - LATER

               The door opens revealing Brian silhouetted in the doorway. 
               Under the influence of Lucky Lager, he fumbles with the key... 
               gets inside and noisily shuts the door behind him. Carrie 
               remains stonily silent, in the dark.

                                     BRIAN
                         Gotta see a man about a mule... What's 
                         wrong?

               A few seconds pass.

                                     CARRIE
                         The same thing that's been "wrong" 
                         the whole trip. Your good buddy Early.

               Carrie, in bed, switches on the side table light. Reveals 
               Brian leaning on the wall trying to get his shoes off without 
               falling over.

                                     BRIAN
                         Who said he's my good buddy?

                                     CARRIE
                         You sure been acting like you were...
                              (redneck accent)
                         ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' 
                         and ever' thang.

               Brian points to the empty beer bottles on the table.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey come on, you two were drinking 
                         too... so what's the big deal.

               Brian throws his shoes somewhere and heads toward the 
               bathroom.

                                     CARRIE
                         Yeah, and you should've seen how 
                         terrified she was that he'd find 
                         out. He beats her.

                                     BRIAN
                         How do you know that?

                                     CARRIE
                         She told me...
                              (adding)
                         ...but only when she "deserves" it. 
                         Did you know he was in jail?

               BATHROOM

               Brian turns on the light. Takes a piss. A long one.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah, for stealing a car. Aaahhhh.

               Suddenly, from right behind him:

                                     CARRIE (O.S.)
                         Bullshit!

               Startled, Brian turns to see Carrie.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...He told her it was for carrying a 
                         gun, but the truth could be murder 
                         for all we know.

               No response from Brian. Carrie walks away.

               LIVING ROOM

               Carrie steps over to the bed, pulls the sheets back. Brian 
               leans out the bathroom door:

                                     BRIAN
                         Stop being so fucking melodramatic! 
                         If it was murder he'd still be locked 
                         up or on parole, in which case he 
                         wouldn't be allowed to leave the 
                         state.

                                     CARRIE
                         Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! 
                         Geezus Brian!

               Brian smacks himself on the forehead (a sarcastic "how stupid 
               of me!") He pulls his shirt off over his head, and admits...

                                     BRIAN
                              (sarcastically)
                         Of course! The accent, the clothes, 
                         and those table manners!... He's got 
                         to be a mass murderer!
                              (pause)
                         What else could he be?

               He switches off the bathroom light, steps out of the doorway, 
               and begins to pull his jeans off. Carrie climbs into bed.

                                     BRIAN
                         You know, it wouldn't even surprise 
                         me if he turned out to be... a 
                         Republican!

               Brian tosses his jeans and moves toward the bed. Carrie 
               switches off the the only light in the room. In the dark, we 
               hear a thud as Brian trips over a chair.

                                     BRIAN
                         Goddamnit!... my fucking toe!

               EXT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S MOTEL ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               Carrie leaves the motel room, ice bucket in hand.

                                     CARRIE
                              (to Brian inside room)
                         Try not to lose consciousness 'til I 
                         get back.

               EXT. MOTEL CORRIDOR

               At the far end of a narrow hallway, Carrie finds an ice 
               machine rumbling away noisily. The only illumination, a single 
               fluorescent light bulb, hangs suspended above it.

               AT THE ICE MACHINE

               With her arm buried inside the ice machine, Carrie scavenges 
               for what little ice there is... when, out of the corner of 
               her eye, she notices...

               SOMEONE standing at the other end of the corridor. The 
               silhouette of a man.

               Carrie stops. Her eyes scan the claustrophobic hallway for 
               another way out. There is none.

               She tries to ignore the situation. Grabs another handful of 
               ice cubes. The man approaches. Carrie stops again. Her mind 
               races. The man's face slowly becomes visible as he nears the 
               fluorescent light. It's Early.

                                     EARLY
                         Ain't you done enough drinking for 
                         tonight?

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Brian hurt his foot.

               Early reaches past her into the ice machine and grabs a 
               solitary cube. He puts it in his mouth, sucks on it. His 
               torso is drenched in sweat. He catches Carrie staring at 
               him.

                                     EARLY
                         Sometimes... Don't know why it is... 
                         I get so hot I can't stand it. I 
                         just start sweating like a dog. You 
                         ever get like that?

                                     CARRIE
                              (tenuous)
                         No.

               Early spits the ice cube back into his hand. He presses it 
               against the back of his neck.

                                     EARLY
                         I can feel it start to run down my 
                         neck...
                              (he turns his back to 
                              show her)
                         ...and down my back... right into my 
                         pants.

               Carrie follows a bead of ice water as it slides down between 
               his shoulder blades and along his back.

                                     EARLY
                         ...and everything starts stickin' 
                         together... keeps running down the 
                         back of my legs like two rivers racin' 
                         for my boots, see who gets there 
                         first.

               He snaps a look back to Carrie and finds her looking at his 
               ass. She diverts her glance.

                                     EARLY
                         You never get that hot, huh?

               Carrie shakes her head no. Early looks in his hand to see 
               that his ice cube has melted.

                                     CARRIE
                         I gotta get back before this ice 
                         melts.

               Carrie tries to slip past him. He reaches back into the 
               machine, momentarily blocking her exit. He grabs another ice 
               cube. His face only inches from hers.

                                     EARLY
                         ...never?

                                     CARRIE
                         No, never. Excuse me.

               He pops the ice cube in his mouth and lets her pass.

                                     EARLY
                         You like Skynard?

               No response, Early chews up the ice cube.

               EXT. LINCOLN LEAVING THE MOTEL - NEXT MORNING

               The car crawls out of the parking lot.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Carrie is driving. Brian is contending with a major hangover. 
               There is still a silent tension between Brian and Carrie 
               from the argument the night before. Early is in the back 
               with Adele. Brian moves his head and moans.

                                     ADELE
                         My daddy always took sauerkraut juice 
                         and tobasco sauce for a hangover, 
                         mixed in one egg not two, and some 
                         tomato juice...

               From the front seat, Brian's hand springs up in a desperate 
               plea for an end to Adele's colorful description.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm okay, thanks.

               Brian rolls down his window for some fresh air, as the car 
               pulls away.

               EXT. LINCOLN ON HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

               THE CAR IS HEADING DOWN A COUNTRY ROAD.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Carrie glances over at Brian, who is now asleep next to her. 
               She looks up into her rear-view mirror...

               CARRIE'S POV: IN THE MIRROR

               Early is asleep, leaning against the door. Adele is rummaging 
               through a large canvas bag on the seat next to her. 
               Suddenly... The wail of an approaching ambulance gets Carrie's 
               attention. It roars by. Carrie glances in the mirror again. 
               The next instant, unexpectedly...

               EXT. LINCOLN

               She furiously pulls the car off the road to an abrupt halt.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Brian's heads bangs against the side window.

                                     BRIAN
                         What! What!

               Carrie nods toward the back seat. Brian turns and sees Adele 
               looking back at them questioningly. Beside her, Early rustles.

                                     BRIAN
                         What is it?

                                     CARRIE
                         Look again!

               Brian notices that Adele's rummaging has revealed an automatic 
               pistol in the open canvas bag. Brian stares at it. Early's 
               eyes open.

               EXT. PARKED LINCOLN - LATER

               A deserted plain. It's very quiet here. Until the silence is 
               broken by the sound of gunshots. Reveal Early teaching Brian 
               how to shoot. A row of tin cans are set up on a rusty old 
               car. It's obvious that Brian's enthralled with the idea of 
               shooting the gun. Even if he isn't hitting anything.

                                     EARLY
                         Only thing my old man ever gave me 
                         is that goddamn .45.

               Brian fires off another shot, misses again.

                                     EARLY
                         Bri', you're jerkin' it when you 
                         pull the trigger, hold it real steady.

               Nearby stands an unhappy Carrie. Adele pulls her yoyo out of 
               her pocket.

                                     ADELE
                         Boys'll be boys.

               Carrie doesn't respond. Adele offers the yoyo to Carrie.

                                     ADELE
                         You know any tricks?

               Carrie shakes her head no. Adele withdraws her offer.

                                     ADELE
                         You wanna learn some?

               Again Carrie declines. Her steely gaze returns to Brian.

               ON EARLY AND BRIAN

               Early helps Brian to hold the gun.

                                     EARLY
                         Steady... Breath in... now let half 
                         of it out, and... fire.

               BANG!! The can flies off the tree stump. Brian turns to Carrie 
               to see her reaction... but she's already on her way back to 
               the car, and she's furious. Concerned, Brian starts to follow 
               after her... But Early grabs his attention.

                                     EARLY
                         Bri, I want you to keep this gun... 
                         consider it a present. Never know, 
                         California could turn out to be a 
                         dangerous place.

               Brian gazes at the gun resting in the palm of his hand.

               EXT. AN EMPTY HIGHWAY - DAY

               The Lincoln rolling along.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Brian is driving. Carrie keeps to herself. In her side mirror 
               she catches a glimpse of Early curled up in Adele's lap. She 
               watches a moment longer... and realizes that they are making 
               out. Beginning to kiss and touch one another.

               EXT. HIGHWAY NEAR ABATTOIR - LATE AFTERNOON

               The Lincoln turns off the main highway onto a dirt road. In 
               the distance, we see a large rundown building.

               INT. AN OLD DESERTED ABATTOIR - AFTERNOON

               The Lincoln pulls up to the ramshackle structure. Brian 
               glances to the back seat to make a remark to Early and Adele 
               and sees that they are amorously engaged.

               Brian and Carrie start to gather their stuff. Carrie opens 
               the glove compartment, inside are boxes of film... and the 
               .45 automatic. She takes a few packs of film, and closes the 
               glove compartment.

                                     EARLY
                         Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little 
                         sleepy,... think Adele and me are 
                         gonna take us a fiesta.

                                     CARRIE
                              (pissed off)
                         Siesta.

               Carrie reaches over and takes the keys from the ignition, 
               locks the glove compartment and pockets the key. Both she 
               and Brian exit the car. As they start to walk toward the 
               structure Brian hears a sound, he turns back to see. Adele 
               leaning forward into the frontseat as the lincoln's big white 
               top starts to come up.

               INT. ABATTOIR

               Even in daylight, the interior of the dilapidated old building 
               is equal parts unnerving, austere, and menacing. The last 
               rays of sunlight stream through what remains of the windows. 
               The light falls on a long ominous row of wicked looking meat-
               hooks hanging from the ceiling.

               Carrie is getting her camera equipment ready. She's quiet 
               and uncommunicative.

               NEW ANGLE

               CLOSE, on a small audio cassette player as it comes to rest 
               on a giant butcher block table in the center of the room. 
               Brian pops a cassette in the player.

                                     CARRIE
                         What's that?

                                     BRIAN
                         A copy of a tape they found. He 
                         recorded everything.

               Camera in hand, Carrie begins to move about, despite the 
               fact that this place repels her.

               Brian presses a button on the audio cassette player. The 
               small tinny speaker plays a bad recording of something we 
               slowly come to realize is the unmistakable sounds of a woman 
               being tortured and pleading for her life.

               FLASH!! FLASH!!

               Carrie fires off a series of shots from different angles. 
               Brian scans the place trying to imagine what happened. Screams 
               from the audio tape bounce off the walls.

                                     BRIAN
                              (speaks into his small 
                              hand held tape 
                              recorder)
                         His mother had him working in here 
                         before he was eight years old... 
                         killing animals with a sledgehammer 
                         that was bigger than he was.

               Brian and Carrie walk through the remains of a doorway into 
               another room.

                                     BRIAN
                         When she was pissed at him, she'd 
                         beat the shit out of him and lock 
                         him in here overnight...

               The pleas for help and screams on the tape subside to a steady 
               whimpering.

                                     BRIAN
                              (continuing)
                         ...Eventually the boy wakes up one 
                         morning, picks up that sledgehammer 
                         and starts hurting back.

               FLASH!! FLASH!!

               Carrie takes a few more shots of the ominous interior. Then 
               she stops, turns and walks out of the room. She's had enough. 
               Brian follows after her.

                                     BRIAN
                         There's more...

                                     CARRIE
                         I'm finished.

               Carrie stops to pick up the rest of her gear.

                                     BRIAN
                         Look... I know you're pissed off 
                         about the gun, and I don't blame 
                         you...

               Carrie wheels around to face him.

                                     CARRIE
                         Brian, I'm not pissed off. God damm 
                         it, turn that thing off.

               She switches off the cassette player.

                                     CARRIE
                         I'm scared. A week ago you would 
                         never have even thought to pick up 
                         that gun. This afternoon you're out 
                         there wielding it around like Clyde 
                         fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! 
                         What's with you?

                                     BRIAN
                         Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was 
                         stupid, I admit it, alright?
                              (pause)
                         But let's not blow this. Not now... 
                         Let's just get the photos.

                                     CARRIE
                         I can't believe I agreed to do this.

               OMITTED

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh come on, don't give me that shit... 
                         you wanted to take these photos as 
                         much as I wanted you too.

                                     CARRIE
                         Wrong! I was willing to do whatever 
                         it took to get you up off your ass 
                         and on the way to California... 
                         There's a big difference.

               Carrie storms out of the place. She exits the tunnel, and 
               makes her way toward...

               THE LINCOLN

               As she approaches it, through the rear windshield she sees... 
               Early and Adele fucking wildly!

               Carrie wants to turn away, but she can't stop watching them. 
               Fascinated, she raises the camera to her eye and zooms in on 
               them.

               THROUGH CARRIE'S CAMERA LENS: ON EARLY AND ADELE

               Early is sitting against the back seat. Adele is straddling 
               him. Carrie's finger finds the shutter button.

               Early's arms move up under Adele's dress... Her hands press 
               up against the roof. She's trembling... Wavering... Carrie's 
               finger presses down on the button, CLICK!!

               Then in one swift movement Early sweeps Adele onto the back 
               seat. Close on Early's face. He's sweating... Lips moving... 
               Talking dirty to Adele.

               Keeping her finger on the button, Carrie rapid fires through 
               a whole roll of film. She's oblivious to the whine of the 
               motor drive once all the film is shot out.

               Then unexpectedly!! Early looks directly into the camera, at 
               Carrie. And smiles... And continues to fuck Adele.

               A chill rushes through Carrie, she almost drops the camera. 
               She runs back toward the tunnel... and right into Brian's 
               arms. He startles her. She pulls away from him.

                                     CARRIE
                         Brian I want him out of our car!

                         Why, what did he do?

                                     CARRIE
                         Brian get him out of the car. Next

               EXT. DESERT - DUSK

               The Lincoln passes through frame. In the background, the 
               surreal image of an industrial complex bathed in an eerie 
               artificial light.

               INT. LINCOLN PULLS INTO A GAS STATION - TWILIGHT

               An electrical storm is in full swing.

               EXT. GAS STATION

               The Lincoln barely comes to a stop at the pumps before Carrie 
               storms out of the car and heads toward the gas station 
               interior. She leaves Brian to break the news to Adele and 
               Early.

               INT. GAS STATION

               The only person inside is a YOUNG MALE ATTENDANT. He's 
               watching TV behind the counter as Carrie enters. On the TV 
               we see a NEWSMAN. We only catch fragments of what he is saying 
               because the storm outside is affecting the TV reception.

               electrical power at the station is affected. The fluorescent 
               lights outside and inside begin to flicker and falter 
               sporadically.

               Static.

               Carrie looks at the TV, watches for a moment. It doesn't 
               hold her attention. She looks away and notices Adele leaving 
               the car. Adele walks toward a Coke machine at the other end 
               of the gas station.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Here's your cigarettes...

               Carrie turns back toward him.

                         ...And change. Better be careful,

                         Hear it never rains there. Must be 
                         nice.

               He buttons up his rain coat and goes out into the night to 
               gas up the Lincoln. Carrie pulls a pack of cigarettes from 
               the carton, nervously lights one up. She looks out the window 
               toward the Lincoln.

               EXT. GAS PUMPS

               Through flashes of lightning and thunder she sees Brian in 
               the car talking to Early. Early listening quietly. Brian 
               looking adamant yet apologetic. The attendant fills the 
               Lincoln's tank.

               INT. GAS STATION

               Simultaneously, as Carrie watches this... Behind her on the 
               TV screen... A wave of interference scrambles the picture.

               Brian's still talking -- using his hands to explain. Early

               INT. GAS STATION - ON THE TV

               A video tape image of a familiar gas station recorded by a

               She stares at the TV with growing horror as she notices a 
               familiar black Lincoln in the background. In mid-ground, a 
               male figure approaches the video camera unknowingly. Slowly, 
               Early's image becomes visible.

               Carrie panics, turns toward the door and runs smack into the 
               arms of a dripping wet Early Grayce! Early stares at her and 
               drops his bag to the ground.

                                     EARLY
                         I ain't ridin' in no bus... bitch.

               Then... Early notices himself on the TV.

               Static.

               Early grabs Carrie around the neck and yanks her into the 
               back office. He pushes her down onto a chair.

                                     EARLY
                         You just sit there and keep your 
                         mouth shut.

               He searches behind the cash register and finds a sawed-off 
               shotgun. He shuts the TV off.

                                     EARLY
                         I knew that boy'd have a hogleg here 
                         somewhere.

               The Attendant rushes back in from the pouring rain. Early 
               points the sawed-off shotgun at him.

                                     EARLY
                         Get over here.

               Early forces him into the office.

                                     EARLY
                         Sit your ass down in that corner.

               Adele enters the adjacent room. She checks out the various 
               vending machines in search of candy. Early taps on the window 
               and motions her into the office. She sees Carrie in the chair, 
               scared to death, and Early aiming the gun at the Attendant.

                                     ADELE
                         Early, what're you doin'?

                         Go back to the car and keep Brian 
                         there. I don't want him in here...

               Adele looks back at Carrie, then hurries out. Early empties 
               the cash register.

                                     EARLY
                         What's your name, boy?

                         Think. I might just have to kill you 
                         Walter. How do you feel about that?

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Not so good. You sure you have to?

                                     EARLY
                         I don't know. Wish I did.

                         Shut your mouth.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Adele opens the door on the driver's side looking scared. 
               Brian is in the passenger seat. He's looking in the glove 
               compartment for a map. The .45 automatic Early gave Brian is 
               clearly visible. Adele stares at it.

                                     BRIAN
                         Adele, what are you doing back here?

               Adele gets in and starts looking under the seats.

                                     ADELE
                         ...Lost my purse... Could you help 
                         me look for it? It's probably under 
                         the seat.

               The Attendant is reaching up, handing Early the money from 
               his pockets. Carrie is seated in front of him.

                                     EARLY

                                     EARLY
                         Turkey's are real smart. Smarter 
                         than most people think...

               Early rips the phone out of the wall.

                                     EARLY
                         Tell you what Walter, you lie down 
                         there now... You make sure you stay 
                         put for a while after we leave... 
                         Okay?

               The attendant nods yes.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         ...Mind if I hold that Bible?

                                     EARLY
                         What do you need a Bible for?

               The attendant has no response.

                                     EARLY
                         You think I'm goin' to kill you. 
                         Well that'd make me a liar then 
                         wouldn't it?

                                     ATTENDANT
                         No sir.

               Early takes the Bible off the desk and hands it down to the 
               Attendant.

                                     EARLY
                         Here you go.

               The frightened young man lies face down on his stomach 
               clutching the Bible and starts to pray.

               On the counter next to him Early notices a large stuffed 
               "happy face" display. "Free with every 20 gallon purchase."

               He grabs one, stares at its face curiously.

                                     EARLY
                              (mumbles to himself)
                         I wonder if Adele would like one of 
                         these?
                              (beat)
                         Nah...

               Suddenly... He puts the barrel of the gun between the "happy 
               face" eyes... Points it at the back of the attendant's head.

               Carrie begins to scream. Early pulls the trigger.

               The blast explodes the "happy face" and rips into the back 
               of the Attendant's head, killing him.

               INT. LINCOLN - SIMULTANEOUSLY

               A thunderous crackle of lightning all but masks the gunshot. 
               The rain starts pouring down.

                                     BRIAN
                         What was that?

               Adele stares blankly back.

               INT. GAS STATION

               The room fills with billowing down stuffing. As the stuffing 
               floats to the floor it sticks to their hair, skin and 
               clothes...

                                     EARLY
                              (surprised at the 
                              feathers)
                         What the fuck!

               INT. LINCOLN

               Brian opens the door to leave.

               EXT. GAS STATION

               Early drags Carrie out of the office toward the car. Brian 
               sees them running toward the car. They spill into the back 
               seat. Brian sees Carrie is upset.

                                     BRIAN
                         Carrie, what's wrong?
                              (to Early)
                         Early, we went through this already, 
                         you have to leave.

               From the back seat Early wipes some more feathers from his 
               face, then points the Attendant's gun at Brian's head.

                                     EARLY
                              (spits out a feather)
                         'Fraid not Bri'... Drive Adele.

               Adele starts the car. She pulls out of the station and into 
               the rainstorm.

               INT. GAS STATION

               The last of the feathers fall like snow. The whole room is 
               now white except for a red stain around the head of the dead 
               Attendant.

               INT. LINCOLN - A MOMENT LATER

               The car moves down the highway. Early in the back seat is 
               still trying to brush away feathers.

                                     EARLY
                         Hate to be an Indian-giver but I'm 
                         gonna have to ask for my gun back.

               Brian reaches in the glove compartment. He removes the gun 
               and hands it to Early.

                                     BRIAN
                              (to Early)
                         What happened back there?

               Carrie sits in the corner of the back seat, covered in 
               feathers but not even noticing them.

                                     CARRIE
                         He shot him in the head... oh God!

               Adele turns to the back of the car to face Carrie.

                                     ADELE
                              (raising her voice)
                         He did not, you liar. Take that back.

               The Lincoln swerves off onto the side of the road. Adele 
               looks to the front again and steers it back onto the highway.

                                     CARRIE
                         He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking 
                         insane.

                                     EARLY
                         Everybody just shut up!

               Early picks some more feathers off himself.

                                     EARLY
                         You two just cooperate and do what I 
                         say, and we'll all arrive safe and 
                         sound in California, as planned... 
                         unless, of course, Adele don't kill 
                         us first with her driving.

               The St. Christopher statue swings from the rear-view mirror. 
               The windshield wipers sweep back and forth against the pouring 
               rain.

               EXT. AN ISOLATED ABANDONED STORE - NEXT MORNING

               The Lincoln pulls up at the rear of the store. Adele exits 
               carrying a couple of bags of Chinese take-out food.

               INT. ABANDONED STORE

               Adele enters the decrepit store. The others are inside. Brian 
               and Carrie are tied up. Brian watches Early intently as he 
               takes one of the bags from Adele. He begins opening one of 
               the carry out containers.

                                     EARLY
                         What the hell is this stuff?

                                     ADELE
                         It's Chinese food. It was the only 
                         place open. You said you was starving, 
                         you'd eat anyth...

               Early opens another container. Stares curiously at the 
               contents.

                                     EARLY
                         Yeah but, what is it?

                                     ADELE
                         I don't know, they didn't speak too 
                         good English.

               Early sets the container down.

                                     EARLY
                         And just what exactly are the Chinese 
                         doing here in the middle of the 
                         American desert anyway?... Didja get 
                         the beer?

               Adele somewhat reluctantly hands Early a bottle of beer from 
               a second bag.

                                     EARLY
                         ..."Chink" beer!

               Early notices that Brian is watching him intently. He mistakes 
               Brian's interest for hunger.

                                     EARLY
                         Oh hell, I'm sorry Bri. Adele, honey, 
                         untie Brian, he's starving over there.
                              (pause)
                         Carrie, you want some?

               Carrie doesn't respond at all. Adele unties Brian.

               Early pulls out his gun, puts it on the table next to him. 
               Brian sits across from Early. He watches as Early rummages 
               impatiently through the carry out paraphernalia.

                                     EARLY
                         Where's the damn forks and spoons 
                         at!

               Frustrated, Early finally takes a gulp of Chinese food right 
               out of the container. It goes down rough.

                                     EARLY
                         ...Is it just me, or has this whole 
                         trip been goin' downhill ever since 
                         we ran outta Lucky Lager?

               Brian picks up a pair of chopsticks, then reconsiders, puts 
               them back down and, like Early, gulps from the container.

               NEARBY, Carrie sits quietly. As she listens to the two men 
               talk... she notices something on her arm. She lifts her arm 
               up to get a closer look.

               HER POV

               She sees that a few of the white down feathers still cling 
               to her. Closer... and she sees that one of the tiny feathers 
               is tinged with blood. The Gas Station Attendant's. It freaks 
               her.

               ON BRIAN AND EARLY

                                     BRIAN
                              (quietly)
                         How many people have you killed Early?

               Early stops... thinks for a moment.

               ON CARRIE

               She tries to brush the bloodied feather away... but with her 
               hands bound, she can't reach it.

               ON BRIAN AND EARLY

                                     EARLY
                         Well now, how many people d'you see 
                         me kill?

               Brian shakes his head.

                                     BRIAN
                         None.

               ON CARRIE

               In quiet desperation, she raises her arm to her lips... and 
               blows the solitary blood tinged reminder away.

               ON BRIAN AND EARLY

               Early stares at Brian.

                                     EARLY
                         ...Well then, that's how many I 
                         killed.

                                     BRIAN
                              (unconvincingly)
                         If you say so.

                                     EARLY
                         Damn right I do.

               ON ADELE

               Adele watches the tiny down feather drift to the floor.

               ON BRIAN AND EARLY

               Early picks up a different container and gulps some down. 
               After a moment...

                                     EARLY
                         You never killed anyone have you 
                         Bri'?

               Brian shakes his head no.

                                     EARLY
                         You never even seen anybody killed, 
                         right?

               Brian stops eating and looks at Early.

                                     BRIAN
                         What are you getting at?

               Early leans closer to him.

                                     EARLY
                         You wanna tell me how'n the hell you 
                         gonna write a book 'bout somethin' 
                         you don't know nothin' 'bout?

               Eye to eye, the two men stare at one another. Brian has no 
               answer.

                                     EARLY
                         Ya see what I'm sayin'?
                              (beat)
                         Ha!

                                     BRIAN
                              (nervously mimes the 
                              same)
                         ...Ha.

               Early goes back to gulping down his dinner. This time he 
               gets a spicy one.

                                     EARLY
                              (a nod toward the 
                              carry out container)
                         ...watch out for that stuff, it bites.

               Brian gazes at the cluster of Chinese carry-out food 
               containers. An ironic reminder of an earlier conversation. 
               He lets out a weak ironic laugh.

                                     BRIAN
                              (recollecting to 
                              himself)
                         ...way too much MSG.

               EXT. LINCOLN - TRAVELING - DAY

               INT. LINCOLN DRIVING DOWN BACKROADS - DAY

               Early is behind the wheel, not a care in the world. Adele 
               sits beside him playing with her camera. She turns and aims 
               the camera at Brian and Carrie in the back seat, their hands 
               are bound.

                                     ADELE
                         Smile.

               Neither makes any attempt at smiling. Adele snaps their photo 
               anyway. In the front seat, she sits quietly for a moment 
               then leans over to Early and whispers something to him.

                                     EARLY
                         No way. I guarantee you he was 
                         breathing when I walked outta there.

               Adele sits back quietly. Carrie wants to speak but doesn't.

                                     EARLY
                         Hey... Ain't we getting near the 
                         next murder site... Bri?

                                     BRIAN
                         Forget about it, doesn't matter.

                                     EARLY
                         Hell it don't...
                              (beat)
                         ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. 
                         One day I'm gonna pass some store 
                         and see your book in the window. Me 
                         and Adele gonna buy a copy for our 
                         coffee table.

               NEW ANGLE

               Carrie silently fuming in the back seat. Brian stares at the 
               rope that binds his wrists.

               EXT. OLD DESERTED MINE AREA - LATER THAT DAY

               The Lincoln drives down the dirt access road and stops. They 
               all get out, Early unties Brian and Carrie.

                                     EARLY
                         Figured your hands might be starting 
                         to hurt.

               Early looks down the hill to the old mine building.

                                     EARLY
                         Let's have a look. You girls coming?

               Carrie's steely gaze answers Early's question.

                                     ADELE
                         Can I just wait here?

               Early leans into the car and picks up Adele's camera.

                                     EARLY
                         Don't worry Bri', I'll take the 
                         pictures.
                              (to Adele, with a 
                              kiss to her cheek)
                         ...you stay here with Carrie.
                              (to Carrie)
                         You run off... Bri' pays the price. 
                         Karma, remember?

               Pistol in hand, Early follows Brian down the hill. Adele 
               begins nervously playing with her yoyo.

               Carrie watches as Brian and Early disappear around a bend in 
               the dirt road. Out of the corner of her eye, she hones in on 
               Adele's yoyo.

               Adele becomes increasingly intense about manipulating the 
               yoyo, controlling it. Until she's lost in it. A momentary 
               refuge.

                                     ADELE
                         This is called walk the dog.

               NEW ANGLE - EXTREME CU

               A huge excruciatingly tight shot of the yoyo in slow motion. 
               Its string unraveling as it spins downward. Carrie pulls her 
               gaze away.

               CARRIE'S POV

               The desolate surrounding landscape, a bright blue sky, the 
               scrubbrush. And no one who can help them. Carrie turns and 
               looks over her shoulder down the hill.

               EXT. OLD MINE BUILDING

               The old mine building, rusted and deserted since the late 
               '20's.

                                     EARLY
                         So tell me... what happened here?

                                     BRIAN
                         Two brothers, prospectors, lived 
                         here. Up until a few years back.

               Flash! -- Early takes a photo with the Instamatic.

                                     EARLY
                              (coaxing)
                         ...and?

                                     BRIAN
                         They picked up hitchhikers... young 
                         men... and brought them back here.

               Early scans the grounds.

                                     EARLY
                         Where'd they do it?

               Reluctantly Brian leads Early toward the old mine building. 
               At the opening, Early hesitates.

                                     EARLY
                         Bri.

               Brian stops in his tracks.

               EXT. LINCOLN - TIGHT CLOSE UP

               Adele's yoyo skitters across the gravel road surface.

               EXT. OLD MINE BUILDING

               Brian turns back to Early.

                                     EARLY
                         This ain't going to give me 
                         nightmares, is it?

               EXT. LINCOLN - TIGHT CLOSE UP

               Then in a snap!... the yoyo recoils into Adele's palm.

               CARRIE'S POV

               A distant empty ribbon of road.

               ON CARRIE

               Her eyes searching for anyone who could help.

                                     ADELE (O.S.)
                         This is one of my favorites... rock 
                         the cradle.

               INT. OLD MINE BUILDING

               Brian and Early are silhouetted against the dying sky. Flash!! 
               Early takes another photo.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...They asked them just before they 
                         were executed why they did it. They 
                         said "to be famous."
                              (beat)
                         Why do you do it?

               Flash!! Early takes a flash photo of Brian, momentarily 
               blinding him.

                                     EARLY
                         Do what Bri?

               Early moves slowly toward Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         We both know you didn't have to kill 
                         that gas station attendant.

               Brian's eyes dart nervously to the gun dangling in Early's 
               palm. Flash!

               EXT. LINCOLN - TIGHT CU

               In slow motion Adele's hands manipulate the yoyo and string.

               INT. OLD MINE BUILDING

                         You wanted to.
                              (beat)
                         Why?

               Flash! Brian flinches. Early remains silent as he closes in 
               on Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         It make you feel good? Powerful?
                              (Flash!)
                         Superior, what? Come on Early, tell 
                         me something.
                              (Flash!)
                         Were you angry?

               Early's boot lands toe to toe with Brian's shoe.

                                     BRIAN
                              (tentative)
                         Who are you angry with Early... your 
                         mother, your father?

               Eye to eye, the two men stand there.

                                     EARLY
                         You want to know about my daddy, 
                         I'll tell you about my daddy, Bri...

               EXT. LINCOLN

               Carrie walks over to Adele at the car. Adele doesn't miss a 
               beat with her yoyo.

                                     CARRIE
                         Adele, listen to me... Early's sick; 
                         he should be in a hospital.

               Adele screws up the trick. She pulls the yoyo off her finger 
               and throws it in the back seat. She leans into the front 
               seat and cranks the radio up to the max. Closing her eyes, 
               she begins moving to the music, and tries to ignore Carrie.

                                     CARRIE

                         The police are after him, he's a 
                         murderer!

                         That's not true!

               NEW ANGLE

               A POLICE CAR pulls into frame, unnoticed by Carrie and Adele 
               in the background.

               INT. POLICE CAR

                                     MALE OFFICER
                         Let's take a look.

                                     FEMALE OFFICER
                         I'll call in the plate.

               The Male Officer exits, unlocking his holster. The Female 
               Officer picks up the police radio and calls in the license 
               plate number.

               EXT. LINCOLN NEAR MINE AREA

               The radio is blaring. Adele continues to dance despite 
               Carrie's pleas.

                                     CARRIE
                              (shouting)
                         ...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . 
                         I saw him kill that man.

                                     ADELE
                              (defensive)
                         Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't 
                         do that. I don't know why you're 
                         saying those things. You ain't my 
                         friend.

               With that, Adele stops her dancing and turns away from 
               Carrie... To see the Male Officer walking toward them.

                                     ADELE
                         Please don't say anything Carrie.

               The Male Officer continues toward them. It looks like he's 
               talking to them... but his voice is inaudible under the 
               deafening radio.

               NEW ANGLE: FAVORING THE TWO POLICE OFFICERS

               The Female Officer sticks her head out of the police car and 
               yells to her partner. He turns to listen.

                                     FEMALE OFFICER
                         We got a match, I'll call for back 
                         up.

               As the Male Officer turns back, he sees Adele reach into the 
               front seat of the Lincoln. The Male Officer draws his revolver 
               and levels it at Adele.

               NEW ANGLE: FAVORING ADELE AND CARRIE

               Click! Adele shuts the radio off, total silence. As Adele 
               leans back out of the car, she turns, facing directly into 
               the barrel of the Male Officer's gun.

                                     MALE OFFICER
                         All right ladies, I want both of you 
                         to slowly step away from the ca...

               BANG! A single gunshot rings out! The Male Officer jerks 
               back and falls to the ground. Adele screams! Carrie whips a 
               panicked glance around and sees... Early running toward them. 
               Brian, bewildered, follows behind.

               BRIAN'S POV (RUNNING)

               Ahead of him, he watches Early race past the wounded Male 
               Officer. He kicks the Officer's revolver out of reach and 
               rushes toward the police car.

               Early fires his gun repeatedly as he charges the car!

               The Female Officer pulls her gun and starts to get out of 
               the car, when... a shot shatters the windshield hitting her 
               in the chest. She collapses back onto the seat.

               ON BRIAN

               He stops at the sight of the wounded Male Officer. Shocked, 
               he watches the man writhing in pain. His hands clutching his 
               crotch. His blood oozes into the dirt.

               Early approaches the police car. He sees the dead cop and 
               hears the radio dispatcher.

                                     POLICE RADIO
                         Officer needs help, shots fired, six 
                         Adam five, one eighty-seven, suspects 
                         wanted in multiple murders. Location 
                         unknown, last seen...

               Brian is not sure what to do. He looks around... sees the 
               Officer's handgun lying in the dirt. He takes a step toward 
               it, when... another gunshot rings out! Brian stops. Looks to 
               the police car. He sees Early standing there, smoke belching 
               from the dashboard... the police radio is dead.

               Early walks back toward Brian and the others. He steps over 
               to the injured Male Officer on the ground.

                                     EARLY
                         Tell me that don't hurt.

               Early picks up the wounded cop's gun. He hands it to Brian 
               as he trains the .45 automatic at Brian's chest.

                                     EARLY
                         Shoot him. You'll be doing him a 
                         favor.

               Brian looks to Early in disbelief.

               OMITTED

                                     BRIAN
                         No, no, I can't.

               Early cocks the pistol and pushes the barrel to Brian's head. 
               Brian looks down at the wounded cop who is writhing in pain.

                                     EARLY
                         (No,) It's the answer to all them 
                         questions of yers.

               Brian won't do it. He drops the gun to the ground.

                                     EARLY
                         Now you'll never know.

               Early cocks his pistol.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...Don't do it. Early, look at him, 
                         look at his face. That's not your 
                         father.

               Early stares at the wounded cop's face.

                                     EARLY
                         I know that. That there is a policeman 
                         in a world of pain. And this is what 
                         you call a mercy killin'.

               Early shoots the cop again. The cop lays still.

               Early reaches down and takes the dead cop's handcuffs. He 
               casually points the little camera at the dead cop. Flash!!

               EXT. LINCOLN - ON BACKROADS - LATER

               The Lincoln hurtles down the road.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Early driving. Adele in the passenger seat looks bewildered. 
               Carrie and Brian in back, handcuffed, eyes hollow with 
               exhaustion and fear. Then out of the quiet...

                                     EARLY
                         I'm still waiting.

               Adele looks across the seat to Early. Her face drained of 
               all expression.

                                     EARLY
                              (disappointed)
                         Not so much as a simple "thank you."

               Adele at a loss. Finally... confused...

                                     ADELE
                              (empty)
                         ...thank you.

                                     EARLY
                         Thank you for what?
                              (becoming aggravated)
                         What are you thanking me for Adele?

                              (hesitantly, she admits)
                         ...I don't know.

                         Well Adele... it was for...
                              (screaming at her)
                         ...saving your fucking life back 
                         there!

               She shrinks away from him.

                                     EARLY
                              (gesturing with his 
                              fingertips a fraction

               Early looks into the rear-view mirror. Brian tries to defuse 
               the situation.

                         There ain't nothing we could do. 
                         Once Early sets his mind on somethin', 
                         well thats the end of that.

               Adele drifts back to the cacti.

               INT. MUSGRAVE LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

               CLOSE ON A PORCELAIN CACTUS

               One of many we now reveal to be atop a fireplace mantle. 
               Adele leans in against the mantle and scrutinizes the cactus.

               Carrie and Brian sit on the floor, back to back, their arms 
               bound around the leg of a piano by a pair of police handcuffs. 
               Mrs. Musgrave is standing nearby. She's overwhelmed. Numb. 
               She pours herself a glass of bourbon.

                                     MRS. MUSGRAVE
                              (to herself)
                         It's just like in that dream I had. 
                         If only I had seen their faces.

               She takes her drink and sits down on the couch nearby. Adele 
               drops down quietly on the chair next to her.

                                     ADELE
                              (tries to cheer Mrs. 
                              Musgrave up)
                         You've got beautiful cactuses here, 
                         I just love 'em. My momma used to 
                         keep a garden.

               Mrs. Musgrave downs most of her drink with the first try. 
               Distressed, her head slumps down.

                                     EARLY (O.S.)
                              (from the kitchen)
                         Hey Bri... You ever stop to think 
                         that if you switched the two letters 
                         in your name...
                              (entering the room)
                         ...it would spell Brain.

               Early, his pistol wedged in his belt, appears from the kitchen 
               eating a sandwich. Between bites... He walks over and rips 
               the phone out of the wall unit. He glimpses Mrs. Musgrave.

                                     EARLY
                         What's wrong with her?

                                     ADELE
                              (sorry for her)
                         She had a dream that somethin' like 
                         this was gonna happen.

               Early notices the glass of bourbon in her trembling hands. 
               He steps over to her and takes the glass away.

                                     EARLY
                         I'll bet she did.

               He sets the glass down next to a recent picture of Mrs. 
               Musgrave and an ELDERLY MAN with silver hair.

                                     EARLY
                         Where's your husband?

                                     MRS. MUSGRAVE
                              (lying)
                         ...I'm a widow.

               Early looks at her, he doesn't believe her.

               EXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE - NIGHT

               Everything is quiet beneath the star studded sky. The same 
               elderly man pictured with Mrs. Musgrave is studying the sky 
               through a powerful telescope. MR. MUSGRAVE is an amateur 
               astronomer. o.s. the SOUND of a door opening. Then footsteps.

                                     MR. MUSGRAVE
                              (excited)
                         Is that you Peaches? Come, you must 
                         see Saturn tonight. The rings are 
                         sensational!

               INT. STUDY - GLASS DISPLAY CASE

               Early leans into frame, staring at the display case.

               EARLY'S POV

               Inside of it is a four foot long replica of the first ATOMIC 
               BOMB, "Fat Boy." Faded newspaper articles on the wall indicate 
               Mr. Musgrave had something to do with the bomb's initial 
               construction. An old photo on the bookshelf shows a much 
               younger Mr. Musgrave in a '50's kitchen. He is laughing and 
               embracing a '50's style female mannequin.

                                     MR. MUSGRAVE (O.S.)
                         My oh my, this is quite rare, quite 
                         rare indeed. Come have a look...

               Early's eyes drift over to a set of golf clubs that sit in 
               the corner of the room.

               MR MUSGRAVE'S POV - THROUGH TELESCOPE

               The planet Saturn and its glorious rings.

                                     MR. MUSGRAVE (O.S.)
                         Peaches?

               OMITTED

               THWACK!! The planet turns into a blur of light... then 
               blackness.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - ON BRIAN AND CARRIE

               Brian and Carrie are still cuffed to the piano, in the 
               background we see Mrs. Musgrave and Adele looking out the 
               window into the backyard.

                                     BRIAN
                              (whispers to Carrie)
                         You gotta talk to her. She looks up 
                         to you, she'll listen to you.

                                     CARRIE
                         I tried talking to her at the mine. 
                         It didn't work.

                                     BRIAN
                         Then try again, (it's our only 
                         chance.)

               EXT. HOUSE - LATER

               Early is leaning on a golf club looking through the telescope.

                                     ADELE (O.S.)
                         Early?

               He pulls his eye away as Adele arrives.

                                     ADELE
                              (excited)
                         Early, Mrs. Musgrave has the most 
                         beautiful little guest house out 
                         back and... well, no one's stayin' 
                         in it... it's just empty. And she 
                         said if me and you wanted to, well 
                         maybe we...

               Suddenly, o.s., a scream pierces the moment!

               Early and Adele turn toward the doorway to see Mrs. Musgrave 
               screaming. The older woman's eyes staring past Adele to the 
               floor nearby. Adele follows the terrified woman's gaze to 
               find... Mr. Musgrave's body lying on the floor. A bloodied 
               wound in the back of his head. All of Adele's enthusiasm 
               drains from her face.

                                     EARLY
                              (to Mrs. Musgrave)
                         Well 'Peaches'... you're a widow 
                         now.

               Mrs. Musgrave collapses to the floor.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - SHORT WHILE LATER

               Brian and Carrie are still cuffed to the piano. Across from 
               them, Early sits in an overstuffed chair looking through 
               Carrie's collection of erotic photography.

                                     EARLY
                              (to Brian)
                         Have you seen this one? That don't 
                         leave much to the imagination now 
                         does it?

               He looks at another photograph. Confused, he turns it upside 
               down, stares at it.

               INT. THE DEN - SAME TIME

               Mrs. Musgrave is laid out on the couch. Adele, deep in 
               thought, watches over the older woman. Finally Adele reaches 
               into her purse, pulls out her small potted cactus then walks 
               across the room to a table. Its top is covered with small 
               potted cacti. She gently places hers among them.

               ON MRS. MUSGRAVE

               Mrs. Musgrave begins to regain consciousness. Her eyes open 
               to find... Adele standing over her. Adele brings her finger 
               to her lips -- Shhhh.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               Early looks through several more photos. He stops on one of 
               a nude woman's torso. Early looks at it for a moment... then 
               extends the photo out toward Carrie, comparing it to her.

                                     EARLY
                              (smiles and shakes 
                              his head in disbelief)
                         That's you ain't it?

               Carrie doesn't answer him. Then, in the background directly 
               behind Early... Adele and Mrs. Musgrave quietly appear. Carrie 
               notices them as they start to cross the hallway to the 
               kitchen. Early sees Carrie's eyes glance past him. He turns 
               to see why... when...

                                     CARRIE (O.S.)
                         You're right Early...

               Early stops. Looks back to Carrie. Brian also turns to her 
               curiously.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...It is me. Do you like it?

               Early looks at the photo again. Adele and Mrs. Musgrave now 
               cross safely to the kitchen. Carrie eyes meet Early's. He 
               smiles, pulls the nude photo of her close to his face... and 
               licks it.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               Adele quietly opens the back door.

                                     ADELE
                         Go on now... please.

               Mrs. Musgrave is confused, is it a trick? She looks into 
               Adele's eyes... and knows it's not. The old lady turns and 
               walks out into the dark desert. Adele stands at the open 
               door, watching Mrs Musgrave escape.

                                     ADELE
                              (in a whisper)
                         ...Call me.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               Early finishes looking through the photographs. He closes 
               the cover of the portfolio.

                                     EARLY
                         Well they say there's room fur all 
                         kinds in California... and that's 
                         where we're gonna be this time 
                         tomorrow. California.
                              (beat)
                         Adele honey?

               INT. KITCHEN

                                     EARLY (O.S.)
                         Adele?

               Early enters, and sees Adele standing at the back door. Adele 
               turns to face him. Early looks past her into the night and 
               realizes what she's done. He strides across the room pulling 
               the pistol from his waistband.

               AT THE KITCHEN DOOR

               Early pushes Adele out of the way.

                                     EARLY
                              (shouting)
                         Peaches! Come on back here. There 
                         ain't nothin' for you to be afraid 
                         of.

               EARLY POV - EXT. CACTUS GARDEN

               Aside from the occasional pools of light illuminating the 
               cacti, it's very dark. There's no sign of Mrs. Musgrave.

               INT. KITCHEN

               He steps outside and starts firing his gun into the 
               blackness... bullets THUNK into the cacti.

                                     EARLY
                              (shouting over the 
                              gunfire)
                         Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!

                                     ADELE
                         Early! Stop!!

               Desperate, Adele grabs a large potted cactus. She rushes 
               toward Early. Swinging the cactus like an unwieldy bat, she 
               pummels the side of his head. He stumbles forward, 
               disappearing into the darkness. Adele stands outside the 
               kitchen door, bewildered. Then...

                                     EARLY (O.S.)
                         Oww! Oww!! -- FUCK!!!!

               Early re-emerges from the shadows. Adele's eyes widen when 
               she sees him. His cheek has long bloody gashes where the 
               cactus ripped the flesh.

                                     EARLY
                              (perplexed)
                         Honey... What do you think you're 
                         doin'?

               Adele starts to cry.

                                     EARLY
                         Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 
                         'bout? I'm the one got hit.

                                     ADELE
                         I changed my mind, Early. I'm not 
                         gonna climb up that Hollywood sign 
                         with you... I decided. I think your 
                         mean, and you hurt people.

               A look comes over Early's face that we've never seen before. 
               That he's never felt before. Hurt. He doesn't know how to 
               deal with it. And he definitely doesn't like it.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME (INTERCUT WITH PREVIOUS SCENE)

                                     BRIAN
                         Carrie, watch for Early.

                                     CARRIE
                         What are you going to do?

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm going to try and lift the end of 
                         the piano. If I can... slide your 
                         cuffs free.

               Carrie glues her eyes to the kitchen doorway. Brian presses 
               his back up under the belly of the piano and using all his 
               strength manages to lift the piano an inch off the floor. 
               Carrie slides her cuffs out from under the leg.

                                     CARRIE
                         What about you?

                                     BRIAN
                         I don't know.

               Carrie's eyes dart back toward the kitchen. Then she notices 
               a chair nearby.

                                     CARRIE
                         Can you lift it again? Just lift it, 
                         hurry.

               Carrie grabs the chair. As Brian lifts the piano, she pushes 
               the chair beneath the underside of it. It holds the piano 
               suspended an inch off the floor. Brian drops to the floor 
               and slips the cuffs free.

               When... a solitary gunshot rings out from the cactus garden.

               A moment later, Early steps quietly into the room. He's 
               pulling the last few cactus needles from his face. He sees 
               Brian and Carrie standing.

                                     EARLY
                         You two been busy in here.

                                     BRIAN
                         What happened to Adele?

                                     EARLY
                         Well, let's put it this way.
                              (beat)
                         I need me a new woman.

               A shocked silence. Brian and Carrie look to one another. 
               Carrie moves toward the kitchen but Early stops her! Brian 
               rushes at him. Early sticks the .45 automatic in his face!

                                     EARLY
                         Sorry about this Bri...

               He starts to squeeze the trigger.

                                     CARRIE
                              (desperate)
                         Early, don't.

               Early stops. He looks to Carrie.

                                     CARRIE
                         I'll do whatever you want. You want 
                         me to go with you, I'll go with you. 
                         Just don't kill him.

               Early deliberates the situation, then eases up off the 
               trigger... and smiles to Brian.

               Then, without warning, he hits Brian over the head with the 
               butt of the .45 automatic. Brian falls to the floor 
               unconscious.

               OMITTED

               EXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               As Early finishes tieing one of the replicant bombs, Little 
               Boy onto the hood. He reaches down and grabs a six pack of 
               beer on the ground and shoves it in the back seat, then slides 
               into the driver's seat next to an anxious Carrie. Carrie is 
               now wearing one of Adele's floral dresses.

                                     EARLY
                         Think anyone will notice?

               Carrie doesn't answer, Early laughs.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Early looks out over the expanse of the desert. He sees a 
               dirt fire road.

                                     EARLY
                         I'll bet there's a 'door' out there... 
                         save us some time.

               Carrie doesn't understand what he means. Nonetheless, she 
               nods her head in agreement.

               EXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE

               The Lincoln heads out, past the cactus garden, into the 
               darkness.

               THE LINCOLN'S HEADLIGHTS REVEAL

               Adele's lifeless body on the ground near her beloved cacti.

               FADE TO BLACK WITH THE DEPARTING HEADLIGHTS

               INT. MUSGRAVE LIVING ROOM - MORNING

               Brian is handcuffed on the floor. His eyes open slowly as he 
               begins to regain consciousness. He senses someone behind 
               him. He pivots around to see Mrs. Musgrave kneeling down to 
               help him.

               EXT. DESERT - SAME TIME

               In the distance, a cloud of dust reveals the Lincoln, 
               traveling at high speed along the dirt fire road.

               INT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME

               Early still behind the wheel. Carrie sits up against the 
               passenger side door. She is tense and guarded. Out the window, 
               nothing but empty desert.

                                     EARLY
                         Pass me a beer hon'.

               Carrie quietly responds. She kneels on the front seat and 
               reaches into the back. She grabs a bottle by its neck, and 
               pulls it from the six pack of beer. Bottle in hand, she 
               hesitates a moment...

               NEW ANGLE: EARLY'S POV IN THE DRIVING MIRROR

               Early watches Carrie.

                                     EARLY
                         You wanna hit me with that, huh?

               NEW ANGLE

               Carrie reconsiders and sits back in the far corner of the 
               front seat.

                                     CARRIE
                              (not looking at him)
                         No.

               She hands the bottle to him. Early reaches out for the beer, 
               but instead of taking it, he clasps his hand over hers.

               He looks at her and begins to squeeze...

                                     EARLY
                         Stop lyin'... I can see right through 
                         you.

               Early squeezes even harder -- Carrie begins to wince with 
               pain. She waits for the glass bottle to shatter in her hand.

                                     EARLY
                         Who d'ya think you're foolin'?
                              (beat)
                         I know you better than you think...

                                     CARRIE
                              (confused)
                         ...You're hurting me...

               Early hits the brakes. The car screeches to a halt in a cloud 
               of dust. Early squeezes on her hand even harder and begins 
               to drag her toward him.

                                     EARLY
                         I seen the way you been lookin' at 
                         me since we met... Snappin' my photo 
                         when you thought I wasn't lookin'. 
                         Wanting me...

               Carrie turns her head away. Early pulls her closer.

                                     EARLY
                         I saw you when I killed that boy...

               He grabs her hair with his other hand... Pulls her head around -- 
               forcing her to look at him. Early has Carrie right up against 
               him, looking right into her eyes.

                                     EARLY
                              (whispers)
                         You were plenty hot.

                                     CARRIE
                              (explodes)
                         You sick twisted fuck! You don't 
                         know shit about me.

               She struggles trying to free herself. Early, his face only 
               inches from hers, smiles...

                                     EARLY
                         Sick... some people might say takin' 
                         photos of me and Adele humpin' in 
                         the back of the car is sick.

               Carrie struggles even harder, but Early tightens his hold.

                                     EARLY
                         ...You know what I mean?

                                     CARRIE
                         ...I know I'd love to smash this 
                         bottle right in your fucking face.

               Suddenly... Early releases Carrie, taking the beer from her. 
               Carrie retreats back into the corner of the passenger side.

                                     EARLY
                         That's better... Honesty... I like 
                         that in a woman.

               He gives her a grin, then opens the bottle.

                                     EARLY
                         But I'll tell ya... when we get to 
                         California, we're gonna have to do 
                         something 'bout that gutter mouth of 
                         yours.

               Early takes a gulp of beer.

               EXT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME

               Early throws the bottle of beer out the window (it ain't 
               Lucky Lager), slams the Lincoln into "drive" and accelerates 
               along the dirt road.

               INT. MUSGRAVE LIVING ROOM

                                     MRS. MUSGRAVE
                         He's pulled out all the lines. The 
                         nearest phone is twenty miles east 
                         of here.

               Brian notices an old pickup truck parked outside.

               EXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE - THE NEXT MOMENT

               An anxious Brian hustles into the cab of the pickup truck. 
               Some tools are in the back. Brian still wears the handcuffs 
               around his wrists. Mrs. Musgrave stands near the front door.

                                     BRIAN
                         Which way did they go?

                                     MRS. MUSGRAVE
                              (pointing)
                         He took the fire road.

                                     BRIAN
                         Take your car and get to that phone. 
                         Call the police.

               Brian starts the pickup and drives off.

               EXT. DESERT - LATER

               The wind has picked up. An old wooden gate blocks the fire 
               road. On either side, barbed wire as far as the eye can see. 
               The Lincoln roars into frame and powers through the barrier.

               The gate smashes into splintered pieces of wood.

               INT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME

               Carrie leans against the passenger door. Early's eyes scan 
               the open desert -- looking for the elusive 'doors.' Carrie 
               reaches for her pack of cigarettes. Early, without a word, 
               reaches out and takes the pack from her. He crumples it up 
               and throws it out the window.

               NEW ANGLE

               Carrie's eyes go to the instrument panel. The temperature 
               gauge is in the red.

               EXT. DESERT

               The pickup truck arrives at a crossroads and skids to a halt. 
               Brian tries to guess which direction to take. Then he spots 
               Early's discarded beer bottle up ahead. The truck accelerates 
               straight ahead, tires spinning.

               EXT. DESERT - LATER, THE SUN IS ON THE HORIZON

               The winds continue to escalate, blowing harder and harder. 
               The Lincoln approaches on the fire road. A trail of steam is 
               streaming out from under the hood, blinding Early's view.

               Finally, Early slams on the brakes and skids 180 degrees to 
               a halt... Steam pours out of the Lincoln's grill. The Lincoln 
               has had it.

               Early is indifferent and looks around. About a hundred yards 
               away, barely visible through the growing sand storm, an old 
               1950's style building.

               INT. LINCOLN

               Early opens the back door. He grabs a box of supplies (some 
               rope, a kerosene lamp etc.)

                                     EARLY
                         Come on.

               Carrie slowly begins to respond. She slides across the front 
               seat.

               NEW ANGLE: CLOSE ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL

               Carrie's hand crosses frame and pulls out a knob on the dash.

               EXT. DESERT - LATE AFTERNOON

               The sun is starting to set behind a distant mountain range. 
               In the far distance... The pickup truck, revealed by its 
               trail of dust, crosses the vast landscape.

               EXT. '50'S DESERT HOUSE

               Early and Carrie struggle through the growing sand storm. 
               Carrie throws a last curious glance back to the Lincoln as 
               they reach the front door.

               INT. '50'S DESERT HOUSE

               The front door is kicked open. Early enters the room with 
               Carrie in tow.

               CLOSE ON EARLY

               He looks around the room... A smile forms on his face.

                                     EARLY
                         Howdy, my name's Early Grayce and 
                         this is my girl Carrie. I hope you 
                         don't mind us bargin' in like this 
                         but a... we was on our way to 
                         California when our car broke down, 
                         and...

               EARLY'S POV (AS HE EXPLAINS)

               A living room fully decorated in '50's furniture. Sand covers 
               everything... Including...

               A FAMILY OF FOUR MANNEQUINS placed around the room: The father 
               sits in front of the TV... The mother (the same mannequin as 
               in Mr. Musgrave's old picture) is toppled over a kitchen 
               counter... The little girl is seated at a table... The little 
               boy is playing with his toy plane on the floor.

                                     EARLY (O.S.)
                         Well... it's gettin' pretty rough 
                         out there, so if it's all the same 
                         to you, we'll be staying the night.

               EXT. '50'S HOUSE

               Early slams the front door shut.

               CAMERA PULLS AWAY - REVEALING

               The building is a single story '50's home of extremely cheap 
               construction. It's in bad condition.

               EXT. DESERT - THE SMASHED WOODEN GATE

               The last rays of the setting sun reveal the pickup truck 
               heading toward the smashed remains of the wooden gate. The 
               pickup truck hurtles through the opening left by the Lincoln.

               NEW ANGLE

               On a collapsed old wooden sign. It lies on the ground a few 
               feet away from the gate posts.

               INT. '50'S DESERT HOUSE - NIGHT

               Wind and sand blow freely through the remains of the windows. 
               A solitary kerosene lamp dimly illuminates the living room 
               area. Its flickering light finds... Early, stripped to the 
               waist, crouched over the broken TV set. He fidgets with the 
               knobs. Then the mangled rabbit ears antenna. Carrie sits on 
               some blankets in the corner next to the couch. She's scared 
               to death. Her eyes scan the battered room. Debris everywhere.

               Amidst all of it, Carrie's erotic photographs have been placed 
               about the room.

               ON EARLY

               Still unable to get the TV to work, he smacks it a good one 
               on the side.

               With the smack!... Carrie whips her look back toward Early... 
               To find he's lost interest in the TV. He turns toward Carrie. 
               Stares at her for a moment. Then with a hint of a smile, he 
               begins to move toward her. The time has arrived.

               He reaches down, grabs her by the shirt and pulls her to her 
               feet. Carrie doesn't resist. He's rough with her as he kisses 
               her on the lips. Carrie pulls her mouth away from his. She 
               seems confused, unsure of her feelings. Early watches her, 
               until her eyes come back to his. Then she steps forward 
               crowding her body against his, as she slips one hand around 
               his neck and kisses him deep and hard...

               Suddenly Early breaks the kiss and backhands Carrie hard 
               across the face. She lands on the floor several feet away, 
               the palm of her right hand is bleeding.

               Early looks down to his waist to find a large piece of glass 
               protruding from his side.

               He pulls the glass shard out, blood drips down his side and 
               onto his jeans.

               Carrie gets up and races into the back bedroom, frantically 
               looking for a way out, there is none. On the bed the two 
               adult mannequins now lie naked. They have been placed, 
               intertwined in a grotesque sexual position.

               Carrie turns and rushes back toward the door. Early intercepts 
               her and throws a punch to her stomach, which doubles her 
               over. Then Early sends a second punch to her face, she 
               stumbles backward, landing onto the bed amongst the 
               mannequins. Early begins undoing his belt.

                                     EARLY
                              (friendly)
                         You'll like it...

               A violent gust of wind sends several of the erotic photos 
               swirling through the air. One of the photos whips across 
               Early's chest. The wind holds it there momentarily.

                                     EARLY
                         Not a lot, but you'll like it.

               Early peels Carrie's photo off him, the blood from his wound 
               covers the back of it. He slaps it against the nearest wall. 
               It sticks. He walks toward her.

               INT. PICKUP TRUCK - BRIAN'S POV

               The high winds have turned into a full fledged sandstorm. 
               Brian is still driving dangerously fast. The dim lights of 
               the old pickup illuminate only a short stretch of dirt road 
               ahead and the swirling sand.

               He passes a road sign: 'DEVASTATION DRIVE'

               Then... As the pickup truck comes around a corner Suddenly... 
               directly in front of him -- Headlights!!

               Brian reacts... too late!!

               The pickup truck ploughs into the vehicle, and tumbles end 
               over end through the open desert, before finally coming to 
               an abrupt halt.

               INT. '50'S DESERT HOUSE - NIGHT

               With each thrust of Early's body, Carrie's badly bruised 
               face contorts with pain and hatred

               FADE IN:

               EXT. DESERT

               Sand blows in through the smashed windshield of the wrecked 
               pickup truck. Brian is upside down with his eyes shut. A 
               trickle of blood runs down his face. Camera booms up a dirt 
               slope to reveal the Lincoln, beyond it on the hill above 
               sits the desert house. The glow of the kerosene lamp is 
               visible through the windows.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. DESERT HOUSE - DAWN

               The storm is over... No sand blowing. No wind. No nothing.

               COMPLETE SILENCE!!!!

               The dawn light reveals the devastated '50's house to be one 
               of a cluster, set at the end of a 'Doom Town' cul-de-sac.

               INT. '50'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

               In the darkened bedroom, Early's solitary figure rustles 
               atop the bed. Slowly, he awakens. His eyes open. Across the 
               bed, a pair of handcuffs is locked around the bedpost. In 
               the other cuff is Carrie's motionless hand.

               Then, out of the corner of his eye, Early sees something in 
               one of the nearby rooms. Curious, he stands, shoves the .45 
               automatic in his waistband and walks toward the hallway.

               As he passes through the living room and enters the hallway, 
               his face contorts with a strange sense of wonderment.

               EARLY'S POV

               A blinding light is shafting through cracks and broken gaps 
               around the front door frame... It looks like a magical "door" 
               shrouded in a wall of light!

               ON EARLY

               In disbelief he pulls his gaze away from the "door"... and 
               sees through a window at the opposite end of the house... 
               the morning sun rising. With that he turns his attention 
               back to the front door!

                                     EARLY
                         I knew there was doors out here!

               He walks toward the doorway of light. He grins as he opens 
               the "door" and steps through it. The sunlight momentarily 
               blinding him.

               EARLY'S POV

               A black shadow hurtles toward him out of the brightness... 
               Eventually it blocks out all the light until... WHAAMM!!!!

               EXT. DOOR

               A blow knocks Early back through the doorway. He slams to 
               the ground, on his back. The gun falls from his jeans and 
               slides across the floor. A look of joyful amazement over the 
               blood covered remains of his face, he tries to get up, but 
               can't.

               EARLY'S POV

               Brian, silhouetted, steps into the doorway. He holds a shovel 
               raised, ready to deliver a second, fatal blow... but when he 
               sees Early incapacitated on the floor, he lowers the shovel 
               to his side. His handcuffed hands reach down and picks up 
               Early's gun. He trains it on Early, then walks around him to 
               enter the house. Brian's eyes slowly adjust to the interior...

               EARLY'S POV

               From on his back, Early looks out the open "door." He sees 
               two large shards of glass standing vertical in the sand, 
               reflecting the sun's rays back toward the house. He realizes 
               that the glass, placed there by Brian, is what created the 
               effect of the "door." He starts to laugh.

                                     EARLY
                              (laughing)
                         That was damn tricky of you Bri.

               Brian searches for Carrie.

                                     BRIAN
                         Carrie... Carrie... it's over.

               ON BRIAN

               He moves into the back bedroom and finds Carrie. She is 
               crouched on the floor, handcuffed to the bedframe. He moves 
               to help her. As he gets closer, he sees her badly bruised 
               face and realizes what's taken place throughout the night.

               Brian stops. The sympathetic expression on his face changes. 
               With hatred in his eyes, he pivots around, strides out of 
               the bedroom and moves toward the front of the house to Early. 
               in the front room Gun in hand, Brian rushes back into the 
               room. He wields the pistol toward the ground where Early 
               lay... but Early's not there.

               Brian's eyes dart around the room... then suddenly, from 
               behind him, Early grabs him!

               He wrenches Brian's head back and whips his belt buckle knife 
               toward his throat!

               Brian manages to lift his hands to his neck an instant before 
               the knife tears through his flesh. The knife slices a vicious 
               wound across the back of Brian's right hand. He drops the 
               gun to the floor. Brian elbows Early in the ribs and pulls 
               away from him. He reaches to the ground for the gun, but 
               Early kicks him in the stomach and sends him crumbling to 
               his knees.

                                     EARLY
                         Go ahead Bri, ask me something.
                              (beat)
                         You wanna know how I'm feeling'? 
                         Well I'd say I'm feelin' pretty damn 
                         good.

               On all fours, Brian reaches out for the gun, but Early kicks 
               it across the room.

                                     EARLY
                         How 'bout you? You feelin' good?

               Another kick to Brian's chest. The wind rushes out of him.

                                     EARLY
                         ...'Cause you sure don't look so 
                         good.
                              (beat)
                         Or maybe you're feelin'... powerful. 
                         That it, you feeling powerful? 
                         Superior? I know I am.

               Early unloads a ferocious kick to the side of Brian's face! 
               His head snaps back, his handcuffed arms buckle and he falls 
               flat to the ground.

                                     EARLY
                         What? Am I angry with my daddy? Now 
                         why would I be angry with my daddy... 
                         you're the one hit me with the shovel. 
                         And you're the one's gonna wish you 
                         hadn't.

               With one last effort, Brian manages to pull himself back up 
               to his knees. He focuses on the gun ahead of him and tries 
               to crawl toward it. But Early's foot shoves Brian. He flips 
               over onto his back, landing in front of the bedroom doorway. 
               Early moves toward him, knife in hand.

               As Early moves toward Brian, unexpectedly from inside the 
               doorway, the torso of the female child mannequin whips past. 
               Her hardened molten face slams into Early's bloodied face. 
               Early stumbles backward.

               Brian crawls for the gun and grabs it. From his knees he 
               turns, steadies the weapon, takes a quick breath... and fires. 
               Hitting Early square in the chest!

               Early falls to the ground on his back. Brian lifts himself 
               to his feet.

               He sees that Carrie has dragged the bedframe to the doorway, 
               and in her free hand she holds the child mannequin by the 
               leg.

               Gun in hand, Brian steps over to Early. Early's body is still. 
               Blood oozes from the hole in his chest. On a silver chain 
               around his neck is the key to Brian and Carrie's handcuffs. 
               Brian reaches down and grabs the keys... when suddenly Early's 
               arm springs up from his side. His hand grabs Brian's shirt 
               collar. Brian is startled by the move, then realizes that 
               Early's hold is weak. His fingers tremble. Finally his arm 
               drops back down to his side.

                                     EARLY
                         Hey Bri... I think I need a doctor. 
                         What d'ya say?

               The two men stare at one another for a moment... then Brian, 
               with one hand still on the handcuff keys, shoves the .45 
               automatic firmly under Early's chin.

               CLOSE ON BRIAN

                                     BRIAN
                         ...Sorry 'bout this Early.

               o.s. BANG!! rings out as...

               CLOSE UP on the chain and keys snapping free from Early's 
               neck.

               CLOSE UP on Brian's handcuffs hitting the dusty wooden floor.

               CLOSE UP on Carrie's handcuff swinging empty against the 
               rusty bedpost.
