          All eight weeks of it. And you know

          I'll see you in the morning, okay?
          Marley looks at him with a heartbreaking expression. John

          Not only has everything has been chewed, but some time during

          wreaking havoc, knocking over everything that isn't nailed
          down. John picks up the HUGE CHEW TOY he'd just bought and
          examines it as Marley runs into the bathroom...

          screen door, bounces back.

          It's a mess. It's almost incredible that it's all due to a
          single puppy. The box is in shreds; so are the blankets. A
          puddle of urine on the floor. A large piece of dry wall has
          been chewed off near the big garage door. The garbage cans
          are overturned. Marley is whimpering in the corner.

          Jenny orders Marley to sit; instead Marley jumps up on her
          and puts his paws on her shoulders. She presses his butt to
          the ground, and he rolls over for a belly rub. She tries to
          tug him into place and he grabs the leash in his teeth,
          shaking it playfully.

          MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)
          That, class, is an example of a dog
          that has been foolishly allowed to
          believe he is the alpha male of his
          pack. And therefore he cannot be a

          As Ms. Kornblut demonstrates on her wrist.

          MS. KORNBLUT
          The choke chain. When your animal
          walks properly by your side, there'll
          be slack. If he pulls, it tightens
          around his neck like a noose and
          loosens as soon as he stops pulling.

                         JOHN
          Does it hurt them?

          MS. KORNBLUT
          Well, it's not called a hug chain. But
          they learn to like it. Go on, collar
          your dogs.
          Everyone else quickly, easily gets the choke chain around
          their dogs' necks. Of course. Meanwhile:
          John kneels down and struggles to put it. around Marley's

          That's because he's eating it... Get it
          out of his mouth. Class? Give your
          dogs the sit command.
          All the dogs sit; John forces Marley's butt down.

          MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)
          The leash is held in two places. Loop
          around your right hand, left hand at
          waist level. Dog always on your left,
          of course.

                         JOHN
          That means us, pal.
          He rearranges Marley so he's on John's left.

          MS. KORNBLUT
          Now, when you give the heel command,
          step off with your left foot - I don't
          want to see any right foot first
          steppers - and walk. If your dog gets
          ahead, administer a correction by
          forcefully bring your left hand down
          and towards the right, and he'll
          respond. Shall we? One, two, three -

          Just as the dogs and owners prepare to step off, Marley

          Class? Even an unruly dog wants to
          obey his leader. Marley? Heel.
          And she steps off confidently - but Marley is a bit more
          confident than she is. He lunges, she pulls, he falls back
          on his hind legs, then barrels up and lurches forward.
          Ms. Kornblut half-stumbles, half rockets across the park.
          She manages to turn Marley around, and the whole process
          begins again as they make their way back to the line. Her
          face is flushed with embarrassment, anger, and exertion, but
          Marley, jowls frothing, is having a ball. It's like a
          walking tug-of-war.
          With difficulty, Ms. Kornblut manages to return Marley to
          John, but not before, as a coup-de-grace, he starts humping
          her leg enthusiastically. She struggles, he knocks her down,
          and then he buries his face in her crotch and humps her knee.
          John and Jenny rush over. John restrains Marley; Jenny helps
          up Mrs. Kornblut. She's livid.

          John, he's out of control. It's the

          It won't be so bad, buddy. You'll see.

          Okay, I'm lying, and I think you know
          that... so maybe the best thing is to
          just not talk about it.
          Jenny cuts him a look. He lowers his voice.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Poor son-of-a-bitch.
          A guilty John cracks the window just a bit and Marley begins
          listing to starboard, leaning against John to catch a whiff
          of the outdoor smells. Marley crawls onto John's lap...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Oh, okay, you wanna sit up here...

          catch the fresh air

          Here you go...
          John lowers the window again and now Marley sticks his whole
          head out, ears flapping behind him, tongue hanging out like
          he's drunk.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          He's so happy. He has no idea what's
          about to happen to him.
          Jenny looks over as Marley hooks his paws over the half open
          window so that his neck and upper shoulders now hang out of
          the car.

          his front armpits are resting on the glass.

          Before John can do anything, Marley is off his lap and
          scrambling out the window of the moving car.

          He's onto our evil plan, and he's

          so that Marley dangles upside down, outside the car, by his

          can't open the door. He can't let go as angry drivers behind

          smile as he passes. John sits there another moment, looks at
          his desk. A photo of him and Jenny. One of Marley with a flip

          Debby. Welcome to our home! Marley is
          a spirited dog who loves interaction.
          We've never left him before but we're
          sure he'll behave just as he does when
          we're at home.

          There are just a few things about
          Marley you need to know. He eats three

          water. Debby splashes water at him to make him go away.
          Marley, thinking she's playing, scrambles into the tub with
          her. She grabs the curtain, and it pops off the curtain

          box.

          onto the patio and pool, a huge yellow lab now leaping in.
          A moment later, we see John, clutching Patrick, enter the
          backyard, try to haul Marley out of the pool. He gives up,
          heads for the house, opens the back door and peers inside.

          sits down with him in a rocking chair, tries to nurse him...

          She finally stops trying, rocks the chair, looks helplessly
          at John.

          I don't know what's wrong with me.
          Mothers are supposed to be able to give
          their baby everything.

          He's just colicky, Jen. He'll grow out
          of it.

          Okay, here's an idea, you stay here and
          I'll go to work while he grows out of
          it.
          He holds up his hands, what does he say to that. She looks
          up at him a moment.

          I'm just tired, alright? Go on.
          She then resumes trying to nurse the baby. He walks out of
          the room. She rocks back and forth, looks up with a dark
          expression as she hears his CAR START.

          Her hormones are all on tilt and she's
          depressed. It happens. After my
          fourth kid was born, I'd wake up, find
          my wife just staring at me with a
          mallet in her hand. I thought she was

          John just nods stupidly, the dagger so deep in his heart,
          he'll never reach it. She smiles at him.

          You certainly look a lot better than
          Jerry ever looked. I tried to get him
          to take a new picture, but he liked the
          one they took the day he started the
          column, nineteen years ago.

          Nineteen years, huh...
          And just when he thought one dagger was brutal enough, his
          expression goes really pensive. And on that look, we see a

          chases Marley around the room. John sits in the car, unable
          to move, just watching the chaos in the window.
          Marley jumps up against the glass, stands on his hind legs,
          paws to the window and looks out. He barks and now Jenny
          comes up behind him, hauls him off the window and now sees
          John sitting in the car. She gives him a look that says
          "What're you doing? Get in here!"

          There's a florist kiosk in the center of the plaza; Marley-

          Security guards look around wildly. It's pandemonium, but
          Marley is in heaven. He makes a circuit of the entire plaz a,

          But Marley jumps onto John's lap as they get going...

          ON THE TOBOGGAN
          Flying down the hill. Marley is much heavier than the kids,
          and they sail past the place where the kids stopped, through
          the woods, barely missing trees and low-hanging branches,

          John! The creek!
          The toboggan bumps over the crest of a small hill and sails
          through the air, landing with a crash on the iced-over creek.
          John and Marley tumble into a snow bank on the opposite side.
          A moment. But then Marley jumps up and wriggles in delight.
          John painfully unfolds himself, checks for injuries. Marley
          comes up and romps with him.

          John shuts off all of the lights, heads upstairs. We follow
          him up the stairs. He stops near the top, peers through the
          bannister into...

          183 PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 183
          From the low angle of the stairs, Patrick lies on his side,
          sleeping. And then we see Marley's head rise and reveal
          itself as Marley lifts it to look at John standing there.
          He'd been laying there on the bed behind Patrick. He looks
          at John, knows he's not supposed to be there, but...

                         JOHN

          Early Spring. The snow has melted. Marley, still as a

          stands up and starts to wag his tail.

          A moment later, a yellow dot appears on the horizon. As it
          gets closer, Marley gets more and more excited as we now see
          that the dot is a SCHOOL BUS. It pulls to a stop beside
          Marley. Conor and Patrick get off and are greeted by Marley.

                         PATRICK
          Hey, boy.
          We HOLD WIDE ON THEIR BACKS as the boys start up the road

          And he collapses with the boys at the foot of the. steps,
          Marley all over them, licking whatever faces he can get.
          Colleen comes out the front door, stands at the top of the

          211 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 211

          Jenny and Patrick are sitting on the floor. Marley is lying
          on the dining room floor, breathing heavily.

                         JENNY
          Patrick came home and we got him here.
          Dr. Platt said if he's comfortable,
          leave him here for a while and see.
          But he's no better.
          John kneels down by Marley, who looks at him but doesn't wag
          his tail or lick his hand. He runs his hand over his coat -
          then over his stomach, the dog flinches.

                         JOHN
          I'm taking him in.
          The kids all come into the room, Colleen carrying a stuffed
          sheep.

                         COLLEEN
          Is he sick again?

                         JOHN
          Yeah, he is, honey. But I'm going to
          take him to the hospital and they'll
          try to make him better.
          Conor bends down, nuzzles Marley's face.

                         CONOR
          Get better, Mar.

                         COLLEEN
          You can take Lamby, okay?
          (she puts the stuffed animal
          next to him)
          But don't chew her other ear off.
          Patrick leans down, hugs Marley tightly and whispers right in

                         HIS EAR:

                         PATRICK
          Goodbye.
          When he looks up at his father, John can see that Patrick's
          crying, that he knows what the other two don't.

          212 EXT. VET'S - NIGHT 212

          John lifts Marley out of the car. Marley seems a little more
          alert.

                         JOHN
          You wanna walk?
          He sets him down gingerly. Hesitantly, Marley walks over to
          the tree that countless dogs have peed on, sniffs it, then
          looks around. John looks around, too. It's a crisp spring
          night in Pennsylvania. Takes a breath...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Nice night, huh?
          Marley looks around, then looks at John. There's something
          in his expression. John nods, knows what he's saying.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Okay, boy.
          (as Marley moves close)
          Okay.
          John, his heart breaking, bends down to carry Marley up the
          front steps of the clinic.

          DR. PLATT
          I did everything that worked before.
          But no luck. There's still surgery,

                         BUT HE'S--

                         JOHN
          --not strong enough.

          DR. PLATT
          There's blood in his stomach. The
          lining might be compromised. I don't
          know what we'll find if we go in there
          anyway.

                         JOHN

          John enters. Marley is on the table, zonked out. Dr. Platt
          has put a blanket on the cold metal table so Marley is warm.

          DR. PLATT
          I'll give you some time.
          She goes. John stares down at Marley. Takes the stuffed
          lamb out of his pocket, places it under a paw. When John
          puts a hand on his flank, Marley's eyes flutter open. His
          tail THUMPS gently.

                         JOHN
          Hey, buddy.
          He pets Marley's head, runs his hands all over Marley's body.
          His coat, still shedding. His tail. He takes up each paw,
          each ear, remembering and memorizing at the same time. He
          leans down, puts his nose on Marley's neck and breathes him
          in. Then he goes around, squats down so he's on Marley's
          level. He looks into Marley's eyes.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Listen, you know all that stuff we
          always said about you? What a total
          pain you are? The world's worst dog?
          Well, don't you believe it. Don't
          believe it for a minute. You loved us,
          every day, no matter what. And that's
          a pretty amazing thing.

          Dr. Platt is in the room now. John, his hand on one of
          Marley's paws, kneels on the ground, looking at Marley,
          Marley lays on the table, looking right back at him.

          DR. PLATT
          He won't feel a thing. He'll just slip
          away. Are you ready?

          TWO-YEAR-OLD PATRICK rides on Marley's back through the house
