          table beneath; pinning his hand. Marco wants to scream
          but there is so much pain, nothing escapes his throat.

          far side of the courtyard, opens it, and disappears. One
          of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the
          gate, hiding it.

           Very tired.
                         
          The girls all around twitter. Sherri looks back at them,
          no good rising on her smirking face.
           24.
                         
                          SHERRI

          She points halfway down the aisle to an empty bed. Cat is
          about to walk towards it, when Sherri puts a beefy hand in
          her chest.

           Twenty dollars.
                         
          Cat looks at Sherri. Looks at the other girls all hanging
          on every word, waiting to see what jumps off.
                         
          Cat considers, then reaches into her jumper and extracts
          the twenty dollars the headmisstress gave her. Hands it
          over to Sherri.

           y'know what I'm saying?
                         
          Cat says nothing, just stares at Sherri.
                         
                          SHERRI

           Twenty dollars a week.
                         
          Sherri opens her sweatshirt to reveal a fanny pack. She
          unzips it, puts Cat's twenty in with a wad of other
          twenties.
                         
                          SHERRI

          The other girls hoot and whistle. Sherri removes her hand
          from Cat's chest.
                         
                          SHERRI

           In peace.
                         
          Cat still says nothing. She walks up the aisle past all
          the other girls, who remain silent. It is only after Cat
          has laid down on her bed, that the laughing and twittering
          resumes.
           25.
                         
          Cat stares at the ceiling, her hand reaches inside her
          jumper, takes out the medal her father gave her. She holds
          it close in her hand, just lays that way.

          CLOSE ON CAT
                         
          Her eyes still open, her hand clutching her father's medal.

          INT. HALL - NIGHT
                         
          Cat makes her way down the hall. At the end of the Hall
          is a door marked EXIT. But she is not looking at the exit
          she is looking for something else. And she finds it. A
          door marked: HEADMISTRESS.
                         
          Cat tries the door, it is locked. She takes her father's
          medal from around her neck, and uses it to pop the lock.
          Looking left and right to make sure the coast is clear,
          she enters.

          Cat tries the drawer where the Headmistress locked her
          money away. She looks around, takes a letter opener off
          the desk, pops the drawer, extracts the envelope with her
          name on it.

          Again Cat walks down the darkened hall, looking for another

          Cat walks along the cabinets containing the pharmaceuticals
          until she finds what she is looking for. She smashes the
          glass door, reaches in, extracts one bottle.

          Cat pours the contents of the bottle out into the cloth.
          Seals the bottle. Puts it down. Then takes the cloth and
          places it over Sherri's sleeping face, ever so gently.

          1. A twenty dollar bill on each bed.

          of the bed with belts, her shirt pulled up, her money belt
          gone. And the word THIEF written in magic marker across

          merchandise.
                         
          In another room, guns are being serviced. Lots of guns,

          Cat enters an office with three women working on computers.
          Looks like any other business office. At the sight of
          Cat, the women get up and exit, closing the door behind
          them. Cat is left alone.
                         
          She looks around the office, when the sound of a door
          opening behind her. She turns to Emilio. Who approaches
          her cautiously, scrutinizing her.

          Cat stands stock still. Emilio takes her up in his arms,
          lifts her, crushes her to his chest. Cat remains suspended,
          emotionless for a moment. And then, for the first time
          emotion, real emotion, washes across her face. Her lower
          lip begins to tremble. Tears well up in her eyes. She
          bursts into tears.

          All the emotion, the fear, the anger that she has kept
          locked away deep inside, rushes to the surface in one
          massive wave.

          Mama caresses her face, her eyes glisten with a
          grandmother's love. Kisses her on the forehead, lovingly,

           Well good. A growing body needs
           sleep. When I was your age I would
           sleep half the day. I don't know

          years of dust and grime, surrounded by a fence, and a weedy
          garden which is home to dozens of the most unique wind
          chimes of all sizes and shapes, made from scrap metal.
          And two of the biggest, most ferocious dogs on Earth, laying
          on their sides, asleep.
                         
          The dog's ears perk up; hearing something we don't, a low
          growl begins to rumble deep in their throats. The gate to
          the garden begins to open, and like a shot the dogs are
          up, hurling themselves toward the opening gate, eyes
          flashing, barking loud enough to scare the dead back to
          life, fangs bared, ready to kill.
                         
          And then they stop cold when they see who it is coming
          into their domain.

           Hi guys.
                         
          And the dogs jump all over her, licking her.
                         
                          CAT

          She pets them, plays with them.
                         
                          CAT
           OK. OK. Now sit.
           65.
                         
          The dogs obey her in a heartbeat, sitting expectantly.
          Not making a sound.
                         
                          CAT

           can be.

          roasts!
                         
                          CAT
           Top cut sirloin.
                         
          Which she puts down on the ground. The dog's eyes go to
          the chunks of meat.
                         
                          CAT
           Nice, huh?
                         
          The dogs can barely contain themselves.
                         
                          CAT
           Red, juicy, delicious.
                         
          The dogs whimper in anticipation.
                         
                          CAT
           Stay.
                         
          She picks up the shopping bags, and heads for the ramshackle
          warehouse. The dogs moan, but do not move, their eyes
          going from the meat to Cat.
                         
          Cat reaches the door. Turns. Sees the dogs looking at
          her.
                         
                          CAT
           Good boys.

           Eat.
                         
          The dogs pounce. Each one grabs a roast and tears into
          the meat with ferocious, pent up glee. Cat smiles at the
          sight, enters the warehouse.

          The warehouse, is filled with piles of rusting scrap metal,
          the cannibalized carcasses of cars, trucks, shipping
          containers, welding equipment, hammers tongs, all sorts of
          tools. In the corner is one fully built truck, a big red
          monster with huge demolition fenders.
                         
          This is home to OLD PEPE, an ancient, blind man, who is
          working away, building yet another set of oversized chimes
          out of scrap metal.

           Anyone else? The barking would
           only have stopped when their
           screaming began. You spoil them.

          Cat kisses Pepe, taps one of the chimes, it makes the most
          ethereal sound as one chime bangs against the other. She
          opens a cupboard in the makeshift kitchen area, and starts
          unpacking the groceries.

          She moves from the kitchen, walks across to the far wall.

                          PEPE
           You could start with that one. It

           away. How was your trip?
                         
          Cat starts to remove some of the cash. Starts to count
          it. Stick it in her pocket.

                          PEPE
           You work too much. I keep telling
           that to Emilio. The girl should
           have a life while she is still
           young enough to enjoy it. You
           should take a vacation. Go some
           place warm. With a nice beach.

          Giggling, the girls scamper toward the villa, where a
          sumptuous table is set on the veranda, attended by more
          servants. William is handed a drink, as he sips it, watches
          their perfect, barely covered butts, his eyes pools of

          As they all enter the villa, the CAMERA lingers on the

          The Head of Security goes around the villa checking that
          all the doors and windows are secure. His men are posted
          outside the door to the bedroom, on the stairs, in the
          salon. He closes lights as he goes.
           71.
                         
          He walks across the aquarium floor in the foyer to the
          front door, closes the lights, so that only the glow from
          the aquarium lights illuminate the dark. And he exits,
          closing the door behind him, turning the lock.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE AQUARIUM
                         
          The sharks gliding back and forth. And then, a figure in
          a black wet suit, fins and a mask, with a small back back,
          comes gliding into through the sharks. Who just go about
          their business. The figure stops at the edge of the glass
          floor, takes something out of the back pack and very
          skillfully cuts a small hole in one of the glass panels
          that makes up the floor.
                         
          The diver lifts out of the aquarium, pulls back the wet
          suit. It is Cat.

          Cat enters, silent, closes the door, approaches the bed
          where William is asleep sandwiched between the three passed
          out girls. Empty champagne bottles and glasses are strewn
          about.
                         
          Cat stares down at the scene, points her gun at William.
          One of the girls rolls over onto William, ruining her shot.
          She hesitates.

          As sits up suddenly, startled from sleep. No one is in
          the room. He looks around, and notices the bedroom door
          ajar. He is more awake now, sees the Nymphettes sleeping
          soundly. He rises, dressed in a silk sleeping robe. He
          feels something on his chest, goes over to the mirror,
          opens his gown and sees, painted on his chest: In red
          lipstick, the word THIEF, and a drawing of a Cataleya
          orchid. Panic starts to set in.

          No answer.
                         
          William tip toes to the ajar door. He peeks out and sees
          two guards with bullets through their foreheads, blood
          leaked out across the white marble floor. Really panicked,
          he flattens himself against the inside of the door, his
          breath coming in gasps.

          William, holding the two guns of the dead guards in front
          of him, makes his way down stairs, past two more dead
          guards. Growing more and more nervous by the moment, he
          tries a light switch on the wall, nothing.
           72.
                         
          The only light comes from the ambient glow of the aquarium
          below. He reaches the bottom of the stairs.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Anybody?
                         
          No answer. He crosses the aquarium floor, and when he is
          right in the middle...
                         
                          CAT
           Stop right there.
                         
          Cat comes out of the dark. In her hand, a silencer fitted
          pistol.

           Doesn't matter who I am.
                         
          He pulls the trigger on his gun. Click, click, click. He
          tries the other one. Again click click click.
                         
                          WILLIAM

                          CAT
           I want you exactly where you are.
                         
          And then, without warning, she puts a bullet in both his
          knees.

          He falls to the floor. The blood starts to seep out onto
          the glass. The sharks swim back and forth.
                         
                          WILLIAM

           they will just ignore you, but put

          on. The glass shatters. William falls into the water.
          Grabs onto the squares on either side and props himself
          up. His blood runs down into the clear water. Cat turns
          and walks toward the door.

          as austere as Cat's. Heads for the small kitchen, where
          he is about to put his precooked meal in the microwave.
          When he feels a gun in the back of his neck.
                         
                          CAT
           This won't take long. Hands up.
                         
          Ross raises his hands. Cat reaches around, removes his
          gun.
                         
                          CAT
           Turn around.
                         
          Ross faces her.
           99.
                         
                          CAT
           Sit.
                         
          She motions him into the chair behind him.
                         
                          ROSS
           Just so you know, all this? Being
           so smart? Covering all your bases?
           It's not going to matter. It's
           already over. The whole place is
           wired with web cams.
                         
          His moment of triumph is short lived. Cat reaches on the
          side of the counter. Holds up six web cams, wires ripped
          out.
                         
                          CAT
           You mean these?
                         
          Tosses the ripped out cams onto the table.
                         
                          CAT
           Talking about covering all your
           bases. Your chair is pressure
           wired. You move your ass one inch
           you don't have one anymore.
                         
          Ross looks under the chair. Sure enough, there are several
          wires leading out of the bottom of the chair. He looks
          further to the where the wires attach to a small charge.
          She puts her gun down on the table.
                         
                          CAT
           I know what you're thinking. Maybe
           yes a bluff, maybe no. But you
           have to figure yes, given what you
           know about me.
                         
          Ross does not move.
                         
                          CAT
           This wasn't what I had in mind for
           myself when I was a kid. I wanted
           to be on the other side of things.
           Like you.
                         
                          ROSS
           So what happened?
                         
                          CAT
           He did.
                         
          She takes out an old picture of Don Luis, lifted from the
          internet. She takes out the picture of her parents and
          her as an eight year old.
                         
                          CAT

           And all this? All these
           clues...they weren't for us. They
           were for him.
                         
                          CAT

           By a part of the government I have
           no way of reaching. It's CIA. I
           don't know why. But there's no

           I know this sounds harsh. But
           until I get what I want, you'll go
           to a funeral a week. And you will

          She places the photo album in his lap. Puts his food in
          the microwave, starts it. Goes to exit.

           When your dinner's ready, the timer
           on it will have expired. Then you
           can get to work.
                         
          And she is gone. Ross watches the timer on the microwave.
          When it beeps, he sits a moment longer. Hesitates to get
          up. Little by little, he moves himself off the chair,
          tentative. Afraid that any moment, BOOM! Until he makes
          the final move, stands just enough to clear the seat,
          waiting for the worst to happen. And when it doesn't, he
          breathes a sigh of relief.
