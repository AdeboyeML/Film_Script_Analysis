          1 INT. DARK STAGE - NIGHT 1
                         
                          OPENING CREDITS:
                         
           A SPOTLIGHT slices black space.
                         
           In its beam, a DANCER materializes. She is fair-skinned.
           Beautiful and pure.
                         
           The maiden twirls on pointe, a smile on her face, light as
           air and carefree.
                         
           She pauses, her face grows worried. Sensing someone watching.
                         
           Scared, she peers into the darkness.
                         
           She moves now, looking, growing more frantic.
                         
           Then, a SINISTER MAN emerges out of the darkness behind her.
           She stumbles backwards, frightened.
                         
           She tries to escape, twirling away, but he pursues. His true
           form is revealed, the demon ROTHBART.
                         
           He flings his open hand towards her, casting the spell.
                         
           She wants to scream, but nothing comes out. She looks at her
           body, sensing something happening to her. Something
           terrifying.
                         
           She spins, panicking, but it's too late. She disappears
           beneath the beast's cape.
                         
           She emerges as the WHITE SWAN, the iconic protagonist of SWAN
           LAKE.
                         
           CUT TO BLACK.
                         
                         
          2 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 2
                         
           In the darkness, a pair of EYES. They belong to NINA, the
           same dancer. She lies awake in bed, thinking about her dream.
                         
           The room looks like it hasn't been redecorated since she was
           a teenager. Stuffed animals. Dolls. Pink and frilly.
                         
           The door opens, throwing LIGHT on her face. Nina looks
           towards the door and smiles softly at whoever opened it.
                         
           Nina sits up and hangs her BARE FEET off the side of the bed.
           Like all ballerinas, she's beautiful and her feet are
           atrocious. Covered in corns, broken blisters and bunions. She
           arches them, doing her first extensions of the day.
           2.
                         
          3 INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 3
                         
           The room is empty of furniture to leave space for dancing. A
           large mirror covers the opposite wall entirely.
                         
           Nina rubs her knees to get them warm, and then begins her
           morning exercises, extending and contracting her feet and
           legs in precise and rhythmic motions.
                         
           The skin on her chest stretches tautly over her sternum.
           Defined vertebrae run up her back, sinewy muscles contract as
           she moves. Her slender neck leads into her hair, contained
           in a ballerina's bun.
                         
           Nina looks serene as she moves, completely in her element.
                         
           She hears someone fussing about in the kitchen.

           Still no answer.
                         
           Nina continues to stretch.
                         
                         
          4 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 4
                         
           Nina sits at the table. An older woman, ERICA, places a
           POACHED EGG and a QUARTER-GRAPEFRUIT in front of her.

          They giggle and Erica resumes packing Nina's shoulder bag
          with extra clothing, shoes, snack filled tupperware, duct
          tape, ribbon, thread, etc.

           He certainly should. You're the
           most dedicated dancer in the
           company.
                         
          Nina smiles, comforted, and begins taking her vitamins.
                         
          Erica walks over with a SWEATSHIRT and holds it above her.
          Nina pulls it over her head and starts to push her arms
          through the sleeves.
           3.

           Erica points to her shoulder. Nina feels and finds a small
           SCRATCH MARK.
                         
           She shrugs and shakes her head.
                         
           Erica gives her a suspicious look, but lets it go and smiles.
           Nina finishes pulling down the sweatshirt.
                         
           Erica hugs Nina into her chest and kisses the top of her
           head.

          5 INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY 5
                         
           Nina rides inside a crowded subway, staring absentmindedly at
           her faint reflection in the train's window.
                         
           Suddenly, another train roars by on the opposite track,
           snapping her awake.
                         
           In the next train car, she sees the back of a BALLERINA
           standing in the midst of the crowd. Her head bops to music
           playing through iPod earphones.
                         
           Nina moves a strand of hair out of her eyes, and at that
           exact moment, the girl in the next car moves in the same way.
           Mirroring her.
                         
           Unnerved, Nina slowly lowers her arm. So does the other girl.
           Although Nina can't quite see her face, the girl seems
           IDENTICAL from Nina's vantage point.
           4.
                         
           The train jerks to a stop as it arrives at a station. Nina
           sees the girl head to the exit. She cranes to see her face,
           but her view's obscured.
                         
           The doors slide shut and the train pulls out. Nina watches
           the platform whisk by, keeping her eyes peeled, but she
           doesn't see the girl.

           Nina emerges from the subway station onto a city street.
                         
           She arrives at the MAJESTIC-LOOKING THEATER, where a few
           other BALLERINAS likewise trickle towards the entrance. They
           all look strangely similar: slender, carrying shoulder bags,
           wearing leggings and loose sweatshirts.
                         
           She passes a ROW OF POSTERS featuring the company's prima
           ballerina, BETH MACINTYRE.
                         
           Nina looks at them, a little envious, before continuing on to
           the STAGE DOOR.

           Crammed into a single dressing room, Nina and the company's 5
           SOLOISTS get ready for rehearsal. Chatting, sewing ribbon
           onto shoes, applying makeup, putting band-aids on blisters.
                         
           Nina removes a new pair of BALLET SHOES, admires them for a
           moment, before cutting off the satin toe with scissors.

           it flow.
                         
           Flustered, Nina nods and tries to follow her instruction.
                         
           Suddenly, the girls around Nina begin stripping off their
           sweatshirts and insulated pants.
                         
           Nina sees that the intense and brooding director of the
           company, THOMAS LEROY, has entered the space. He has the
           unkept look of an artist. Magnetic and intense.
                         
           The ballerinas remove their warm-up gear to show off their
           bodies.
                         
           Leroy walks around the room, judging his flock. Smiles and
           glances are thrown his way.
                         
           He goes up to the ballet mistress, takes her hand and kisses
           her on the cheek. Even she manages a smile.
           7.
                         
          He heads to the line of soloists, studying them.
                         
                          LEROY
           We all know the story: virginal
           girl, pure and sweet, trapped in
           the body of a swan. She desires
           freedom, but only true love can
           break the spell.
                         
          He taps a dancer on the shoulder, she lights up. He walks,
          then taps another. A selection process of some kind.
                         
          Nina looks nervous, has an inkling of what it means.

           a prince.
                         
          He nears Nina. She sneaks peeks at him, eager and hopeful.
          He acknowledges her with a small nod and a smile.
                         
          But he walks on without tapping her. She deflates.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But before he can declare his love,
           her lustful twin, the Black Swan,
           tricks and seduces him.
                         
          He approaches the New Girl. Nina watches, threatened.
                         
          But he doesn't tap her either.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Devastated, the White Swan leaps
           off a cliff, killing herself. But,
           in death, finds freedom.
                         
          He taps one more soloist and then CLAPS.
                         
          The music stops and all the girls face him, attentive.

           Good morning, company.
                         
          They respond "Good morning" in nervous, unsure voices.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           We open our season with Swan Lake.
           Done to death, I know. But not like
           this. We strip it down. Make it
           visceral and real.
                         
          He pauses for effect.

           And a new production needs a new
           Swan Queen. A fresh face to present
           to the world.
                         
           Surprised, the soloists glance at each other, trying to keep
           their cool.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But which of you can embody both
           swans? The white and the black?
                         
           Nina prepares for disappointment.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           All the soloists I touched...
           Please go to your scheduled
           rehearsals this afternoon.
                         
           The girls are confused.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           And the girls I didn't touch, meet
           me in studio B at five.
                         
           Nina breathes, realizing the girls he didn't tap are the ones
           he's selected, purposefully toying with them.
                         
                         
          10 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 10
                         
           Hidden inside a nook, Nina has her eyes closed, nervously
           HUMMING the score to Swan Lake.
                         
           She makes small motions with her feet and hands, going
           through the choreography in her mind. Preparing for the
           audition.
                         
           A loud CRASHING sound snaps her out of it.
                         
           She goes out into the hallway to investigate.
                         
           The door to a PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM is halfway open. Nina
           cautiously approaches.
                         
           Inside, she can see someone moving around the room in a fury,
           trashing it.
                         
           Suddenly, the door swings open and BETH MACINTYRE bursts out.
                         
           She makes brief eye-contact with Nina.
                         
                          BETH
           What?!
           9.
                         
           Nina just shakes her head.
                         
           Beth scoffs as she slams the door behind her. She clips down
           the hall in the opposite direction.
                         
           Nina waits until she's gone, then moves closer to the door
           and peeks inside, curious.
                         
           She checks to make sure no one's around and quickly enters.
                         
                         
          11 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 11
                         
           Large and comfortable. Beth's presence is everywhere.
           Photographs, clothing, and personal belongings scattered
           across the space.
                         
           Nina looks at herself in the mirror and smiles, imagining how
           great it would be...
                         
           Then she notices a LARGE VASE lying on the floor. The flowers
           have been shredded, water everywhere.
                         
           She moves to the vanity counter and touches Beth's
           belongings in reverence. The items are neatly laid out:
           ballet supplies, jewelry, and makeup.
                         
           Her fingers brush a tube of LIPSTICK. She picks it up.
                         
           Nina slips the lipstick into her bag and exits the room.

           In the middle of her audition, Nina dances Odette's Variation
           from Act II of the ballet, a frightened look on her face.
                         
           Although her movement is incredibly precise, there's a
           definite vulnerability. Exactly as the White Swan should be:
           fear tinged with melancholy.
                         
           Leroy waves his arm. The music and Nina stop abruptly.
                         
           He approaches her and, when he gets close, taps on her
           sternum with two of his fingers.
                         
                          LEROY

           He leans in and talks softly so the other girls can't hear.

           White Swan, she'd be yours.
                         
          She can't help but smile, flattered. He pulls away from her.

          Nervous, she glances over at Veronica and Galina, who
          anxiously await their turn.
                         
          She takes a few breaths, then looks towards the piano player

          The music begins.
                         
          Nina dances a few steps, and then launches into the most
          difficult and famous part of Swan Lake: The Black Swan's
          Coda. It consists of 32 consecutive fouettes (spins).

          The music builds in intensity, she pushes herself into the
          next turn.

           Attack it! Attack it!
                         
          Leroy runs his hand through his hair, dismayed.
                         
          A look of worry spreads across Nina's face. Knows she's
          blowing it.
                         
          The door CLANGS open and throws Nina's focus completely. She
          stumbles, several spins short of finishing.
           11.
                         
           The New Girl obliviously marches into the room, listening to

           They now advertise Swan Lake and feature a beautiful
           photograph of Nina.

           Nina slowly enters Beth's room, but remains at the threshold.
                         
           Beth sits in a wheelchair faced towards the window. Sleeping.
                         
           Nina gets up the nerve and quietly walks further in, trying
           not to wake her.
                         
           Nina pulls out the tube of lipstick from her bag and gently
           places it on the hospital table.
                         
           She pulls out the diamond earrings, sets them down.
                         
           Followed by the makeup compact, the pack of cigarettes, a
           needle and thread, and an emory board.
                         
           A hand suddenly GRABS Nina's arm.
                         
           Awake, Beth stares Nina down.

           What are you doing here?
                         
           Stunned, Nina's unable to answer.
                         
           Beth follows her gaze to the random items on her table.
                         
                          NINA

           She's trying to replace me.
                         
          Beth sees the earrings and it all clicks in.

          Nina spins Beth around. She is now a bloody version of THE
          DOUBLE! She continues stabbing herself.
                         
          Nina grabs the Double's hand and struggles to restrain her.

           causing a CLAMOR.
                         
           The older nurse looks up.
                         
           Nina jumps into an open elevator.

           As the doors close, she looks down and sees that, in one
           hand, she holds the BLOODY EMORY BOARD.
                         
           She drops it, disgusted.

           She goes to the sink and washes her hands.
                         
           She finishes, and flips the light off as she walks out of the
           room.
                         
           She pauses, rushes back and flips on the light. The Double
           stares at her from the corner, her face covered in blood.
           Terrified, Nina runs.

           She goes straight to the toilet and VOMITS.
                         
           She hears a creaking sound in the apartment and looks towards
           the open door.

           She hears RUSTLING, then WHISPERING.
                         
           Nina looks around the room. The paintings of herself seem to
           move slightly. Blink. Mouths move.
                         
           They whisper: "Sweet girl" and then start chanting "My turn,
           my turn, my turn!"
                         
           Nina cups her hands over her ears, trying to block it out.
                         
           She hears a BANG and looks towards the door. No one's there.
                         
           She glimpses the mirror, which reflects down the hallway. She
           sees her Double rushing towards the room.
                         
           Scared, Nina whips around, just as her mother arrives in the
           doorway.

           Nina closes the door. Sticks in the broken piece of wood.
                         
           A pain shoots through her shoulder. She SCREAMS,
           instinctively reaching for it.
                         
           She quickly yanks off the sweater and looks at the vanity
           mirror.
                         
           Her back pulsates unnaturally. Tiny black tips poke through.
                         
           The door opens and catches on the doorjamb.
                         
           Erica starts POUNDING.

           fingernails.

           Erica violently pushes and pulls, jostling the piece of wood.
                         
           Nina concentrates, takes hold of the growth and yanks.
                         
           Blood vessels in her eyes explode, making the white turn red.
                         
           Nina looks at the object held in her fingers: a sharp, TINY
           BLACK SPINE. Like that of a sea urchin. Damp, feathery wisps
           hang off of it.
                         
           The door flings open.
                         
           Erica rushes in and finds Nina half-naked, her skin inflamed.

           Erica SCREAMS in pain.
                         
           Nina slams the door again, and again. The hand now human.
                         
           She finally gets the door all the way shut.
                         
           She steps away from it, nervous...
                         
           She looks down, sees one of her knees SNAP backwards, like
           that of a bird. Then the other knee SNAPS back.
                         
           Nina stumbles and falls.
                         
           And SLAMS her head into the radiator.

           Nina flutters open her eyes. The world comes into focus and
           she sees her mother hovering over her, stroking her hair.

           Nina looks around, disoriented. Sees her hands jammed inside
           thick socks, held on by rubber bands. Groggy, she tries to
           pull them off.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           You were scratching all night.

          Nina gives in, too tired to fight her. Her eyes drift to the
          source of the tinny music: the open jewelry box. The
          ballerina's been broken off, all that remains is a single
          amputated leg, spinning morbidly on the base.

           That's good. Rest.

          She slowly opens the door to the wardrobe...
                         
          And finds it empty. No body whatsoever.
                         
          She looks over at the broken mirror. Sees her reflection
          staring back at her.
                         
          She stares at it for a long beat, and realizes something.
                         
          She touches her stomach and winces a little. Pulls back her
          hand. It's coated with red liquid. Blood.
                         
          It's started to soak through the costume, creating a faint
          red spot. The fabric is ripped at the center of the stain.
                         
          She feels inside for confirmation.
                         
          And discovers a stab wound, in her own stomach.
                         
          She pulls out the sharp tip of mirror still stuck inside.
          Blood begins flowing more rapidly.
                         
          She drops the mirror.

           Nina dances the final Pas de Deux as the White Swan. Losing
           blood by the second, everything is woozy and blurry.
                         
           She can't do all the steps, but her performance is pained,
           making it poignant.
                         
           A spot of red begins to soak through at the center of her
           costume.

           She gets to the top, takes one last look around, at all the

           She notices a familiar face in the audience: HER MOTHER. She
           watches with a profound sadness, tears streaking her cheeks.
                         
           In the front of Nina's costume, a dark circle has started to
           form. Her blood fully seeping through.

           She slowly twists around in the air, so that she's falling
           backwards.
                         
           She hears something. Soft and muffled.
