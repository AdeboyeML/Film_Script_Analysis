          FADE IN:
          
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING
          
          TWIN BOYS, RUDY AND JACOB CARGES (12), ride their bikes
          through a suburban neighborhood.
          
          Rudy, the more athletic of the two, rides at a breakneck
          pace. Jacob rides slowly due to a HOCKEY MASK that he wears
          over his face. It's making it difficult for him to see. The
          boys turn down a DIRT PATH and ride deep into some WOODS.
          
          INT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
          
          Rudy and Jacob ride to the edge of a CLEARING and stop.
          Across from the clearing is a large OAK TREE, which has a
          TREE HOUSE perched high up in it's branches. The boys
          cautiously look around and whisper.
          
                               JACOB
                     You see `em?
          
                               RUDY
                     No. But that doesn't mean they're
                     not here.
          
          After a beat, Rudy gets off his bike and starts walking
          towards the tree house.   Jacob stays behind, eyeing their
          safety.
          
                               RUDY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                     Jacob, come on. It's cool.
          
          Suddenly, a ROCK comes careening from off screen.   It hits
          Jacob in the head and knocks him to the ground.
          
          Rudy darts for the oak tree as a hail storm of rock and
          debris come flying at him.
          
          As Jacob rises, a stream of blood pours down the front of his
          mask. He quickly runs for the tree.
          
          TWO BOYS, JEFF AND KENNY (14), trailer park, punks come
          running out of the woods, rocks in hand.
          
          Rudy and Jacob climb the tree, using makeshift RUNGS that are
          nailed into the trunk. In the floor of the tree house is a
          DOOR. Rudy removes a KEY from a chain around his neck and
          unlocks it. He climbs inside and pulls Jacob in after him.
          
                                                                    2.
          
          
          
          INT. TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Jacob looks back and sees Jeff and Kenny, running over. Rudy
          crosses to the door with a BUCKET of liquid.
          
                              JACOB
                    What the hell is that?
          
                              RUDY
                    Piss.
          
          Rudy dumps the piss onto Jeff and Kenny.
          
          EXT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME
          
          Now drenched with piss, Jeff and Kenny jump from the tree,
          screaming. They try to shake the urine off.
          
          Kenny spits the taste out of his mouth and angrily calls up
          to the boys.
          
                              KENNY
                    You and your deformed brother are
                    dead!
          
          INT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME
          
          Jacob rips the hockey mask off. (A large STRAWBERRY
          BIRTHMARK covers the right side of his face.) He's insulted.
          
                              RUDY
                        (calling to Kenny)
                    Anytime you're ready, dickhead.
          
          EXT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME
          
          Jeff and Kenny walk off.
          
                              KENNY
                    They're fucking dead!
          
          Jeff runs off screen and throws up.
          
          INT. FISHER HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING
          
          LEONARD FISHER (12), severely obese, sits at the dinner
          table, eating pancakes.
          
          His FATHER, PATRICK (35) and TWO YOUNGER SISTERS, HALEY (8)
          and SARA (6) are seated with him. They are all overweight.
          
          
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          LEONARD'S MOTHER, GRACE (35), the largest of them all,
          crosses to the table, sits and starts eating.
          
          JUMP CUTS show the progression of their meal. From globs of
          syrup being placed over pancakes to the mass consumption of
          omelets and sausage. Caught up with eating, nobody speaks.

                       The check is supposed to be here on
                       the first of the month... She's
                       your daughter, you asshole!
          
          INT. CHUNG HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          YACCO CHUANG (35), Asian-American, sexy, uptight,
          psychiatrist, paces the hallway on the phone.
          
          HER DAUGHTER, MALEE (12) with long, black, braided hair and
          thick rimmed glasses, peeks her head out of the bathroom.
          
                                 MALEE
                       Mom, I need help.
          
                                 YACCO (INTO PHONE)
                           (ignoring her)
                       Any parent is "parent of the year"
                       next to you, you selfish prick.
          
          Yacco walks off.    Deflated, Malee reenters the bathroom.
          
          INT. CHUNG HOME - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Malee is wrapped in a towel and holding a TAMPON. Confused,
          she grabs the TAMPON BOX and reads the directions. Malee's
          confusion quickly turns to disgust.
          
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD ENTRANCE - LATER
          
          Leonard sits upon a large rock with the words, LINDSAY ACRES
          inscribed on the center of it. He eats POPCORN. Hanging off
          the top right hand corner of the rock is a banner, which
          reads, 5th ANNUAL 4TH OF JULY PICNIC. ALL INVITED.
          
          Malee rides her bike up to Leonard. She HONKS her BIKE HORN
          at every pedestrian in her path.
          
                                 MALEE
                       Move it, people.    Outta my way!

          She comes to a screeching halt an inch in front of Leonard.
          
                                 LEONARD
                           (mouthful)
                       You're late.
          
                                 MALEE
                       Yeah well, I began menstruating
                       this morning, and I had some
                       difficulty inserting the tampon.
                           (off his disgusted look)
                       What? It's a natural process. You
                       know, I could conceive, carry and
                       birth a child right now.
          
                                   LEONARD
                       Big deal.    You won't.
          
                                 MALEE
                       But I could. That's what matters.
          
                                 LEONARD
                       The twins said, they'd meet us at
                       the spot.
          
          Leonard gets on his bike.
          
                                 MALEE
                       Wanna race?
          
                                 LEONARD
                       Nah, I'm good.
          
          INT. TREE HOUSE - LATER
          
          Jacob wipes at his head wound, frightened.
          
                                 JACOB
                       Maybe I should have mom look at it.
          
                                  RUDY
                       If you didn't have that damn mask
                       on, you'd have seen it coming. Our
                       birthday comes once a year, and you
                       ask for a hockey mask. You don't
                       even play.
          
                                 JACOB
                       Jason from "Friday the 13th" wears
                       one. He's bad ass.

                       Exactly. Jason wouldn't run home
                       `cause of a little blood. He'd get
                       back up, decapitate his victim and
                       move on.
          
          Jacob looks out the makeshift window in the wall.
          
                                 JACOB
                       You think Jeff and Kenny will come
                       back?
          
                                 RUDY
                       I dropped piss on their heads.    I'd
                       say the odds are pretty good.
          
                                 MALEE (O.S.)
                       You did what?
          
          Rudy and Jacob turn to find Malee and Leonard, entering the
          tree house.
          
                                 RUDY
                       Jeff and Kenny were here. I dumped
                       the piss I've been saving on their
                       heads.
          
                                 LEONARD
                       Why were you saving piss?

                       gonna come back here and kick all
                       our asses.

                       Yeah, I could probably take them
                       both myself.

          Rudy pushes Jacob.   Jacob pushes back.   The two start
          fighting.
          
                              MALEE
                    You guys, it's your birthday.
                    Could you try and get along?
          
          Off the boy's fighting -
          
          INT. YACCO'S OFFICE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
          
          Yacco sits across from DEBBIE POOLE (42), housewife,
          conservatively dressed.
          
                              DEBBIE
                    I don't think therapy is helping.
          
                               YACCO
                    Why do you say that?   Are you still
                    "cutting"?
          
          Embarrassed, Maggie lifts up her shirt sleeve. We see that
          her arm is covered with cuts. Dried blood is everywhere.
          Yacco is horrified by the sight.
          
                              YACCO (cont'd)
                    Oh, Debbie.

                    Really.
          
          Suddenly, Malee bursts into her mother's office.

          Yacco enters the reception area.       She is obviously angry.

                       I told you a 100 times to knock.

                       I said, I was sorry.

                       Rudy and Jacob went for pizza with
                       their parents.
          
          Yacco crosses to a desk and removes a FLUTE from a drawer.
          
                                 YACCO
                       I found this in the backseat of my
                       car this morning. Do you know how
                       much flutes cost?   Go outside, sit
                       on the front steps and practice.
          
                                   MALEE

                       Now!
          
          Angered, Malee grabs the flute and exits.
          
          EXT. FRONT OF YACCO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Malee drops on the stoop like a ton of bricks.      After a beat,
          she reluctantly begins playing her flute.
          
          A few pedestrians stop to listen.
          
                                 MALEE
                       Keep it moving. This ain't a show.

          The boys relax their poses as ASHLEY and JIM CARGES (30's),
          enter the shot. Ashley puts her camera down on the table and
          picks up a large PRESENT.

                       this year, we were able to splurge.
          
          Ashley removes an ENVELOPE from her purse. She hands it to
          Jacob. His enthusiasm suddenly turns to worry.

          Hurt, Leonard looks down at his own plate, which overflows
          with food. He feels embarrassed and disgusted.

          He walks off with his food. Leanard looks down at the food,
          shrugs, then helps himself to a heaping porion.

                                 NEIGHBORHOOD FATHER (O.S.)
                       What's going on over there?
          
          Kenny looks up and sees a neighborhood parent coming over.
          
                                 KENNY
                       I'll finish this tonight!
          
          Kenny pushes Rudy down once more and runs off.      Rudy slowly
          rises, wiping the saliva from his face.
          
          EXT. VACANT LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT
          
          The entire neighborhood has descended upon a VACANT LOT.
          They are awaiting the annual, fireworks display.
          
          We FIND Leonard, Jacob and Malee sitting on a large rock,
          which gives them a birds eye view of the crowd.
          
          Rudy runs over to the rock and climbs up top.

                       Kenny showed up. He said, Jeff and
                       him are gonna tear the treehouse
                       down tonight. We gotta sneak out
                       and stop them.

                       Mom and Dad would kill us.
          
                                 RUDY
                       We can't let him tear it down.
          
                                 JACOB
                       It's just a treehouse.
          
                                 RUDY
                       No, it's not! You know what, you
                       suck. I'm going. Leonard, you in?

                       Don't listen to him.     He's a pussy.
          
          Leonard looks between Jacob and Malee.
          
                                  LEONARD
                       I'll go.

                       Finally, someone with balls.
          
          Insulted, Jacob slides off the rock and walks away.       Malee
          follows.

                       Let them go.
          
          The fireworks display begins.       As they turn to watch it...
          
          INT. TWIN'S HOME - BOY'S BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
          
          We SCAN the room and come to a set of BUNK BEDS.

          A body in the top bunk sits up and turns on a small bed
          light. Reveal, it's RUDY. Rudy grabs his watch from the
          post and silences the alarm. Jacob sits up in bed.

                       Unless you're coming with me, I
                       don't want to hear it.
          
          Jacob lies back in bed, silent. Rudy jumps off the top bunk,
          gets dressed and grabs a BASEBALL BAT. Before leaving, Rudy
          looks back at Jacob and shakes his head, disappointed.

                                 JACOB
                       It's my problem.
          
                                 RUDY
                       No, it's mine too. Cause we're
                       brothers. That's what brothers do.
                       They fight for each other, kill for
                       each other, die for each other.
          
                                 JACOB
                       I don't feel that way.
          
                                 RUDY
                       Cause you're a pussy. So stay
                       home, keep your head under the
                       blankets. I'm gonna fight.

          Both boys lie asleep. A mosquito flies in through the window

          in his sleep, wakes himself up.

          Leonard rises, picks up his bag and opens the TRAP DOOR in

          and pained. They are accompanied by a number of mourners.
          
                                 PRIEST
                       Rest in piece, Rudolph Eugene
                       Carges. May God hold you in the
                       palm of his hand.
          
          Jacob stands beside his parents. Tears stream from his eyes,
          across his birthmark and off his chin. So stricken with
          grief, Jacob barely has to energy to wipe the tears away.
          
          We continue on through the crowd and find Malee. Embarrassed
          by the tears, she brings a black veil down over her face.
          
          INT. YACCO'S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY
          
          Malee enters, still wearing the veil. She crosses to the
          couch and sits beside A PATIENT, GUS MAITLAND (30), long
          haired, hippi-type with a moustache and beard. Gus eyes
          Malee, intrigued.
          
                                 GUS
                       Friend or family?
          
                                   MALEE
                       Huh?
          
                                 GUS
                       The person who died.
          
                                   MALEE
                       Friend.
          
                                 GUS
                       I'm sorry. You'll like Dr. Chung.
                       This is only my second session, but
                       she's good.

                       I'm not a patient.     I'm her
                       daughter.
          
          Malee lifts her veil and looks at Gus.
          
                                    GUS
                       Oh.     I can see the resemblance.
          
                                 MALEE
                       Are you trying to make me sick?
          
          Gus shoots Malee a look just as Yacco exits her office.
          
                                 YACCO
                       Mr. Maitland?
          
          Gus rises and enters the office.

                       I'll be with you in a second.
          
          Yacco crosses to Malee and sits beside her.
          
                                 YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       So, how was it?
          
                                 MALEE
                       It was a funeral, Mom.     How do you
                       think it was?
          
                                 YACCO
                       I'm sorry I couldn't make it. Let
                       Rudy's parents know I'm available
                       if they need to talk. I won't
                       charge for the sessions.
          
          Malee looks to Yacco, stunned by her comment.
          
                                 YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       You know, it's okay to cry.
          
                                 MALEE
                       I know it's okay to cry. I don't
                       need you to tell me, it's okay to
                       cry. If I want to cry, I'll cry.
          
                                    YACCO
                       Okay.
          
          Yacco re-enters her office.       A beat.

          EXT. JACOB'S HOME - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
          
          Cars fill the driveway and line the street in front of
          Jacob's house.
          
          INT. TWIN'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
          
          Mourners stand in small groups, engaged in hushed
          conversations. Jim sits in his recliner, crying.
          
          INT. TWIN'S HOME - KITCHEN - SAME TIME
          
          A number of MOTHERS watch as Ashley obsessively prepares a
          platter of deviled eggs. Concerned, one of them crosses over
          to her.
          
                               MOTHER
                    Ashley, there's more than enough
                    food here.
          
                              ASHLEY
                    No, Rudy loved my deviled eggs.
                    It's right that I make them.
                    Where's the paprika?
          
          Ashley opens up her cupboards in search of the paprika.
          
                              ASHLEY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    Jesus, you put something down, and
                    it disappears.
          
          Now angry, Ashley starts throwing objects out of the
          cupboards, haphazardly.
          
                                 MOTHER # 1
                    Ashley.
          
          Ashley slams her cupboard doors shut. She looks around and
          spots the GARBAGE PAIL across the kitchen.
          
                              ASHLEY
                    Maybe I threw it out.
          
          Ashley crosses to the garbage. She lifts it upside down and
          dumps the trash all over the floor. Ashley gets on her knees
          and starts searching.
          
          The other women look to each other, uncomfortable.     Mother #
          1 kneels down beside her.

                       Ashley.
          
          Ashley ignores her. Mother # 1 grabs Ashley's hands and
          looks her in the eye.
          
                                    ASHLEY
                       It's okay.
          
          Ashley stops cold.     The grief and heartache hit once again.
          
                                 ASHLEY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       Not my baby! Please God not my son!
          
          The mothers collectively drop to the floor and surround
          Ashley in an attempt to comfort her. They give no care to
          the pile of garbage they now sit in.
          
          INT. LEONARD'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER THAT DAY
          
          Leonard lies in a bed, staring out the window. There is a
          BANDAGE wrapped around his forehead. Patrick sits beside him
          in a chair.
          
          Grace enters, carrying bags of MCDONALD'S food with her.
          
                                 GRACE
                       This hospital is a nightmare. The
                       elevator is never there when you
                       need it.
          
          Patrick crosses over to the food and grabs his lunch.
          
                                 PATRICK
                       Where are the girls?

                       Haley took Sara up to the maternity
                       ward.
          
          Grace crosses over to Leonard.

                       How are you feeling?
          
                                 LEONARD
                       My head hurts.
          
                                 GRACE

                       the hospital. I've never been so
                       scared in my life. And poor Rudy.

                                 GRACE
                       Hospital food is always bland.
                       This has flavor.

                       No, it's because of my condition.
                       I can't taste or smell anything
                       anymore.

                                 DOCTOR
                       Leonard has a condition.    It's
                       called Anosmia.
          
                                    GRACE
                       Oh my God!     Is it serious?
          
                                 DOCTOR
                       No. Anosmia is when a person
                       looses their sense of smell. It's
                       not uncommon in patients who suffer
                       serious head injuries.
                       Unfortunately, it's also affecting
                       his ability to taste. Again, not
                       uncommon.
          
                                 PATRICK
                       Is it permanent?
          
                                 DOCTOR
                       Depends on the patient.
          
                                 GRACE
                       What do we do? He can't eat.
          
                                 DOCTOR
                       He can eat. He just can't taste
                       what he's eating.
          
                                 PATRICK
                       What she means is, he won't eat.
          
                                 DOCTOR
                       Leonard's association with food is
                       no longer about taste. It's about
                       texture. While we may be partial
                       to sweet or salty foods, Leonard
                       will become partial to crunchy or
                       smooth ones. Once he settles on a
                       texture he likes, his appetite will
                       increase.
          
                                 GRACE
                       I can't believe this is happening.
          
                                 DOCTOR
                       Considering what Leonard could have
                       suffered, he's lucky. Besides, he

          INT. LEONARD'S HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME TIME
          
          Leonard lies in bed, staring out the window. A NURSE (40)
          enters and crosses over to his bedside table.
          
                              NURSE
                    How'd we do?
          
          The nurse sees that Leonard has barely touched his food.
          
                              NURSE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    You have to eat something. It may
                    not be gourmet, but you don't look
                    that finicky.
          
                              LEONARD
                    This stuff feels like shit in my
                    mouth.
          
                              NURSE
                    It's macaroni and cheese.
          
                              LEONARD
                    It feels gross. Like there's a
                    film on my tongue.
          
          The nurse grabs the tray of food. She removes an untouched
          apple and places it in Leonard's hand.
          
                              LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    I don't like apples.
          
                              NURSE
                    So, you can't taste it, right?
                    Maybe you'll like the crunch.
          
          The nurse exits. Leonard eyes the apple in his hand. A
          beat. He reluctantly takes a bite. The apple makes a loud
          CRUNCH. Leonard starts chewing. After a few seconds, a
          smile comes to his face. He likes it.
          
          INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
          
          Jacob lies in bed, holding Rudy's old baseball GLOVE. He
          brings the glove to his nose, and a flood of old memories
          come back to him.
          
          Jacob rises, crosses over to the closet and removes a metal
          LOCK BOX. He selects 666 for the combination and the box
          opens. Jacob removes the contents; baseball cards, some
          firecrackers, a few ticket stubs and a PHOTOGRAPH of he and
          Rudy at age 5. He can't help but smile.
          
                                                                      25.

                    I'm leaving, Jim.    Again, so sorry.

                    Gabe, are you still interested in
                    buying the land? Because I accept
                    your offer.
          
                              GABE
                    This is hardly the time to talk

                              JIM
                    Buy the woods, Gabe, please. Tear
                    them down and build. Build houses,
                    condos, a 7-11, I don't care. I
                    just don't want to recognize it
                    ever again.

          We FIND Malee and Jacob, straddling their bikes a few feet
          away from the site. Leonard is beside them on a scooter. He
          as a band-aid on his forehead.

                       I'm sorry. I wish I could have
                       done something.
          
                                 JACOB
                       Jeff and Kenny were the ones that
                       started the fire. It was their
                       fault. Or maybe mine. I should of

                                 MALEE
                       You wouldn't have been able to do
                       anything. And it could have been
                       you who died.
          
                                 JACOB
                       I wish it was. You know the last
                       thing Rudy said to me? He said, I
                       can't be a pussy all my life. He
                       was right, I am. And Rudy might be
                       dead because of it.
          
                                  MALEE

                       What if it doesn't? My dad hasn't
                       gone back to work yet. What if he
                       loses his job. We could lose our
                       house. I could be homeless.

          Leonard and Jacob start heading off.
          
          Malee stays for a beat, eyeing Gus as he removes his T-shirt
          and exposes his rock abs. She is obviously turned on.

                    chocolate cheesecake for dessert.

                                 TEACHER
                       I'm so sorry. Wow, this is
                       awkward. Would you like the seat
                       left empty?
          
                                    JACOB
                       Why?
          
                                    TEACHER
                       In memory.
          
          Off Jacob's look -
          
                                                                   30.
          
          
          
          INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LATER THAT DAY
          
          COACH GILMORE (55), overweight, gym teacher, dressed in a
          jogging suit, snaps gum while addressing his students.
          
          The class of boys stand up against the wall.    Leonard is
          amongst them. His gym uniform barely fits.
          
                              COACH
                    Alright, ladies, welcome to gym.
                    We will be starting things off this
                    year with the United States
                    Standardized Fitness Test.
          
          The entire class groans.
          
                              COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    I'm sure you all remember it from
                    last year. I will be testing you
                    in a number of physical fitness
                    areas.
          
          As coach speaks, Leonard looks as if he's going to throw up.
          
                                                   SMASH CUT TO:
          
          ON CHIN UP BAR - MOMENTS LATER
          
          A STUDENT performs chin ups with great ease.
          
                              COACH (V.O.)
                    The state's requirement for upper
                    body strength is ten chin ups.
          
          The student finishes his run with a count of twelve.   He hops
          off the bar and crosses over to his classmates.
          
                              COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    Leonard, you're up.
          
          Leonard crosses to the chin-up bar, grabs a hold of it and
          begins struggling to lift himself up. Unfortunately, he can
          only manage 1/8th of an inch. Leonard drops off the bar,
          exhausted.
          
                              COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    What are you doing, let's go!
          
                               LEONARD
                    That was as far as I could pull
                    myself up.
          
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          A few students laugh.        Coach shakes his head, disgusted.
          
                                                            SMASH CUT TO:
          
          ON A STUDENT DOING SITUPS - LATER
          
          Coach stands over the boy, timing him with a stop watch.
          
                                 COACH
                       Ten seconds. You need forty to
                       pass.
          
          The student increases his speed.
          
                                     COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       Time.   42.     Good job.
          
          The student rises off the mat and walks over to the other
          boys. Leonard enters frame and drops on the mat like a ton
          of bricks.
          
                                   COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                             (rolling his eyes)
                       Go!
          
          Leonard struggles to lift himself up but, he can't do it.
          
                                 COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       Come on, son, fight it.
          
          Leonard's face turns red. He clenches his teeth.
          Unfortunately, due to the pressure he is exerting, he blows a
          loud fart. The gym erupts with laughter.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - TRACK - LATER
          
          The coach and his students stand at the beginning of the
          track, waiting for Leonard to finish his laps.
          
          Leonard slowly walks over.           He is soaking wet and breathing
          heavy.
          
                                 COACH
                       23 minutes.
          
                                     LEONARD
                       Not bad.
          
                                 COACH
                       The goal was 8.
          
          The class can't help but laugh.
          
          
                                                                     (CONTINUED)

          The class walks off.
          
                                 COACH (cont'd)
                       Not you Leonard.
          
          Leonard turns back and crosses over to the coach.
          
                                 COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       Center. That's the position you'll
                       be playing in two years.
          
                                   LEONARD
                       Football?
          
                                 COACH
                       You don't like football?
          
                                 LEONARD
                       I love it. It's just I'll never
                       make the weight requirement. Pop
                       Warner league wouldn't let me play
                       for five years because of it.
          
                                 COACH
                       There's no weight requirement in
                       high school ball, son.
          
          The coach bends down and rifles through his GYM BAG.    He
          removes 2 books and hands them to Leonard.
          
                                 COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       These are your new bibles.
          
                                   LEONARD
                       Books?
          
                                 COACH
                       One is on nutrition, the other
                       exercise. You do what they say,
                       and you can play for me once you
                       get to high school.
          
                                   LEONARD
                       Thanks.
          
          Leonard begins walking back to the gym.    After a few steps,
          he stops and turns back.

                    me?
          
                              COACH
                    Because I've never seen a child so
                    out of shape in my life.
          
          INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT DAY
          
          The school BAND is on stage and playing a particularly
          horrendous rendition of the STAR SPANGLED BANNER. We FIND
          MALEE in the flute section, playing her heart out.
          
          The CONDUCTOR, MR. FARMER (40) overly energetic and dorky,
          waves his baton, silencing the band.
          
                              MR FARMER
                        (annoyed)
                    Did anyone practice over the
                    summer?
          
          The band sits silent.
          
                               MR. FARMER
                    Great. Well, we still have a fall
                    recital coming up. If anyone would
                    like to perform a solo, sign up on
                    the sheet outside my office. Class
                    dismissed.
          
          Off Malee, weighing the decision in her mind.
          
          INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Malee stands outside Mr. Farmer's office, staring at the SIGN
          UP SHEET on his door. After a beat, she lifts her pen to
          sign her name. Before she writes it, she stops, quickly
          turns around and walks away.
          
          After a beat, Malee returns to the sign up sheet and starts
          writing her name. Halfway through, she stops, scratches out
          her name and walks off.
          
          We remain on the sign up sheet. After a few seconds, Malee's
          hand enters the shot and writes in her name.

          Dressed in a sweat suit and sneakers, Leonard sprints down

          Leonard looks like a stuffed sausage.
          
          With each step he takes, Leonard breathing becomes heavier
          and heavier. Sweat forms on his forehead and drips down his
          face.
          
          Within seconds, Leonard's pace tapers off. He struggles to
          continue but is so out of shape, stopping is inevitable.
          
          Leonard leans over, gasping for air. He looks back and
          realizes that he only ran about one hundred yards. In fact,
          his house is still in view.
          
          Leonard turns around and starts walking back home.    After a
          few steps, he stops and throws up.

                       I was in the mood for a picnic. I
                       thought this would be a nice place
                       to have one.
          
          Gus looks around, confused. This location is anything but
          picnic friendly. Bulldozers plough through the scene,
          blasting exhaust into the air. Men scream at each other.

                    Rudy knew we were going to be
                    there. He never should have come.
                    You want the truth, all this
                    happened cause of you.

                    Yeah, you deformed retard! The
                    only reason we started picking on
                    you guys in the first place was
                    because of that thing on your face.

                              JACOB
                    First I'm going to take a kitchen
                    knife and chop off your fingers
                    then your nose then your tongue.
                    Then I'm gonna poke out your eyes
                    with the end of a broomstick.
                    Well, not really poke them out, but
                    I'm gonna push them back into your
                    brain. Then I'm gonna take
                    scissors and cut off your ears.
                    When they find you, it's gonna be
                    like putting a jigsaw puzzle back
                    together.

                       There are no accidents. You're

                       This is serious. You can't keep
                       buying this crap. Don't you care

                       Post traumatic stress is very
                       common in your line of work. Many
                       fire fighters go through this.
          
                                 GUS
                       Yeah. But why now? I haven't
                       fought fires in ten years.

                       Sometimes we experience something
                       so horrific, our memory blocks it
                       out. That way we won't have to
                       relive the pain. It's called
                       repression. Our bodies are not so
                       forgiving, however. Inside, we
                       feel the effects of trauma even
                       when we don't know why.

                           (half crazed)
                       I went to work today. For the
                       first time in weeks. It was as if
                       I had just gotten out of college!
                       I was fearless! I went after
                       accounts I had avoided for years
                       because I thought they were out of
                       my league. I spoke to presidents,
                       vice presidents, business managers,
                       sales reps. I was amazing. I was
                       magic. But when I came home to
                       share the news with your mother, I
                       discovered her asleep. When I
                       looked around the house, I realized
                       that her "office", for lack of a
                       better word, was also piled up.
                       So, I took to the house. I have
                       made it my duty to clean this place
                       from top to bottom. Even if it
                       takes me all night, I don't care.

                                 JACOB
                       Good night, Dad.
          
          Off Jim's look -
          
          EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAYS LATER - NIGHT
          
          Parents and students file inside. A large SIGN above the
          door reads, JEFFERSON JUNIOR HIGH FALL RECITAL.
          
                                                                  47.
          
          
          
          INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          A packed audience listens to A GIRL (12), standing center
          stage and singing "The Rose". She is not nearly as good as
          she thinks she is, but she sings full throttle.
          
          We FIND Malee, sitting in the flute section and playing along
          with the rest of the orchestra. She looks to the front row,
          but Gus is no where to be found.
          
          The girl finishes her song, and the crowd politely applauds.
          
          Mr. Farmer crosses to the microphone.
          
                              MR. FARMER
                    I'm sure Bette Midler would be most
                    impressed with that rendition.
          
          The crowd laughs.   Mr. Farmer didn't mean for it to be a
          joke.
          
                              MR. FARMER (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    Anyway, our next soloist is Malee
                    Chung. She will play the theme
                    from "Love Story" on the flute.
          
          The crowd applauds as Malee rises and crosses to the
          microphone.
          
                              MALEE
                    Thank you, Mr. Farmer.
          
          Malee spots Gus, walking down the aisle. He scurries into
          the front row and sits. Malee lights up.
          
                              MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    There's actually been a change.
                    I'm not going to play the theme
                    from "Love Story". Um... this is a
                    song...
          
          Mr. Farmer, waves to Malee from off stage.   Malee looks at
          him. Mr. Farmer mouths something to her.
          
                              MALEE (INTO MICROPHONE) (CONT'D)
                        (to Mr. Farmer)
                    What? I can't hear you?
          
          Mr. Farmer throws up his hands.
          
          
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                       Anyway.    This is a song by The
                       Doors.
          
          At the mention of The Doors, Gus' smile instantly fades.    The
          coincidence is just too great.
          
          Malee starts to play "Light My Fire". She is good. Mr.
          Farmer and the audience seem pleased by her euphonious
          performance. Even Gus is won over. He appears entranced by
          the music.
          
          INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT NIGHT
          
          The recital is over. Most of the audience has filed out. A
          few remain, offering their congratulations to the musicians.
          
          Malee stands with Leonard.
          
                                 MALEE
                       Where's Jacob?
          
                                 LEONARD
                       Couldn't make it. He...
          
                                    GUS (O.S.)
                       Malee.
          
          Malee spots Gus, heading towards her.
          
                                    MALEE
                       Oh my God!     He's coming over.
          
                                    LEONARD
                       Who?
          
                                    MALEE
                       Shut up!     Leave now.
          
          Malee pushes Leonard behind her just as Gus approaches.
          
                                 GUS
                       You were awesome.
          
                                 MALEE
                       Really? Be honest. I'd rather you
                       tell me I sucked then lie.
          
                                 GUS
                       You were great.
          
          Leonard peeks around Malee's back.
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                 MALEE
                       Excuse me for a second.
          
          Malee turns around and pinches Leonard.
          
                                 LEONARD
                       Ow, ow, ow alright.    I'm going.
          
          Leonard walks off. Malee turns back around with a big smile
          on her face. She plays coy.
          
                                 MALEE
                       So you really enjoyed it?
          
                                GUS
                       Yeah. Good song.      What made you
                       pick it?
          
                                 MALEE
                           (covering)
                       Oh, uh... my mother was humming it
                       all last week. Big Doors fan.
          
                                  GUS
                       Really?   Is she here?
          
                                  MALEE
                       No.
          
                                 GUS
                       She missed out.
          
                                 MALEE
                       You're so sweet.
          
                                 GUS
                       Yeah well, I have to go, but thanks
                       again. I had a great time.
          
          Gus gives Malee an innocent kiss on the check and then walks
          off. Malee melts. She stands frozen, clutching onto her
          flute in ecstacy.
          
          EXT. STREET - MORNING
          
          With fire and determination, Leonard jogs. Unfortunately, he
          is quickly winded by the run. He bends over, gasping.
          
          SUPERIMPOSE SHOT OVER SHOT: Leonard appears, running past
          his old, weaker self. Stronger, he makes a few more yards
          and then is forced to stop.
          
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          He leans over for air, and we SUPERIMPOSE another SHOT OVER
          SHOT of Leonard, weeks later, running past his weaker self.
          (This series of shots repeats a few more times, illustrating
          the progression of time and weight loss.)
          
          INT. LEONARD'S HOME - STAIRCASE/KITCHEN - DAY
          
          Leonard runs up and down the stairs, sweating like crazy.
          
          Grace appears, watching him around the corner.     She shakes
          her head and then returns to the kitchen.
          
                                 GRACE
                       That boy is going to bring the
                       entire house down.
          
                                 PATRICK
                       Let him be. He's looking good.
                       I'm proud of him.
          
                                 GRACE
                           (to the girls)
                       Girls, have you decided what you're
                       going to go as for Halloween?
          
                                 SARA
                       Either a witch or a princess.
          
                                 GRACE
                       That's nice. Haley?
          
                                 HALEY
                       I'm going to go as a marble.
          
                                 GRACE
                       What do you mean, a marble?
          
                                 HALEY
                       You know, like a bag of marbles,
                       but just one marble.
          
          INT. JUVY HALL - CONVERSATION BOOTHS - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Jacob and Jeff sit across from each other on the phone. Jeff
          has two black eyes and a fat lip. He is crying profusely.
          Jacob doesn't appear at all sympathetic.
          
                                 JEFF
                       I'm really sorry, man.   I...

                       Get out of my sight. And send
                       Kenny in on your way out.
          
          Jeff rises and walks to a door, leading to the jail. A
          moment later, Kenny enters, looking pissed off. He sits
          across from Jacob and picks up the phone.
          
                                 KENNY

                       I thought you'd both like to know
                       that Halloween was Rudy's favorite
                       holiday.

                       single Halloween since we were
                       five. You see how happy he was?

                       After we'd go trick or treating,
                       we'd sit in our room and swap the
                       candy we hated. Rudy loved
                       Snickers, I Almond Joys.

                       to sit in my room and swap candy
                       with my brother ever again. Thanks

                    He pissed off the wrong guy off.
                    Jeff is totally fucked right now.

                    Good.
          
                              KENNY
                    Don't come back here ever again.

                    Free country. I'll come if I want.

                    Don't expect me to show up.
          
          Kenny slams down the phone and exits.   Jacob smiles, having
          shaken him.

          Haley and Sara storm into the kitchen in tears. Haley is
          dressed as a MARBLE, and Sara is dressed as a WITCH.
          
                              HALEY

                              HALEY
                    Leonard! He threw away all our
                    Halloween candy.

                    What?
          
                              SARA
                    He grabbed our bags and just threw
                    them down a gutter.
          
          Leonard enters.   Haley and Sara run out of the kitchen.

                    What the hell is going on? Why did
                    you throw away their candy?
          
                              LEONARD
                    Because their sugar intake is
                    completely unhealthy. Besides,
                    Halloween is supposed to be a
                    celebration of evil. How did candy
                    get wrapped into it?

                       I am going to ask you this once,
                       and I want a straight answer. Are
                       you in a cult?

                       This is what happens when kids join
                       cults. The first thing they change
                       is their diets.

                       I'm not in a cult. This is all

                                 GRACE
                       The issue here is that you have
                       stolen one of the most exciting
                       nights of the year from your
                       sisters.

                       If anybody had done this to you
                       when you were a child, we never
                       would have heard the end of it.
          
                                 LEONARD
                       I wish somebody had done it to me.
                       I wish either one of you had given
                       a shit about my weight.

                       Dad, you and mom are going to die
                       young if you keep eating as poorly

                       The coach for Jefferson High is
                       also my gym teacher. He told me

                       start as center for the Freshman
                       team when I get to high school.
          
                                 PATRICK
                       Center is a great position.
                       Toughest guy on the field. A good
                       center can make or break a team.

                       hard to get into shape. You guys
                       should to. At the rate you're
                       going, you won't make it to your

                       She doesn't! Tonight she served
                       spaghetti and meatballs from a can.
                       The amount of sodium alone can
                       wreck havoc on a person's blood

                       if I want to keep this firm ass as
                       an adult, I gotta develop good

                       To be honest, I can't wait till
                       this job is finished. This place
                       is creepy. You know, a boy died

          opens the chamber and loads the gun with a single bullet.
          
          Then he spins the chamber and locks it. Gus puts the gun to
          his head and fires. NOTHING. He throws the gun across the
          room, grabs the bottle of whiskey and drinks it till it's
          gone.

                    He committed suicide in his jail

                    called just now to tell me.
          
          Jim and Jacob sit, stunned. Their shock turns to intrigue as
          Ashley, appearing unaffected by the news, crosses to the
          kitchen table, opens a nearby box of donuts and begins
          eating. She is smiling.
          
                              JACOB
                    Why are you smiling?    A boy died.
          
                              ASHLEY
                    No, a monster that murdered my son
                    died. Justice is served; end of
                    story.
          
          Ashley crosses to the kitchen sink. She rolls up her sleeves
          and begins cleaning. Jim crosses over to her and they kiss
          as if nothing happened. Jacob is baffled by their behavior.

                       when you heard, you started
                       dancing.
          
                                  JACOB
                       No.
          
                                 KENNY
                       I knew he wouldn't make it. It's
                       my fault too. Jeff wasn't a saint
                       when I met him, but he sure as hell
                       wasn't headed here.
                           (tearing up)
                       That fucking asshole!
          
          Kenny drops the phone and begins crying in his arms. Jacob
          watches through the glass, touched by Kenny's reaction.

          INT. JACOB'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - CHRISTMAS MORNING
          
          Jacob sits on the floor, surrounded by boxes and wrapping
          paper. Santa has obviously been good to him.
          
          Jim sits on the couch, drifting in and out of sleep.
          
          Ashley, dressed in her finest Christmas sweater, peruses the
          fireplace mantel and all of the decorations that line it.
          She is a drastically different woman than the last time we
          saw her. She looks upbeat and pretty.
          
                                  JACOB
                       An IPOD!   Sweet!
          
          Ashley looks at Jacob and smiles.    He has just unwrapped an
          IPOD.

                                    JACOB
                       I love it.     You guys went crazy
                       this year.
          
          Ashley smiles at her son. It's a bittersweet moment for her.
          
                                 JIM
                       I'm going to shower.
          
                                 ASHLEY
                       Jim, Jacob still has one more
                       present.
          
                                 JIM
                       I thought we were going to wait.

                       No, do it now! Now!
          
          Ashley crosses to the couch and sits beside Jim.    They hold
          each others hands.
          
                                 ASHLEY
                       After serious debate, your father
                       and I have decided... to adopt A
                       BABY!
          
                                    JACOB
                       What?
          
                                 JIM
                       We're gonna adopt a baby.
                       Hopefully a boy.

          Leonard's extended    family sits at the kitchen table, eating
          Christmas dinner.     His extended family is just as overweight
          as his immediate.     Leonard barely touches his own plate, too
          disgusted to eat.     He rises.
          
                                 LEONARD
                       May I be excused?
          
          The entire family stops eating and turns to him.

          Leonard sits back down.    His family quickly resumes eating.

          Malee does her homework, Yacoo flips through a fashion
          magazine.
          
                                 MALEE
                       Why do I have to do this? It's
                       Christmas break.

                       Just because you're an atheist, I
                       don't get to celebrate the
                       holidays.
          
          Yacco shoots Malee the look of death.

          EXT. 7-11 PARKING LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT
          
          Malee flips through a TELEPHONE BOOK.      She comes to Gus' name
          and rips out the page.
          
                                                                    61.

          Malee knocks on Gus' door, but he doesn't answer. Then Malee
          spots a WELCOME MAT. She kicks it aside and discovers a
          SPARE KEY underneath.
          
          INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Malee cautiously enters, shutting the door behind her. A
          beat. She allows the excitement to settle in. It's your
          typical bachelor pad. Stray beer bottles decorate every
          shelf and end table. Dirty clothes drape across an old
          couch. Malee continues on to the kitchen.
          
          INT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
          
          Malee finds the kitchen more of a mess than the living room.
          Pots, pans and stacks of TV dinners line the counter top.
          
          INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Malee enters and stops cold at the sight of the bed. Its
          unmade and the sheets and blankets are entangled in a ball.
          Aroused, Malee sits on the bed and then lies back in ecstacy.
          
          EXT. FRONT OF GUS' APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME TIME
          
          Gus drives up, parks along the sidewalk, and gets out.
          
          INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME
          
          Malee goes through a photo album. We see pictures of Gus,
          dressed in a firefighter's uniform. He appears much younger
          and clean cut.
          
          As Malee returns the album to the night stand, she notices a
          an open drawer and peeks inside.
          
          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - SAME TIME
          
          Gus lazily makes his way upstairs.
          
          INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME
          
          Malee holds Gus' gun. Complete with sound effects, she
          pretends to shoot a beer bottle off the dresser.
          
          Malee laughs and then jumps across the bed like a Charlie's
          Angel.
          
                                                                   62.

          INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME
          
          Malee stands in front of the mirror, posing.
          
                                 MALEE
                      Freeze!   That's right.
          
          Malee laughs in spite of herself. In the process, she
          unknowingly cocks the trigger.   Malee places the gun to her
          forehead and pretends to shoot herself.
          
          TIGHT ON TRIGGER, a hair away from firing -
          
          SFX: BAM!
          
          INT. GUS' APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR - SAME TIME
          
          The loud bang we heard was the front door slamming shut.   Gus
          opens it and inspects the door frame.
          
          INT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN/BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER
          
          Gus removes a beer from the fridge. We follow him into his
          bedroom. He stops cold as if feeling the presence of some
          one else there, but Malee is nowhere to be found.
          
          Gus begins getting undressed. We follow his shirt to the
          floor and SEE Malee, hiding underneath his bed.
          
          SFX: FOOTSTEPS, DOOR OPENING, SHOWER RUNNING
          
          Malee looks out from underneath the bed. She watches as the
          now naked Gus enters the shower stall in the bathroom.
          
          As the water falls upon Gus, Malee rises from underneath the
          bed and crosses over to him.
          
          INT. GUS' APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          From over Gus's shoulder, we see Malee approaching. An inch
          away from Gus, Malee reaches out her hand to touch him.
          Suddenly, Gus breaks down and starts crying.
          
          Unsettled, Malee slowly retreats out of the bathroom.
          
          INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - NEXT DAY
          
          Malee, Leonard and Jacob sit, playing LIFE, the board game.

          Malee has been silent this entire time.    Seeing a moment, she
          speaks up.
          
                                 MALEE

                    That's a gun.
          
                                 MALEE
                    I know.

                              MALEE
                    I can't tell you. I just need you
                    to hide it for a while. When all
                    is cool, I'll come for it.
          
                              JACOB

          Jacob crosses to his closet, removes his metal LOCK BOX and
          opens it. Jacob takes the gun and places it inside.

                     No, but I do have some bullets.
          
          Malee reaches into her backpack and removes the bullets.
          Jacob takes them out and puts them in the lock box.

                     Besides, I could be building a bomb
                     in here, and they wouldn't even

          ON TWO FEET, running. We REVEAL that it's LEONARD. His once
          skin tight sweat suit, hangs off of him. More than just
          skinny, Leonard is in perfect shape. He runs fast, carefully
          avoiding puddles of melting snow. (Spring is fast on the

          Jacob and Kenny talk via one way phone. Their demeanor has
          changed since last we saw them. No longer fraught with
          contempt and acrimony, they speak like two old friends.

                       Before you go, I got some news.
                       Apparently, the parole board feels
                       I've been a model prisoner, so
                       they're giving me early release.

                       You're pissed, aren't you? I knew
                       you would be.

                        (off Malee's look)
                    Fine, spend it. You'll have to do
                    it alone though. I have a patient

                       Malee, dinner!
          
          Yacco notices a number of department store bags strewn
          everywhere.

                       Oh my God!
          
          REVEAL MALEE, standing across the room. She is no longer the
          gawky, adolescent girl. Rather, she has been transformed
          into a beautiful young woman. Her glasses have been replaced
          by contacts, and her braided pig tails by a quaff of chin
          length curls.

                       Spring. What do you think?
          
          Malee spins around, giving Yacco the full picture.

                       Honey, in the future, I'd like to
                       know if you're going to radically
                       change your appearance. Clean your

          Once the cement is poured, the truck pulls forward. Malee is
          revealed, standing there and holding a picnic basket.
          
          Gus sees the new and improved Malee for the first time.      His

                       Boys my age are so immature. I'm
                       more attracted to older gentlemen.

                                 JACOB
                       He's not some baby.   He's like 10.
          
                                 KENNY
                       You're blaming me for this?
          
                                  JACOB
                       No.   But can you believe it?
          
          
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                   76.

                                 KENNY
                       Maybe this is the only way they can
                       get over Rudy's death.
          
                                 JACOB
                       He's a person not a fucking vase.
          
                                 KENNY
                       I know.
          
                                 JACOB
                       I gotta get out of there. I can't
                       live in that house for one more
                       day. I want to go with you to New
                       Mexico.
          
                                 KENNY
                       No way. You've never even   been
                       out on the road.
          
                                 JACOB
                       So.
          
                                 KENNY
                       It's not easy. After first night
                       falls, you'll be pissing yourself.
          
                                 JACOB
                       No, I won't.
          
                                 KENNY
                       You don't need me to run away from
                       home.
          
                                 JACOB
                       That's not what this is about.
          
                                  KENNY
                       Yes, it is.
                           (beat)
                       And you want to come with ME of all
                       people. Are you forgetting, I was
                       the one who killed Rudy!
          
                                 JACOB
                       That was an accident.
          
          Kenny appears stunned.    Jacob has never accepted that truth.
          
          
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

                              JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    I'll be helpful. I can get
                    everything we'll need together. As
                    soon as you're released, we can go.
          
          Kenny appears to be weighing the decision.
          
                              JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    Please.
          
                              KENNY
                    If this is what you want.   Alright.
          
          INT. MALEE'S HOME - KITCHEN - SAME TIME
          
          Yacco is on the phone with her ex-husband.
          
                              YACCO (INTO PHONE)
                    ... I'm not asking for much. Just
                    call her from time to time...
                    Because she needs to know her
                    father cares... Call collect.
          
          Malee enters the kitchen.
          
                              MALEE
                    Is that Dad? Can I talk to him?
          
                              YACCO
                    Take some responsibility for
                    yourself and grow... Hello?...
          
          Yacco slams the phone down.
          
                              YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    He hung up.
          
                              MALEE
                    Well, what do you expect?   All you
                    ever do is yell at him.
          
                              YACCO
                    Malee, you don't understand.
          
                              MALEE
                    He's my Dad! I'm sorry if it
                    bothers you, but I love him. You
                    keep this up then one day, when I'm
                    old enough, I'll leave here and go
                    and stay with him.
          
          Malee runs out of the room, leaving a disappointed Yacco.
          
                                                                  78.
          
          
          
          INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT
          
          Leonard hammers a piece of wood over the basement door, which
          is now entirely boarded up.
          
          REVEAL the basement. Now clean. Boxes, furniture and trash
          are piled neatly in a corner. Only a mattress remains on the
          floor in the center of the room.
          
          Leonard grabs a grocery bag and crosses to a bathroom at the
          opposite end of the basement.
          
          INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Leonard turns on the light, revealing a shower, toilet and
          sink. He removes toiletries from the grocery bag and places
          them inside.
          
          INT. LEONARD'S HOME - DEN - SAME TIME
          
          Grace watches FAMILY FEUD while eating cake.
          
                              LEONARD (O.S.)
                        (screaming)
                    Help! Oh God, Ma! Help!
          
          Grace drops her fork.
          
                               GRACE
                    Leonard?
          
          Grace jumps up and runs out of the room.
          
          INT. LEONARD'S HOME - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Grace opens the door to the staircase, which leads to the
          basement.
          
                              GRACE
                        (screaming)
                    Leonard, what's wrong?
          
                              LEONARD (O.S.)
                    It's on top of me. I can't get up!
                    Oh, there's so much blood!
          
                              GRACE
                    I'm calling 9-1-1!
          
                              LEONARD (O.S.)
                    Get it off me first! I'm bleeding.
          
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
                                 GRACE
                       If I go downstairs, I won't be able
                       to make it back up. Let me call
                       9-1-1 first, okay?
          
          Leonard doesn't answer her.
          
                                    GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       Leonard?
          
          Silence.
          
                                    GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       Oh, Jesus!
          
          Grace begins walking downstairs. Due to her size, she has
          difficultly maneuvering through the tight space. Her
          inability to see her feet isn't helping matters.
          
          Grace makes it downstairs, but Leonard is nowhere in sight.
          
                                    GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       Leonard?
          
          Suddenly, Leonard bursts through the bathroom door with a
          hammer in hand. He runs past Grace and up the stairs.
          
                                 GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       What the hell?
          
          Half way up the stairs, Leonard stops and pries two of the
          steps off the stair case with his hammer. This creates a
          GAP, making it virtually impossible for Grace to ascend.
          
                                 GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       What are you doing? I can't climb
                       up now!
          
          Leonard runs upstairs and slams the door after him.
          
                                    GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       Leonard!     Leonard!
          
          EXT. GUS' APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME TIME
          
          Malee watches as Gus enters his car and drives off.
          
          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER
          
          Malee crosses to Gus' door with a GROCERY BAG in hand. She
          kicks the welcome mat aside, picks up the spare key and
          enters.
          
                                                                    80.
          
          
          
          INT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
          
          Malee enters and removes a pair of rubber gloves, a bottle of
          ammonia and trash bags. She starts cleaning.
          
          INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - LATER THAT DAY
          
          Leonard descends the staircase, holding a tray of food.
          
          Grace instantly rises.
          
                              LEONARD
                    I hope someone is hungry.
          
                              GRACE
                    Get me out of here now!
          
                              LEONARD
                    No joke, Ma. For the next two
                    weeks while Dad and the girls are
                    away, you will be kept down here.
                    I'll provide you with nutritious
                    meals and plenty of water. You,
                    mother, will learn what it means to
                    be healthy.
          
                              GRACE
                    That's what this is about, food?
          
                              LEONARD
                    I'm trying to save your life, mom.
                    Trying to give you a life. Cause I
                    love you.
          
                              GRACE
                    My life is fine.   I don't need you
                    to "save me".
          
          Leonard looks at his mother, sympathetic.
          
                              LEONARD
                    You don't even realize how sick you
                    are. It's a problem when an
                    otherwise healthy woman can't drag
                    her ass up a flight of stairs
                    because she's so obese. You're
                    staying down here.
          
          Leonard turns and crosses back to the staircase.
          
                              LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    Oh, and no cigarettes either.
          
                                                                    81.
          
          
          
          INT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING
          
          The kitchen is now spotless. Malee removes TWO TV DINNERS
          from the oven. She crosses over to the kitchen table and
          places the food onto plates.
          
          The table is set to the nines. A small candle burns in the
          center. Once the table is set and the food served, Malee
          takes a step back and smiles.
          
          INT. GUS' APARTMENT - BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Malee strips off her clothes and puts on a long, silk robe.
          
          EXT. GUS' APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME TIME
          
          Gus drives up, gets out of his car and enters the building.
          
          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Gus approaches his door. As he takes out his key, he notices
          that the welcome mat has been pushed off to the side. Gus
          lifts the mat up and sees that his spare key is gone.
          
          INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - FRONT ENTRANCE/ KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
          
          Gus enters.   He knows someone else is in there.
          
                               GUS
                    Hello?
          
          We follow him into the kitchen and FIND MALEE, standing
          beside the table and dressed only in her robe.
          
                              GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    What the hell is this?
          
                              MALEE
                    I made dinner, my love.   And I have
                    a surprise.
          
                              GUS
                    You've been in my apartment before,
                    haven't you?
          
          Malee drops her robe, revealing her naked body.    Gus quickly
          looks away.
          
                              GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    Malee, put your clothes on now!

                                 MALEE
                       Don't you like my body?
          
          Malee starts walking towards him.
          
                                 GUS
                       Malee, stop.
          
                                 MALEE
                       It's okay because I love you.
          
          Gus doesn't answer. Malee is right behind him now.     She puts
          her head on his back.
          
                                   MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       Touch me.
          
          Gus slowly turns around and looks at Malee for a long,
          pregnant beat. It's a tense moment, and we are unsure of
          what he's going to do. Then Gus moves past her and crosses
          to the living room.
          
                                 MALEE (cont'd)
                       Where are you going?
          
                                 GUS
                       To go call your mother.
          
          Gus exits.    Malee stands the fool.
          
                                 MALEE
                       But we're soulmates.
          
          Now embarrassed and crushed, she starts to cry.
          
          EXT. GUS'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT
          
          Malee, now wrapped in a large overcoat, is led by Yacco out
          of the building and over to her car.
          
          INT. YACCO'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Yacco and Malee sit in silence.      After a beat.
          
                                 YACCO
                       I don't know what to say to you.
          
          INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Jacob shoves clothes into his backpack.
          
          Keith enters with Rudy's baseball glove on his hand.
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 KEITH
                       Wanna play some catch?
          
          Jacob notices the glove. He rushes over to Keith, yanks it
          off his hand and pushes Keith to the ground.
          
                                 JACOB
                       Where the hell did you get this?
          
                                 KEITH
                       The closet. Ow, what's wrong?
          
          Keith struggles to get free, but Jacob is too strong.
          
                                 KEITH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       You're hurting me.
          
                                 JACOB
                       Did I say you could play with the
                       glove? Did I?
          
                                 KEITH
                       No, I just...
          
                                 JACOB
                       Everything, and I mean, EVERYTHING
                       in this room is mine. You are not
                       allowed to touch a thing,
                       especially the glove.
          
                                 KEITH
                       Okay, okay.
          
          Jacob gets off of Keith and crosses to his closet. He pulls
          out the lock box, unlocks it and removes the gun. He points
          it at Keith.
          
                                 JACOB
                       If you tell my parents what I said,
                       I'll kill you. I'll shoot you in
                       the fucking face, I swear it!
          
          Keith nods, petrified. Jacob puts the gun back in the lock
          box, throws it in the closet and storms out of the room.
          
          INT. JACOB'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Ashley sits at the kitchen table, looking at a picture of
          Rudy and Jacob when they were infants. Her eyes are filled,
          but she's not crying.

          Jacob enters and crosses to the fridge.      He spots Ashley and
          is taken aback by her state.
          
                                  JACOB
                           (cold)
                       What's wrong now?
          
                                 ASHLEY
                       I was looking at a picture of you
                       and Rudy when you were born. God,
                       I miss him.
          
                                 JACOB
                       But you have Keith now
          
          Ashley is struck by Jacob's comment.
          
                                 ASHLEY
                       What the hell does that mean?
          
                                 JACOB
                       You have Keith. Two boys again.
                       Everything is fine.
          
                                 ASHLEY
                       We didn't adopt Keith to replace
                       Rudy.
          
                                 JACOB
                       Didn't you?
          
                                 ASHLEY
                       For your information, your father
                       and I discussed adopting for years.
          
                                 JACOB
                           (not buying it)
                       Right. Maybe if it was me who
                       died, you wouldn't need another kid
                       to get over it.
          
                                 ASHLEY
                       How can you say that? I never
                       wanted either of my children to
                       die.
          
                                 JACOB
                       But one of us did. If you had to
                       choose which one, I bet you wish it
                       was me.

                                JACOB
                    You did!    Admit it.
          
                              ASHLEY
                    I admit he was easier to raise, but
                    we didn't love him more. Jacob,
                    listen to me. You came with a
                    different set of challenges.

                    My birthmark.
          
                              ASHLEY
                    It's not easy being different...

                        (screams)
                    I'm not different!! You always
                    made me feel like something was
                    wrong. There's nothing wrong with
                    me.
          
                                ASHLEY
                    I know...
          
                               JACOB
                    No, you don't! It's like you don't
                    know how to deal with me. You
                    never did.
          
                              ASHLEY
                    I'm sorry if that is how you feel.
                    You do the best you can as a
                    parent. You don't always know
                    what's right. But you're my son.
                    I'd do anything for you. I'd fight
                    for you, I'd kill for you, I'd die
                    for you.

                    Rudy used to say that exact same
                    thing.
          
                              ASHLEY
                    It's true. And as unchristian as
                    it sounds, I still want the boy
                    that killed Rudy dead. Someday,
                    when you grow up, you'll understand

          Grace exits the bathroom and begins walking around the
          basement, looking for a way out. She crosses to the boarded
          up door and tries to pull the boards off. Unsuccessful, she
          returns to the bed and sits.
          
          After a beat, Grace spots the tray of food, which is still
          untouched. Angry and disgusted, she takes it and throws it
          at the wall.

                    When Pat calls, and I don't answer,
                    he'll know something is wrong.
                    He'll know. I'll be fine.

          Grace nervously rocks back and forth. Sweat covers her body.
          She glances at the tray of food, which rests on the floor.

                    Open this door now! Let me out,

          threw on the floor.
          
          After a beat, Grace crawls over to it and starts shoving it
          down her throat. She doesn't seem bothered by the fact that
          her dinner is covered with dirt.
          
                                                                  87.

                    Before we begin, I want to
                    apologize. I should have known
                    what was going on with Malee.
          
                              GUS
                    It's my fault. I knew she had a
                    crush on me. I guess, I felt bad
                    for her. She's a very unhappy
                    girl.
          
          Yacco looks down, embarrassed.

                    If it's any consolation, the whole
                    thing was very "therapeutic" for
                    me.
                        (off Yacco's look)

                    One of the last fires I ever fought
                    was a brownstone, beautiful. The
                    place was burned from roof to
                    basement. Whole family was wiped
                    out. When I was upstairs,
                    inspecting, I found a girl. She
                    couldn't have been more than 12.

          SUDDENLY, he hears the sound of water boiling over from the
          stove. Leonard quickly turns the gas low, extinguishing the
          flame. He removes the pot from the burner, grabs a strainer
          and removes poached EGG WHITES from the water.

          wipes the oven knob dry, he turns the gas on high. (Since
          the overflowing water, extinguished the pilot light, he is
          unaware that gas is now being emitted from the burner.)    In
          his condition, HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SMELL IT.

          With the help of the railing, Grace pulls herself up to the
          GAP in the staircase. In one forceful exertion, she propels
          her body up and forward. The railing instantly becomes
          separated from the wall. Grace lands in a heap.
          
          Luckily, the top half of her body made it to the other side.

                       enough for her to fit in. Even if
                       they had, no one could have carried
                       it.
                           (tearing up)
                       I loved her so much. I don't want
                       that to happen to me.

                       Even if I can manage the food...
                       Can you honestly see me, running a
                       marathon?
          
                                 LEONARD
                       You don't have to run a marathon.
                       You just have to run to the end of
                       the block. It's not so hard as you
                       think it is.
          
                                    GRACE
                       I'll try.
          
          Leonard leans over and kisses his mother's forehead.
          
                                 GRACE (cont'd)
                       I spoke to your father. He and the
                       girls caught a flight. They should
                       be here by morning.
          
                                 LEONARD
                       Did you tell him what happened?
          
                                 GRACE
                       I told him there was a gas leak.
          
                                    LEONARD
                       I meant...

                    I know what you meant. I didn't
                    tell him. I don't think I will.
          
          Leonard smiles.
          
          INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
          
          Jacob lies awake, staring out the window.     A heavy wind
          blows.
          
          SFX: WATCH ALARM
          
          Jacob sits up and silences his watch alarm.
          
          Keith awakens as well, but remains silent. He watches as
          Jacob grabs a bag and exits the house through the window.
          
          Once he's gone, Keith gets off the top bunk, crosses to the
          window and watches as Jacob runs off.
          
          Immediately, Keith crosses to the closet. He removes the
          lock box and begins trying combinations to open it.
          
          EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          A heavy rain begins to fall as Jacob rides up. He sees
          Kenny, standing inside of a partially, constructed house.
          
                              KENNY
                    You're late.
          
                                JACOB
                    I'm here.
          
          Kenny throws Jacob a PONCHO.
          
                              KENNY
                    Put this on.
          
          Jacob removes his backpack and puts on the poncho. Then he
          opens his backpack and removes his HOCKEY MASK. (The same
          mask he was wearing at the beginning of the movie.)
          
                              KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    What the fuck is that?
          
                              JACOB
                    If people see me riding around in
                    the middle of the night, we're
                    screwed. You didn't bring a
                    disguise?

          The boys start riding off in opposite directions.
          
                                 KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       The main road is this way.
          
                                 JACOB
                       Yeah, but if we cut through the
                       construction site, we'll hit the
                       railroad tracks. It's faster and
                       no one will bother us.
          
                                 KENNY
                       Good point.
          
          Kenny files in behind Jacob, and the boys make their way deep
          into the construction site. Thunder and lightning crash.
          
          INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - SAME TIME
          
          Keith has forgone opening the lock box via a combination and
          now tries to pry the top open with a SCREWDRIVER. He works
          frantically, fearing Jacob's return.
          
          EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME TIME
          
          Jacob and Henry make their way to the edge of the
          construction site. Suddenly, Jacob stops in his tracks.
          
                                 KENNY
                       What's wrong?
          
          Jacob lifts the hockey mask.
          
                                 JACOB
                       I can't do this.
          
                                 KENNY
                       What?!
          
          Jacob begins rummaging through his backpack.
          
          INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - SAME TIME
          
          Keith pries the box open.       It's EMPTY.   No gun or bullets.
          
                                                                     96.

                    Son of a bitch! I knew it.     I knew
                    you'd chicken...
          
          Jacob rises, holding the gun.   He points it at Kenny.
          
                              KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    What the fuck?
          
          Jacob shakes, frightened and reluctant to do what he believes
          he has to do.
          
                              JACOB
                    I can't let you leave, Kenny.     You
                    have to pay for what you did.
          
                              KENNY
                    Whoa, whoa hold on. Alright, I...
                    I won't go. I'll stay here. I'll
                    do my probation.
          
          Jacob cocks the gun.   Tears stream down his checks.
          
                              JACOB
                    You killed him. I gotta do this...
                    for my family. It's the only way.
          
                              KENNY
                    Jacob, I told ya, it... it was an
                    accident. I swear. Please, don't.
                    This isn't you.
          
                             JACOB
                    I know. But I can't be a pussy all
                    my life.
          
          Jacob fires. Kenny is hit in the head.      He drops to the
          ground instantly.
          
          The force of the gun, knocks Jacob to the ground.      As he
          falls, the hockey mask comes down over his face.
          
          Jacob sits for a beat, staring at Kenny's lifeless body.
          Lightning flashes, illuminating his blue eyes through the
          hockey mask.
          
          EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Jacob is inside one of the UNPAVED house foundations, digging
          a hole. He cries, struggling to finish what he has done.

          Once a hole is dug, Jacob throws Kenny's body inside and
          starts covering it up with dirt.
          
          INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
          
          Jacob climbs through his window, soaking wet. He crosses to
          his closet and begins to change. Keith lies in bed, watching.
          
          Jacob removes the gun from his pocket and places it back
          inside the lock box. His hands shake violently. As he puts
          the box back inside the closet. He finds Rudy's glove. He
          smells the leather and smiles.
          
          Jacob takes the glove and crosses over to his bed.    He places
          the glove beside Keith.
          
                                 KEITH
                       I thought I wasn't supposed to
                       touch this.

                       It's yours. Just don't leave it
                       outside. If it gets wet, the
                       leather will crack.
          
                                 KEITH
                       I'll take good care of it.   I know
                       this was Rudy's.

          Keith lies back in bed, smiling. Jacob rolls over, still
          unnerved by what he is done. He'll never be the same, and he

          It's a bittersweet moment. While relieved by the fact that
          his crime will be hidden, the guilt overwhelms him.
          
                                 MALEE (cont'd)
                       Earth to Jacob. You coming?
          
                                  JACOB
                       Huh?   Oh, yeah.
          
          Jacob turns his bike around, and the two ride off together.
          
                                 MALEE
                       You know, your birthday's coming
                       up. Any hints as to what you might
                       like?
          
                                 JACOB
                       Whatever you get me will be fine.
          
                                 MALEE
                           (annoyed)
                       Right.
          
          Malee eyes Jacob, sensing that something is wrong.
          
                                 MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                       Are you okay?
          
                                 JACOB
                           (lying)
                       Never better.
          
          BACK ON the foundation. Gus enters frame and begins
          spreading cement over Kenny's grave.
          
                                                     FADE TO BLACK:
          

          THE END
