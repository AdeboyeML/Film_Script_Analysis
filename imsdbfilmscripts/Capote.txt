                 Based on the book "Capote: A Biography" by Gerald Clarke

                

               TITLE UP:         "Western Kansas, 1959"

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

               The CAMERA follows a SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, long hair, pretty 
               Sunday church dress, walking toward a peaceful farmhouse. At 
               the door she lifts the knocker. The door opens slightly. The 
               girl turns and looks past the camera at her MOTHER, sitting 
               in an old Plymouth idling in the driveway. Her mother shrugs, 
               motions for her to go inside.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               The girl walks through the downstairs rooms. In the kitchen, 
               the PHONE is OFF the hook. The girl looks back toward the 
               open front door. She turns toward the stairs, climbs them.

               INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS

               She walks down the hall to a BEDROOM DOOR at the end. The 
               door is slightly ajar. She knocks, then enters the room.

               INT. FARMHOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The girl's POV: the CAMERA pans across the bedroom of a high 
               school coed. We see the desk, the bureau, the bed. On the 
               bed lies NANCY CLUTTER, her wrists and legs bound in rope, 
               SHOT in the head. There is blood on the wall. The sixteen 
               year-old girl stands immobile. Before she starts to scream,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KANSAS LANDSCAPE - DAY

               Trees ring the edge of a field.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. N.Y. CITYSCAPE, ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

               Buildings lit against the night sky.

               INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING/STAIRS - NIGHT

               Camera follows group of partygoers as they mount the stairs: 
               Truman Capote, Barbara (very tall), Rose, Christopher, 
               Williams.

               INT. SMALL, PACKED NEW YORK APARTMENT/KITCHEN - LATER

               The friends are standing in the crowded kitchen -- people 
               are coming in and out -- talking and drinking and laughing.

                                     TRUMAN
                         So Jimmy Baldwin tells me the plot 
                         of his book, and he says to me: the 
                         writing's going well, but I just 
                         want to make sure it's not one of 
                         those problem novels. I said: Jimmy, 
                         your novel's about a Negro homosexual 
                         who's in love with a Jew -- wouldn't 
                         you call that a problem?

               Laughter.

                                     CHRISTOPHER
                         Susan's father had a minor heart 
                         attack, so she's writing more erotic 
                         poems about death and sex.

                                     BARBARA
                         It's so tiresome.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         Hmm. What rhymes with angina?

               Laughter. We see Truman watching everyone laugh. GRAYSON 
               notices, leans in to him. As the rest of the group continues 
               talking, we come closer, hear their conversation.

                                     GRAYSON
                         How's your writing?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Oh, I've got a million ideas of what 
                         to write next -- I just have to choose 
                         one.

                                     GRAYSON
                         Really?

                                     TRUMAN
                         No.

               Their attention is pulled back into the group as:

                                     BARBARA
                         Who would I want to play me? Natalie 
                         Wood.

                                     ROSE
                         Too fat.

                                     BARBARA
                         Audrey Hepburn?

                                     ROSE
                         Not bad. Sort of middle-class.

                                     TRUMAN
                         When a movie is made of my life I 
                         know exactly who I want as me...
                              (beat)
                         Marilyn Monroe.

               Barbara cracks up, chokes on her drink.

               EXT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE/BACK PATIO - MORNING

               Truman sits with his coffee, reading the New York Times. An 
               article catches his eye. He sits up straight, folds the paper 
               over, reads it.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, STUDY - DAY

               C/U of article being snipped out of PAGE 39 of the Times, 
               November 16, 1959. As the page gets turned around with each 
               snip, we see a small PHOTO of a middle-aged man wearing 
               glasses, with the caption: "FOUND DEAD: Herbert W. Clutter, 
               a wealthy Kansas farmer..." We read the headline: "WEALTHY 
               FARMER, 3 OF FAMILY SLAIN. Parts of the story: "HOLCOMB, 
               Kan., Nov. 15 (UPI) -- ...wheat farmer, his wife... two young 
               children found shot today..."

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, STUDY - MOMENTS LATER

               Truman on the phone.

                         William Shawn, please.
                              (he listens)
                         Adorable one? All of a sudden I know 
                         what article I'm going to write for 
                         you next.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, STUDY/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

               Truman on the phone, on a long cord, travels between the 
               study and the kitchen as he talks to William Shawn. We hear 
               pieces of the conversation, and see Truman in different parts 
               of the room as he says each bit.

                                     TRUMAN
                         ...never had anything like this happen 
                         to them before. They're used to 
                         sleeping at night with the doors 
                         unlatched....
                              (laughs)
                         Yes, we should buy stock in Master 
                         Locks -- all of Kansas will be in 
                         the hardware store tomorrow.

                         They have no idea who the killer is. 
                         But it doesn't matter who the killer 
                         is -- what matters is who the 
                         townspeople imagine the killer is. 
                         That's what I want to write about.

                         I'm gonna need some help... I'm 
                         thinking about Nelle -- she can 
                         protect me...

               JACK DUNPHY (strong, Irish-American, ten years older than 
               Truman) -- his longtime boyfriend -- enters the front door 
               with a bag of groceries, stops in the hall. He sees Truman 
               on the phone. Truman looks at Jack, though he's still speaking 
               to Shawn --

                         I want to leave tonight...

               EXT. TRAIN TRACKS, OUTSKIRTS OF NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

               A train barrels toward us, its headlight bright. The train 
               roars past, away from the city.

               INT. TRAIN, MOVING - NIGHT

               Truman hurries through the train, checking his ticket with 
               the sleeper cabins. His long SCARF trails behind. His longer 
               cashmere COAT practically brushes the floor.

               INT. TRUMAN AND HARPER LEE'S CABIN, TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

               Truman opens the door. Inside the cabin his childhood friend 
               from Monroeville, Alabama, NELLE HARPER LEE (yes, that Harper 
               Lee), is reading. She looks up, deadpan --

                                     NELLE
                         I figured you'd missed it.

               Nelle is a year younger than Truman, dowdy in dress, but 
               smart, tough, sensible. Truman smiles.

                                     TRUMAN
                         God I'm glad you agreed to come. 
                         You're the only one I know with the 
                         qualifications to be both a research 
                         assistant and personal bodyguard.
                              (then, noticing)
                         Oh, Nelle, you poor thing.

               He tries to spruce up her limp silk scarf.

                                     NELLE
                         Off. Truman. Off.
                              (holds his hands)
                         I'm happy to see you too, but I can 
                         still whip your behind.

               TWO BLACK PORTERS enter, one with an enormous TRUNK 
               (Truman's), the other with a sensible SUITCASE (Nelle's).

                                     PORTER #1
                              (reading tags)
                         Mr. Truman Capote, Miss Nelle Harper 
                         Lee. Where would you like these, 
                         sir?

                                     TRUMAN
                         That one up there and that one on 
                         the floor.

               He tips them.

                                     NELLE
                         What all did you bring?

                         to have you with us. If you don't 
                         mind my saying, your last book was 
                         even better than the first --

                                     TRUMAN
                         Thank you. You're very kind.

                              (to Nelle)
                         Ma'am.

               The PORTERS leave. Nelle is stunned. Truman fiddles with the 
               trunk locks, his back to Nelle. Silence, then:

                                     NELLE
                         You're pathetic.

               Truman doesn't answer.

                                     NELLE
                         You're pathetic.

                         What?

                                     NELLE
                         You paid them to say that.

               Truman won't look at her. She whacks him.

                                     NELLE
                         You paid them to say that!

                              (squealing)

                         "Just when you think they've gotten

                                     TRUMAN
                         You think that was too much?
                              (laughter)
                         I thought that was a good line.

               More laughter. More smacking of Truman. Then it is quiet.

                                     NELLE
                         Pathetic.

               Nelle's awake, but still in her bunk, looking out the window 
               at the Kansas plains. Truman's dressing, watching her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FINNEY COUNTY COURTHOUSE, GARDEN CITY - CONTINUOUS

               Truman and Nelle trot up the COURTHOUSE STEPS.

               INT. FINNEY COUNTY COURTHOUSE, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

               Truman approaches the GUARD DESK.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Mr. Alvin Dewey, please.

                                     GUARD
                         Third floor. In what used to be the 
                         Sheriff's Office.

               Truman CURTSIES.

               INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

               In the reception area, ALVIN DEWEY and the two other KBI 
               AGENTS assigned to the Clutter case are getting their jackets 
               on and straightening their ties. They've completely taken 
               over the office. They are: HAROLD "Brother" NYE (34); and 
               ROY "Curly CHURCH (60 - bald). They all smoke.

               Sheriff WALTER SANDERSON -- 60's, kind, overweight -- is 
               office-less (though he and his wife DOROTHY still live on 
               the fourth floor of the Courthouse.) WALTER lurks in the 
               background, nowhere to go, emptying one of many FILLED 
               ASHTRAYS, BOTHERED by the SMOKE. Truman and Nelle enter as:

                                     CHURCH
                         The wife said no more smoking in the 
                         house. I told her, "Fine. Walter's 
                         got a couch upstairs in his apartment. 
                         I'll stay with him and Dorothy till 
                         we're done here."
                              (to Walter)
                         I've got my bag and a carton of 
                         cigarettes in the car.

               WALTER looks uncomfortable. Dewey shakes his head at Church.

                                     DEWEY
                         Roy.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Mr. Dewey. Truman Capote from the 
                         New Yorker.

               Silence. The Agents stare at him.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

               Silence. Nye is looking at Truman, particularly puzzled.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Bergdorf's.

                                     NYE
                         Sorry?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The scarf.

                                     NYE
                         Oh.
                              (then)
                         Nice.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Thank you.
                              (turns to Dewey)
                         I wonder when we could arrange an 
                         interview? Some time to talk.

               Dewey stubs out his cigarette.

                                     DEWEY
                         About what?

                                     TRUMAN
                         We're not looking for any inside 
                         information -- I don't care one way 
                         or another if you catch whoever did 
                         this -- I'm writing an article not 
                         about the Clutter killings, but how 
                         they're affecting the town, how you 
                         all are bearing up --

                                     DEWEY
                         I care.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Excuse me?

                                     DEWEY
                         I care.
                              (puts on his hat, 
                              pulls out another 
                              cigarette)
                         I care a great deal if we catch 
                         whoever did this.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Yes --

                                     DEWEY
                         As do a lot of folks around here.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Of course.

               Dewey walks out. Nye and Church start out after him.

                                     NYE
                              (to Church)

                                     CHURCH
                         You have press credentials?

                                     NYE
                         What's the New Yorker?

                                     CHURCH
                         Magazine.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Magazines don't give out --

                                     CHURCH
                         You can come to the news conference 
                         with the rest of them.
                              (tips his hat to Nelle)
                         Sears and Roebuck.

               Nelle and Truman are left alone.

               INT. SPARE COURTROOM - DAY

               Packed with PRESS from all over the Midwest, as well as local 
               Finney County CITIZENS.

               Dewey's leading the press conference from a FOLDING TABLE 
               set up in front of the Judge's bench, flanked by the two 
               other KBI Agents. He's got a cigarette burning in an ashtray. 
               Truman and Nelle stand in the back.

                                     DEWEY
                         I'll talk facts but I won't speculate. 
                         The main fact here we need to be 
                         clear on is not one, but four people 
                         were killed. A lot of folks say Herb 
                         Clutter had to be the main target 
                         because he was dealt with the most 
                         brutally --

                                     JOURNALIST #1
                         Had his throat cut.

                                     DEWEY
                              (a moment)
                         Yes. We'd all like to know why. But 
                         it could've been any one of the family 
                         they were after. We just don't know --

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         You've identified the murder weapon?

                                     DEWEY
                         Wounds indicate a shotgun, close-
                         range, but no casings were found.

                                     JOURNALIST #1
                         Twelve-gauge, hunting --

                                     DEWEY
                         Right.

                                     JOURNALIST #1
                         They were all shot in the face?

               Dewey looks at the journalist. Then, evenly:

                                     DEWEY
                         No. Nancy in the back of the head.

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         Is there any evidence of, I'm sorry, 
                         sexual molestation of the women?

                                     DEWEY
                         No.

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         Anything else stolen?

                                     DEWEY
                         Kenyon's radio seems to be the only...

                                     JOURNALIST #3
                         The boy was sixteen?

                                     DEWEY
                         Fifteen. Nancy was sixteen.

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         It's her friend that found them?

                                     DEWEY
                         Laura Kinney.

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         Spell that?

                                     DEWEY
                         I assume you're okay with the Laura 
                         part. K-I-N-N-E-Y. But, please, leave 
                         her be.

               Lots of folks try to talk at once, one OLD MAN makes himself 
               heard above the rest:

                                     OLD MAN
                         There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans, 
                         a whole bunch of Mexicans...

                                     DEWEY
                              (standing, stubs out 
                              cigarette)
                         George, it's good to see you again. 
                         I do have an opinion whether this 
                         was the work of one man or a whole 
                         bunch, as you said, but it doesn't 
                         matter a whole lot whether it was 
                         Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos. 
                         We're going to find whoever did this. 
                         Four good people from our community 
                         are dead. Let's remember that. Okay 
                         with you?
                              (holds up a notice)
                         The West Kansas Farm Committee's 
                         offering a thousand dollar reward 
                         for information leading to an arrest. 
                         Please print that.
                              (moving to the exit)
                         Thank you all for coming.

               The room is immediately noisy as Dewey makes his way to the 
               door, pulling a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, followed 
               by Church and Nye. He's about to step out when Truman catches 
               his eye. Dewey exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RENTAL CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

               Nelle drives while consulting a MAP. Truman is leaning back, 
               looking out at the passing farms through the window. He speaks 
               almost to himself.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Mr. Dewey's protective of the 
                         Clutters. I wonder how well he knew 
                         them...

               Nelle glances over at him. He doesn't notice.

                                     TRUMAN
                         He was foxy with that old man.
                              (turns to Nelle)
                         Are you ever gonna let me drive?

                                     NELLE
                         Truman, you're a menace. You can 
                         barely see over the wheel.

               Truman looks back out the window at the farms, leans back.

                                     NELLE
                         This make you miss Alabama?

                                     TRUMAN
                              (rolling window down, 
                              shakes his head)
                         Not even a little bit.

               He leans his head out, closes his eyes.

               EXT. CLUTTER FARM - SUNSET

               Nelle pulls their car to the side of the COUNTY ROAD which 
               fronts the CLUTTER FARM. We recognize the FARMHOUSE as the 
               one in which Nancy Clutter was found dead. A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN 
               (20 years old) sits in a CRUISER parked up the driveway.

               CRIME SCENE TAPE marks the perimeter of the property. Truman 
               and Nelle get out of their car, stand at the foot of the 
               driveway, gazing at the lonely farmhouse.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               EXT. HOLCOMB HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

               A gorgeous fall day. Crowds of kids arriving at school. Many 
               are SOMBER. As Truman and Nelle walk toward the kids, some 
               look warily at Truman and give him a wide berth.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

               Kids back away. Nelle notices. She leaves Truman, walks up 
               to a group of THREE GIRLS.

                                     NELLE
                         Morning.

                         Hi.

                         Can any of you tell me where I'd 
                         find Laura Kinney?

                                     GIRL #1
                         Oh, um...

               The girl glances toward the school entrance where LAURA KINNEY 
               (who found Nancy Clutter's body) walks with DANNY BURKE (tall, 
               17).

                                     NELLE
                              (gently)
                         Is that her? With the tall boy?

                                     GIRL #2
                         Yeah. With Danny Burke.

                         Danny Burke?
                              (Girl #2 nods)
                         Thank you.

               As Nelle leaves, Girl #1 turns to her friend:

                                     GIRL #2
                         Oh, quiet yourself, Janice.

                         Truman. Truman --

               Truman doesn't hear. She watches Truman approach them. Laura 
               backs away. Danny leads her off. Nelle walks over to Truman, 
               looks at him for several moments.

               Nelle leaves. On Truman, as the bell rings and the mass of 
               teenagers starts to enter the school.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MAIN STREET, GARDEN CITY - DAY

               Truman walks alone, sees the Gilbart Funeral Home. He removes 
               his hat, slips past the few people standing outside.

               INT. GILBART FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

               Warm but slightly tacky. Some people are engaged in hushed 
               conversation at the reception area. Truman slips past, into 
               the back room.

               INT. BACK ROOM, GILBART FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

               No people, low light. Four CLOSED CASKETS at the back of the 
               room. Truman walks over slowly. After a moment, he checks to 
               make sure he's alone. Then he LIFTS THE TOP of one of the 
               caskets. It's Bonnie Clutter's body, in a long-sleaved navy-
               blue dress; but her head is wrapped in layers and layers of 
               white cotton gauze, and lacquered with a shiny substance -- 
               like an enormous cocoon. Truman stares.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Truman on the PHONE to Jack in Brooklyn. One of Truman's 
               trunks is open, displaying bottles of liquor, packaged and 
               tinned gourmet food, and stacks of unused yellow legal pads. 
               He drinks, standing at the window.

                                     JACK (OVER PHONE)
                         I think I scared a friend of yours 
                         this morning. He came looking for 
                         you while I was writing.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You hate my friends.

                                     JACK
                         I wouldn't say hate. So long as they 
                         don't knock on my door.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I saw the bodies today.

                                     JACK
                         Which?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The Clutters. I looked inside the 
                         coffins.

                                     JACK
                         That's horrifying.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It comforts me -- something so 
                         horrifying it's freeing. It's a 
                         relief. Normal life falls away.
                              (beat)
                         But, then, I was never much for normal 
                         life --

                                     JACK
                         No, you weren't.

                                     TRUMAN
                         People here won't talk to me. They 
                         want someone like you, like Nelle. 
                         Me they hate.

                                     JACK
                         I can't think of a single quality I 
                         share with Nelle.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Well --

                                     JACK
                         Maybe manliness.

                                     TRUMAN
                         My point exactly.

                                     JACK
                         It's why I left the Midwest in the 
                         first place. I knew I could only 
                         find someone like you in New York 
                         City.

               On Truman, gazing at the EMPTY TOWN SQUARE below.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. GARDEN CITY, VARIOUS - EARLY MORNING

               A SHOPKEEPER sweeps the sidewalk. There are THANKSGIVING 
               DECORATIONS in his shop window.

               A SCHOOL BUS picks up a SMALL BOY at the intersection of a 
               DIRT ROAD and the paved COUNTY ROAD.

               A SMALL BRIDGE over the Arkansas river. Below them, men are 
               sifting the riverbed with nets, moving slowly downstream.

               INT. WALKER HOTEL, LOBBY - EARLY MORNING

               Nelle waits by the FRONT DESK. The ELEVATOR DOORS open and 
               Truman emerges. He is DRESSED SOBERLY -- NO LONG SCARF, NO 
               LONG COAT. He walks toward Nelle, then TURNS as if he's a 
               runway model, walks away, turns again and walks back. He 
               stops a few feet in front of her. Nelle refuses to smile.

                                     NELLE
                         Let's go.

               EXT. HOLCOMB TOWN ROAD - EARLY MORNING

               Danny Burke walks down the road with a bookbag over his 
               shoulder. Nelle approaches him, Truman keeps his distance.

                                     NELLE
                         Danny?
                              (Danny stops)
                         Would you mind terribly if I walked 
                         with you for a bit?

               He shrugs. They walk together.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Laura opens door to Truman and Nelle.

               INT. LAURA KINNEY HOUSE, KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

               Nelle and Laura Kinney sit at the table. Truman stands at 
               the counter.

                                     LAURA
                         I thought you were from the FBI with 
                         your long coat.

                         Is that so?

                         That's why I ran off.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I've been getting a lot of that 
                         lately.

               Truman smiles. Laura smiles back, amused, a bit comforted.

                                     LAURA
                         It's fine talking to you all.

                         to talk since what happened.

                         Nancy was your best friend.

                                     LAURA
                         She was my best friend.

                         Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible 
                         ever happened to him before. Nancy 
                         just started wearing his ring again 
                         after this huge fight -- Mr. Clutter 
                         was trying to get her to end it 'cause 
                         Danny's Catholic.

                         Methodist. Danny was the last person 
                         at the house that night. That's why 
                         Mr. Dewey's keeps interviewing him -- 
                         they don't think he had anything to 
                         do with it -- just to see if he 
                         remembers anything unusual and all.

                         was involved.

                                     LAURA
                         That's been real hard for Danny.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Oh, it's the hardest -- when people 
                         have a notion about you and it's 
                         impossible to convince them otherwise. 
                         Since I was a child folks have thought 
                         they had me pegged because of the 
                         way I look and the way I talk. They're 
                         always wrong.
                              (looks at her)
                         Do you know what I mean?

               Laura stares at him and nods. He's clearly struck a chord.

                                     LAURA
                         I want to show you something.

               She goes in the door to the GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT. They see 
               her through the LACE CURTAINS getting something from her 
               DESK, which is stacked with books. Truman whispers to Nelle:

                                     TRUMAN
                         Not one person here understands her.

               Laura returns. She hugs a SMALL BOOK to her chest. After a 
               moment, she holds it out to them.

                                     LAURA
                         Maybe you'll get a better picture of 
                         Nancy. And the family.

               there, looking at the ceiling for a few moments. He closes

               Truman drinks coffee alone, sleepy. He takes a SMALL BOTTLE

               over his EGGS. He replaces the bottle in his jacket. Nelle

               hair neatly combed, like an Exeter schoolboy attending a 
               funeral. Nelle smiles.

                         minute you came to town he read your

               The remains of dinner. The kids have left. The bottle of J&B 
               sits on the table, half-empty. Marie's a bit drunk. Everyone's 
               PLATE is clean except for Alvin's, on which sits a MOUND of 
               uneaten black-eyed peas. Truman is mid-story.

                         I was writing the script as they

                         I'd work like mad all day long and 
                         then dash down to the bar around

                         just handed them the final scene 
                         when the bellhop told me I had a 
                         phone call. It was my stepfather, 
                         Joe Capote, calling to say that my 
                         mother had died. I flew home to New 
                         York -- terribly distraught -- but 
                         when I got to the apartment I could 
                         see that Joe was in even worse shape 
                         than I was. He grabbed my hands and 
                         sat me down at the kitchen table, 
                         and he said to me, "Talk. Talk about 
                         anything, any subject in the world. 
                         Don't worry whether it will interest 
                         me or not. Just talk so I won't break 
                         down." And I did. He couldn't bear 
                         to be alone with his thoughts. It 
                         was too painful.

               It's quiet for a moment, then Marie looks at Alvin.

                                     MARIE
                         It's been a hard couple weeks for 
                         Alvin. He and Herb Clutter were good 
                         friends. From church.

               Finally, Dewey looks at Truman and Nelle.

               Alvin shows Truman and Nelle the CRIME SCENE PHOTOS from the 
               Clutter murders. We see the four corpses, BOUND and SHOT, 
               the bloody footprints in the Clutter basement. Truman and 
               Nelle stare at the photos of Nancy and Kenyon. Then, quietly --

                         would they tuck Nancy in?

               Truman hands Nelle one of the photos. She looks at it --

               and a "ONE WEEK LEFT TO BUY YOUR GIFTS..." sign.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CLUTTER FARM - LATE AFTERNOON

               Truman and Nelle walk with PETE HOLT (70, very frail) on the 
               Clutter property. Apples rot on the ground, the trees are 
               bare, signs of disrepair are beginning to weather the house.

                                     HOLT
                              (re the apples)
                         I'd of picked them up but I haven't 
                         been myself. Mind you, I make the 
                         walk out here every day, check the 
                         house, make sure the pipes don't 
                         freeze -- that sort of item. The 
                         least I can do for Mr. Clutter.

                                     NELLE
                         How long have you worked here?

                                     HOLT
                         1940 -- a lotta years. The wife too, 
                         cleaning the house. Cooking.

                                     NELLE
                         Well, she's marvelous. Lunch was 
                         wonderful.

                                     HOLT
                              (ignoring this)
                         She had a hard job after what all 
                         happened. Cleaning. I burned most of 
                         the rest -- mattresses -- too far of 
                         a mess.
                              (then, looks at them)
                         I've asked around some -- if anyone's 
                         looking for a strong hand.

               They don't know what to say. Finally, he looks away.

                                     HOLT
                         I don't think they'll be able to 
                         sell the place till they catch the 
                         ones that did it.
                              (beat)
                         That's what I hear anyhow.

               Silence as the three of them look out over the barren fields.

               INT. CLUTTER HOUSE, BONNIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK

               Just the bed-frame -- the mattress is gone. Truman and Nelle 
               find her Bible on the bedside table, her bookmark, see the 
               painting of Jesus walking on water. Pete Holt stands off to 
               the side, waiting patiently.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WALKER HOTEL LOBBY, GARDEN CITY - NIGHT

               Through the front window we see a Christmas tree in the lobby.

               INT. WALKER HOTEL, TRUMAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Jazzy Christmas music on the RADIO. Nelle sits in the big 
               armchair with a drink. She laughs. We HEAR Jack on the phone:

                                     JACK
                         You're celebrating.

               We see Truman wearing a YELLOW SILK SHORT ROBE with white 
               lace, bare legs. He's on the phone and walking, for Nelle's 
               enjoyment, back and forth, like a runway model.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Remember Nelle's manuscript she sent 
                         me in New York?

                                     JACK
                         Mockingbird. Killing a Mockingbird. 
                         You said it was good.

                                     TRUMAN
                         And I was right. She just heard 
                         Lipincott wants to publish it.

                                     JACK
                              (pause)
                         Well. Jesus. That's terrific. Tell 
                         her congratulations.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Congratulations.
                              (covers phone, mouths 
                              to Nelle:)
                         Jealous.

                                     JACK
                         Just promise you'll be home by 
                         Christmas.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I can't leave now Jack -- I mean it 
                         was hard at first, but now I'm 
                         practically the mayor.

               He vamps. Nelle laughs.

                                     JACK
                         Alright.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I want to come home -- I do. Though 
                         if they catch whoever did this, who 
                         knows what -- I'll probably be here 
                         til next Christmas.

                                     JACK
                         Right. I'll let you go.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Jack, we'll go away this spring to 
                         write. Maybe Spain...

                                     JACK
                         Alright, Truman.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Bye.
                              (hangs up)
                         The poor boy misses me.

               Goes to the mini-bar to fix a drink.

                         Truman.

                         Nelle.

                                     NELLE
                         You remember when we were kids?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I was never a kid. I was born fully 
                         formed.

                                     NELLE
                         I had no idea what a homosexual was. 
                         But I knew whatever they were, you 
                         were one of 'em.

               Truman puts down his drink and marches out of the room, shuts 
               the door. Nelle's unsure whether she really insulted him. 
               From the HALL, we hear a WOMAN SHRIEK, and a MAN saying:

                                     MAN IN HALL (O.S.)
                         Oh. Uh. Oh. Excuse us.

               Truman runs back in, shuts door. They crack up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DEWEY HOME - NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVE, ESTABLISHING

               Tasteful Christmas lights strung on the BUSHES. A WREATH on 
               the FRONT DOOR.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Truman, Nelle, Marie and Alvin. Drinks. A FULL ASHTRAY on 
               the coffee table in front of Alvin. He's distracted, smoking. 
               Marie holds a WOMEN'S MAGAZINE, checking what Truman says 
               with what's written there.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (quickly, as if 
                              reciting)
                         -- girdle up -- no extra bulges -- 
                         if you're dressed right for him when 
                         he gets home, the evening should be 
                         smooth sailing. Bon voyage, gals.

                                     MARIE
                         I can't believe you got this whole 
                         page -- I only read it to you once!

                         TRUMAN
                 I've trained myself.

               Truman looks at Nelle.

                         TRUMAN
                 I have 94 percent 
                 recall.

                              (laughing)
                         You cut that out.

               Alvin stubs out his cigarette -- though it still burns. He 
               stands.

                                     MARIE
                         You believe that Alvin?

                                     ALVIN
                         Impressive.

               He walks out. Silence.

                                     MARIE
                         I'm sorry. He's upset.
                              (stubs out cigarette)
                         -- smoking three packs a day.
                              (then)
                         Two men did it. They know who. One 
                         of them used to have a cellmate who 
                         gave him up for the thousand dollar 
                         reward. They passed through Kansas 
                         City last week writing bad checks -- 
                         by the time Alvin's boys got up there 
                         they'd skipped out again.

                                     NELLE
                         Where to?

                                     MARIE
                         They have no idea.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, DINING ROOM - LATER

               Christmas dinner. Truman, Nelle, Marie and Alvin have just 
               sat down. They wait for the Dewey boys -- Alvin Jr. and Paul. 
               We hear them in the living room horsing around.

                                     DEWEY
                         Alvin. Paul. Now.

               It's quiet for a second. Then something crashes and breaks.

                                     DEWEY
                         Damnit.
                              (gets up, goes)
                         Come here.

                         Alvin Jr. Get over here.

                                     ALVIN JR. (O.S.)
                         Dad, the phone.

                                     DEWEY (O.S.)
                         Paul. Back to the table.

               Dewey returns to the dining room, pushing Paul ahead of him.

                                     DEWEY
                         Sit.

               Alvin Jr. enters.

                                     ALVIN JR.
                         Dad?

                                     MARIE
                         Tell them we're at dinner, Alvin.

                                     ALVIN JR.
                         Dad?

                                     DEWEY
                         Not now, Alvin.

               Alvin Jr. leaves. We hear the PHONE being HUNG UP. Alvin Jr. 
               returns and sits. They all get ready to say grace, then:

                                     ALVIN JR.
                         You need to call the Chief of Police 
                         in Las Vegas when you have a minute.

               Everyone looks at Dewey.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. COURTHOUSE SQUARE, GARDEN CITY - LATE AFTERNOON

               OVER BLACK SCREEN we hear the voice of a RADIO ANNOUNCER.

                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         ...This is KERG radio, Garden City. 
                         A friendly broadcast from a friendly 
                         place. Our lead story:

               Slowly, the sounds of a CROWD emerge in the background.

               FADE UP ON: HIGH SCHOOL kids sitting on the hood and front 
               seat of a CHEW parked at the edge of a CROWD of 200 people. 
               Truman watches. It is COLD. A fat, shivering CO-ED reads the 
               headline in the Kansas City Star: "Police Fear Lynch Mob." 
               The CAR RADIO is on.

                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

               Truman moves from the car into the large crowd. Old ladies; 
               ranchers; local businessmen; moms with kids; journalists 
               INTERVIEWING citizens; photographers lined up at the bottom 
               of the COURTHOUSE STEPS. We hear snippets of conversation as 
               we pass. A CITIZEN is being interviewed by a JOURNALIST; a 
               MOM WITH BABY standing with a FRIEND; a MIDDLE-AGED man in 
               an overcoat CRYING silently.

               Truman approaches Nelle and Marie Dewey, standing together 
               at the curb in front of the courthouse, near the 
               photographers. They are talking quietly, turn to Truman --

                                     NELLE
                         Hey.

               We hear LOUD CROWD NOISE at the south end of the square. A 
               CONVOY of FOUR CARS enters the square. It pulls around to 
               the front of the courthouse. STATE TROOPERS spill out of the 
               lead and rear CARS. Nye gets out of the second car. He opens 
               the back door. The crowd falls SILENT. Two state troopers 
               get DICK HICKOCK -- handcuffed, pale -- out of the car and 
               lead him up the steps. FLASH. FLASH.

               Dewey and Church open the third car's back door. Silence. 
               They retrieve PERRY SMITH. Perry is extremely SHORT, STRONG, 
               ODDLY BEAUTIFUL, with the dark skin and hair of his American 
               Indian mother, and the pug features of his Irish father. As 
               he stands, he has trouble straightening his stubby LEGS, as 
               if they are arthritic. Truman stares.

                                     MARIE
                              (whispers to Truman)
                         Motorcycle accident. He broke them 
                         and they never healed right.
                              (Truman looks at her)
                         Alvin told me.

               Truman watches Perry, transfixed. Perry seems terrified of 
               the crowd, all the faces, like a child. Perry scans the crowd. 
               His eyes fall on Truman. FLASH. FLASH. Truman and Perry look 
               at each other as Perry is led slowly past. At the top of the 
               steps the COURTHOUSE DOORS slam shut.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE (4TH FLOOR OF COURTHOUSE ) - 
               MORNING

               FADE IN: Truman knocks on the door, a NEWSPAPER, a BOOK, and 
               a PAPER BAG in his hand. On the door it says "SHERIFF'S 
               RESIDENCE - PRIVATE". Dorothy Sanderson opens the door.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Truman Capote.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Dorothy Sanderson. I figured you'd 
                         be left alone this morning by that 
                         hard-working husband of yours.
                              (holds up bag)
                         So I have breakfast.
                              (holds up paper)
                         I have news.
                              (book)
                         And I have literature. My friend 
                         Jack mailed me the book you wanted.

               He presents book. Dorothy, flattered, takes it, reads the 
               inscription inside.

                                     DOROTHY
                         "For the maiden of the Midwest, the 
                         priestess of the plains, the queen 
                         of the kitchen: my first novel. 
                         Truman."

               It is "Other Voices, Other Rooms" and we see on the back of 
               it the INFAMOUS JACKET PHOTO of Truman at 23 draped sexily 
               on a couch. Truman curtsies. The PHONE RINGS.

                                     DOROTHY
                         You're too much. Go on into the living 
                         room, lemme grab that -- it's been 
                         ringing all morning.

               INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, FOYER - CONTINUOUS

               Truman walks into the residence. To the left is the kitchen; 
               to the right is the living room. Truman looks back at Dorothy -- 
               she's still on the phone. He heads for the kitchen.

               INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Truman walks slowly through the doorway of the large kitchen. 
               On the far side of the kitchen is a JAIL CELL. Inside the 
               cell is PERRY SMITH. (Now we know why Truman came here.)

               Truman STARES. Perry doesn't see him -- he's resting his 
               head on a small table, the tip of his THUMB in his mouth. 
               The chair seems too tall for Perry. He looks like a lonely 
               kindergartner, told to take his afternoon nap. After several 
               moments, Dorothy enters, flustered:

                                     DOROTHY
                         Oh. Truman. I meant in there.
                              (points to living 
                              room)
                         I... um...

               Perry sits up quickly, rubs his legs.

                                     DOROTHY
                         It's the women's cell. It's hardly 
                         ever used. But they wanted to, um, 
                         separate... Please. Let's sit in the 
                         living room. I'll set up in the living 
                         room.

               She gathers a tray of Truman's PASTRIES, and COFFEE CUPS.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Come.

               She goes -- Truman starts to follow, then lingers.

                                     TRUMAN
                         They put you in the women's cell.

                                     PERRY
                         Among other indignities.

               Perry's voice is oddly high, whispery -- special words are 
               precisely enunciated.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Well... she's a good cook.

                                     PERRY
                         She's scared of me.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I think so am I. A little bit.

                                     PERRY
                         Are you?
                              (a moment, then:)
                         You have any aspirin? My legs --

               Dorothy's in the doorway.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Um. Truman? All set.

               Truman looks at Dorothy, looks back at Perry.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm sorry.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               Judge ROLAND TATE, white-haired, imperious, bangs his gavel. 
               The packed crowd quiets down. Perry and Dick sit at the 
               defense table chewing JUICY FRUIT GUM. Next to them: their 
               aged court-appointed lawyer, Franklin Weeks (70).

               Dick wears a SHIRT AND TIE. Perry wears jeans rolled up at 
               the cuff, his SHIRT OPEN at the collar. He draws on a piece 
               of paper with a STUBBY PENCIL -- a rather good picture of a 
               LARGE PARROT. Truman sits with Nelle, watching Perry --

                                     TRUMAN
                              (murmurs)
                         His feet don't touch the floor.

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         In the matter of the State of Kansas 
                         v. Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry 
                         Edward Smith this Court has been 
                         informed by counsel -- Mr. Weeks -- 
                         that defendants wish to waive their 
                         right to Preliminary Hearing. Mr. 
                         Hickock, is that your wish?

               Hickock looks at Weeks. Weeks nods. Hickock stands.

                                     HICKOCK
                              (unconvincing)
                         Yessir. Yes.

               Hickock sits. Truman whispers to Nelle --

                                     TRUMAN
                         Why are they doing that?

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         Mr. Smith.

                                     PERRY
                              (stands... then:)
                         I ask that the waiver be effectuated.

               Judge Tate looks at him for a moment --

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         So noted.
                              (bangs gavel)
                         We're adjourned.

               Crowd gets up. Much talk. Truman watches Perry and Dick 
               through the forest of bodies. They are led away in handcuffs. 
               Franklin Weeks stands slowly, then begins gathering his things -- 
               he's old and it takes him ages to collect his papers. Truman 
               watches.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE - AFTERNOON

               Truman knocks. He holds a PIE. Dorothy answers.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Mr. Capote.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (offers pie)
                         Madame Sanderson.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Is that for the two of us to share? 
                         Or for me to eat alone while you 
                         talk to our guest?

               Truman is caught. He smiles.

               INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

               Truman sits near the bars of the cell. Perry draws on a scrap 
               of paper at the small table. Dorothy watches from the door 
               to the living room. The BOOK Truman gave to Dorothy lies on 
               the floor next to Perry's meticulously made bed.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Was it your choice to waive the 
                         hearing?

               Perry doesn't answer. Dorothy checks her watch, leaves. Truman 
               takes a bottle of BAYER ASPIRIN out of his pocket.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You still need some?
                              (Perry doesn't move)
                         Give me your hand.

               Perry extends his hand through the bars. As Truman shakes 
               some aspirin into it --

                                     PERRY
                         I could kill you if you got too close.

               Perry puts the aspirin in his mouth, CHEWS THEM, holds out 
               his hand for more. Truman gives him more, which Perry puts 
               in his pocket for later.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Would you like some water?

               Perry shakes his head. Silence.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book --

                                     PERRY
                         He said we'd curry favor with the 
                         Judge if we waived our rights.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Who did?

                                     PERRY
                         The lawyer.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Okay.

               Truman nods, not wanting to push this any further. Perry 
               picks up the book, holds it out through the bars.

                                     PERRY
                         Your picture's undignified. People 
                         recall first impressions.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What's been your first impression?

                                     PERRY
                         You want something.

                                     TRUMAN
                         From you?

               Dorothy pokes her head in from the living room.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Truman. Walter's gonna be home soon.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to Perry)
                         I just want permission to talk.
                              (then)
                         Has anyone else visited?

               Perry doesn't answer.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Truman --

                                     TRUMAN
                         Will you tell me if you need anything? 
                         I can have whatever you want sent 
                         from New York.
                              (no answer)
                         Will you do that?

               On Perry, considering whether to trust this man.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I'm writing a book. It's too much 
                         for a single article -- this town, 
                         the killers most of all -- you will 
                         be stunned by Perry Smith --

                         Not much yet, but I know. I can sense 
                         him. He's desperately lonely,

               INT. HICKOCK'S JAIL CELL - DAY

               Perry has been placed in an adjoining cell for the afternoon. 
               He COMBS his greased hair in a mirror. A camera FLASHES.

               Nelle and Truman sit outside the cells. Franklin Weeks dozes 
               off to the side. RICHARD AVEDON -- small, dark, wiry, 
               flamboyant -- is snapping photos of a bare-chested Hickock 
               in the next cell, particularly his TATTOOS, while Hickock 
               chatters away.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Perry, honey. You look terrific...

               Perry is embarrassed, glances over at Truman. FLASH.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Calm yourself down, sweetheart.

               Perry glances at Nelle. She MOTIONS to him that his SHIRT is 
               buttoned wrong. Perry fixes it, looks back at her.

               Hickock notices Truman gazing at his tattoos -- the one on 
               his CHEST: the word PEACE, with a cross radiating rays of 
               light.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Be patient, Capote. Maybe later 
                         they'll send you my skin.

                         I have the perfect place for it, 
                         over the hearth.

               Hickock smiles. FLASH. Truman looks over at Perry, sitting 
               alone. Truman starts to remove his TIE.

               PHOTOS, in quick succession: Of Hickock pulling up his sleeve 
               to reveal his tattoos. Of Perry combing his HAIR. FLASH. The 
               GRINNING CAT on Hickock's hand. FLASH. Perry looking directly 
               at the camera. FLASH.

               An officer approaches down a long hallway. A janitor cleans 
               the basin of the water fountain. Spectators are drawn into 
               the courthouse. The officer opens the courtroom doors. A 
               crescendo of sounds.

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               Spectators take seats. The jury files back into the box. 
               Perry and Dick chew gum. Perry wears TRUMAN'S TIE, and draws 
               on a pad with a NEW SET OF COLORED PENCILS -- another PARROT, 
               quite beautiful, now YELLOW. Nelle and Truman sit together.

                         Where'd Perry get the art set?

               Truman shrugs. Nelle raises her eyebrows. Judge Tate GAVELS 
               loudly, looks to the jury.

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         Members of the jury. Have you reached 
                         a verdict?

               Judge nods, the foreman sits. Judge turns to Perry and Dick.

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene 
                         Hickock. You've been found guilty of 
                         four counts of murder in the first 
                         degree. You will be taken to the

                         year, nineteen hundred and sixty, 
                         each of you will be hanged by the 
                         neck until dead. So ordered.

               He GAVELS. Perry and Dick are set upon by Sheriff's Deputies 
               and led out. Photographers crowd them. Dick turns to Perry.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Alright, partner. Least now we're 
                         not the only killers in Kansas.

               Perry looks at him, utterly lost. FLASH.

               Nelle sits at the window, smoking. Truman in the armchair, 
               holding a drink. They've been up all night. Their bags are 
               packed. Also -- a few packed boxes of written -- in yellow 
               notepads and many typed pages. Truman glances at his watch.

                         He hasn't written a word yet, though 
                         he says it's the nonfiction book of 
                         the decade...

               We HEAR Truman before we see him:

                                     TRUMAN (O.S.)
                         He's little, but terrifying --

               We see Truman in the corner entertaining a small group. Jack 
               Dunphy stands off to the side. Nelle settles next to Jack.

                         He's as short as I am. And almost as 
                         pretty. I'd be with him right now 
                         but he's being given new 
                         accommodations --

                         don't see him that way. The book I'm 
                         writing will return him to the realm 
                         of humanity -- it's the book I was 
                         always meant to write...

                         To answer your question, I'm following 
                         "Breakfast at Tiffany's" by blazing 
                         a different path -- by inventing an 
                         entirely new kind of writing: the 
                         non-fiction novel.

                         You have a subject?

               Truman takes a last sip of his drink -- utterly serious now.

                                     TRUMAN
                         On the night of November 14, two men 
                         broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas 
                         and murdered an entire family. Why 
                         did they do that? It's been suggested 
                         that this subject is tawdry -- it's 
                         not worthy of literature. I disagree. 
                         Two worlds exist in this country -- 
                         the quiet conservative life, and the 
                         life of those two men -- the 
                         underbelly, the criminally violent. 
                         Those worlds converged that bloody 
                         night. I spent the past three months 
                         interviewing everyone in Kansas 
                         touched by that violence. I spent 
                         hours talking to the killers -- and 
                         I'll spend more.

                         Researching this work has changed my 
                         life, altered my point of view about 
                         almost everything. I think those who

                         You're really very clever.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY

               Truman sits in bed, writing on a yellow LEGAL PAD, surrounded 
               by PILES of notes. He squints his eyes, concentrating. Jack 
               enters, delivers a CUP OF COFFEE. Truman doesn't notice.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER

               Truman is rifling through the boxes, looking for particular 
               notes. He can't find what he needs. The phone RINGS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET, BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON

               Jack and Truman walk.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Perry's decided to appeal. He claims 
                         their attorney was incompetent -- 
                         that he never raised the issue of 
                         temporary insanity.

                                     JACK
                         So you find them a new lawyer.

                                     TRUMAN
                         They're facing execution in six weeks, 
                         Jack. They need someone to argue 
                         whether or not that's right.

                                     JACK
                         Okay.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'd also like to see them alive, 
                         yes, thank you very much. I need to 
                         hear their story.

               They walk in silence for a few moments.

                                     TRUMAN
                         If you met him you'd understand. 
                         It's as if no-one's ever asked him a 
                         single question about himself. He's 
                         so... damaged -- and strange -- 
                         unexplored...
                              (then)
                         I don't trust this Hickock fellow. 
                         Perry's the only person who can 
                         describe to me what happened that 
                         night. I need to hear him say it.

                                     JACK
                         Just be careful what you do to get 
                         what you want.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm finding them a lawyer.

                                     JACK
                         Truman. You're finding yourself a 
                         lawyer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR, DRIVING, TWO-LANE KANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY

               Truman drives alone, concentrating intently. He has to stretch 
               to see over the dashboard.

               EXT. KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY (KSP), LANSING - DAY

               A turreted, Civil War-era fortress an hour's drive from Kansas 
               City. Truman pulls up to the GUARDHOUSE.

               INT. KSP, WAITING ROOM/WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY

               Truman waits alone, looking at the lone decoration: a campaign 
               poster, showing a fat man in a suit grinning while holding a 
               shotgun. Across the bottom it reads: WALK TALL WITH KRUTCH. 
               A YOUNG PRISON GUARD sticks his head out of the office door.

                                     YOUNG PRISON GUARD
                         Warden Krutch will see you now.

               INT. KSP, WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY

               Wood-paneled walls, government-issue desk. On the wall behind 
               the desk is a CHART -- a racial accounting of the current 
               inmate population. It reads: WHITE - 1405, COLORED - 360, 
               MEXICANS - 12, INDIANS - 6.

               WARDEN MARSHALL KRUTCH is fat, coarse, sweaty even in winter. 
               And it's spring. He's running for Congress -- there are 
               "KRUTCH FOR CONGRESS" bumper stickers laying around the 
               office. He's enjoying a chance at a little publicity. The 
               YOUNG PRISON GUARD stands quietly by the wall.

                                     KRUTCH
                         We do well by our boys. Showers once 
                         a week. Feed em good. We'll be feeding 
                         Perry Smith in the infirmary soon if 
                         he don't eat. Get the food in through 
                         his arm.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What are you talking about?

                                     KRUTCH
                         Hasn't eaten in a month. But it's 
                         not his right to kill himself. It's 
                         the People's right. The People of 
                         this State. And that's who I work 
                         for, the People. You can write any 
                         of this down.

                                     TRUMAN
                         No one told me.

                                     KRUTCH
                         Yah. Won't eat.

                                     TRUMAN
                         When can I see him?

                                     KRUTCH
                              (checking desk calendar)
                         How about you come back Thursday?

                                     TRUMAN
                         No. That's no good. I need to see 
                         them now, then whenever I want for 
                         as long as I want.

                                     KRUTCH
                         Not how we do things here.

               Pause.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I see.

               Truman glances at the campaign stickers, the young prison 
               guard, then back at Krutch.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I understand what a burden unlimited 
                         visitation might be -- on this 
                         institution, and on the People who 
                         pay for it. I want to be clear that 
                         I don't expect the citizens of 
                         Leavenworth County to have to shoulder 
                         that burden.

               Truman reaches into his jacket, pulls from it an ENVELOPE 
               STUFFED with CASH. He lays it on the desk.

                                     TRUMAN
                         To be dispensed as you see fit.

               Krutch is stone-faced as he regards the money. Finally:

                                     KRUTCH
                         I didn't know where to count your 
                         boy -- being half-Indian. I did him 
                         a favor though.
                              (points to race chart)
                         Counted him White.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You're a kind and generous man.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY

               The second floor of a small building in the corner of the 
               prison complex. Decrepit. The one hall is lit by mesh-covered 
               BARE BULBS in the ceiling. Twelve cells -- six on each side. 
               Each is 7 by 10 feet, with one small, high WINDOW covered by 
               bars and wire. The YOUNG PRISON GUARD opens the heavy GATE 
               at the end of the hall and shows Truman in.

               They walk down the row of cells. In one of them we notice 
               Lowell Lee Andrews (20, white, spectacled, ENORMOUSLY FAT) 
               peering at his own face 4 inches from a mirror.

               Dick is leaning against the bars of his own cell. He smiles.

                                     HICKOCK
                         My hero.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Thanks for your help with the lawyer.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That's fine.

                                     HICKOCK
                         You must be desperate for a story to 
                         come all the way out here.

                                     YOUNG PRISON GUARD
                         Mr. Capote. You're entitled to go 
                         in. You may, um, go in. If you wish.

               Truman hesitates for a second.

                                     HICKOCK
                         You want to see Perry. Go ahead.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Thank you.

               Truman walks to the next cell.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Ask me, he's just trying to prove 
                         the insanity defense.

               Truman sees Perry, gaunt, lying on his cot, almost comatose. 
               Perry's rather striking drawing of a LARGE YELLOW PARROT 
               sits propped on his table. An UNEATEN LUNCH TRAY lies on the 
               floor -- a cockroach runs over it. Truman watches, disturbed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

               Camera follows Truman as he walks down an aisle with a small 
               WICKER BASKET. He stops, looks at a shelf.

               INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

               Truman waits in the check-out line behind a MOM paying for 
               her groceries. Her SON (3) stands next to her legs, wearing 
               a little cowboy hat and cradling a TOY GUN to his chest. He 
               sucks his thumb. Truman and the boy look at each other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY

               Truman sits on the chair, his WICKER BASKET on the table. He 
               has spread out a cloth napkin. A GUARD watches from outside 
               the cell. Perry lies completely still on the cot. Truman 
               takes out jars of BONNET BABY FOOD, inspects the labels.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to Perry)
                         I don't care what your plans are for 
                         yourself...

               He decides on the CUSTARD jar. He opens it, takes a plastic 
               BABY SPOON from the basket.

                                     TRUMAN
                         But you're gonna wake up enough to 
                         tell me what you did with my tie.

               He spoons a bit into Perry's mouth. The GUARD walks away. 
               Truman leans close to Perry, whispers:

                                     TRUMAN
                         It's okay. It's Truman. It's your 
                         friend.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON)

               Perry sleeps. Truman stands against the wall watching him. 
               He has cleaned up the basket of food. He walks over to Perry's 
               desk, sees two handwritten notebooks on it: THE PRIVATE DIARY 
               OF PERRY EDWARD SMITH and PERSONAL DICTIONARY. Next to them, 
               he sees a pencil SELF-PORTRAIT Perry drew. It's very good. 
               Truman touches it.

               INT. KSP DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (EVENING)

               Perry sleeps. Truman sits on the chair watching, waiting. 
               Perry opens his eyes, looks at Truman.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (NIGHT)

               Perry is sitting up a bit, Truman helps him sip a cup of 
               water. Perry lies back down. He's looking at Truman.

                                     TRUMAN
                         How'd you learn to draw like that?

               Perry closes his eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR, DRIVING - AFTERNOON (NEXT DAY)

               Truman drives through the KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY gate, 
               waves to the Guard.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - EVENING

               Perry sits on the bed, cleaned up, wet hair neatly combed, 
               looking at a few OLD SNAPSHOTS he has saved in a handkerchief. 
               Truman sits in the chair across from him. Perry hands him a 
               photo of his mother. Perry speaks quietly.

                                     PERRY

                         That's your sister?

               Perry nods. Truman waits for more. It doesn't come.

                                     TRUMAN
                         We're not so different as you might 
                         think. I was abandoned repeatedly as 
                         a child. My mama'd drag me along to 
                         some new town so she could take up 
                         with another man she'd met. Night 
                         after night she'd lock me in the 
                         hotel room -- Mama'd turn the latch 
                         and tell the staff not to let me out 
                         no matter what. I was terrified -- 
                         I'd scream my head off -- till finally 
                         I'd collapse on the carpet next to 
                         the door and fall asleep. After years 
                         of this she just left me with 
                         relatives in Alabama.

                              (Perry nods)
                         That's when I met Nelle -- she lived 
                         next door.
                              (looks again at the 
                              photo, hands it back)

                         Drinking was not a good thing for 
                         her.

                                     PERRY
                         No tolerance for it.

                         No tolerance for him either.

               Truman's laughs, surprised by the joke, though it's unclear 
               whether Perry meant it as one. He stares at Perry.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What I can't decide is if you 
                         understand how fascinating you are.

               Perry doesn't respond, then --

                                     PERRY
                         I'm sorry about your tie. They took 
                         it away from me because we're all on 
                         suicide watch. It's why the lights 
                         stay on at night.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I hope we're past that now. You had 
                         me worried.

                                     PERRY
                         Okay.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't care about the tie. It's 
                         just a pity because it looked so 
                         good on you.

               Perry leans in, motions toward Dick's cell, lowers his voice --

                                     PERRY
                         Be careful of Ricardo. I think he 
                         wants you all to himself.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Alright --

                                     PERRY
                         But he's naturally mendacious -- not 
                         to be trusted -- if he had a hundred 
                         dollars he'd steal a stick of chewing 
                         gum.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You wouldn't.

               Perry shakes his head. Then, Truman nods toward Perry's 
               notebooks.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I want to take your notebooks with 
                         me -- I want to read them.

               Perry hesitates.

                                     TRUMAN
                         If I leave here without understanding 
                         you, the world will always see you 
                         as a monster. I don't want that -- I 
                         don't see you that way.

               A moment, then Perry reaches for the NOTEBOOKS, hands them 
               to Truman. Then he hands Truman the DRAWING he did of himself.

                                     PERRY
                         I tracked my father down in Alaska. 
                         I was 14. One day I said to him, 
                         "Mom's dead." I could see it. A week 
                         later we got the news. She finally 
                         drunk herself to death.

               Truman regards Perry. Then he looks at the drawing --

                                     TRUMAN
                         This is remarkable.

                                     PERRY
                         Sometimes you see a thing -- how it 
                         really is.

               On Truman holding the drawing, looking at Perry.

               EXT. KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Truman walks quickly to his car, holding Perry's DRAWING and 
               NOTEBOOKS. At the car, he looks back at the dark jailhouse.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - LATE NIGHT

               Truman at the desk, PERRY'S TWO BOOKS next to a LEGAL PAD 
               already filled with notes. He's on the PHONE with Nelle, 
               paging through the PERSONAL DICTIONARY captivated by it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         He trusts me -- that's why he gave 
                         it to me. He's given me absolutely 
                         everything.
                              (paging through Diary)
                         You should see his drawings, Nelle, 
                         how good he is. He wants so badly to 
                         be taken seriously, to be held in 
                         some esteem.

                         ever before have so many people been 
                         so directly responsible for my being 
                         so very, very glad. It's a wonderful 
                         moment and a rare one. Thank you!"
                              (beat)
                         There's an exclamation point on the

               EXT. KANSAS CITYSCAPE - VARIOUS (TWO WEEKS ELAPSE)

               INT. DINER, DOWNTOWN KANSAS CITY - MORNING

               Truman is eating breakfast with Alvin Dewey. A WAITRESS 
               refills their coffees.

                                     DEWEY
                              (to waitress)
                         Thanks.

               She leaves. An uncomfortable silence. Then:

                                     DEWEY
                         You're nothing if not hard-working.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You look good, healthy again.

                                     DEWEY
                         Not a chance.

               Dewey taps a cigarette out of his pack.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I've decided on a title for my book. 
                         I think you'll like it -- very 
                         masculine. "In Cold Blood."

                                     DEWEY
                              (lights the cigarette)
                         That refers to the crime or the fact 
                         that you're still talking to the 
                         criminals?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The former, among other things.

                                     DEWEY
                         I see.

               They eat for a moment. Then:

                                     TRUMAN
                         I've been wanting to ask if you'll 
                         let me look at your investigation 
                         notes.

                                     DEWEY
                         That lawyer you helped find for your 
                         friends got them a hearing at the 
                         Kansas Supreme Court --

                                     TRUMAN
                         I heard this morning.

                                     DEWEY
                         -- on the issue of inadequate counsel.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Alvin. Do you not want me to look at 
                         your notes? You are permitted to say 
                         no.

                                     DEWEY
                              (rises, takes out 
                              wallet)
                         I'll tell you what: if those boys 
                         get off, I'm coming to Brooklyn to 
                         hunt you down.

               Truman can't decide whether Dewey is kidding or not. Dewey 
               puts money on the table.

                                     DEWEY
                         I have to be in court at nine o'clock.

               He walks away. Over his shoulder:

                                     DEWEY
                         Call Roy Church. He'll show you what 
                         you want to see.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY

               Truman walks down the hall. He passes Dick's cell. Dick is 
               lying in bed. Dick rises and smiles widely at Truman.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Hey, hey...

               Truman smiles, puts HIS FINGERS TO HIS LIPS, continues past. 
               He stops outside Perry's cell. Perry (looking MUCH HEALTHIER) 
               is drawing at his table -- a picture of the HUGE YELLOW PARROT 
               swooping down from the sky. Truman watches for a few moments, 
               then Perry looks at him.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - MOMENTS LATER

               The Guard locks Truman inside with Perry.

                                     PERRY
                         Thank you.

               Truman looks at the Guard -- he leaves.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It was as much for me as for anyone. 
                         I couldn't bear the thought of losing 
                         you so soon.

                                     PERRY
                         We're going to be able to use your 
                         book for our case. You'll write we 
                         never got to raise our insanity plea. 
                         You wrote how terrible the lawyer 
                         was?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I haven't written a word yet.

               Beat.

                                     PERRY
                         What have you been doing?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Research. Waiting to talk to you.

                                     PERRY
                         All right.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I had hoped --

                                     PERRY
                         What are you calling it?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The book?
                              (looks directly at 
                              him)
                         I have no idea.

               Pause.

                                     TRUMAN
                         If I'm going to write about you -- 
                         if I'm going to determine how to 
                         write about you -- you need to tell 
                         me about that night at the Clutter 
                         house.

               Perry just looks at him.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Perry.

               Perry shakes his head.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Why? Do you worry what I'll think?

               Perry looks away. A long moment.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Is that it?

               Silence. Then:

                                     PERRY
                         Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I know a lot of people.

               Truman gives up for now. Sees the PICTURE OF THE YELLOW BIRD 
               on the desk.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What is that you keep drawing?

                                     PERRY
                         You must hate having to come to this 
                         place --

                                     TRUMAN
                         Perry, I have invitations to be in 
                         Morocco, Greece... I choose to be 
                         here. Those people have everything, 
                         all their prayers have been answered, 
                         yet they're more desperate than ever. 
                         I prefer to be here with you.

                                     PERRY
                              (looks at Truman; 
                              evenly)
                         I was ten, I wet the bed, the nuns 
                         at the orphanage hated the smell. 
                         First month one of them found me 
                         shivering -- just trying to get 
                         through the night. The Sister pulled 
                         back the covers and shined her 
                         flashlight to see what I'd did. The 
                         sheets were wet. She hit me so many 
                         times with that flashlight she broke 
                         it.
                              (he shrugs)
                         That night I dreamed about the yellow 
                         bird. Tall. Yellow like the sun. It 
                         picked me up and it clawed the Nun's 
                         eyes and it lifted me into the sky.

               They look at each other.

               EXT. BAR, DOWNTOWN K.C. - NIGHT

               Truman on the street outside the club at a PAY PHONE. He 
               talks with Jack in Brooklyn.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm just missing this one piece, 
                         Jack. Be patient with me.

                                     JACK
                         How long is that gonna take? Why 
                         don't you try leaving him alone for 
                         a while? Come to Spain. You can always 
                         visit him later.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't know.

                                     JACK
                         Well, I'm off. I've got my own writing 
                         to do.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.

                                     JACK
                         Too many people around.
                              (beat)
                         I'll leave the address on the kitchen 
                         table. Truman, what do you do there 
                         when you're not with him? -- It must 
                         be awful.

               Truman's watching a YOUNG GUY standing outside the bar, 
               looking at him.

                                     JACK
                         Think about what I said. Join me 
                         when you can.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I will. I will. Bye.

               Truman follows the YOUNG GUY into the bar.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - LATE NIGHT

               Truman sleeps. He OPENS HIS EYES in bed. Turns to the bedside 
               table to see the drawing of Perry looking at him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KANSAS CITY - DAWN

               A young drifter stands alone on an empty street corner. He 
               checks a pay phone for a coin. It's empty.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY

               Perry is lying on his cot reading an ADVENTURE MAGAZINE -- 
               something to do with finding buried treasure off the coast 
               of Mexico -- and sucking on the tip of his thumb. After a 
               moment he STARTLES and looks up.

               Truman stands outside his cell. He holds a stack of books: 
               Perry's PERSONAL DICTIONARY and DIARY, and a new WEBSTER'S 
               DICTIONARY and THESAURUS.

                                     PERRY
                         I didn't see you. Jesus, you...
                              (stands, tucks in 
                              shirt)
                         Come in. Where's the guard?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I can't. I brought you some things, 
                         but I have to fly back East.

                                     PERRY
                         When?

                                     TRUMAN
                         An hour. I'm sorry.

                                     PERRY
                         You can't.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm sorry.

                                     PERRY
                         Who are you going there to see --

                                     HICKOCK (O.S.)
                              (from next cell)
                         Capote, get it straight in your book -- 
                         we never intended on killing that 
                         family --

                                     PERRY
                         I told him that.

                                     HICKOCK (O.S.)
                         No premeditation --

                                     PERRY
                         I told him!

               Perry searches the cell for something else to give to Truman 
               to keep him there. Then, he stops. He has nothing left to 
               give, and is unwilling to talk about that night at the 
               Clutters. He becomes very still. Truman speaks gently --

                                     TRUMAN
                         Your writings are magnificent. I 
                         hope these help you do more.

               No response. Truman places the books on the floor just outside 
               Perry's cell -- Perry's writings in one stack and the new 
               dictionaries in another right next to it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I have so much material -- from the 
                         trial, from our visits, your journals. 
                         I have to organize it all, and I 
                         have to start the process of writing.
                              (no response)
                         I'll visit soon. Perhaps this fall.
                              (backing away)
                         I miss you already. Write me every 
                         five minutes.

               He turns and goes. We stay with Perry as Truman leaves. We 
               hear Dick speak to Truman.

                                     HICKOCK (O.S.)
                         Be good now.

               Hear Truman's footsteps receding. Then, a long shot of the 
               hallway as the Guard lets Truman out the gate at the end of 
               the row. Silence.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL

               Perry looks down at the books sitting on the floor outside 
               his cell. He crouches, puts his hand through the bars and 
               touches the cover of the new dictionary. He's alone.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               Over black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then 
               passing.

               EXT. BEACH - DAY

               FADE IN: BRIGHT WHITE SKY. Sounds of seagulls. Ocean, sand, 
               cottage houses in greenery set back from the beach.

               EXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - DAY

               The house Jack rented. Jack types on the upstairs deck. Truman 
               pulls up in an OLD TAXI. Jack looks out over the railing to 
               the street. Jack emerges on the FRONT PORCH as Truman walks 
               up the path with his bags. They look at each other. Then 
               Truman looks around at the incredible garden, the ocean in 
               the background, and starts to LAUGH.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               Title up:              "January, 1962"

               Sound of a MANUAL TYPEWRITER over black.

               EXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               FADE IN on the peaceful outside of the house. Sound of TYPING.

               INT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               More typing. A PHONE rings. CAMERA tracks slowly through the 
               pretty, tiled living room, toward a DOOR at the far end.

               INT. BEDROOM, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               Truman at his DESK, surrounded by piles of filled YELLOW 
               PADS, NOTE CARDS, an open TRUNK of random notes. He is at 
               the MANUAL TYPEWRITER. The phone is on the floor, ringing. 
               He types. The phone rings. Exasperated, he picks up.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What.

                         Truman. I was supposed to be home 
                         for dinner with my wife three hours 
                         ago -- I have not been able to tear 
                         myself away from your book. It's 
                         that good. It's not good, it's 
                         astonishing. This first half is 
                         astonishing. If the second half lives 
                         up to this it, -- it -- how much is 
                         left to do?

                         I'm already well into the third part, 
                         but I -- I can't finish that till I 
                         convince Perry to describe the night 
                         of the killings to me. I was planning 
                         to visit this fall, see --

                         I think you need to talk to him now.

                         And we all need to see how this ends 
                         for the final part. I can't finish 
                         the book till I know what happens. 
                         If Perry and Dick are executed it's 
                         one thing -- and if not, well --

                         The Kansas court denied their appeal. 
                         It came over the wire on Friday. You 
                         need to talk to Perry now. He'll be 
                         dead by September. I'm sorry, I know 
                         how much you've come to care about 
                         him.

               Truman is completely immobile.

                         I want to set up a reading for you 
                         in the fall, in New York. We'll build 
                         some interest, and we'll publish in 
                         the fall.

               On Truman.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - MORNING

               Truman at the stove watching his tea water heat up. Jack 
               enters with a HUGE BASKET of WINE and GROCERIES.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Plums. Thank god. We have nothing in 
                         the house.

               He takes one from the basket. Jack starts to unpack food.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Why aren't you working?

                                     JACK
                         I knew you couldn't be depended on 
                         to stock the kitchen.

               Truman looks at him blankly.

                                     JACK
                         What would we feed our famous guest?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Oh, Jesus. I completely forgot.

               He helps Jack put away the groceries. Then:

                                     JACK
                              (utterly nonchalant)
                         Plus -- I finished my novel yesterday.

               Truman looks at Jack, smiles widely.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

               Truman, Jack and Nelle. A BONFIRE, a wind-up Victrola playing 
               Ella Fitzgerald, bottles of wine. Jack and Nelle dance. Truman 
               toasts Jack drunkenly.

                                     TRUMAN
                         My man, my hero, my talented... My 
                         man...

                                     JACK
                         You said that.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You are the hardest worker, the most 
                         unsung talent I know. As Nelle passes 
                         by on her way to London to sell her 
                         book which needs no selling, may a 
                         little of her success rub off on 
                         both of us.

               Jack laughs.

                                     JACK
                         Here, here!

               Nelle tries to smack Truman but can't catch him. The song 
               changes to a slow one. Jack and Truman dance sweetly together. 
               Nelle sits on the sand and watches.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. UPSTAIRS DECK, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - MORNING

               Breakfast. Truman and Nelle are sitting -- Nelle has a small 
               envelope in her hand. Truman is obviously uncomfortable. As 
               Jack delivers a platter of omelettes to the table:

                                     NELLE
                              (to Truman)
                         When was the last time you wrote 
                         back to him?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't know.

                                     JACK
                         What's this?

                                     NELLE
                         A letter for your boyfriend I was 
                         asked to deliver.

                                     TRUMAN
                         From Perry.

                                     JACK
                         Let's have it.

               Jack sits. Nelle opens the letter, reads:

                                     NELLE
                         "Dear Friend Truman. Where are you? 
                         Read this item in a medical 
                         dictionary: "Death by hanging is 
                         caused by asphyxia, by fracture of 
                         the cervical vertebrae, by laceration 
                         of the trachea." Not too comforting 
                         as we lost our appeal. Missing you -- 
                         alone and desirous of your presence. 
                         Your amigo, Perry."

               Pause.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Mr. Shawn told me about the court 
                         decision yesterday.

                                     JACK
                         I was wondering why you were in such 
                         a good mood. Surely, I thought, it's 
                         not because I finished my little 
                         book.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That's a terrible thing to say.

               Jack looks out at the ocean.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to no one in 
                              particular)
                         I used to write him all the time. 
                         I've been so focused lately on the 
                         book.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Truman and Nelle carry her bags down the front walk toward a 
               waiting TAXI.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Jack says I'm using Perry, but he 
                         also thinks I fell in love with him 
                         when I was in Kansas. How both of 
                         those things can be true is beyond 
                         me.

                                     NELLE
                         Did you? Fall in love with him.

               Silence as they load the bags into the trunk.

                         I don't know how to answer that... 
                         It's as if Perry and I started life 
                         in the same house. One day he stood 
                         up and walked out the back door while 
                         I walked out the front. With some 
                         different choices, he's the man I 
                         might have become.

                         Are you kidding me?

               Truman shrugs, doesn't answer. Nelle kisses him.

                         Be nice to Jack. Sometimes I think 
                         he's what I like about you best.

               Nelle gets in the taxi, then leans her head out the window.

                         Truman. Honestly. Are you going back 
                         to Kansas because you care about 
                         Perry or because you need information 
                         before he's killed?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Can't it be both?

                                     NELLE
                         No. I don't think it can be.

               She drives away. Truman watches her go. He turns back up 
               toward the house, stops a moment to pick a FLOWER from the 
               bushes at the front gate.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY

               A Guard walks down the corridor carrying a SINGLE FLOWER. He 
               delivers it to Perry, then walks off. Perry is confused. He 
               hears FOOTSTEPS approaching, but can't see who it is.

                                     HICKOCK (O.S.)
                         Hey, buddy. Thanks.

               More footsteps. CAMERA on Perry as the footsteps finally 
               arrive outside his cell. He's shocked.

               REVERSE onto Truman, looking tanned, healthy, very blond. He 
               holds a STACK OF BOOKS with a BOW on top. He smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - LATER THAT NIGHT

               LONG SHOT of dimly lit corridor, light spilling out from 
               each cell. A ROW GUARD walks the hall. We hear voices 
               murmuring.

               SIX MORE GUARDS arrive at the top of the stairs. The ROW 
               GUARD walks over, unlocks the GATE to let them in.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - NIGHT

               Perry is looking at the cover of a BOOK -- "WALDEN POND." 
               Other books sit next to Perry on the cot. Among them -- WILLA 
               CATHER's "MY ANTONIA", also "GREAT EXPECTATIONS" --

                                     PERRY
                         What was he in jail for?

                                     TRUMAN
                         They said it was not paying his taxes. 
                         But really for being an outsider -- 
                         refusing to go along.

               Perry nods, looks at the other books.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You don't have to read any of these 
                         if you don't want to. But I thought 
                         you'd like something decent. You're 
                         much too smart for adventure 
                         magazines.

               Through the bars of Perry's cell, we can see the SIX GUARDS 
               enter Lowell Lee Andrew's cell (diagonally across the 
               corridor). The ROW GUARD appears at Perry's cell.

                                     ROW GUARD
                         Lock-down while Lowell goes to 
                         solitary. Nobody in or out.
                              (to Truman)
                         You want in or out?

               Truman looks at Perry, then back to the Guard.

                         In.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, LOWELL LEE ANDREW'S CELL - MOMENTS 
               LATER

               The SIX GUARDS start to pack up Andrews cell while he sits 
               on the cot and watches.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER

               Perry and Truman talk very QUIETLY. (Throughout this scene, 
               we see in the background, across the corridor, the mostly 
               obscured cell of Andrews. We see his incredibly FAT LEG being 
               shackled, his belongings being packed in boxes.)

                                     PERRY
                         Everyone says he's a genius. I don't 
                         think he's a genius. He's rich and 
                         he went to college -- like any of us 
                         would've if we got the chance. He 
                         came home for Christmas and shot his 
                         parents --

                         I won't be sorry to see him go. Always 
                         correcting my grammar.

               They watch Andrews being shackled in the background.

                         line.

               Truman regards Perry, who looks down.

                         I'm so sorry I've been away.

                         when they take him out to the Corner, 
                         but the whole prison shuts down.

                         I have to be in New York anyway.

               Perry nods.

                                     PERRY
                         How's the book going?

               One of the six guards CLANGS Andrews' cell bars with his 
               stick.

                         Ready.

               The ROW GUARD opens the cell door. Andrews is led out, arms 
               and legs shackled, into the corridor.

                         under your fat fucking chin.

               Andrews is led past Perry's cell. He looks in at Perry.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Next!

               Andrews shuffles down the hall. Perry watches him go. On 
               Truman watching Perry. We hear the GATE slam shut.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Packed. Nelle stands with William Shawn, who receives well-
               wishers. BEN BARON enters, seeing Nelle.

                                     BEN BARON
                              (loudly, over the 
                              hubbub)
                         Hello Hollywood. That's quite a bundle 
                         you sold your book for.

               Nelle is embarrassed, mostly for Baron, to have the issue of 
               money brought up publicly.

                                     NELLE
                         Well...

               Baron moves past, Nelle smiles politely, whispers to Shawn.

                                     NELLE
                         What a gentleman.

               INT. THEATER, BACKSTAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

               Truman sits alone. In the background, we can HEAR the noise 
               of the huge crowd gathering in the theater. Truman wears his 
               MOST STYLISH LITERARY OUTFIT: a gorgeous dark green Knize 
               SUIT over a black cashmere turtleneck sweater, and horn-rimmed 
               GLASSES (which we've never seen him wear before).

               He's frozen with anticipation, nervousness. After several 
               moments a THEATER ASSISTANT opens the door.

                                     YOUNG ASSISTANT
                         Mr. Capote. Can I get you anything?

                                     TRUMAN
                         No.
                              (clears his throat)
                         Thank you.

               The assistant leaves. We hear the crowd quiet down. Truman 
               rises slowly, walks through the door to the backstage area. 
               We hear William Shawn on stage.

                                     SHAWN (O.S.)
                         Welcome New Yorkers...

               INT. WINGS/STAGE - NIGHT

               Shawn pauses briefly for a laugh that doesn't come. Truman 
               continues walking toward the backstage curtains.

                                     SHAWN (O.S.)
                         Thank you for coming to the first 
                         public reading, the first offering 
                         of any kind, of Truman Capote's new 
                         work "In Cold Blood." Our magazine --

               Truman walks on stage. Loud applause. Shawn sees him, slinks 
               back to his seat. Truman walks over to the podium, takes in 
               the enormous crowd. Once it is completely quiet:

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello. My name is Truman Capote.

               People laugh and applaud loudly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - SAME TIME, NIGHT

               Perry, eating dinner alone at his table, looks up. We HEAR a 
               LOUD ENGINE revving outside.

               EXT. KSP, THE CORNER WAREHOUSE - SAME TIME

               A FRONT-LOADER TRACTOR drives into the warehouse. A PRISON 
               POLICE CAR parks outside the warehouse. Guards get the 
               enormous Lowell Lee Andrews, shackled, from the back seat, 
               walk him inside.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - NIGHT

               C/U on Perry, now standing on his chair and watching out the 
               tiny window.

                         Perry Smith's voice was both gentle 
                         and prim -- a voice that, though 
                         soft, manufactured each sound exactly -- 
                         ejected it like a smoke ring issuing 
                         from a parson's mouth.

               Perry watches through his window. From inside the warehouse 
               we hear the gallows TRAP DOOR spring and CLATTER. On Perry,

                         The village of Holcomb stands on the 
                         high wheat plains of western Kansas, 
                         a lonesome area that other Kansans 
                         call "out there." Until one morning 
                         in mid-November 1959, few Americans -- 
                         in fact, few Kansans -- had ever 
                         heard of Holcomb. Like the waters of 
                         the [Arkansas] river, like the 
                         motorists on the highway... 
                         exceptional happenings had never 
                         stopped there.

               We see the outside wall with Perry and Dick's faces peering 
               out through their tiny windows.

               EXT. KSP, THE CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The TRACTOR emerges through the warehouse doors. It carries 
               in its FRONT SHOVEL the enormous, dead BODY of ANDREWS covered 
               by a BLACK CLOTH.

                         The four coffins, which quite filled 
                         the small, flower-crowded parlor, 
                         were to be sealed at the funeral 
                         services -- very understandably, for 
                         the effect... was disquieting. Nancy 
                         wore her dress of cherry-red velvet, 
                         her brother a bright plaid shirt; 
                         the parents were more sedately 
                         attired, Mr. Clutter in navy-blue 
                         flannel, his wife in navy-blue crepe; 
                         and -- and it was this especially 
                         that lent the scene an awful aura -- 
                         the head of each was completely 
                         encased in cotton, a swollen cocoon 
                         twice the size of an ordinary blown-
                         up balloon, and the cotton, because 
                         it had been sprayed with a glossy 
                         substance, twinkled like Christmas-
                         tree snow.

                         dawn, a carload of... strangers, 
                         ignorant of the local disaster -- 
                         were startled by what they saw as 
                         they crossed the prairies and passed 
                         through Holcomb: windows ablaze, 
                         almost every window in almost every 
                         house, and, in the brightly lit rooms, 
                         fully clothed people, even entire 
                         families, who had sat the whole night 
                         wide awake, watchful, listening. Of 
                         what were they frightened? "It might 
                         happen again."

               He closes his manuscript. Several moments of SILENCE, then 
               thunderous APPLAUSE.

               Truman's dressing room. Packed with well-wishers drinking 
               from bottles of CHAMPAGNE, smoking, toasting, shouting to be 
               heard. Truman in the corner with Christopher Isherwood, BEN 
               BARON others, laughing. A LITERARY ENTHUSIAST approaches,

                         Your portrait of those men was 
                         terrifying. Terrifying.

                         Thank you.

               Truman and Isherwood watch him walk away.

                         Your hairpiece is terrifying.

                         I was going to say the same thing!

               Truman laughs loudly. We SEE Nelle look over from across the 
               room at her friend having the time of his life.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         everything. It'll change how people 
                         see you as a writer. It'll change 
                         how people write. You'll finish by 
                         October?

                         I think so. You know they're scheduled 
                         for next month?

                         I'm flying to Kansas tomorrow. I'll 
                         get Perry to talk --

                         Honestly, what's he got to lose?

               Truman smiles at the joke, then stops himself.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It really is too awful. 
                         Institutionalized sadism.

                         As strange as it may sound to you, 
                         I'm going to miss him.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               Over black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then 
               passing.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY

               Truman, flushed, out of breath, stands outside Perry's cell. 
               He's just arrived. He holds a FOLDED-UP NEWSPAPER. Perry 
               sits at his table reading LEGAL DOCUMENTS.

                                     TRUMAN
                         When did you hear?

               Perry looks up, mistaking Truman's state for shared 
               enthusiasm. He smiles widely.

                                     PERRY
                         Two days ago.

               The Guard opens the cell for Truman. Perry holds up one of 
               the DOCUMENTS.

                                     PERRY
                         It's what we've been waiting for. A 
                         stay of execution to make a federal 
                         appeal.

               Truman enters. Perry goes to him and hugs him tightly.

                                     PERRY
                         All thanks to you.

               On Truman, shocked, being hugged.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER

               Truman sits on the bed, his coat still on, watching Perry -- 
               hyped up, talking, walking around the cell.

                                     PERRY
                         Kansas's had it in for me for ten 
                         years -- in prison the first time, 
                         at that trial, here. They can't corner 
                         me now. Not till the U.S. Government 
                         says so --

                         Perry, sit down. For a minute.
                              (Perry sits)
                         I need you to talk to me...

                                     PERRY
                         We've got all the time in the world 
                         to talk. About everything. I've been 
                         thinking about Ricardo. You need to 
                         stop sending him those trashy books. 
                         I won't even mention the pornography.
                              (getting up)
                         I realize he might have trouble 
                         grasping the literature you gave me, 
                         but those books only exacerbate the 
                         problem -- only 'heighten' or 
                         'intensify' it. Maybe we should start 
                         him on a program...

               Perry stops.

                         I know what exacerbate means.

                         There is not a word, or a sentence, 
                         or a concept, that you can illuminate 
                         for me. There is one singular reason 
                         that I keep coming here --

               Pause.

                                     PERRY
                         I've asked you not to --

                         This is ridiculous.
                              (to the Guard)
                         I'm ready.
                              (to Perry)
                         I have a plane to catch. I found 
                         your sister in Tacoma. Maybe she'll 
                         talk to me about something useful.

                         Don't go out there.

               The Guard lets Truman out of the cell.

                                     PERRY
                         Please don't go out there.

               The Guard shuts the door.

                                     TRUMAN
                         This is my work, Perry. I'm working. 
                         When you want to tell me what I need 
                         to hear, you let me know.

               He walks off down the hall. The GATE slams shut.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PERRY'S SISTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

               Cheaply built ranch house. LINDA MURCHAK (30) walks in the 
               kitchen back door, shuts it.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         They'll play outside a while longer.

               Mrs. Murchak looks like a female Perry, dark and small, 
               attractive and nervous. Through the window, we see THREE 
               LITTLE CHILDREN playing on a DECREPIT JUNGLE GYM in the yard. 
               Truman sits at the table, leafing through a PHOTO ALBUM.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         I don't want them to see that.

                                     TRUMAN
                         They've never seen these pictures?

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                              (shakes her head)
                         Too many questions.

               She joins Truman again at the table.

               We see an OLD PHOTO of the SMITH FAMILY -- Linda at age 8, 
               Perry (5); their older sister, June; their brother Frank; 
               and the parents: Florence (American Indian) and John (Irish) -- 
               in front of their rundown truck on a desolate road.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         June's dead. Frank shot himself. Now 
                         Perry's did what he did. I suppose 
                         I'm next. Some ruination will visit 
                         me.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't think life works that way.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         It does in this family.

               Truman turns the page. A PICTURE of Perry (3) and Linda 
               HOLDING HANDS and splashing in a big mud-puddle in the rain. 
               Linda is smiling at Perry, who is naked, laughing.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         I used to love him. He was my little 
                         doll.

               He turns the page. A PICTURE of Perry (6) and Linda sitting 
               on the back steps of a shack, poking with a stick at something 
               in the dirt. After a moment, she gets up, clears coffee cups.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         He scares me now.

                                     TRUMAN
                         When was the last time you saw him?

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         Ten years.

               She picks up the album to put it away.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Do you think I could borrow one of 
                         those pictures?

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                              (hands it to him)
                         Take the whole thing. I don't want'em 
                         anymore.
                              (then)
                         Just... Perry doesn't know where I 
                         live. He thinks we're still in 
                         Portland. Please don't tell him we're 
                         not.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (he already has)
                         Alright.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         Don't be taken in by my brother. 
                         He's got this sensitive side he'll 
                         show. You believe he's gentle, so 
                         easily hurt. But he'd just as soon 
                         kill you as shake your hand. I believe 
                         that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - NEXT DAY

               Truman slows for a moment as he passes Hickock's cell.

                         Hello handsome.

               Hickock just stares at him. Truman, unnerved, moves on to 
               Perry's cell.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

               Perry doing pushups. He sees Truman and stops. He stands. 
               The Row Guard approaches.

                                     ROW GUARD
                         You want to go in?

               Truman regards Perry for a few moments, then:

                         Yes

               The Guard unlocks the door. Perry STARTS TO MOVE toward it. 
               The Guard SLAMS it shut.

                         What's the name of your book?

               No response. Perry can barely control his anger.

               Perry picks up a cut-out ARTICLE from the NY Times from his 
               desk. He reads.

               Perry doesn't answer.

                         Who sent that to you?

                         It is my business, because it's not 
                         true. The organizers of the reading 
                         needed a title. They picked one -- a 
                         sensational one, I admit -- to attract 
                         a crowd.

                                     PERRY
                         They picked it.

                         Yes.

                                     PERRY
                         That's not your title.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I haven't chosen one yet.

               Perry stares at him, not believing.

                                     TRUMAN
                         How could I choose --

                         You pretend to be my friend...

                                     TRUMAN
                         How could I choose a title when you 
                         still haven't told me what happened 
                         that night? How could I? I couldn't 
                         possibly.

               Long pause. Truman reaches in his breast pocket and extracts 
               a PHOTO (the one of Perry and Linda splashing in the puddle.)

                                     TRUMAN
                         I have something from your sister.

               He hands it through the bars to Perry. Perry takes it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         She misses you.

               Perry looks at the photo. After a few moments, Truman turns 
               to the Guard.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It's alright. I'll go in.

               The Guard unlocks the cell. Truman enters. The Guard locks 
               up, walks away. Perry is still looking at the PHOTO.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm sorry. I should have told you 
                         what they made me call the book.
                              (touches Perry's arm)
                         I couldn't pretend to be your friend. 
                         The truth is, I can't help wanting 
                         to be.
                              (silence, then:)
                         You don't have to tell me anything 
                         if you don't want to.

               Perry looks at the photo of himself and his sister for a 
               long time.

                                     PERRY
                         Look at my belly.

               Perry sits on the bed. Then, almost to himself:

                                     PERRY
                         There must be something wrong with 
                         us. To do what we did.

               Truman waits him out, sitting on the chair. Finally, Perry 
               looks at him. When Perry speaks, it is quietly, completely 
               matter-of-fact.

                                     PERRY
                         We heard there was ten thousand 
                         dollars in that house. Once we'd 
                         tied up everybody and searched all 
                         over, I knew the guy who told us 
                         about it was wrong. There wasn't any 
                         money. But Dick wouldn't believe it. 
                         He went tearing through the house 
                         again, banging on the walls, looking 
                         for a safe. He said when he was done, 
                         he was going to come up to Nancy's 
                         room and have his way with her. I 
                         wouldn't allow it. I told him that. 
                         I sat with Nancy.

               Perry and Nancy. Perry sits quietly on the edge of Nancy's 
               bed. A SMALL BEDSIDE LAMP softly illuminates a portion of 
               the room. We hear Dick banging around downstairs.

                         It was nice in there.

               The scene is almost sweet, until we see that Nancy's legs 
               and hands are TIED and her mouth is TAPED.

                         Dick came to get me and we turned 
                         out the lights and went down to the 
                         basement, where we had Mr. Clutter 
                         and the boy. Dick kept saying "No 
                         witnesses." I figured if I just waited 
                         him out he'd give up and leave them 
                         tied up there. We'd drive all night, 
                         they'd never find us. Mr. Clutter's 
                         wrists were tied to a pipe over his 
                         head. He looked like he was hurt, so 
                         I cut him down.

                         We put a box there on the floor so 
                         he'd be more comfortable. He asked 
                         if his wife and daughter were alright 
                         and I said they were fine, they were 
                         ready to go to sleep. I told him it 
                         wasn't long till morning when somebody 
                         would find them.

                         He was looking at me. Just... looking 
                         at me. Looking at my eyes. Like he 
                         expects me to kill him -- expects me 
                         to be the kind of person who would 
                         kill him. I was thinking -- this 
                         nice man, he's scared of me. I was 
                         ashamed. I mean, I thought he was a 
                         kind man, a good... a gentleman. I 
                         thought so right up to the moment I 
                         cut his throat. I didn't realize 
                         what I'd did till I heard the sound.

               He stirs the custard, eats it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         ...It's harrowing -- all I want is 
                         to write the ending and there's no 
                         fucking end in sight... No. No, I 
                         haven't been drinking again...

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER

               Truman sits on the bed with a glass of bourbon, staring at 
               the television. An empty jar of BABY CUSTARD sits on the 
               bedside table.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER

               Truman on the bed, the television still on, another drink. 
               We hear a DOORBELL. We hear Jack walk down the hall, answer 
               the door, shut the door. Jack enters with a TELEGRAM.

                                     JACK
                         I don't know how you can eat that. 
                         Perhaps if you weren't drinking so 
                         much you wouldn't have to.

               No response. Jack turns down the television, opens the 
               telegram.

                                     JACK
                              (reads)
                         "Dear friend Truman. Haven't heard 
                         from you in such a long while. Please 
                         help find new lawyer. If not, Dick 
                         will have to write Supreme Court 
                         brief himself. Our last appeal. What 
                         a pair of wretched creatures. Please 
                         help. Your amigo? Perry."

               Pause. Jack looks at Truman.

                                     JACK
                         Your amigo.

               Truman stares back. Finally, he turns back to the television.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Put it with the others.

               Jack goes to the DESK and places the telegram on top of a 
               LARGE PILE OF TELEGRAMS, all from Perry -- all, we should 
               assume, unanswered.

               Jack walks out. Truman sips his drink.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER, EARLY EVENING

               Truman at the desk, still in PAJAMAS, typing. Jack enters 
               wearing a TUXEDO, reads over Truman's shoulder. We see:

               "...unable to find laywer despite extensive search. So sorry. 
               All best, Truman."

                                     JACK
                         You tried?

               Truman extracts the page from the typewriter, folds it, and 
               puts it in an envelope. He takes a sip of his BOURBON.

                                     JACK
                              (walking out)
                         You need to get ready.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIMOUSINE, MOVING - NIGHT

               Truman and Jack are driven. Both wear TUXEDOS and OVERCOATS. 
               Truman drinks.

               INT. LIMOUSINE, MOVING - NIGHT, LATER

               Driving. Truman and Jack sit in silence, then:

                                     JACK
                         At least pretend for Nelle that you're 
                         having a good time tonight.

               The limo turns a corner and we see an ENORMOUS CROWD in front 
               of a THEATER. On the marquee it says: "Opening tonight - TO 
               KILL A MOCKINGBIRD"

               It is COLD. Truman and Jack's limo pulls up. An USHER opens 
               their DOOR.

               EXT. MOVIE THEATER - MOMENTS LATER

               Truman, obviously drunk, preens and poses on the red carpet 
               for the CAMERAS. Jack watches from the side.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SARDI'S RESTAURANT, OPENING PARTY - NIGHT

               Huge party in progress. Nelle walks through the crowd. People 
               turn to her saying: "Congratulations"; "Wonderful". She finds 
               Truman sitting at the BAR, receiving a new drink.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Nelle.

               She looks UNCOMFORTABLY DOLLED UP for the premiere of her 
               movie.

                                     NELLE
                         I thought I'd find you here.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to the bartender)
                         Please, another.

               He hands Nelle his drink, receives another. After a moment:

                                     NELLE
                         How are you?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Terrible.

               Beat.

                                     NELLE
                         I'm sorry to hear that.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Well. It's torture. Torture...
                              (he drinks)
                         ...what they're doing to me.

                                     NELLE
                         Uh-huh.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Now the Supreme Court. Can you believe 
                         it? If they win this appeal I will 
                         have a complete nervous breakdown. I 
                         may never recover. Just pray things 
                         turn my way.

                                     NELLE
                         It must be hard.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It's torture. They're torturing me.

                                     NELLE
                         I see.

               Nelle regards him for a moment.

                                     NELLE
                         And how'd you like the movie, Truman.

               She puts her drink down on the bar and walks away. Truman 
               turns back to the bartender, shrugs.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I frankly don't know what the fuss 
                         is about.

               On Truman, alone at the bar.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               EXT. STREET, OUTSIDE TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               FADE UP on a PAPER BOY riding his BIKE down the street. New 
               buds are on the trees. It is SPRING. The BOY wears a NEW 
               YORK TIMES bag slung over his chest and is tossing copies of 
               the paper. One of them lands on Truman and Jack's stoop.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MORNING

               Phone RINGING. Truman asleep.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, JACK'S TINY OFFICE - SAME TIME

               Jack is writing, longhand, at his desk. PHONE is ringing. 
               Jack notices that his door is slightly ajar. He kicks it 
               shut. The ringing is much quieter. He keeps writing.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME TIME

               Truman asleep. PHONE ringing. He wakes up, groggy, answers.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

               Pause.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Oh.
                              (no way out of this)

                         Mr. Smith, you're on the line.

               Now Truman's awake. We hear a series of CLICKS, then:

               Truman can't bring himself to speak.

                              the cradle, then:)

               Truman doesn't know what to say.

               We hear over the line a GUARD in the background:

               Perry and Dick being shackled, their belongings packed into

               with his STICK.

                                     GUARD

               INT. KSP, CONFINEMENT CELL - ONE WEEK LATER, NIGHT

               Perry lies alone on his cot. The DOOR opens, KRUTCH enters 
               with a GUARD.

                         Perry.

               Perry sits up. Krutch sits on the one chair. The Guard stands 
               by the door, takes out a PAD and STUBBY PENCIL.

                                     KRUTCH
                         You're allowed three names of people

               Krutch nods to the Guard who writes the name down. Krutch 
               waits, then:

                                     KRUTCH
                         Anybody else?

               Perry SHAKES HIS HEAD.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

               In a chair near the window, Truman sits awake in his pajamas, 
               unable to sleep, completely unable to decide what to do. He 
               watches Jack sleep. A long time -- then Truman walks to the 
               closet, gets out a travel bag, starts to pack.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Truman sits next to William Shawn, who looks exhausted. The 
               STEWARDESS is approaching with the DRINKS CART. She collects 
               an empty BABY CUSTARD JAR from Truman's tray.

                         You want anything?

               Truman shakes his head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Perry sits alone. The door opens and a Guard brings in his 
               LAST MEAL: three hot dogs, french fries, an ice cream sundae, 
               a strawberry soda. The Guard sets it down on the chair.

                                     PERRY
                         Thank you.
                              (then)
                         You sent the telegram to his hotel?

               Perry looks at the CLOCK on the wall: it's after 8pm.

                                     PERRY
                         May I make a phone call?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PHONE ringing. The CLOCK rads 8:55pm. Empty drinks glasses, 
               a custard jar. Truman lies curled in a fetal position on the 
               BED. Shawn walks the floor, exasperated.

                         That's him again.

               Truman is immobile. Phone still rings.

                         We've never even met. It is utterly 
                         inappropriate for me to be talking 
                         to him.

               Shawn gives up, PICKS UP the phone.

               INT. KSP, CONFINEMENT CELL - NIGHT

               Krutch and Guard enter Perry's cell. Perry hasn't touched 
               his meal.

                                     KRUTCH
                         You got a telex.

               Perry nods. Krutch reads:

                         "Perry. Unable to visit today because

                         It's not true, is it?

               Krutch hesitates a moment, then SHAKES his head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INTERCUT with William Shawn on the phone in Truman's hotel 
               room. A TELEGRAM lies on the DESK. Truman lies on the bed.

                         need to speak to him.

               Shawn, terrifically uncomfortable, walks over to Truman and 
               holds the phone out to him.

               A moment, then Truman takes the phone. On Truman's face. We 
               hear, through the receiver, Nelle:

               Guard checks through the SMALL WINDOW in the door, then 
               approaches Perry, places a STICK OF GUM in Perry's mouth.

               pocket of his jacket. Krutch approaches.

               back, then looks to Truman who seems upset.

               HEADLIGHTS, then a PRISON CAR enters, stops. Dick is extracted 
               from the back seat. He stands, looks at the CROWD, then at 
               the GALLOWS. The Guards nudge him forward.

               INT. KSP, HOLDING CELL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

               CLOCK reads 12:05pm. Perry sits alone looking at his hands. 
               We HEAR A TRAP DOOR SPRING and CLATTER. Perry looks up.

               INT. PRISON CAR - NIGHT

               Light rain outside. Perry in the back seat being driven across 
               the yard. He looks out his window, sees a PICKUP TRUCK drive 
               out of the Corner Warehouse. On it: a BODY covered by a BLACK 
               CLOTH.

               INT. CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The PRISON CAR enters, stops. Perry is removed from the back 
               seat. He stands, looks at the assembled men, looks at Truman. 
               He's nudged forward. As he passes DEWEY, he extends his hand:

                                     PERRY
                         Nice to see you.

               Dewey is caught off-guard so shakes his hand. Perry is led 
               to the base of the gallows.

                                     KRUTCH
                         Perry Edward Smith.
                              (reads)
                         "For the crime of murder in the first 
                         degree, by order of the Court of 
                         Finney County and the Supreme Court 
                         of the sovereign State of Kansas, 
                         you are sentenced to hang until you 
                         die."
                              (then)
                         You can say something if you want.

                                     PERRY
                              (quietly, to Krutch)
                         Is there anybody from the family 
                         here?

                                     KRUTCH
                         No.

               Perry is disappointed by this information.

                                     PERRY
                         Well. Tell them...
                              (he look out at 
                              everyone)
                         I can't remember what I was going to 
                         say for the life of me...

               He stops. Several moments.

               Krutch can't tell if he's done. Finally, Krutch nods to the 
               Guard. Perry is led up the STEPS. The Chaplain follows.

                                     CHAPLAIN
                         Though I walk through the valley of 
                         the shadow of death, I will fear no 
                         evil, for thou art with me.

               The Executioner puts the NOOSE around Perry's neck. Perry 
               chews his gum. Executioner opens a BLACK CLOTH SACK.

               Perry looks at the Chaplain reading prayers, looks at the 
               crowd, at Truman.

                                     CHAPLAIN
                         Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort 
                         me.

               The BLACK SACK goes over Perry's head. Truman watches. He 
               stands next to Alvin Dewey.

                                     CHAPLAIN
                         Thou preparest a table before me in 
                         the presence of mine enemies. Thou 
                         annointest my head with oil.

               The Executioner pulls the handle, Perry drops.

                                     CHAPLAIN
                         My cup runneth over.

               On Truman. Then a WIDE SHOT of the inside of the Warehouse: 
               twenty men watching Perry Smith hang, the Chaplain reading.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               OVER BLACK:

               The SOUND of a TELEPHONE RINGING, as heard through the 
               receiver. We HEAR the CLICK of the phone being PICKED UP, 
               then, after a moment, a VOICE:

                                     NELLE
                         Hello.

               FADE UP:

               INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - EARLY MORNING

               Truman sits on the edge of the bed in his WET OVERCOAT, as 
               if he'd walked in the rain.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Someday I'll tell you about it. For 
                         the moment, I'm too shattered.

               Pause.

                                     NELLE
                         They're dead, Truman. You're alive.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It was a terrible experience and I 
                         will never get over it.
                              (then)
                         There wasn't anything I could have 
                         done to save them.

               We hear Nelle light a cigarette.

                                     NELLE
                         Maybe not.

               We hear her exhale slowly.

                                     NELLE
                         But the fact is, you didn't want to.

               On Truman,

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               FADE IN: BRIGHT WHITE. AIRPLANE NOISE. COLORS RESOLVE INTO:

               INT. FIRST CLASS SECTION, AIRPLANE - DAY

               Truman, seated on the aisle, next to William Shawn. After a 
               long silence, he extracts from his leather briefcase a PACKAGE 
               wrapped in BROWN PAPER. Hands it to Truman.

                                     SHAWN
                         It came to the hotel this morning. I 
                         told them I'd give it to you.

               The package says KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY and is addressed 
               to Truman. Truman opens it.

               He takes out PERRY'S NOTEBOOKS -- the DIARY and PERSONAL 
               DICTIONARY. He opens the Diary. Toward the end, he finds 
               Perry's final entry. He READS silently. We hear Perry's VOICE:

                                     PERRY (V.O.)
                         Did we not know we were to die, we 
                         would be children. By knowing it, we 
                         are given the opportunity to mature 
                         in spirit...

               Truman turns the page. It's BLANK. He closes the Diary.

               We CONTINUE to hear Perry's VOICE as Truman takes out a 
               SNAPSHOT -- the one of Perry (at age 3) and Linda splashing 
               in the puddle.

                                     PERRY (V.O.)
                         Some take that opportunity. I hope I 
                         have...

               Truman takes out a PENCIL DRAWING Perry did of him. It's 
               very good, though Truman looks old and weary in it.

                                     PERRY
                         Life is only the father of wisdom. 
                         Death is the mother.

               Truman finds, at the bottom of the package, his TIE. He takes 
               it out, clutches it.

               Truman grasps for William Shawn's HAND, finds it, holds on 
               tightly. Shawn sits stoically, hoping no one will notice.

               The CAMERA pulls back, up the aisle. Truman clutches the 
               tie, and holds on to Shawn's hand, for dear life.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK.

               TITLE UP: (each title fades up in succession)

               In Cold Blood made Truman Capote the most famous writer in 
               America.

               He never finished another book.

               The epigraph he chose for his last published work reads: 
               "More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered 
               ones. "

               He died in 1984 of complications due to alcoholism.

  

                                        THE END
