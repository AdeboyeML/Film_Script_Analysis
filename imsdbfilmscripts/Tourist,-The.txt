      EXT. PARIS - DAY
      
      CRANE DOWN from a view of Paris on a misty day.   Cool,
      gray and beautiful.
      
      A taxi stops by the curb of a wide, cobbled street. All
      around there is bustle and activity, with cars and people
      hurrying about their business.
      
      The door opens and a pair of exquisitely shaped female
      legs in Christian Louboutin high heels swing out.
      
      
      INT. GARE DE L'EST, PARIS - DAY
      
      WE FOLLOW the legs up the steps, across the concourse,
      through the station. Men turn and stare.
      
      CARA MASON (30, stunning) shows no sign of noticing. She
      wears dark glasses and carries a traveling bag in one
      hand, a copy of the International Herald Tribune in the
      other.
      
      
      INT. BRASSERIE, GARE DE L'EST - DAY
      
      A YOUNG WAITER wiping down the bar stops to watch Cara
      enter and take a seat at a table slightly set apart.
      
      An OLDER WAITER approaches her. They exchange a few
      words and he walks toward the bar.
      
                              WAITER
                She's waiting for someone.
      
                              YOUNGER WAITER
                Probably waiting for me.
      
                              WAITER
                The door's waiting for you if you
                don't get back to work.
      
      A MESSENGER clad in leather, wearing a motorcycle helmet,
      enters the cafe and looks around. He consults a
      photograph.
      
      His eyes land on Cara. He walks over and holds out a
      document-sized envelope.
      
                              MESSENGER
                C'est vous, Mademoiselle?
                                                               2.
      
      
                                CARA
                Oui.
      
      As the messenger walks away she opens the folder and
      shakes out the contents. There is a ticket for the
      Orient Express and a handwritten letter...
      
      She spreads it out on the table like a precious treasure
      map. Her beautiful forehead creases with concentration as
      she reads...
      
                              ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.)
                     (English accent)
                They are following you Cara.
      
      She looks up. Takes out a small makeup mirror and holds
      it in front of her face to glance around behind her...
      
                              ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                They think you'll lead them to me.
                But if you follow my instructions
                closely, there is a way for us to
                get away...
      
      Cara scans the rest of the letter.
      
      CAMERA glides down to see the signature at the bottom:
      "Love, Alexander."
      
      We barely have time to read this before Cara's perfectly
      manicured hand crumples the letter, places it in a saucer
      and sets fire to it.
      
      The YOUNG WAITER hurries over, alarmed.
      
                                YOUNGER WAITER
                Mademoiselle!    Je vous en prie--
      
      Cara is already gathering her things and walking away.
      
      
      INT. GARE DE L'EST STATION - MOMENTS LATER
      
      As Cara walks toward the platform...
      
                              ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.)
                Take the 4:25 Orient Express to
                Venice. En route select a man my
                approximate height and weight...
      
      Her eyes scan the platform.
                                                                3.
      
      
                                 ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   Have faith Cara. I'll be with you
                   soon.
      
      CARA'S POV
      
      Men of various shapes and sizes are boarding "The Orient
      Express." She pauses only long enough to assess and
      discard: too old, too young, too thin, too overweight...
      
      Her gaze comes to rest on a WELL-DRESSED FRENCH MAN.
      Medium height, medium build. Standing alone. Examining
      his ticket.
      
      Cara glances at her reflection critically in the polished
      glass window of the train. Adjusts her hair and dress.
      
      Satisfied with what she sees, she turns and starts toward
      the WELL-DRESSED FRENCH MAN like a cat stalking prey.
      
      The CAMERA admiringly FOLLOWS her silky approach.
      
      The FRENCH MAN hears the click of her heels and looks up.
      His mouth falls open...
      
      HIS WIFE arrives and shuts it for him.
      
                                 WIFE
                   What are you doing Vincent?   Our
                   train car is over here!
      
      With a regretful backward glance at Cara, he allows
      himself to be dragged away.
      
      Frustrated, Cara turns and casts about for another
      possibility.
      
      She spots a TOUSLE HAIRED MAN seated on a bench.
      
                                 CONDUCTER (V.O.)
                   All aboard! All aboard the 4:25
                   is departing!
      
      Tousle Hair gathers his bags to get on the train.
      Encouraged, Cara moves to cut him off.
      
      As Tousle Hair stands up REVEAL... he's six foot seven.
      
      Cara stops short, irritated. The MAN behind her boarding
      the train is fumbling with his suitcase and doesn't
      notice. BAM he walks straight into her.
                                                             4.
      
      
                               CARA
                 Ow!
      
                                FRANK
                 Sorry!   Excuse me. Pardone moi.
      
      FRANK TAYLOR (30's, amiable) is a cheerful American
      tourist. Open face, completely lacking in guile.
      
      Frank continues to mutter apologies as he walks gingerly
      around Cara and boards the train.
      
      Cara watches him with thinly veiled contempt. Frank is a
      man of average size, average build... she peers over her
      glasses at him. And her expression slowly changes. She
      follows him onto the train.
      
      ANGLE ON
      
      A GOOD-LOOKING ENGLISHMAN loitering further down the
      platform, reading the Herald Tribune. Or rather, not
      reading it. He's been watching Cara. He lowers the
      paper and climbs onto the train through a different door.
      
      
      EXT. PARIS - DAY
      
      The gleaming Orient Express pulls out of the station and
      gets underway.
      
      
      INT. ORIENT EXPRESS - AFTERNOON
      
      The train is moving.
      
      The thick carpet, the mellow wood of the inlaid panels,
      the subtlety of the Lalique mirrors and the softly lit
      lamps all inspire a feeling of great luxury.
      
      Frank looks vaguely out of place, sitting by the window
      in his casual jeans and pullover sweater. He's wrapped
      up in a dog-eared paperback spy novel. So wrapped up
      that he barely notices Cara sit down opposite him.
      
      She crosses her legs.   He glances up.
      
      Slowly, nonchalantly, she takes her coat off.   Then the
      headscarf tied around her neck.
      
      FOLLOW her sensual movements in TIGHT CLOSE UP. The
      effect is as if she's performing a tantalizing strip
      tease.
                                                               5.
      
      
      Frank is captivated to the point of being unsettled.
      
      She takes off her glasses to reveal stunning eyes.
      
      She goes to remove her mock-turtleneck sweater.   The
      zipper seems to give her trouble.
      
      Without bothering to struggle she sits up in her seat and
      leans toward Frank.
      
                              CARA
                I think I'm going to need your
                help.
      
      Frank is barely able to respond.
      
                                FRANK
                Hmm?
      
                              CARA
                My zipper...
                     (off his blank look)
                It's stuck.
      
      Frank finally moves into action.   He sets his book down
      and leans closer.
      
      Awkwardly he reaches towards Cara's beautiful neck. He
      attempts to unwind the trapped thread of fabric. But the
      zipper resists.
      
                              FRANK
                I'm afraid of hurting you.
      
      She slides forward on her seat, to get even closer.
      
                              CARA
                Don't be afraid.
      
      The train car sways slightly and throws Frank off
      balance. He tugs sharply and the zipper suddenly gives--
      with a tearing sound.
      
      Frank freezes, looking down at the zipper still in his
      fingers.
      
                                FRANK
                I'm... sorry.
      
      Cara's eyes flash fury for a brief moment.
      
                              CARA
                It doesn't matter.
                                                               6.
      
      
                              FRANK
                Maybe I should let you do this--
      
                              CARA
                Don't give up so quickly.
      
      Reluctantly, Frank continues with the zipper. The
      tearing sound continues as he lowers the zipper, inch by
      inch.
      
      First her neck, then her throat, then her cleavage are
      gradually uncovered. The zipper keeps going downward.
      No sign of anything underneath.
      
      Frank is practically sweating.
      
      Finally he uncovers fabric. He finishes unzipping the
      sweater and sits back into his seat.
      
      Cara slides it off her shoulders, sensuous as ever.
      
                               CARA (CONT'D)
                Thanks.
      
      And settles back into her seat, cat-like. He stares at
      her for several moments, at a loss for words.
      
                              FRANK
                My name is Frank.
      
                               CARA
                Cara.
      
      A white-jacketed STEWARD arrives.
      
                              STEWARD
                     (to Frank)
                Will you and your wife take dinner
                here or in the dining car this
                evening, monsieur?
      
                               FRANK
                Pardon me?   Oh, no.   We're not
                actually--

                The dining car would be lovely,
                thank you.
      
      The steward nods and disappears.    Frank just stares.
      
                                                          CUT TO:

      EXT. MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET
      
      The Orient Express plows through the Alps. PUSH IN ON a
      window where we see Frank and Cara sitting at a romantic,
      candlelit table eating dinner.
      
      
      INT. DINING CAR - EVENING
      
      Linen tablecloths. Fine china. Frank is one of the only
      men in the dining car not in a dinner jacket.
      
      Frank takes out a bottle of pills from his pocket, then
      another and another...
      
      He takes one or two pills from each and swallows them
      methodically. She watches him.
      
                                 CARA
                 Are you ill?
      
                                 FRANK
                 What?   No.
      
      She looks at all the pills spread out beside his plate.
      
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                 Just nervous.    I don't like
                 travelling.
      
                               CARA
                      (gently mocking)
                 So you decided to take a holiday
                 on the Orient Express?
      
      He hesitates.
      
                               FRANK
                 I'm on my honeymoon.
      
                               CARA
                 Your honeymoon?
      
      Cara is annoyed at this revelation.
      
                                CARA (CONT'D)
                 Should we ask the waiter to set
                 another place?
      
                               FRANK
                 She's in Pennsylvania.
      
      Off her questioning look...

                You're sure you want to hear this?
      
                              CARA
                If you'd like to tell me.
      
                              FRANK
                Two weeks ago she left me. For
                the owner of a pizza parlor.
      
                                CARA
                That's awful.
      
      Frank nods, matter-of-fact.
      
                              FRANK
                No travel insurance. No refund on
                the tickets. So... here I am. On
                my honeymoon.
      
                              CARA
                I'm sorry, Frank.
      
                              FRANK
                I really loved that pizza too.
                "Bala Pizza" if you're ever in
                Rosemont.
      
                              CARA
                I wouldn't touch it.    I'm loyal to
                you.
      
      A waiter delivers their drinks.
      
                                WAITER

                                FRANK
                Thanks.

                Nobody knows. He disappeared
                after his escape. He's had
                extensive plastic surgery to alter
                his appearance since then. Drug
                lord Amado Carillo did the same
                thing in the 90s to successfully
                elude authorities.

                Pearce worked with no more than a
                few accomplices at one time. He
                treated them so well that they're
                virtually all completely loyal.
                None of them would cooperate.
                We've questioned the ones we could
                find, and the only thing we
                learned is that Pearce apparently
                arranged it so even his own people
                have never seen him after the
                surgery.

      Frank doesn't get it.
      
      An awkward beat. Cara takes a few Euros from her purse
      and tips him. The Porter exits.

      Demidov makes a gesture and a second BODYGUARD with a
      SCAR on his face gives Quinn an envelope filled with
      cash.
      
      Quinn tucks it away discreetly, as if embarrassed by the
      directness of the pay off.

                Mr. Demidov... if I may ask you a
                question... Why do you care so much
                about Alexander Pearce? I mean,
                you've come here yourself... as if
                it were personal.
      
      Demidov looks at Quinn thoughtfully.
      
                              DEMIDOV
                It may be difficult for you to
                understand, Mr. Quinn; you Swiss
                are mercenary by nature. But for
                some of us, there are things more
                important than money. I put my
                trust in Alexander Pearce. He
                betrayed that trust.
      
      Quinn smiles tightly.   He's ready to get out of there.

                And it's bad business to let
                somebody make a fool of you. If
                Pearce gets away with it, what
                does that say about me?

      EXT. THE LIDO, VENICE - DAY
      
      A clear, bright winter day at the beach. Devoid of
      tourists, the famous stretch is a completely different
      Venice from the one we're used to seeing.
      
      Sandbanks stretch out into the dark green sea.
      
      Cara and Frank walk on a deserted patch of sand.   The
      wind wraps her light sun dress around her body,
      intermittently hugging her perfect curves.

      A sound of voices and laughter drift toward them. Up
      ahead on the beach they see a group of Italians in formal
      clothes. A woman wears a white bridal dress.

      him where he's going to sleep. However...
      
      He watches Cara drop her wrap over a chair and kicks off

      A movement in the street down below catches her eye. She
      studies the Ponte del Vin intently, seeing something.
      
      Cara turns abruptly to Frank and presses her body against
      his. He's taken by surprise but willingly responds to

      It's engraved with a name:
      
      ALEXANDER PEARCE
      
      He stares at the name for a moment, then unzips his
      travel bag. Takes out his pills. Pops a bunch. Brushes
      his teeth.
      
      He pauses and stares at himself in the mirror as if
      wondering how in the world he ended up here. It's like
      he's staring into the face of stranger.

      blinks his eyes.
      
      The morning is misty.   He closes the balcony doors.
      
      Cara's bedroom door is ajar. Frank struggles not to
      notice. He turns to his bed and begins folding sheets.
      
      Then he hears the sound of water running in the shower.
      
      He glances over at the door ajar, the sound of the
      shower... it's too much.
      
      Frank walks to the bedroom door.   He pushes it open.
      
      The door to Cara's bathroom is open.   The outline of her
      naked body is visible in the shower.   She lifts her wet
      hair and soaps the back of her neck.
      
      She sees him.   Cara is so stunned she simply stands
      there.

      slowly toward Frank. Then...

                 Thank you.
      
      The waiter has finished.     He hovers for a moment...
      
      Finally Frank takes the hint and gives the man a one Euro
      tip. He takes it with disdain and leaves.
      
      Frank throws off his blanket and sits up.

      holds it to his face for a moment to enjoy her lingering
      scent.
      
      He notices a newspaper... a copy of The International
      Herald Tribune is open on her bedside table. He lifts it
      to see what Cara had been reading.
      
      There is a personal ad that has been lightly dotted with
      a ball point pen. The message is just a list of words:
      
      
      "TOM CORRY NOW IN A MICA CAN IF FEELING PEST STILL
      AROUND."
      
      The dots single out letters in a code... Frank picks up the
      pen and puts a faint line through the groups of
      unselected letters to reveal the message:
      
      "Tomorrow 11 Caffe Pesaro"
      
      Frank studies this for a moment.
      
      
      THE BUZZER SOUNDS
      
      Laying the paper on the table, Frank walks to the door.
      
                               MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                Breakfast.
      
      Frank reaches for the doorknob... then pauses.   Breakfast
      again?
      
      He quietly slides the chain on.    Peers through the
      spyhole.
      
      SPYHOLE POV -- Two tough-looking men in suits stand
      there: most definitely not hotel staff. One has a scar
      on his face... Demidov's BODYGUARDS.
      
      Frank is frozen.
      
      Scarface takes out a silenced PISTOL and mutters
      something in Russian to his partner. He produces a LOCK
      PICK SET and crouches out of frame.
      
      Frank hears the sound of scratching metal and clicking
      tumblers inside the lock. He looks around wildly. Sees
      the KEY on the entryway table and reaches for it...
      
      Ch-chunk. The Russian picks the lock and slowly starts
      to open the door. The chain stops it. A pause.
                                                              33.
      
      
      A moment later a KNIFE comes through the crack and starts
      to slide the chain...
      
      Frank stares at the knife; he has to act fast...
      
      Frank throws his shoulder against the door. The knife
      clatters to the floor as the door slams shut. Frank jams
      his KEY into the lock and turns the bolt into place.
      
      There's angry confusion on the other side of the door.
      
      Frank grabs a heavy glass ashtray and swings it at the
      back of the key-- breaking it off in the lock.
      
      Frank scrambles out of the way...
      
      The sound of metal scraping in the lock. Russian CURSING
      can be heard just outside. A heavy blow as they try to
      shoulder the door open...
      
      Frank looks around desperately for an escape.
      
      The bathroom?   The sitting room?   Adjoining doors?   None.
      
      There's nowhere to go.
      
      Frank bolts for the balcony in his bare feet.
      
      He scrambles outside as...
      
      POP! POP! POP! Bullets rip through the wood and metal,
      blasting the lock assembly apart. The door bursts open.
      
      
      EXT. BALCONY - DAY
      
      Frank looks down and stares at the
      
      
      DIZZYING SIX STORY DROP
      
      to the cobblestones of the Ponte del Vin below.
      
      Guests sit on their balconies with their morning coffee.
      
      Three balconies over, Frank sees the rooftop of the
      modern wing of the hotel.
      
      
      IN THE SUITE
      
      The two TOUGHS rapidly move through the room, searching.
      Nyet, Nyet.
                                                               34.
      
      
      The one place they haven't checked...
      
      THE BALCONY
      
      Frank puts one bare foot on the stonework. He grimaces
      as he HEAVES himself onto the railing of the balcony
      adjacent to his.
      
      He hangs desperately, flailing, 100 feet over the street
      below. He gets a tentative hold...
      
      A PALLID FRENCH WOMAN drops her coffee and screams.
      
      The Russians sprint out to the balcony.    They spot
      Frank...
      
      Who shoves the Pallid Woman inside, struggles past her
      breakfast table, and prepares to leap again-- but slips
      on the spilled coffee.
      
      Bullets shatter China around him. He cuts his foot on a
      broken plate. He grabs his bleeding foot.
      
                                 FRANK
                  Goddamn it!   I'm a fucking
                  tourist!
      
      Another round of shots ring out.    They don't seem to
      care.
      
      Frank goes over the railing with another awkward HEAVE.
      
      His pursuers scale the adjoining stone work and step onto
      the Pallid Woman's balcony.
      
      This time Frank lands in the lap of a BURLY WELSHMAN.
      
                                BURLY WELSHMAN
                  Are ya bloody mad?
      
      The Burly Welshman PUNCHES Frank in the stomach, which
      drops him out of the way of...
      
      TWO SHOTS
      
      Which explode into the Welshman's shoulder.   He cries out
      and falls down on top of Frank.
      
      The Russians stand on the Pallid Woman's balcony and
      prepare to JUMP...
      
      as Frank crawls out from under the wounded Welshman and
      peers over the next balcony...
                                                            35.
      
      
      Which is at least TWENTY FEET from the roof.
      
      He misjudged the distance.
      
                                FRANK
                  Shit...
      
      
      INT. THE WELSHMAN'S ROOM - SECONDS LATER
      
      Frank runs through the hotel room, past the Welshman's
      wife to the door.
      
      A SHOT behind him and pounding feet send him out into the
      corridor past a room service steward to an...
      
      ELEVATOR
      
      Which   will not do but the--
      
      
      INT.    SERVICE STAIRCASE - SECONDS LATER
      
      STAIRS will and Frank flies down the steps, three at a
      time, hearing his pursuers above him, running harder than
      he's run in his entire life...
      
      But he's slow and they gain on him enough to aim weapons
      through the railing...
      
      P-CHING, several bullets ricochet like pinballs in the
      metal stairwell.
      
      Frank pants as he pushes out a side door...
      
      
      EXT. RIO DEL VIN CANAL, VENICE - DAY
      
      Frank sprints along the edge of the canal, dodging
      tourists and children, vendors and locals. He spots a
      VENDOR'S three wheel BICYCLE and jumps on.
      
      As he pedals, he realizes it's too slow so he JUMPS
      OFF...
      
      and FALLS - a painful spill, he cuts his hand - but
      clambers to his feet as the Russians bear down. Running
      up hidden stairs he finds the roof of a shop on the Riva
      Degli Schiavoni...
                                                             36.
      
      
      EXT. RIVA DEGLI SCHIAVONI, VENICE - DAY
      
      Frank runs down the ridge of the roof.   A silenced shot
      hits roof tile nearby and throws him off balance. He
      FALLS...
      
      ...bumping down the other side of the roof until, as he
      topples over the edge, he thrusts a hand at the gutter,
      smashing his head against the wall. He drops onto the
      pavement along the edge of the small canal.
      
      He doubles back towards the lagoon. Looking back, he sees
      the men still in pursuit.
      
      He turns into the Campo San Zaccaria, scattering the
      flapping and fluttering PIGEONS.   The Gondolieri and
      their passengers watch the half-naked man run past and
      cheer.
      
                              A GONDOLIER
                     (in Italian)
                Run faster, man!
      
      The Russians force their way past the pedestrians.    They
      have almost caught him when...
      
      
      INT. LEATHER SHOP - DAY
      
      Ducking inside a leather shop, Frank heads straight for
      the back entrance and finds it.
      
      He stands on the cobblestones. Blood streams from his
      forehead as well as his hand. He has
      
      SECONDS
      
      to decide which way to go. The alley is long and narrow
      on either side. An awning above. Clear sight lines.
      
      The back of the shop upends the Grand Canal.
      
      
      EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER
      
      The Russians burst out the back.
      
      There is no sign of Frank.
      
      Scarface looks at the Canal. He walks to the edge of the
      water and SPRAYS gun fire atop it. Nothing.
      
                                                           CUT TO:
                                                              37.
      
      
      HIGH ANGLE OF SCENE
      
      Frank lies huddled on his back IN THE AWNING behind the
      leather shop, barely able to control his frantic
      breathing. He's mere feet away from the men who are
      trying to kill him...
      
      He looks up and sees: the scowling face of an Italian
      WOMAN peering out over her window box.
      
      Frank raises a desperate finger to his lips.    A prayer
      that she won't give him away.
      
      She looks at him disapprovingly.     Then disappears back
      inside.
      
      CLOSE ON FRANK as he waits, his heart pounding.
      
      Seconds tick past...   is he safe?
      
      Rrrrrip! A black cylinder, like the barrel of a gun,
      tears through the awning fabric inches from his Frank's
      head.
      
      He cries out. The awning rips and dumps him down hard
      onto the cobblestones below...
      
      
      A MOMENTARY BLACKOUT
      
      Frank opens his eyes and sees two pairs of black boots
      that belong to... A PAIR OF CARBINIERI who stand over him.
      One of them holds a nightstick.
      
      They stare down at the bloodied tourist in his underpants
      lying at their feet. They've seen stranger things.
      
                                                           CUT TO:
      
      
      INT. POLIZIA "QUESTURA" (POLICE STATION) - DAY
      
      Frank sits alone with a blanket over his shoulders. Most
      of the blood has been wiped from his wound and he has a
      rough bandage on his head.
      
      From down the hallway a cheery stubble-faced POLICE
      OFFICER, DOMENICO (30's, animated), walks into the room
      where Frank is waiting.
      
      Domenico laughs, talking on his cell phone as he enters.
                                                             38.

                You can't let them stay over, man.
                You start cuddling and then she
                wants to borrow your car. Stop
                cuddling, Tomaso!
      
      Frank stands.
      
                               FRANK
                Excuse me...
      
                              DOMENICO
                     (suddenly noticing
                      him)
                Hey, what are you doing in here?
      
                              FRANK
                The officers told me to wait here.
                I've been sitting here for over
                two hours...
      
      Dominico glances over his shoulder.
      
                              DOMENICO
                I think they forgot about you.
      
      Frank sits back down heavily.    Domenico sits on the edge
      of a desk.
      
                              DOMENICO (CONT'D)
                What happened to you, anyway?
      
                              FRANK
                Somebody tried to kill me.
      
      Domenico picks up Frank's statement and glances at it.
      
                              DOMENICO
                Mr. Taylor, wow, you had quite a
                day. Eh? We got chasing, we got
                shooting.
      
      Domenico looks at mild-mannered Frank sitting there in
      his boxers. The story seems unlikely.
      
                              FRANK
                You think I'm crazy but it's all
                true.
      
                              DOMENICO
                Maybe you crazy AND it's true, my
                friend.
                                                              39.
      
      
      Domenico looks at Frank a little harder.     Decides this
      guy is not making all this up.
      
                              DOMENICO (CONT'D)
                Okay, so who are these guys? Why
                they mad at you?
      
                              FRANK
                I have absolutely no idea.
      
                              DOMENICO
                They followed you from the
                Danieli?
      
                              FRANK
                They came to the room. They
                pretended to be room service.
      
                              DOMENICO
                You don't scopata one of their
                girlfriends or something?

                               DOMENICO
                Who is...
      
      He consults a piece of paper.
      
                               DOMENICO (CONT'D)
                Cara Mason?
      
      Frank is quiet.   Domenico playfully points at him.
      
                              DOMENICO (CONT'D)

      Domenico considers for a moment.

                               FRANK
                No.
      
                              DOMENICO
                How long you know Cara Mason?
      
                              FRANK
                I met her yesterday.
      
                              DOMENICO

                              FRANK
                I didn't take her. She took me.
      
      The infectious grin again lights up Domenico's face.
      
                              DOMENICO
                You lead an exciting life, Mr.

                               FRANK
                Not usually.
      
      Domenico picks up the phone and dials a number. He talks
      in brisk Italian, listens again and replaces the
      receiver.
      
                              DOMENICO
                Signora Mason was staying with
                "her husband" last night. You

                I think maybe Signora Mason might
                know why these guys behave badly.

      Pause.

                She didn't give me one.

                You need some clothes.     I'll be
                right back.
      
      He leaves Frank alone again.
      
      Frank stands and half-heartedly follows him to the
      doorway.
      
      He spots something in the adjoining room; a computer that
      has been left on. He wanders over and looks at the
      screen.
      
      An idea comes into Frank's head... he looks around. Nobody
      is watching him. He glances at the inscription on the
      WATCH...
      
      Then quickly sits down. He does a search for "WANTED
      INTERNATIONAL CRIMINALS" and types in the name:
      
      ALEXANDER PEARCE.
      
      An immediate hit in the data base. Alexander Pearce's
      page fills the screen. The caption reads:
      
      #6 on INTERPOL'S MOST WANTED LIST.
      
      In place of a photograph there is just a black outline of
      a man's head.
      
      Frank is about to scan for more information when he hears
      Domenico returning. He quickly steps back into the room
      where he was left...
      
      DOMENICO enters carrying a garish SWEAT SUIT.   He hands
      it to Frank.

      Frank looks at the clothes.

      Domenico gets down on his hands and knees and looks
      around. He spots something under the sofa and fishes it
      out with his penknife... a spent bullet casing.
      
      He puts it in a plastic bag, pleased with himself.
      Demidov catches his eye. He smiles at him.

      the door...
      
      
      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
      
      Frank looks right and left. The corridor is empty and
      silent, lit by strip lights set on low.
      
      Just as he's about to close the door again, Frank notices
      that there is a label stuck there with his name on it,
      just above the room number.
      
      He struggles with the label for a few seconds, tearing it

      Then...
      
      He hears the clang of a metal pushcart being wheeled
      along. Some footsteps approach. There are voices speaking
      an unfamiliar language, maybe Russian...
      
      Russian?
      
      Frank scrambles for his clothes. He fishes out
      Domenico's phone number from a pocket and races to the
      phone. Then freezes, listening:
      
      The footsteps move away slightly... there is the sound of a
      door opening. The door across the hall.

      Seconds pass. The door is closed again.      The footsteps

      Nothing. He moves along the passage, slipping into
      doorways and out of the light.
      
      He finds the elevator and jabs at the button.
      
      The light shows it is approaching the floor. It stops.
      The doors open. Frank is about to enter it, when
      suddenly SOMEBODY STEPS OUT...

      close.
      
      Slowly the elevator descends... and stops.
      
      The doors open. A big MAN stands with his back to us,
      blocking the exit. Frank shrinks away, with nowhere to
      hide. The man turns.

      He's a MALE NURSE, waiting to get into the lift. He
      stands aside to allow Frank to leave. Frank takes a step
      out...

      the doors shut first.

      Frank in the darkness as the car careers towards him.

                 Um... you may not believe this but
                 there are some people trying to
                 kill me--

                 I know.
      
      Cara drives toward the ramp.     He looks at her.
      
                               FRANK
                 Do you know why?
      
                               CARA
                 It's because I kissed you.
      
      She stops the car and waits for the metal gate at the top
      of the ramp to open. It rises with a loud creaking to
      REVEAL...
      
      A BLACK CAR with two men inside. One of them steps out
      and ducks under the gate as it rises up.
      
      While he's briefly silhouetted by the car's headlights we
      glimpse the outline of an AUTOMATIC WEAPON.
      
                                CARA (CONT'D)
                 Shit.
      
      With remarkable sangfroid she cuts the engine and lets
      her car roll backwards, gliding silently and perfectly
      into a parking spot.
      
      Silence.
      
      They watch the BLACK CAR slowly descend the ramp.   The
      Russian with the gun in his hand walks carefully
      alongside.
      
      Frank watches, holding his breath.
      
      The sound of another engine cuts through the silence.     A
      pair of headlights come up from the level below.
      
      CLOSE ON THE CAR. The MALE NURSE from the elevator is
      driving up toward the exit ramp, toward the exit where
      the Russians are waiting.
      
      CLOSE ON THE GUNMAN slipping back into the shadows and
      readying his gun to fire.
                                                              50.
      
      
      FRANK sees what is about to happen.    His face betrays his
      concern.
      
      He reaches for the door.
      
      CLICK. Cara presses the central door lock.      Frank's door
      doesn't budge. He looks over at her.
      
                               FRANK
                      (re: the Nurse)
                That guy has nothing to do with

                Neither do you.
      
      He looks her straight in the eye.    She relents.
      
                               CARA (CONT'D)
                Okay.   If you want to play hero...
      
      She turns over the ignition.
      
                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                Hold on.
      
      Cara revs the car and pulls out fast, cutting off the
      Nurse's car. He leans on the horn.
      
      At the top of the exit ramp, the metal parking gate is
      slowly being lowered.
      
      She weaves around the black car, deliberately heading for
      the gunman. He opens fire.
      
      BRRRRRAAAP!! Bullets spray wildly, ricocheting off the
      walls, shattering windshields... Frank covers his face as a
      side-window pops, showering him with glass.
      
      The GUNMAN is forced to jump out of the way as Cara
      scrapes the side of her car along the wall. Sparks fly.
      
      The black car burns rubber as it U-turns to follow her.
      
      She guns it up the ramp towards the closing door.
      
                              FRANK
                There's not enough room!
      
                              CARA
                There's enough room.

      The fence whirs at head height and keeps lowering.    The
      black car is closing in behind them.
      
                              FRANK
                We won't make it!
      
                              CARA
                I thought Americans were
                optimists.
      
      At the last second he ducks instinctively and closes his
      eyes. The gate clips the top of Cara's car with a
      tremendous CLANG! Traps it.
      
      Cara presses her foot all the way down on the
      accelerator. Smoke pours from the tires.
      
      
      CRASH!
      
      The black car RAMS them from behind.
      
      A Russian leans out the window and fires at the outlines
      of Cara and Frank's HEADS. Bullets shatter the back
      window.
      
      Cara pushes Frank's head down. The sound of burning
      gears as the engine hits its limit.
      
      Suddenly, scraping paint, Cara's car SPRINGS forward,
      jetting out onto the street.
      
      The fence drops further and shudders to a halt. The
      black car is trapped. The Russians can only watch as
      Cara speeds away.
      
                                                           CUT TO:
      
      
      INT. CARA'S CAR - NIGHT
      
      The quiet hum of the autostrade is the only sound in the
      car.
      
      Frank sits in a daze.   He turns to her.
      
                              FRANK
                Do I look that much like Alexander
                Pearce?
      
      Cara turns sharply.
                                                            52.

      Frank holds up his wrist.
      
                                  FRANK
                The watch.
      
      She hesitates.   A pause.
      
                              CARA
                I don't know. You're about his
                size. That's all.

                Alexander crossed a very dangerous
                man. He changed his appearance in
                order to vanish.
      
                                  FRANK

                We should go to the police.
      
                              CARA
                Because they did such a good job
                protecting you before?
      
      Frank doesn't respond.
      
                                  CARA (CONT'D)
                Trust me.
      
      Frank looks at her. Then relents, leaning his head back
      against the support and closing his eyes.

      EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF VENICE - MORNING
      
      The car is parked along a muddy canal. Beside it runs a
      small disconnected set of palazzos. Cara shakes Frank.
      He won't wake up.
      
                                  CARA
                Frank... Frank.
      
      He's snoring.   She pinches his nose closed...
      
      He startles awake.   She smiles mischievously.
      
      
      ON A SIDE STREET
      
      He follows her past abandoned tricycles and very old men
      sitting on stone steps.
      
                              FRANK
                And I thought I wouldn't get to do
                any sight-seeing.
      
      Frank steps over a greenish puddle.
      
                                  CARA
                Here we are.
      
      She pauses before a run-down palazzo.
      
      
      INT. RUN DOWN PALAZZO, HALL - NIGHT
      
      The narrow hall is dark and shabby.
      
      Cara walks up the stairs to a door on the landing.     She
      opens it with a key.
      
      
      INT. PEARCE'S "SAFE HOUSE" - NIGHT
      
      It is completely dark inside. The two of them maneuver
      in the darkness. The sound of a hand bumping against a
      wall.
      
      Finally somebody finds the light switch and--
      
      CARA holds a .38 Taurus PISTOL in front of her.
      
      Frank happens to be right in her line of sight.   He
      flinches.
                                                              54.

                Whoa!
      
                               CARA
                Sorry.
      
      She quickly directs the gun away from him.    Frank leans
      over, catching his breath.
      
      Cara starts to giggle.   Frank starts to laugh too.
      
      
      INT. KITCHEN, PEARCE'S "SAFE HOUSE" - NIGHT
      
      The apartment appears as if it was leased, stocked and
      then never set foot in again. Brand new appliances that
      have never been used.
      
      Frank walks over to a flat screen TV and curiously peels
      off the protective clear film... He looks up and sees:
      
      Cara has her head inside the OVEN.
      
                              FRANK
                What are you doing?
      
      She pulls out, a flashlight in her mouth.
      
                              CARA
                Making sure no one sabotaged the
                gas lines.
      
      Frank watches her walk over to the FUSE BOXES.
      
      MINUTES LATER
      
      Frank pokes through the cupboards. Stocked with fine
      olives, tins of expensive smoked fish, viands, stewed
      fruit from orchards in France.
      
      He opens the icebox. Inside is frozen meat and fish.     He
      pulls out one package of frozen orange steaks - it is
      labelled "BARRACUDA, CAUGHT ANTIGUA, 8/07".
      
                              FRANK
                He goes Barracuda fishing?
      
      Cara has poured herself a glass of wine.
      
                              CARA
                He goes Marlin fishing. You catch
                the Barracudas by accident.
                                                               55.
      
      
      Frank looks at the steak...
      
      
      INT. DINING AREA, PEARCE'S "SAFE HOUSE" - LATER
      
      CLOSE ON THE FISH -- now seasoned, grilled and surrounded
      by whipped sweet potatoes, beets and almonds.
      
      Frank places a plate before Cara who sits with her wine
      at Pearce's oak table. She looks appreciatively at her
      plate.
      
                               CARA
                 And she left you for a cook?
      
      Frank smiles and pours himself a glass of wine.   Cara
      takes a bite.
      
                                CARA (CONT'D)
                 Mmmmm!   That's decadent.
      
                               FRANK
                 With these ingredients, it's not
                 hard.
      
      Frank savors a bite of his meal.
      
                               FRANK (CONT'D)
                 You know something? Food tastes
                 better after you've been shot at.
      
      Cara laughs.   She clinks his glass.
      
                               CARA
                 I'm glad I decided to come back
                 for you, Frank Taylor.
      
      They watch one another eat for several moments.
      
                               FRANK
                 Can I ask you a question.
      
      She sets down her fork.   Leans back.
      
                               FRANK (CONT'D)
                 What's it like? Being a criminal?

                              CARA
                Okay, I'm a criminal.
      
      She takes a big gulp of wine.     Moves over to the sofa.
      
                              CARA (CONT'D)
                I didn't mean for things to turn
                out like this. I always lived by
                a certain code. But then... I broke
                it.
      
      She lapses into silence.    Frank comes and sits beside
      her.
      
                              FRANK

                ever known. When I first met him,
                I wasn't expecting that. He took
                me by surprise.
      
      She shifts deeper into the leather cushions as if
      reliving a memory of sensual pleasure.
      
                              CARA (CONT'D)
                If I'd been prepared, I might not

      She frowns into her empty wine glass.    Frank slides a
      little closer.

      He looks into her eyes. They are sitting very close on
      the sofa. The lights are low. The mood is romantic...

                 height. Do you understand?
      
      He does. His humiliation complete, he rises with as much
      dignity as he can muster and carries the plates into the
      kitchen.
      
      Cara looks after him... exasperated yet already sorry for
      being so blunt. She is about to say something when...

      A PAGE has been turned down.   A recipe for LAMB.
      
      Cara pulls out her red, felt-tipped pen. She finds a
      sentence in the recipe with a single pen dot beside it.

      outfit. The lines of the suit highlight his frame.
      
      He likes what he sees.
      
      
      INT. DEMIDOV'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
      
      Demidov is getting dressed. It's an elaborate ritual:
      carefully pressed pants, ironed shirt, starched collar,
      etc.
      
      His two BODYGUARDS stand nervously at attention, watching
      him.
                                                              66.
      
      
                              DEMIDOV
                When I was a young man, times were
                very hard. When an opportunity
                presented itself, you took it.
      
      He pats talcum powder on himself.    The men remain stone-
      faced.
      
                              DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                I was twelve years old when Gregor
                asked me if I was ready for a
                man's job. He was the top
                chelovek in our housing block. So
                I said yes. He gave me a crowbar
                and told me to go bash in the
                skull of another boy who had
                stolen something from him.
      
      He points at his platinum cufflinks on a bedside table
      and snaps his fingers. Scarface hands them to him.
      
                              DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                Now it just so happened this boy
                was a friend of mine. I did not
                want to do this terrible thing.
                But when you come from the
                streets, you have no choice.
      
      He carefully knots his tie in the mirror.
      
                                DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                I worked   very hard for years to
                get past   that life. So I would
                not have   to do these terrible
                things.    So I would have a choice...
      
      He turns and smiles at his THICK-NECKED bodyguard.    He
      gestures toward the man's holstered pistol --
      
                                 DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                I have people like you to do these
                things for me...
      
      He holds out his hand; THICK NECK hands him the pistol.
      
                              DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                Except that you don't!
      
      Suddenly Demidov pistol whips the man across the face!
      
      Blood explodes from THICK NECK's nose.     He falls down to
      one knee, clutching his face in pain.
                                                             67.
      
      
      Scarface looks on in fear. Demidov calms himself almost
      as quickly as he lost his temper. He drops the gun on
      the carpet and steps back in disgust.
      
                              DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
                If you did your job properly, I
                wouldn't have to get my hands
                dirty, you piece of shit.
      
      He turns and walks into the bathroom to wash his hands.

      EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY
      
      Heels clicking on the cobblestones, Cara strides quickly
      along the Palazzo Vendramin en route to the Cipriani.
      She checks her watch. Then walks faster.
      
      She passes a smallish transporto via cargo (supply boat)
      floating in the lagoon beside the Palazzo.
      
      Cara approaches the poolside hotel restaurant.
      
      
      INT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY
      
      From a second story SUITE of rooms, The ENGLISHMAN peers
      through the curtains. He sees Cara seat herself at a
      TABLE between the pool and the lagoon.
      
      His eyes settle on the transporto. Workers step on and
      off, carrying fresh linens into the hotel.
      
      He leaves the window.
      
      
      INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY
      
      There is a small cabin on the deck.
      
      Inside the cabin, Ackerman, Goyal, a videographer, a
      signals surveillance officer and a coordinating tactics
      officer huddle.
      
      Ackerman stares out the tinted window.
      
      ACKERMAN'S POV - he can just see Cara sitting at the
      table.
                                                              68.
      
      
      EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY
      
      Fanning herself with a newspaper, Cara discreetly
      evaluates the men in her sight lines. Venetian civic
      leaders chatting by the bar, tourists reading maps...
      
      Over her sunglasses she catches sight of a pair of YOUNG
      LOVERS drunk in each other's grasp in the pool.
      
      She turns away.
      
      
      INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY
      
      Squinting, Ackerman evaluates his placements.
      
      - A WAITER, idling at his bussing station, his eyes
      roaming the palazzo.
      
      - A VAPORETTO CAPTAIN, who quietly turns away requests
      for a ride into St. Marks Square, his finger to his ear.
      
      - An OLDER COUPLE sitting a few seats away from Cara.
      
      And an AGENTE DI POLIZIA (police patrolman) loud and
      jovial, joking with passersby, while quietly checking his
      earpiece.
      
      He speaks into the air.
      
                              AGENTE DI POLIZIA (V.O.)

      The VIDEO CAMERA swivels to follow a MAN, elegantly
      dressed, with trim hair who swiftly approaches Cara's
      table...
      
      
      IN THE TRANSPORTO
      
      Standing up, Ackerman holds his hand up.
                                                             69.

      Cara glances up from her menu as she senses the elegant
      man approaching.
      
      The WAITER walks quickly toward Cara's table...
      
      The elegant man is FRANK.
      
      
      IN THE TRANSPORTO
      
      Ackerman stares at the monitor with Frank's face on it.
      He's quietly furious.
      
                              ACKERMAN

      AT THE RESTAURANT
      
      Cara stares slack-jawed at Frank.
      
      He has given himself a complete make-over.    New haircut.
      Pearce's suit fits him well.
      
      He looks terrific. Cara notices before quickly recovering
      her composure.

      Frank sits at the table with Cara and eats a CASHEW.

      The UNDERCOVER WAITER quickly moves away from Cara's
      table.
      
      Ackerman stares at the monitor which captures Cara's
      angry expression.

      signals to a different THIN WAITER.

                Not particularly, but I'm tired of
                being afraid. I've been running
                around like a frightened mouse

      Frank pulls out a Gitane cigarette.   He lights it,
      smoking while he talks.

                scared: "Alexander Pearce." He
                even sounds like some super cool
                master criminal with Russian
                enemies and the beautiful
                girlfriend... he probably works out.
                He might own a pizza shop on the

      Frank SHOVES him back.
                                                             74.

                women like that!
      
      Frank grabs the Undercover Waiter's collar with
      unaccustomed strength.
      
      Cara quietly picks up her bag and leaves the restaurant.
      She walks as fast as she can without being noticed toward
      the Palazzo Vendramin.
      
      In the midst of his scuffle, Frank looks around and
      realizes she's gone.
      
      The Undercover Waiter's earpiece falls out in the melee...
      Frank sees it and hesitates. Maybe this guy isn't
      Pearce.
      
      
      INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY
      
      Getting up from his seat in the cabin, Ackerman gestures
      for the captain of the transporto to leave the dock.
      
      ON THE MONITOR: Frank looks around and sees Cara:     fifty
      feet away. Walking with purpose.

                Cara!
      
      Cara says nothing. She just shoots Frank an angry glance
      and climbs onto A VAPORETTO (water taxi).
                                                              75.
      
      
      Frank runs to the edge of the water as it motors away.
      
      Suddenly he feels the presence of somebody behind him.
      TWO of ACKERMAN'S MEN are right there.
      
      They pin his arms forcefully.

                Ok Signor... you can come with us
                now.
      
      Frank looks at the two big men on either side of him.
      Then at Cara disappearing over the water. The fight
      drains out of him and he doesn't resist.

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
      
      Frank sits alone in the sparsely furnished, windowless
      room. A table, two chairs. A large mirror on the wall.
      
      Frank straightens his slightly disheveled suit, as if
      he's been dumped here without ceremony.
      
      He glances in the mirror periodically, suspicious.
      
      The door opens and Ackerman enters. He pulls up one of
      the chairs and gestures for Frank to do the same.

                                 FRANK
                Unfortunately.
      
      Ackerman reaches into his breast pocket and takes out his
      INTERPOL credentials. Tosses them on the table for Frank
      to see.

                 alternative I suppose.
      
      Ackerman smiles. Frank remains defiant.      He jerks his
      head toward the mirror confidently.
      
                               FRANK (CONT'D)
                 Who's watching from behind there?
      
      Ackerman looks over at the mirror, taken off guard by the
      question. He stands and goes to the mirror -- lifts it
      off its hooks and sets it on the floor.
      
      Nothing but plain wall underneath. Ackerman sits back
      down. Frank is a little bit chastened.
      
                               ACKERMAN
                 You have a vivid imagination.

      Ackerman leads Frank through the maze of desks and
      police. Various members of the task force follow their
      progress... Jean Luc, Jones, etc.
      
      They arrive at a central INTEL area where Goyal sits in
      front of several computer monitors.

      Goyal raises an eyebrow, but does as he's told. A few
      moments later a photo of POLICE RECRUITS in uniform comes
      up on screen.

      the determined police cadet than the sexy siren...  but
      it's definitely her.

      drinking from a fresh spring in the desert.
      
      Finally she pulls away and looks at him.
      
                                CARA
                 Why?
      
                               FRANK
                 You said I'd told so many lies,
                 you wouldn't believe me even if I
                 did tell the truth... This was the
                 only way to convince you.
                      (pause)
                 The truth is that I love you. All
                 that matters is that you believe
                 me.
      
      She stares into his eyes for a beat. Finally looking at
      her without a trace of deception. She believes.
      
      They hear voices on the stairs below.
      
      Frank holds up a finger to her-- wait.
      
      Frank crawls across the room and presses a hidden latch
      on a built-in bookshelf. It swings out of the way to
      reveal a hidden safe built into the floor.
      
      Frank removes the fitted floor boards. There is a
      sophisticated BIO-METRIC LOCK -- just like the one at the
      gate in the beginning of the movie.
                                                              98.
      
      
      Frank places his finger on the spot and the lock clicks
      open.
      
                                                           CUT TO:
      
      
      INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA - NIGHT
      
      TRACK WITH ACKERMAN up the stairs.
      
      He leads the team into the PENTHOUSE.
      
      He looks around at the mess as the agents fan out.
      
      Cara leans on Frank's arm as she heads for the exit.
      
                                ACKERMAN
                Cara... I want the paramedics to
                make sure you're all right--
      
      She blows right past him.     Ackerman calls out after her.
      
                                  ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                Cara...
      
      She pauses.   Turns to face him.
      
      Ackerman looks down for a moment, ashamed.
      
                                  ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                I'm sorry... I... we'll talk about
                this later.
      
                             CARA
                No we won't. There's nothing to
                talk about. I don't work for you
                anymore.
      
      She walks past him.    For a moment Ackerman and Frank look
      at one another.
      
                                  ACKERMAN
                Mr.   Taylor...   you're free to go.
      
      He looks at Frank with a measure of begrudging respect.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                It seems I underestimated you.
      
                              FRANK
                     (American accent)
                It seems you did, Mr. Ackerman.
                                                              99.
      
      
      With that, Frank steps out of the room.    Ackerman's
      attention is distracted by--
      
                                GOYAL
                 Sir... over here. Take a look at
                 this!
      
      Goyal has found the safe.   Ackerman comes over and looks.
      
      INSERT CLOSE UP - the only thing in the safe is a single
      FLASH DRIVE.
      
      Goyal signals to one of the TECHS. He opens a laptop on
      the desk and they plug in the FLASH DRIVE to check the
      contents.
      
      While they are doing this, Ackerman bends to inspect the
      BIO-METRIC LOCK.
      
                                ACKERMAN
                 He was here.
      
      Jones looks on eagerly as numbers fill the screen.
      
                               GOYAL
                 Account numbers... access codes...
                 unless I'm mistaken... he left the
                 money behind.
      
                               JEAN LUC
                 A mistake perhaps?
      
                               JONES
                 How much is there?
      
      Goyal scans down to a total...
      
                               GOYAL
                 Looks like 744 million.
      
                               JONES
                 That's no mistake...
                      (walks over)
                 That's his tax bill.
      
      She holds out her hand to the TECH who has just removed
      the FLASH DRIVE.
      
                               JONES (CONT'D)
                 I'll take that.
      
      She slips it into her pocket, then turns to Ackerman.
                                                          100.
      
      
      Ackerman has moved away. He's staring down at the ground
      -- from behind he looks like a man defeated.
      
                               JONES (CONT'D)
                Well John... with the funds
                recovered, I don't think there's
                going to be any appetite from our
                side to continue this
                investigation.
      
      Ackerman's shoulders are slumped, staring at Demidov's
      dead body on the ground. Jones puts a hand on his back,
      consoling him.
      
                              JONES (CONT'D)
                I'm sorry you didn't get your man.
      
      Then Ackerman turns... a big smile on his face.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Oh but I did get my man, Ms.
                Jones.
      
      She realizes; he was after Demidov all along.
      
      Ackerman nods to Goyal, a twinkle in his eye.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                Mr. Goyal, you may place Mr. Quinn
                under arrest now.
      
      Quinn is taken completely off guard. Before he can move,
      Goyal and another agent have placed him in handcuffs.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                     (to Quinn)
                What? You thought I didn't know?
                You were unwittingly quite
                helpful; without you Mr. Demidov
                might have escaped justice.
      
      He turns to Jones with a smile.
      
                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                After all, Demidov wasn't a target
                of this investigation, was he?
      
      Ackerman walks over to the window as Quinn is led away.
      
      ACKERMAN'S POV - Cara and Frank walk toward the canal in
      the street below.
      
      A WATER TAXI approaches.
                                                            101.
      
      
                               JONES
                There's something I don't
                understand... how did Pearce manage
                to get here and open that safe
                without anybody noticing? And
                where did he go?
      
      Ackerman stands at the window with his hands behind his
      back. For the briefest of moments, Frank looks back up
      at him and their eyes connect.
      
      Frank gives him a little smile.   Cara takes his arm to
      climb onto the boat.
      
      CLOSE ON ACKERMAN:   his eyes narrow.   He knows.
      
      For a moment he doesn't move. Then, in spite of himself,
      a small smile creeps over his face too.
      
                              ACKERMAN
                Because Pearce was cleverer than
                all of us.
      
                                                          CUT TO:
      
      
      EXT. WATER TAXI - NIGHT
      
      Cara and Frank step on board.
      
      The DRIVER starts the engine.
      
      He turns to REVEAL... that he is the "ENGLISHMAN" we've
      seen throughout the movie. He and Frank look at one
      another for a moment.
      
                              THE ENGLISHMAN
                $20 million dollars worth of
                surgery and that's the face you
                chose?
      
                              FRANK
                     (English accent)
                It's good to see you too.
      
      They embrace warmly. Cara is in disbelief, realizing
      just how completely Frank/Alexander has planned things
      out.
      
      She casts one last glance backwards.
                                                             102.
      
      
                               CARA
                 You really think they'll just give
                 up?
      
                               FRANK
                 The Americans have their money.   I
                 left it all for them.
      
                               CARA
                 What about Demidov's money?
      
                               FRANK
                 Well...
                      (smiles)
                 You have to save something for
                 your pension.
      
      The Englishman opens the door to the cabin for them.
      
      A bottle of Crystal Champagne and two glasses are set out
      for them. Frank leads Cara in and offers her a glass.
      
      Instead, she slips into his arms and presses against him.
      They begin to kiss...
      
      CAMERA STAYS discreetly behind as they pull away from us,
      the water taxi swinging out into the Grand Canal.
      
      As it recedes from view, the vaporetto's tail lamps
      shimmer and blend into the beautiful lights of Venice...   a
      city for lovers.
