                       I don't want to be a product of my
                       environment. I want my environment
                       to be a product...of me.

                                 COSTELLO (V.O.)
                       Years ago, we had the Church. That
                       was only a way of saying we had
                       each other. The Knights of Columbus
                       were head-breakers. They took over
                       their piece of the city.
          
          EXT. SOUTHIE. VARIOUS
          
          The neighborhood. 1980's. We won't be here long. This isn't
          where Costello ends up. It's where he began. Liquor stores
          with shamrocked signs. MEN FISHING near Castle Island.
          Catholic SCHOOLKIDS playing in an asphalted schoolyard.
          
                                 COSTELLO (V.O.)
                       Twenty years after an Irishman
                       couldn't get a job, we had the
                       presidency. That's what the niggers
                       don't realize. If I got one thing
                       against the black chaps it's this.
                       No one gives it to you. You have to
                       take it.
          
          INT. LUNCH COUNTER. DAY
          
          COSTELLO comes in. The shop is one that sells papers,
          sundries, fountain drinks...and fronts a bookie operation.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO
                           (leaning over cluttered
                            counter)
                       Don't make me have to come down
                       here again.
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                        2.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
                                 PROPRIETOR
                       Won't happen again, Mr. C.
          
          The frightened proprietor hands over money. Fifty bucks, a
          hundred, doesn't matter. COSTELLO is never the threatener.
          His demeanor is gentle, philosophical. Almost a shrink's
          probing bedside manner. He has great interest in the world
          as he moves through it. As if he originally came from a
          different world and his survival in this one depends on close
          continual observation and analysis.
          
          YOUNG COLIN looks up. CLOSE ON his eyes. He is fourteen or
          fifteen, but small for his age. Bookish.
          
          COSTELLO eyes the proprietor's TEENAGE DAUGHTER, working
          behind the counter. He takes a propane lighter, and,
          strangely, pays for it (the proprietor startled) and waits
          for change. He lights a MORE cigarette with the lighter.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO
                       Carmen's developing into a fine
                       young lady. You should be proud.
                       You get your period yet, Carmen?
          
          The PROPRIETOR is uneasy. COSTELLO turns to YOUNG COLIN
          (about 14) staring at the local hero. Costello reaches up
          above and behind the counter and takes down some cigarettes.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                       You Johnny Sullivan's kid?
          
          COLIN nods.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                       You live with your grandmother?
          
          COLIN nods.
          
                                 YOUNG COLIN
                       Yeah.
          
          COSTELLO tells the Proprietor to takes three loaves of bread
          and some soup off the shelves and puts them in Colin's bag.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Get him three loaves of bread. And
                       a couple of half gallons of milk.
                       And some soup.
          
          He goes over to the fridge and puts two half gallons of milk
          in the bag. Some soup. Costello turns to Colin.
          
          
          
                                                                 (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                     3.
          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          
                              COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                    Do you like comic books?
          
          Colin nods.   He adds a couple of comic books.
          
          When the PROPRIETOR looks at him, he takes out the money he
          put in his pocket and gives back half.
          
                              YOUNG COSTELLO
                    You do good in school?
          
          YOUNG COLIN nods, holding the big bag of loot.
          
                                 COLIN
                    Yes.
          
                              YOUNG COSTELLO
                    That's good. I did good in school.
                    They call that a paradox.
          
          He gives some money to Carmen.
          
                              YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                    Buy yourself some makeup. Keep the
                    change.
          
          Looks intently at COLIN to see if he gets it.    Colin does.
          
                              YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                    You ever want to earn a little
                    extra money, you come by L street.
                    You know where I am on L street.
          
          COLIN nods: everybody does.
          
                                 YOUNG COLIN
                    Thank you.
          
          He pushes out with the bags of groceries.
          
          The PROPRIETOR can do shit about it.
          
          YOUNG COSTELLO watches YOUNG COLIN go off down a slummy
          street.
          
          INT. A CHURCH. MORNING. 1985-ISH
          
          YOUNG COLIN, the good boy, the very good boy, is serving at a
          funeral Mass. Various views of the church. Stained-glass
          light. The altar is still wreathed in the smoke of incense.

                       To you, O Lord we commend the soul
                       of Alphonsus, your Servant; in the
                       sight of this world he is now dead;
                       in your sight may he live forever.
                       Forgive whatever sins he committed
                       through human weakness and in your
                       goodness grant him everlasting
                       peace.

                       Amen.
          
          CLOSE on COLIN'S face.

                       May the angels lead you into
                       paradise; May the martyrs come to
                       welcome you and take you to the
                       holy city, The new and eternal
                       Jerusalem.

          INT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY
          
          COSTELLO is talking informally (we realize that this is a
          continuation of the philosophical talk, the shadowy pacing).
          YOUNG KIDS. Useful young men. YOUNG COLIN, three years older,
          is among them.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO
                       Church wants you in your place.
                       What sort of man wants to be kept
                       in his place? Do this don't do
                       that, kneel, stand, kneel,
                       stand...I mean if you go for that
                       sort of thing...
          
          YOUNG COLIN, the recent altar boy, visibly doesn't go for
          that sort of thing.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                       I don't know what to do for you. A
                       man makes his own way. No one gives
                       it to you. You have to take it.

          has just been executed.

                       You decide to be something, you can

                       When I was your age, they would
                       say, we become cops or criminals.
                       Today, what I'm saying to you is
                       this: When you are facing a loaded

                    The slug enters the skull by
                    forming a small entrance hole.
                    Blood and brain matter is ejected
                    backwards from this hole. The
                    bullet, which may expand, fragment

          POLICE TRAINEES ON A FIRING RANGE. As we go along the line we
          see COLIN, firing dry and then speed-changing a clip in a
          BERETTA 92F. He is a perfect trainee.

          rough game. The game breaks up with each group giving each
          other the finger. FIREFIGHTERS are moving away triumphantly.
          
                              COLIN
                    Fucking firemen are getting pussy
                    for the first time in the history
                    of fire. Or pussy.
          
          COLIN sits on a bench looking at THE GOLD DOME OF BEACON
          HILL. The terraces of fine townhouses. Aqueous golden light
          behind. Misty golden beauty.

                       What are you looking at? Forget
                       it. Your father was a janitor, and
                       his son's only a cop.
          
                                 COLIN
                           (not vainglorious, but
                            innocently stretching for
                            the idea)
                       You're in trouble if you're "only"
                       anything.
          
                                 BARRIGAN
                       Don't tell me I'm looking at the
                       first dickhead-American president
                       of the United States.
          
          COLIN doesn't have a great sense of humor but he knows how to
          pretend that he does. He smiles.
          
          EXT. STATE POLICE GRADUATION CEREMONY. DAY
          
          Bagpipes and bullshit. Flags cracking. Line after line of
          paramilitary-looking graduates, among them COLIN.
          
                                 SPEAKER (V.O.)
                       The Massachusetts State Police has
                       a long tradition of excellence.
                       Your graduation today solidifies
                       your acceptance into one of the
                       finest law enforcement agencies in
                       our nation. As the Governor of the
                       Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I am
                       confident each and every one of you
                       will serve with distinction, honor
                       and integrity.
          
          CAMERA swirls around COLIN as he moves, a lone person,
          through the breaking up crowd. Other graduates are hugged by
          family. COLIN, alone, comes to the gates of the yard.
          
                                 THE MAYOR VO
                       Congratulations. You are dismissed.

          COLIN walks over to the car. COSTELLO gives COLIN a BOX.
          COLIN flips open the top and then quickly closes it. NOTE:
          The box could contain an eyeball, money, drugs, a picture of
          Colin fucking his school teacher...we will never know.

          TITLE: FOUR YEARS LATER
          
          A test is reversed on a desk lit with fluorescents. BILLY
          takes up a Number Two pencil. He is in a room full of
          trainees, far enough along in their traineeship that their
          hair has grown in.
          
          A CLOCK TICKS, sweep hand coming around.
          
          BILLY'S EYES on it.

                       Begin.
          
          BILLY takes the test, marking multiple choice answers swiftly
          while all around him trainees are sweating and still trying
          to read the questions.
          
          EXT. A TRACK. DAY
          
          BILLY, wearing a State Police sweatshirt is running,

                       You finish the police course you
                       get taken care of again baby.

                       Ways to get ahead, though, man,
                       ways to get ahead.

                       To where. (Yeah)
          
          BROWN is left thinking about this.

                       This is not the regular police.
                       This is the state police. Your
                       training will illustrate the
                       difference. What's the difference?

                       Sir, I was agreeing with you about
                       our obvious superiority to other
                       forms of police, sir.
          
                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR
                       We're not superior, we're the best.

          COLIN, four years a veteran of the gang unit, is on the job,
          on a raid, clearing rooms, part of a team working with
          massive aggression. He moves through a door. A SAD SACK OF
          SHIT is throwing drugs out a window.
          
                               COLIN

                    Douchebag!
          
          COPS enter past Colin and pigpile the man. COLIN is chewing
          gum, all testosterone and aggression, glad to be a cop. The
          smartest guy in the room.

          BILLY fires, and changes clips.
          
          EXT. A STREET IN BOSTON. DAY
          
          A BLACK-WINDOWED, MODERN, POLICE BUILDING, beetling over a
          plaza. Older Boston reflected in the featureless glass. The
          Boston of this film is almost futuristic. COLIN looks up at
          the building with great intensity. He puts on his sunglasses
          and walks towards the door.
          
          INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          COLIN, in civvies (a very good suit), stands at suave

                    We won't be working directly
                    together, you'll be working for
                    Captain Ellerby, but I like to see

          As COLIN leaves the office, looking very satisfied and not a
          little saturnine (it's not as if he isn't pleased by
          recognition and it's not as if he won't get revenge on
          Dignam), he barely glances--and does not actually see--the
          TRAINEE sitting off to one side. He sees polished brogues,
          and walks on.

                                 COLIN
                       Thanks, hon.
          
          As COLIN leaves she moderates her expression and:

          BILLY looks up. He has not seen COLIN, and COLIN has not seen
          him. He has his interview on his mind.

          BILLY has no idea why he is in this room with the brass.
          Sgt. Dignam is staring at him aggressively, with contempt,
          stirring his coffee. DIGNAM is more intelligent than he
          seems.

                       and leave it there. No idea. Zip,
                       none. If you had an idea about what
                       we do we would not be good at what
                       we do. We would be cunts. Are you
                       calling us cunts?
          
          BILLY wouldn't normally take crap from this guy; but he does.
          He's openly intrigued by the situation. Dignam is staring at

                       We have a question. You want to be
                       a cop, or do you want to appear to
                       be a cop. It's an honest question.

          A TROLLEY goes past. HOSPITAL HILL, above the trolley line,
          is sinister, quiet. HOSPITAL at the top like a malign
          fortress, above rows of endlessly repeated condominiums.
          BILLY CROSSES from the Trolley stop, desperately, an angry
          young man at his life's turning point.
          
          INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM. LATER
          
          BILLY'S MOTHER lies as if floating in her bed. Tubes, lights.
          A bald head on a barely-dented pillow. She is a cancer
          patient in a coma, weighing possibly 80 lbs. Gasping for air.
          Her airways are cleared with a suction tube. BILLY sits
          watching as the tube goes in. BILLY sits looking at her.
          
          EXT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATER
          
          BILLY is leaning against a wall. A maternal WASP UNCLE, a not-
          bright guy (pretensions, rather than status), speaks briefly
          to a DOCTOR further along the hall, then approaches BILLY,
          hands in the pocket of a good suit.
          
                              WASP UNCLE
                    What's this I hear from Stephanie

                       "Is my wife a money-grubbing
                       whore?" Those are questions.

                       During the war, Churchill used
                       river mines. He'd float them down
                       the rivers into Germany. They'd
                       either hit something, or not.
                       That's what we'll use you for. I'll
                       float you down the river. The rest
                       will happen. Or it won't...

                                                                  23.
          
          
          
          EXT. CEMETERY. DAY
          
          Priest's cassock whipping in the wind. A few mourners (shabby
          genteel ladies, contemporaries of his mother), but Billy
          seems to have no real connection with any of them.
          
          LATER
          
          BILLY is alone at the grave. He looks at the tags on wind-
          blown wreaths. One gives him pause. Under a picture of The
          Virgin it reads: "Heaven holds the Faithful Departed" and is
          signed: "F. Costello".
          
          INT. JAIL HOLDING TANK. DAY
          
          A CELL DOOR CLOSES. On Billy. Looking like a real criminal.
          Not a pretend one. Frightened and resolute at once. BILLY is
          in a holding tank.
          
          EXT. THE BALCONY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. MORNING
          
          COLIN, in a bathrobe, leans on the rail and looks at Boston.
          THE GOLD DOME visible. Colin drinks coffee. Not satisfied:
          worried.
          
          INT. A PROCESSING FACILITY. DAY
          
          BILLY, naked, holds his clothes in a bundle. Being processed
          out of jail. Beside him another guy, furtive, gruff, not
          trying to be friendly.

                    Who wants to know?

                              OTHER PRISONER
                    Connected but not too bright--
                        (BILLY looks at him with
                         an only-I-can-insult-my-
                         cousin look)
                    No offense.
          
          Billy gets his clothes.
          
                                                                  24.

          primary guys...MISTER FRENCH, DELAHUNT, FITZY. COLIN and
          others sitting listening. COLIN, reading a paper (Boston
          Herald) which may or may not have the headline, CASE DROPPED
          AGAINST DRUGS CADET (featuring a picture of Billy), looks up
          as SGT. DIGNAM comes in.

                    They're like the fuckin' Indians.
                    You're not gonna see them. You're
                    not gonna hear about them except
                    through me or Captain Queenan. You
                    will not, ever, know the identity
                    of undercover people. This shit

                       Somebody, as you may already know,
                       stole one hundred microprocessors
                       from the Mass Processor Corp out
                       Route 128. They're the kind of
                       processors they put into computers
                       that can put a cruise missile up
                       the ass of a camel from the other
                       side of the planet. That's what
                       they do out there on "America's
                       Technology Highway". Worth a
                       hundred grand apiece. Guy worked
                       for the company two months walked
                       out the door with a box of
                       processors on Tuesday, has a ticket
                       booked for Florida on Wednesday,
                       but on Thursday he gets found in a
                       dumpster. You know where this dirt

          His aunt takes her cigarette out of her mouth and then
          embraces him fiercely. BILLY takes it like the imposter he
          is. But he might well love his aunt.

                    I don't have ten thousand dollars.
                    As a matter of fact I have never
                    had ten thousand dollars.
          
                              BILLY
                    That's what I'm saying.
          
          Sean nods, and nods.
          
                              SEAN
                    You know what we usually say at
                    these moments.

                       You fuckin' moron. What are you
                       talking about? I'm not a cop. I'm
                       your cousin.
          
          INT. BILLY'S CAR. NIGHT
          
          BILLY is waiting. Sean comes out of a squalid looking house
          and gets into a car. Fast. Billy puts the car in gear.
          
                                 SEAN
                       Fuckin' Ricans think they know
                       everything. If they knew shit they
                       wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.
          
          He has a paper bag full of money. He opens a beer.
          
                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                           (high as a kite)
                       Double the money, double the fun.

                       for Ricans...P is for pigs...
          
          They drive past a BPD cruiser. Sean hides his beer.
          
                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                       I can't stop drinkin.
          
          BILLY laughs.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Why would you even think of
                       stopping drinking?
          
                                  SEAN
                       He don't like it. He don't like
                       drinkin...he don't like fightin...
                           (Sean looks sad)
                       ...he says stay out of the bars...
                       You know, we're not even supposed
                       to do this on this side of fuckin'
                       Worcester.

                       He says. Costello says. God says,
                       as far as you're concerned.

          INT. A HORRIBLE BAR IN SOUTHIE. NIGHT
          
          Sean, beyond wasted, is talking to some people, including
          MISTER FRENCH. A table wet with spilled beer.
          
                              SEAN
                    Not a cop. He got out of the joint
                    three weeks ago. Dead up. He talks
                    like his shit don't stink but he's
                    good people.

                              MISTER FRENCH
                    I knew his father. I liked his
                    uncle Jackie better.
          
                              SEAN
                    Uncle Jackie was excellent.
          
                              AN IRISH VILLAIN
                    Fucking guineas.
          
          They solemnly toast uncle Jackie and his fate among the
          fucking guineas. Across the crowded room, BILLY is ordering
          at the bar.
          
                              BILLY
                    A cranberry juice.
          
                              WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG AT BAR
                    It's a natural diuretic. My
                    girlfriend drinks it when she got
                    her period.
                        (to BILLY)
                    You got your period?
          
          BILLY glances over at the table where MISTER FRENCH sits with
          SEAN, and then smashes his glass into the face of the WELL
          DRESSED SCUMBAG. He stands waiting for the SCUMBAG to get up
          he is grabbed and shoved against the wall by MISTER FRENCH.
          Popped into a pay phone hard. The pay phone comes off the
          hook.
          
                              BILLY
                    Get your hands off me.
          
                              MISTER FRENCH
                    Do you know me?

          BILLY shakes his head no.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       I'm the guy who tells you there are
                       guys you hit and there are guys you
                       don't. That's not quite a guy you
                       can't hit, but it's almost a guy
                       you can't hit, so I'm fucking
                       ruling on it right now that you
                       don't hit him, understand?
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah. Excellent. Fine.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       I know you. I know your family.
                       Also I know you do another drug

                                 BILLY
                       Yeah.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       Now you know me.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah.
          
          A beat: they stare at each other.

          COLIN and BARRIGAN (who Colin has moved to plain clothes)
          stand at the door, talking, or trying to talk, with a fearful
          MRS KENNEFICK. MRS KENNEFICK looks like she starts drinking
          whiskey at 9 in the morning.
          
                              COLIN
                    Mrs. Kennefick, Myles and I were in
                    school together. Myles was behind
                    me in school but I knew him. I will
                    get those responsible. Don't you
                    want to see us catch whoever used
                    him to do a robbery and then killed
                    him?
          
                                 MRS KENNEFICK

                    If he was killed he probably did
                    something wrong.

          She slams the door. As COLIN walks away from the door he
          notices the TAIL: a maroon sedan and a damaged white delivery
          van.

          COLIN boards with a bunch of other cops and workers. On
          board, directly beside him, is MADOLYN. COLIN's age,
          beautiful, wearing a business suit. She has a thick stack of
          medical-looking files. She's a psychiatrist on contract to
          the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She does probation
          counselling work with "violent offenders" and also sees

                       who you are.
          
          MADOLYN nods, and then because this is a (relatively)
          sensitive subject ignores COLIN, but she is visibly attracted
          by him.

                       No. Oh, I know how it goes. You're
                       a mental health professional.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                           (laughing)
                       I have an appointment on this
                       floor.
          
          The door opens.
          
                                 COLIN
                       That's good. They're all fuckin'
                       crazy on that floor.
                           (points up)
                       I'm one floor up.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Oh, fancy policeman.
          
                                 COLIN
                       That's right. Fancy.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Are you a Statie?
          
          After she steps out he prevents the door from closing.

                    degree.

                              COLIN
                    They don't run Harvard Law at
                    night, last time I checked.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    When was the last time you checked?
          
                              COLIN
                    Before I went to fucking Suffolk.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    I went to U Mass. I wasn't
                    insulting you.
          
                              COLIN
                    Well I thought you were, and for
                    that you have to take me to dinner.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Maybe you could shoot someone and
                    I'd have to see you professionally.
          
                              COLIN
                    Whatever it takes. I'll stab
                    someone in the heart with an
                    icepick right now if it gets me
                    dinner with you.
          
          MADOLYN hands him a card.
          
                               COLIN (CONT'D)
                    I don't need a card, I'm a
                    detective.
          
          She hesitates. He takes the card.
          
                              COLIN (CONT'D)
                    I'm only joking. Nice to meet
                    you... "Madolyn".
          
          The doors close. The elevator takes him up. He takes out his
          cellphone as if he's forgotten something. As the doors open,
          the signal bars light up, and the phone rings.

                    I didn't know about your tail until
                    I saw it myself. I couldn't call, I
                    had the other guy with me. Blue
                    sedan and a white delivery van,
                    fucked up with graffiti on the
                    side. The van is audio
                    surveillance. OK, have a nice day.
          
          INT. A COFFEE SHOP IN SOUTHIE. MORNING
          
          The same shop in which YOUNG COSTELLO talked to YOUNG COLIN,
          all those years ago. Two ITALIANS are in the shop, talking
          hard to the Pakistani PROPRIETOR (SINGH). These are hard guys
          but they're not being threatening, just persistent: the guy
          DOES owe them money. BILLY is finishing his breakfast.
          Watching. He goes over. The two GUINEAS are amazed. [Dialog
          on separate document].
          
          Billy is finishing his breakfast. Watching. He goes over....
          
                              BILLY
                    You guys from Providence?
          
          The GUINEAS look at him. The younger one moves to intervene.
          BILLY smiles and destroys them both. Maniacal violence. The
          biggest beatdown in gangster movie history--and obviously
          that's saying something. In the course of the beat-down Billy
          breaks his left hand--a "boxer's fracture". BILLY stands over
          his victims, breathing hard, holding his broken hand.
          
                              PROPRIETOR
                    What have you done to my place! Get
                    out of here.
          
          BILLY goes.
          
          INT. EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT
          
          BILLY, unlit cigarette in his mouth, is having his hand
          wrapped in plaster by a lady doctor. In another life he might
          have dated her. Not in this one.
          
          INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT. NIGHT
          
          A romantic restaurant. The best Boston has (which isn't
          saying much, but whatever). COLIN, looking great, a man on
          the rise. MADOLYN in pearls, also looking great. But maybe
          the conversation has lapsed and the date gone south.

                                 MADOLYN
                       That's right. I see "violent
                       offenders".
          
                                   COLIN
                       Bad guys.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       That's one way to look at it.   Not
                       necessarily.
          
          COLIN wonders if she's breaking his balls. A DESSERT arrives:
          some towering Japanesey concoction with a fan of sugar candy
          spines, sitting in a pool of sauce. COLIN looks at it, fork
          poised. MADOLYN looks at it. He looks up at her.
          
                                 COLIN
                       That have this and they don't have
                       duck l'orange.
          
          MADOLYN smiles: she likes him. Even with the dinner-long
          bitterness over the duck l'orange.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Was your dinner OK?
          
                                 COLIN
                           (holding balloon of
                            inappropriate wine)
                       Oh, the lobster was excellent. I
                       just thought, French restaurant...
          
          The look at the dessert.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I'm waiting for you to make your
                       move.
          
                                 COLIN
                       I don't know what you're gonna do,
                       but if it moves I'm going to arrest
                       it (shoot it).
          
          MADOLYN laughs.    COLIN sees his shot: he's got her laughing.

                    What's it like having people "find
                    themselves?" All day long people
                    "finding themselves." Does it get
                    messy with all those feelings
                    flying around the room?
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Why, does that make you
                    uncomfortable?
          
          Colin stares at her.    Water glass nearly goes over.
          
                              MADOLYN (CONT'D)
                    You know what Freud said about the
                    Irish?
          
                                 COLIN
                    Yes I do.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    If you actually do I'll see you
                    again.

                        (concerned, perhaps
                         unexpectedly)
                    Don't you?
          
                              COLIN
                    Yes, course I do.
                        (a beat)
                    What Freud said about the Irish is
                    We're the only people impervious to
                    psychoanalysis.
          
          MADOLYN is impressed.
          
                              COLIN (CONT'D)
                    Tough luck for you with a client
                    list of Mick cops, isn't it.
                    "Opening up"? Good luck to you.

          INT. A HORRIBLE BAR IN SOUTHIE. NIGHT
          
          A slow night. BILLY IS AT THE BAR bent over a glass of
          cranberry juice. The women available are two CRONES. [Dialog
          on separate document]. Stark contrast to COLIN'S EVENING. A
          BOOKMAKER on the phone. BILLY, by the glances of people
          looking at him, has made his bones. He's treated with
          respect. His hand and wrist in a cast. Out of nowhere (though
          Billy is aware conversation has stopped he does not look
          around)...
          
          COSTELLO sits down beside him AT THE BAR.
          
          BILLY observes:
          
          MISTER FRENCH sitting down at a far table. Watching. Covering
          the room.
          
          COSTELLO is brought a glass of water by the silent bartender.
          No sound whatsoever in the bar.

          They say nothing, look at each other. BILLY notices DELAHUNT
          and FITZY, entering. They stand by MISTER FRENCH.
          
          BILLY sits motionless.

          BILLY does: but shakes his head.
          
                                 BILLY
                       No.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       You met my friend, Mister French
                       the other night.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Is his real name Mister French?
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       No.
                            (a beat)
                       Come with me.
                            (As BILLY hesitates)
                       I'm not the cops. I'm not askin'
                       you.
          
          BILLY stands up. MISTER FRENCH stands up. BILLY, COSTELLO,
          and MISTER FRENCH move towards the back room. As they walk to
          the back room of the bar, we hear COSTELLO:
          
                                 COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                       You know something, they just do
                       not stop having the Mafia in
                       Providence, and this can cause
                       problems for me.

                       Those guys you tuned up are
                       connected down Providence. What
                       they're going to do is come back up
                       with some guys and kill you.
                       Which, sure as you're born, they
                       will do unless I stop them. Do you
                       want me to stop them?
          
                                 BILLY
                       Is it something I can't do
                       personally?

          COSTELLO appreciates the balls of this. He looks at Mister
          French. Then back at Billy, smiling.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I'm going to have my associate
                       search you.
          
          BILLY tenses. Exactly as he might if he were wearing a wire.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Search me? Search me for what?
          
          MISTER FRENCH and COSTELLO look at each other.
          
                                    MISTER FRENCH
                       C'm here.

                       Contra-fucking-band.    Take your
                       fuckin' shoes off.
          
                                    MISTER FRENCH
                       Shoes off.
          
          BILLY slips out of them. MISTER FRENCH inspects the shoes.
          COSTELLO'S cold eyes are on BILLY. MISTER FRENCH searches
          BILLY. Looks into his wallet. The wallet is emptied onto a
          table.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I knew your father.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah. He's dead.
          
                                    COSTELLO
                       I'm sorry.     How did he go?
          
                                 BILLY
                       He didn't complain.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       That was his problem.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Who said he had a fuckin' problem.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I just said he had a fuckin'
                       problem. There's a man could have
                       been anything.

                              COSTELLO
                    I'm saying he worked at the
                    airport.
          
          COSTELLO turns to MISTER FRENCH.
          
                              MISTER FRENCH
                    He's clean.
          
                               COSTELLO
                    The arm.
          
          With amazing violence MISTER FRENCH smashes the cast on the
          corner of a table. Billy drops to his knees in tears of pain.
          MISTER FRENCH sorts through the pieces of the cast. Ad libs:
          "such a fuckin' pussy."
          
                              COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                        (holding Billy by the
                         collar)
                    It makes me curious to see you in
                    this neighborhood. Regressing.
                    And, if I can slander my own
                    formative environment, it makes me
                    sad, this regressing. Plus, I don't
                    know if it's beyond some cop prick
                    like fucking Queenan to pull you
                    out of the Staties, and send you
                    after me. I just can't know. I
                    don't know what they do in...that
                    department, anyway.
          
          He grabs Billy's broken right hand.
          
                              COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                    Are you still a cop?
          
                               BILLY
                    No.
          
          COSTELLO twists Billy's broken hand.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    You swear on your mother's grave

                    Yes!
          
          COSTELLO lets go of Billy's hand. Billy is weeping on the

                    Take it easy. Get your hand taken
                    care of. I'm sorry. It was

                       Hi, Captain. And our primary
                       target is obviously Frank Costello.
                       But we don't communicate with
                       anyone else in this shop. Queenan
                       is compartmentalizing everything in
                       SIU. It's the right thing to do,
                       personally I don't trust these
                       fucking troopers either. We think
                       we might have a problem. We think
                       Costello's got a rat in the State
                       Police.

                       No. Ah...not presently. Not
                       presently. But I'm hoping to get

                       That's the spirit.
          
          EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE BOOKIE SHOP. LATER
          
          BILLY and MISTER FRENCH emerge.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       Very interesting.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah, well. Fuck.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       Don't worry about it. Guy didn't
                       need need his teeth anyway. Maybe
                       if he was an Eskimo. But in this
                       country we eat a variety of items.
          
          They get into COSTELLO'S CAR. Billy in the front seat. Mister
          French in the back.

                       He knocked Jimmy Bags teeth out.
          
          COSTELLO does an Edgar Kennedy.
          
                                   COSTELLO
                       So?
          
                                   BILLY
                       He was...

                                 BILLY
                       Okay! You gonna give me shit, it
                       wasn't no reason----he put his hand
                       in his coat! I don't know if he's a
                       bookie or what the fuck he's
                       doing...

                       Well, you know what the fuck a
                       bookie does?

                                 COSTELLO
                       Bingo. Anyway, I like a guy who
                       goes around knocking guys teeth out
                       for no reason.
          
          He takes out a cell phone and hands it to BILLY.

                       Here. From now on call the bar and
                       ask for Mikey. Just Mikey. You ask
                       for Mikey because there's no Mikey.
                       Wait. We'll call.

                       this phone first rings, you take
                       the fucking chip out - like so -
                       and you fucking destroy it. After
                       three days a phone ain't clean. If
                       you use a phone which is not clean,
                       you will have a accident. You never
                       call us. We call you. You got that?
          
                                   BILLY
                       I got it.

          INT. A HARBOR RESTAURANT. BOSTON. DAY
          
          A lobster-bib kind of place. DAYTIME DRINKERS, MICKS in bad
          boat shoes, hyper-aware of... COSTELLO and BILLY in a back
          table. COSTELLO, having finished his lunch, is drawing. Billy
          is unused to being the subject of so many stares. He has sort
          of a coked-out nervousness, dirty hair.
          
                              BILLY
                    Don't look. There's a white van
                    across the parking lot?
          
          WE see it through the smeared glass: the WHITE VAN we always
          see. This time with a different magnetic business sign.
          
                              COSTELLO

                         his sketch)
                    They don't have directional
                    microphones.
          
                              BILLY
                    What, do you got x-ray vision?
          
                              COSTELLO
                        (not taking his eyes off
                         his sketch)
                    They don't have directional
                    microphones.
          
          BILLY registers what seems to be inside information.
          COSTELLO looks over his half-glasses at Billy's untouched
          food. COSTELLO is sizing Billy up: has been thinking about
          him.

                    People looking at you make you self-
                    conscious?
          
          BILLY shrugs. Indicating: Yeah, well, who the fuck wouldn't
          be.
          
                              BILLY
                    I don't know.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Why? They're minuses. They can't
                    tell the difference between a rock
                    star and a career criminal.
          
                              BILLY
                    Anyone not a criminal is a minus?

                       I said. Eat something, Jesus
                       Christ, we got a nice day by the
                       water. Sun's shining, gulls are

          TWO PRIESTS and a NUN are sitting two tables over. An older
          priest and a younger one. COSTELLO notices. THE NUN gets up
          and leaves.
          
                                 COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                       You know if your father were alive
                       and saw you, sitting here with me,
                       let's say he would have a word with
                       me about this, in fact, he'd kill
                       seven guys just to cut my throat.
                       And he could do it, which is
                       something you may not know about
                       William Costigan, Sr.

                                 COSTELLO
                       He kept his own counsel. He never
                       wanted money. You can't do a thing
                       with a man like that. Your uncle
                       Jackie needed a lot of money. But
                       even though he got his money from
                       me, he also would kill my entire
                       fucking family if he saw me here
                       with you. And I think about this.
          
                                 BILLY
                       So what are talking about here?
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Fact is you're not a guy fresh from
                       the zoo who wants to run a spring
                       water distributor and I don't see
                       you up the dog track as a general
                       manager.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Look at it this way. It's like a
                       tuba. I want to see if I can get
                       something out of it.
          
          COSTELLO smiles at this, then looks at his sketch.

                              COSTELLO
                    Well that's your problem. Maybe
                    someday you'll wake the fuck up.
          
          He gets up and leaves the table, leaving BILLY sitting there.
          COSTELLO stops to speak to the priests.

                    morning.
          
          The OLDER PRIEST is very nervous, looking around. The YOUNGER
          PRIEST concerned for his elder but personally not implicated.
          COSTELLO leans over the OLDER PRIEST, a pathetic man.

                    "I am as God made me", was that
                    what you said? May I remind you,

                    that pride comes before the fall.

                    "Progress" is hard to define. I
                    make progress every day. In fact,

                    guys in this department make
                    excellent progress for twenty years
                    without ever getting anything you
                    could definitively call a result.
                    It's like any American industry.
                    Nobody minds if you don't succeed
                    as long as you don't fuck up.

                              COLIN
                    He had a heart attack in jail and
                    got knifed in his bed at Boston
                    City Hospital. I believe it's been
                    in the papers.
          
          ELLERBY stares at COLIN.

                       Are you happy with this result?
          
                                 COLIN
                       It's a result.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Cui gives a shit. It's got a bow on
                       it.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                           (with true appreciation)
                       I think you are a cop, my son.
          
          He drops his face into the bowl of ice water.
          
          INT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT. MORNING
          
          A stripped HOSPITAL BED stands in a fall of light. This is
          the apartment where his mother became ill. Billy has packed
          half of his mother's things into boxes--and then stopped.
          Billy doesn't use the bedroom. He sleeps on the couch among
          boxes of pictures, papers, teacups wrapped in newspaper.
          BILLY is sitting on the couch. He reaches into a box and lays
          out photographs like cards. Scenes from his life. His former
          life. His family life, his life as a child, his romantic
          life. He sits and stares at the pictures. He rearranges the
          photographs in different ways.
          
          NOTE: THIS IS A MEMORY BILLY HAS AS HE IS LOOKING AT
          PHOTOGRAPHS ON HIS MOTHER'S APARTMENT.
          
          FRENCH and BILLY break in, surprising the MAN (BRIAN), seated
          at his dining room table. He throws a child's toy at them.
          FRENCH ducks out of the way and the toy hits BILLY in the
          cheek.
          
          FRENCH draws his pistol and approaches the table. BRIAN
          rises and starts to flee. Cut off, he retreats the other
          way.
          
                                 BRIAN
                       No, please...
          
                                 FRENCH
                       Brian, stop it, I ain't gonna hurt
                       you.

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          He fires, using a soda bottle as a silencer. BRIAN drops to
          the floor. FRENCH approaches him assessing his victim.
          
          He turns to leave, passing BILLY.     He give him a slap.
          
                                 FRENCH (CONT'D)
                       Wake the fuck up.
          
          They leave.
          
          EXT. A BEACH NEAR A POWERPLANT. DAY
          
          BILLY leans against the wall of a concession stand. His
          knuckles are cut. A cut over his eye. He is agitated.
          Smoking. A car pulls up and Queenan and Dignam get out of it.
          In appearance, if anybody's watching, they're bracing Billy.
          
                                  QUEENAN
                       Hey.   Let's go through the routine.
          
                                 DIGNAM
                       You think you can pop someone.
                       There's no special card to play.
                       The guy whose jaw you broke was
                       Boston Police Department.
          
                                 BILLY
                       I'm going fuckin' nuts. I can't be
                       someone else every day.
          
                                 DIGNAM
                       Most of the people in the world do
                       it every day. What's the big deal?
          
          Dignam is drinking coffee.
          
                                 BILLY
                       I'm not them.
          
                                 DIGNAM
                       You're nobody. You signed the
                       paper. We're the only people in
                       the world who know that you're a
                       cop. Maybe we'll just erase your
                       file.
          
          This is Billy's deepest fear.

                       And zip, you're a soldier for
                       Costello, open to arrest for how
                       many felonies? Maybe we'll do
                       that.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Maybe I'll fucking kill you.
          
          He gets free of DIGNAM and punches him.
          
                                   QUEENAN
                       Easy now.    That was a joke, Billy.
          
                                 DIGNAM
                       Just because you play a fucking
                       tough guy doesn't mean you are one,
                       you lace curtain fucking pussy.
          
          The fight. QUEENAN grabs Billy and holds him against the
          wall.
          
                                  QUEENAN

                             calming a wild animal)
                       Be smart. If someone was watching
                       how are we supposed to not arrest
                       you?
          
          BILLY looks desperately inland.
          
          REVERE BEACH condominium buildings. A thousand empty
          terraces, five thousand empty windows. BILLY is desperate.
          
                                 QUEENAN (CONT'D)
                       Get in the car.

                       Keep your act together. It's just a
                       little while longer.
          
          BILLY nods, out of it. DIGNAM is looking at blood on his
          hands in disbelief.
          
                                 BILLY
                       When are you going to take
                       Costello? What's wrong with taking
                       'em on any one of the million
                       felonies you've seen him do. Get

                    You shut up. We're building a

                              BILLY
                    There's something wrong.
          
                              QUEENAN

                    You hear anything like that?
          
          BILLY shakes his head.

          COLIN walks into the office. BROWN and other team members are
          watching a closed-circuit monitor. The MONITOR shows FITZY
          sitting in an interrogation room. COLIN is spooked.

                    Uniform clipped him on the Pike for
                    a suspended licence. However, as
                    he's the subject of an open
                    investigation----
          
                              COLIN
                    At least one. He's one of
                    Costello's crew.
          
                                BROWN
                    ----we're entitled to get a warrant.
                    We can't get an address off him.
                    He paged his lawyer but the lawyer
                    hasn't called back yet.
          
                              COLIN
                    Who's the lawyer?
          
                              BROWN
                    He didn't know the name. He just
                    had the number on a card. Beeper
                    number.
          
                              COLIN

                    All right.
          
          COLIN glances around and sees: a briefcase lying on a desk.
          He picks it up. He takes off his ID badge and tosses it on a
          desk.

                       I'm gonna take this.
          
          He picks up a BRIEFCASE. BARRIGAN touches two buttons and
          switches off the sound recorder and video feed. COLIN goes
          into the interrogation room.

                       Mr. Fitzgibbon, afternoon.
          
                                 FITZY
                       You my attorney?
          
                                 COLIN
                       What do you think? Did you make
                       any statements or phone calls I
                       need to be aware of?
          
                                 FITZY
                       I beeped you. The card they gave
                       me...that's it.
          
                                 COLIN
                       That's it? Don't you have to call
                       your mother and tell her you're not
                       gonna be home for supper?
          
          ON FITZY. He looks up at the CCTV camera.

                            table)
                       Call your mother.
          
          Fitzy hesitates.
          
                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                       Lookit. They're in there suiting
                       up for a raid. I don't know where
                       they are going, but they do. And
                       so do you. Call your mum.
          
          COLIN puts a cellphone on the table. FITZY takes up the phone
          and punches in a number. It is answered.
          
                                 FITZY
                       Mum, I'm not gonna make it for
                       supper. I got held up. Yeah, talk
                       to you later.

          The DRUGS are swept up instantly, in sheets laid over the
          tables. MISTER FRENCH lights a cigarette with his ZIPPO, and
          then reaches out and lights the curtains on fire as BILLY
          watches.

          COLIN, hung-over, sits at the breakfast table.     Madolyn looks

          COLIN doesn't respond.
          
                                 MADOLYN (CONT'D)
                       It's all right. Guys tend to make
                       a big deal out of it. It's
                       actually quite common.
          
                                 COLIN
                       I gotta go to work.
          
          COLIN simply gets up and walks away.

          A clock ticking. Madolyn is looking across at ...Billy.
          Madolyn is very much a guarded shrink. But no one's more
          guarded than Billy.
          
                                 BILLY
                       It's like confession. Isn't it.

                       People make things up in
                       confession. You know that?
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I know they do.
          
                                 BILLY
                       People are liars. They want to be
                       stars of their little films.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       That's an interesting observation.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Do you lie?
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Why do you?
          
                                 BILLY
                       I'm asking if you lie.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Honesty isn't synonymous with
                       truth.
          
                                 BILLY
                       You lie. So, is it to do some good,
                       to get somewhere personally, or
                       just for the fuck of it?
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I expect sometimes...people...do it
                       to keep things...on an even keel.

                    There was a cop leaving when I came

                              MADOLYN

                    Bad haircut, no dress sense and a
                    slight air of scumbag entitlement.
                    You see cops?
          
                              MADOLYN
                    That's part of what I do. Although,
                    I don't normally see cadets who
                    were kicked out of the Academy.

                    You should get a better job...

                              MADOLYN
                    Sometimes they cry if they had
                    trouble at home or if they've had
                    to...use their weapons.
          
                              BILLY
                    Let me tell you something. They
                    signed up to use their fuckin'
                    weapons. Most of them. But they
                    watch enough TV so they know they
                    have to "weep" after they use their
                    weapons. No one's more full of shit
                    than a cop. Except a cop on TV.

                    Is this true?
          
                              BILLY
                    Yes. I said something true. I want
                    some fucking pills and you close my
                    file? I thought I was supposed to
                    tell the truth here.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Yes, you are.

          She retrieves his folder.

                        (giving into stress)
                    Guy comes in in pain, against every
                    instinct of ...privacy, of, of,
                    self reliance... that he has, and
                    you don't help him? You send him
                    off to score smack on the fucking
                    street?! (Is that what you do, Mrs.
                    Fuckin' Doctor?)
          
          MADOLYN stares at him, then lowers her eyes, takes out a
          small packet of two pills. She hands it over to him. BILLY
          looks at it.
          
                                 BILLY (CONT'D)
                    Two pills.
          
          She nods. BILLY reaches out and deliberately places the pills
          on the desk.
          
                              BILLY (CONT'D)
                    Why don't you just give me a bottle
                    of scotch and a handgun to blow my
                    fucking head off. Are we done here
                    with this psychiatry bullshit?
          
          MADOLYN is taken aback, guilty, astonished.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    You can leave!
          
                              BILLY

          Very windy. Papers blowing. Billy is walking. Madolyn catches
          up to him.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Why is the hardest patient of the
                    day always the last one?
          
                              BILLY
                    Because you're bored and tired and
                    don't give a shit. It's not
                    supernatural.

                    have to see or they put you in
                    jail. If you are in distress I will
                    help you.
          
          Madolyn holds out a paper and a business card.
          
                              BILLY
                    What's this?
          
                              MADOLYN
                    My card. And a prescription for
                    twenty Lorazepam.
          
          BILLY stands holding the prescription.
          
                              BILLY
                    Is it enough to kill myself?

                        (she fixes him with a
                         stare)
                    Maybe it is. All right? Have I done
                    my job up to your goddamned
                    standards? Because by my standards
                    you fit the model of drug-seeking
                    behavior, and fuck you if you don't
                    like my initial clinical reaction.

          INT. COMMAND CENTER (UPSTAIRS). NIGHT. A WEEK LATER
          
          It's an otherwise disused floor of a new luxury office
          building. Cables and monitors and computers everywhere. It's
          crawling with State Cops as well as FBI (LAZIO is present,
          very nattily dressed). COLIN comes in with BROWN and
          BARRIGAN. This operation is all new to Colin.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       All right, let's bring it in,

                           (addressing room)
                       Our target is a major transaction
                       of microprocessors. Yes, those. I
                       don't know what they are. You
                       don't know what they are. Who
                       gives a fuck? Cash will be handed
                       over in a building which we have

                           (he nods at COLIN)
                       Will ID the bad guys and listen in

          about the best way out of this.

          his cell phone when ELLERBY comes up to him.

                       Sorry to get you at the last

                    Thank you, Captain.
          
          He gives him the clipboard, Colin goes to the work area.

          COLIN joins his team (BROWN AND BARRIGAN), who are seated in
          a U shaped work-area. COLIN, still stunned by the fact of
          this operations center, swallows as he notices on video three
          angles of a building he seems to know very well. He sits down
          and puts a headset on. A GEEK COP leans over and shakes his
          hand.

          area, CHINESE GANG MEMBERS are waiting.
          
          A LOCAL CHINESE-AMERICAN MAN acting as the interpreter and
          fixer stands waiting near a SUITCASE on the floor. With the
          CHINESE GANGSTERS is a more official looking MAN IN A BAD
          SUIT - terrified. FITZY carries a case containing the
          processors.

                    you that at least two of these
                    gents have machine guns.
          
          COSTELLO takes it all in. The CHINESE GANGSTER looks like a
          Malay pirate. Costello's gunmen are perched above, automatic
          weapons trained on the Triad.
          
          BILLY sneaks a message to Queenan via Text Message,"$" to

          raise their MACHINE GUNS. They don't aim them.

          EXT. BEHIND THE BUILDING. CONTINUOUS
          
          Tied to the pier there are two boats, a NOVI LOBSTER BOAT and
          a BOSTON WHALER with a guys we've never seen at the wheel
          (random getaway hires). The TRIAD members get into the NOVI,
          and chug away. Fitzy carries the SUITCASES OF MONEY onto a
          BOSTON WHALER and it takes off. COSTELLO turns to Billy.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    See, no surveillance here. They
                    didn't figure we had a navy.
                    Always figure an exit for your
                    business partners. What with
                    everything all dug up, you can't
                    trust a slant to find the Mass Pike
                    and, with or without Staties out
                    front, frankly I don't approve of
                    orientals driving to begin with.
          
                              BILLY
                    What about us, Frank?   What're we
                    gonna do?
          
                              COSTELLO
                    We depart. We didn't commit no
                    illegalities.
          
          BILLY is stunned. Admiring.
          
                              MISTER FRENCH

          The CHINESE GUYS, staring back, chug away down the canal in
          the lobster boat. BILLY watches COSTELLO go, admiringly, and
          then follows him.
          
          EXT. STREET NEAR TARGET BUILDING - NIGHT          103A
          
          A few blocks from the target building, a Police Tactical unit
          stops the departing Triad cars with a roadblock. As officers
          approach the cars they realize they are empty except for
          hired Caucasian drivers. An officer reports this to the
          command center.
          
          INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          Colin is asleep on the couch, in a bachelor disaster of
          Chinese food boxes. Something on TV: "Audition." A key in
          the door: He wakes as MADOLYN comes in carrying a bag of
          coffees and a BOX OF EFFECTS.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Good Morning.
          
          MADOLYN smiles at him, also shy.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Good morning.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I beat the movers.
          
                                 COLIN
                       How was the last night in the, ah,
                       old establishment?
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       (putting the box on the kitchen
                       counter)
                       Lonely.
          
                                  COLIN
                       I'm glad to hear that.   It sucked
                       here, too.
          
          They kiss.    MADOLYN takes in the apartment.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I'm gonna thank your Uncle
                       Alphonsus for the square footage.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Uncle Alphonsus is in heaven.   So
                       am I.
          
          
                                                                   (CONTINUED)

          MADOLYN unpacks food.       Coffee.   Croissants.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       French donut?
          
                                 COLIN
                           (re: box of stuff)
                       Yeah. Hey, can I...
          
                                    MADOLYN
                       Sure yeah.
          
          He sorts through the box. It's all Madolyn's key stuff - a
          mug, a few critical books...framed family pictures,
          breakables...and comes up with: A PHOTOGRAPH of a young
          Madolyn standing in front of a North East rust belt slum.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Well, we're not having this out.
          
                                    MADOLYN
                       What?
          
          MADOLYN isn't prepared to be at cross-purposes. But she is
          taken aback. She puts the photo quietly away. Contaminated.
          
                                 COLIN
                       You don't see any pictures of where
                       I came from. Look, I respect who
                       you are, but not in the living
                       room. We might have company.
          
                                    MADOLYN
                       Company?
          
          She laughs.    COLIN looks at a diploma.     Veritas.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Why work for the state?
          
                                  MADOLYN
                       Why not?   You do.
          
                                  COLIN
                       Not forever, and you don't have to.
                       You've got degrees...you're a hot
                       shit... I mean, what you do, why
                       make as much as a guidance
                       counselor?

                         cup)
                    I believe in public service.
          
          COLIN stares at her.
          
                              COLIN
                    Now you're just being ridiculous.
          
                              MADOLYN

                         intently:)
                    You like me living here?

                    Yes I do.
          
          THE PHONE (landline with mobile handset) rings.
          
                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                    Answer it.     You live here.
          
          MADOLYN, not 100% confused by his seizing on the
          interruption, gets the phone.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Mayor Sullivan's Office.
          
          After a moment she holds the receiver out to COLIN.
          
                               MADOLYN (CONT'D)
                        (whispering)
                    I'm sorry!
          
                                 COLIN
                    Who is it?
          
                              MADOLYN
                    I think it's a guy with a, ah,
                        (She touches her throat,
                         and whispers)
                    A cancer guy.
          
          COLIN reaches in his pocket and looks at his cellphone: dead.
          A bad mistake in his situation. He crams the phone into a
          table charger beside the landline and takes the handset.
          
                                 COLIN
                    Hello?

                    Something for work.
          
          MADOLYN looks after him. She doesn't start eating again, she
          watches Colin. She is seen staring at him through the
          following scene.

                    Nothin', nothin'. It doesn't have
                    any power, that's all. It just
                    happened once.

                       There are certain things I will not
                       be able to talk to you about. I
                       cannot allow you to jeopardize an
                       ongoing investigation. (Or your
                       own life.)
                           (more seriously, after a
                            long beat)
                       There really are things connected
                       to my job that you can't ask about.
                       That you don't want to know about.

                       Okay, then say that.
          
          COLIN looks at her steadily:         if she's serious, she's pure
          gold.
          
                                   COLIN
                       I will.    Thank you.
          
          He kisses her.       The DOORBELL RINGS.

          The doorbell safely ringing, Colin kisses Madolyn.

                       Good, give him a shot.
          
          This may not be exactly what Madolyn wants to hear. But she
          nods.
          
                                  MADOLYN
                       Doctors aren't supposed to have
                       illusions.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah, that's because of vastly
                       superior intelligence. Godlike,
                       really.
          
          Smiles, called on her shit.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       OK, I'm in a serious, newly
                       serious, relationship...there
                       are...ups and downs...everybody has
                       doubts, problems -- I mean doubts.
          
          She realizes she may have glazed and gone a little too far on
          "problems".
          
                                 BILLY
                       What would you do if he was
                       standing right there and saw us?
          
                                MADOLYN
                       I'd lie. To keep things on an even
                       keel. You know all about it.
          
          INT./EXT. BANKROBBER'S APARTMENT. CHARLESTOWN. DAY
          
          The BANKROBBER, a junkie, wakes up to a vision: JESUS,
          indicating the sacred heart.
          
          BILLY smashes the glass and the frame over the guy's head.
          
          CUT TO OUTSIDE:
          
          MISTER FRENCH has lit a cherry-bomb. He throws it. He hands
          out fireworks to KIDS.
          
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

          BACK INSIDE:
          
          BILLY shoves him down on the couch and crams the gun to his
          head.
          
                                 BILLY
                       You take off an armored car at the
                       Dedham Mall and what do you do. Do
                       you pay guineas in Providence?
          
                                 BANKROBBER
                       Fucking now I do.
          
                                 BILLY
                       What the fuck do you do.
          
                                 BANKROBBER
                       What, I pay Costello and wait for
                       him to trade me to the FBI? Cause
                       that's what he does.
          
                                 BILLY
                       FBI? What the fuck are you talking
                       about.
          
          {Firecrackers off}
          
                                 BANKROBBER
                       Oh my God, is that French out
                       there?
          
                                 BILLY
                           (grabbing him by the
                            shirt)
                       What the fuck did you just say
                       about the FBI?
          
                                 BANKROBBER
                       Forget what I said. I'm fucking
                       high, I'm high.
          
          Firecrackers continue to go off outside. The BANKROBBER knows
          what this means.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Whatever's going through your very
                       poor, very limited, brain...I'm not
                       going to hurt you. Just tell me
                       what you just fucking said.

                    Forget it, I'm high, I must be
                    high, I would never say what you
                    thought I said.
          
          As the firecracker sounds increase outside (Maybe French's
          "Do what you have to do"), BILLY, no way out of what he has
          to do, glances at the window, shoots the guy through the
          kneecap. BLOOD sprays everywhere. The bankrobber screams.
          
                              BILLY
                    Tell me what the fuck you said.
          
                              BANKROBBER
                        (covered with blood)
                    Why do you think he's not arrested?
                    Costello's a protected FBI
                    informant. He'll trade you out.
                        (a beat)
                    I thought I was supposed to go into
                    shock. I'm not in shock. It fucking
                    hurts. It fucking hurts.
          
          BILLY gets out of the house.
          
          OUTSIDE
          
          MISTER FRENCH is benignly watching kids light cherry bombs.
          
                                BILLY
                    Let's go.
          
          ON SOUND: Sextet from LUCIA di LAMMAMOOR.
          
          INT. A THEATER. NIGHT
          
          From behind COSTELLO'S HEAD, which almost fills the frame, we
          see a blur of beautiful color. ON STAGE, an opera is in
          progress----LUCIA DI LAMMAMOOR done with masks. CUT TO
          COSTELLO, revealing Costello's rapt face and PAN to reveal on
          his Left a beautiful WHITE PROSTITUTE. PAN back over
          COSTELLO'S face to reveal a beautiful BLACK PROSTITUTE.
          PERFORMERS with MASKS sing on stage. As the music soars,
          COSTELLO moves crinolines up the women's legs.
          
          INT. A BEDROOM. NIGHT.
          
          COSTELLO fucks...and fucks weird.

          EXT. QUEENAN'S HOUSE IN WEST ROXBURY. NIGHT
          
          A street of three-deckers. QUEENAN gets out of his unmarked
          cruiser. As he does: BILLY steps out into the light. The two
          men stare at each other, each lit by their own streetlight.
          
                              BILLY
                    Hey, it's me.
          
                              QUEENAN
                    What do you want? What are you
                    doing here?
          
                                 BILLY
                    Come here.
          
          QUEENAN approaches him.
          
                              BILLY (CONT'D)
                    Costello is giving people up to the
                    FBI.
          
          QUEENAN stares.
          
                                 QUEENAN
                    The FBI?
          
                              BILLY
                    He gives information to the FBI.
                    He's a protected informant. Aren't
                    they trying to make it a Federal
                    case? And it never gets made?
          
                               QUEENAN
                        (realizing he has to be
                          very careful)
                    Go around the back. Go around the
                    back.
          
          INT. QUEENAN'S HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER
          
          BILLY sits on a bench in a hallway, exhausted, staring. THE
          SACRED HEART and JFK are on the walls. QUEENAN comes along
          the hall.
          
                              QUEENAN
                    My wife's asleep. She left supper
                    out. Come and have something to
                    eat.
          
          BILLY shakes his head.

                       We'll talk in the kitchen. Come and
                       have something to eat.
          
          BILLY follows him towards the lighted kitchen door.
          
          EXT. DRIVING RANGE. DAY (WINDY)
          
          COLIN is watching ELLERBY hit golf balls. Well.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       Congratulations. Haven't seen a guy
                       like you since me. You'll be
                       transferred to Internal
                       Investigations but you will
                       continue to work right where you
                       are in the Special Investigation
                       Unit.
          
                                 COLIN
                       I don't get it.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       We are all convinced that Costello
                       has at least one mole in the
                       Special Investigation Unit.
          
                                  COLIN
                       Right.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       You'll investigate. Everybody.
                       Anybody.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Well, that's just a dream job for a
                       cop.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       We have considered all possible
                       candidates. You have an immaculate
                       record. Some people never trust a
                       guy with an immaculate record. I
                       do.

                                    COLIN
                       No.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       That's a pity. Pretty much sucks as
                       a game but you get to form
                       relationships.
                           (a beat)

                       Everything's great. On schedule.
                       She's a doctor.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       Outstanding. That's good. Marriage
                       is an important part of getting
                       ahead. You don't want anyone
                       thinking you're a homo. Married guy
                       seems stable. People look at a
                       wedding ring and think: someone can
                       stand the son of a bitch. Ladies
                       see the wedding ring and know
                       immediately that you must have some
                       cash and that your cock works.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Oh, it's working. Overtime.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       I'm glad to hear that.

          EXT. CONSTRUCTION AREA. DAY
          
          HEAVY EQUIPMENT stands on the thrashed earth. Hoardings.
          BILLY crosses the road under what remains of the Expressway,
          and after hiding in an angle of the building and cocking the
          gun in his pocket bangs on the door of a dead bar. The door
          is unlocked by: DELAHUNT.
          
          INT. THE DEAD BAR. DAY
          
          It's another of COSTELLO'S "locations". BILLY looks around.
          Every man from the previous night is there--but no COSTELLO.
          DELAHUNT closes the door behind him and bars it. Men are
          oddly enough filling out forms. These are not men used to
          pencil and paper. Billy is nodded at.

                       Boss wants your real name, your
                       social, your license number, all
                       your bank account numbers.
          
                                 BILLY
                       I don't have a bank account.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       I'm a cash business myself.
          
                                 BILLY
                       What's he doing, setting up IRAs?
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       You fill in the papers, real name,
                       all your numbers, no fucking
                       around, and then we all wait here.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)
                       No, I ain't.
          
          MISTER FRENCH goes off into a separate room. BILLY takes a
          paper and, sitting at the bar beside FITZY, writes down his
          information. The other men are mostly finished and DELAHUNT
          is collecting the papers. DELAHUNT tosses the brown envelope
          on the bar.
          
                                 DELAHUNT
                       Put the forms in there.
          
                                 FITZY
                       I don't know if this is how you
                       spell Citizens'.
          
          BILLY glances at what FITZY is crawling: CITTIZINS TRUST.
          
                                 BILLY
                       No, no, no. Jesus Christ.
          
          He takes the brown envelope, and writes on it CITIZENS.
          
                                 FITZY
                       What are you, retarded? That ain't
                       right.
          
          BILLY gives up. Both of their forms are stuffed in an
          envelope. BILLY gets up.
          
                                 DELAHUNT
                       Billy, he said to stay here.

                    without a tetanus shot. I'm not

                    Where you going?
          
          BILLY goes out. DELAHUNT puts his coat on. He picks up the
          brown envelope on which CITIZENS TRUST is written.
          
          EXT. THE WATERFRONT. DAY
          
          BILLY is holding his bottle of tranqs. He traces with his
          finger the doctor's name...MADOLYN MADDEN. His "police" phone
          vibrates and he takes it out.

                    Follow the envelope.
          
          BILLY deletes the IM and dials Queenan directly.
          
                              BILLY
                    Why can't Ellerby's guys? SIU.

          Costello emerges, in an overcoat. Carrying the envelope. He
          gets into his Oldsmobile. BILLY starts his car and follows.
          
          INT. CINEMA. NIGHT   REVISED ON SET 5/31/05
          
          Dark theater, movie in progress. Wobbly porno music. A thin
          audience of raincoat artists. The door opens and COSTELLO
          enters. He moves slowly down the aisle and sees: COLIN
          sitting alone. He sits down in front of COLIN.
          
          Costello is wearing the dildo.   He watches the movie,
          moaning.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Oh yeah, be dirty.
          
          Colin goes for his gun.    Costello gets up, shows him the
          dildo.

          COLIN unnerved, recognizing COSTELLO now.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Jesus Christ, Frank, I almost shot
                       you.
          
          Frank sits, closer to Colin.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       You're not indulging in self abuse

                                 COLIN
                       Frank, we got problems.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I hope you're not turning into one
                       of those sob sisters, who wants to
                       get caught. You're not crackin' up

                                 COSTELLO

                       Look...
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       You're gettin' reassigned.

          COSTELLO chuckles, truly enjoying this.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    You're telling me, sonny boy.
          
                              COLIN
                    I have to find the guy you have in
                    the department.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    With everybody looking up their own
                    ass and you looking for yourself, I
                    put my money on nobody finding
                    nothing.
          
          We see in Colin's face hurt and hatred for Costello.   His
          idol doesn't like him.
          
                              COLIN
                    Frank, for me, you've got to lay
                    low.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Laying low is not what I do.
          
                              COLIN
                    Yeah, big fuckin' daddy Frank.
                    Lookit, Frank, what good am I to
                    you if you don't listen to me?
                    Queenan's compartmentalizing. He's
                    fuckin' smart, you know that. I
                    will find this rat if you let me do
                    it my way. If you let me do my job.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Okay.
                        (gives him the envelope)
                    But Colin, I hope I won't have to
                    remind you, that if you don't find
                    that cheese eating rat bastard in
                    your department so we can give him
                    a halo, most likely it won't be me
                    who pays for it.
          
          COLIN nods, sweat on his lip.
          
                              COLIN
                    Why would you need to remind me of
                    that? I didn't know that would I
                    be any good at what I do? Trust

                    It involves lying, and I'm pretty
                    fucking good at that, right?

                        (looking at the screen)
                    Maybe it's because it's always been
                    so easy for me to get cunt that I
                    never understood jerking off in a
                    theatre.
          
          Costello gets up to go.
          
                              COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                    Who knows what's easy? Collie,
                    take care of business.
          
          The door opens again at the back of the theater and we see:
          BILLY in a dark back seat. COSTELLO, after hesitating as
          Colin sweats, shoves the brown envelope to COLIN, and goes.
          
          BILLY receives a text message: "Get visual ID suspect." He
          slumps in his seat as Costello marches up the aisle and out
          of the theater. He has barely recovered from this when:
          
          The dark shape of COLIN is moving rapidly towards and through
          the emergency exit beside the screen.
          
          Billy follows.
          
          INT. CINEMA BACK STAIRCASE AND ALLEY. NIGHT
          
          It's open, and gives on to what Boston keeps trying to call
          the Theater District and what keeps being The Combat Zone.
          COLIN vanishes around a corner. BILLY follows, looks left and
          right, then goes after
          
          EXT. A STREET OF CHINESE SHOPS. CONTINUOUS
          
          COLIN, who is walking along, putting the envelope into his
          coat.
          
          BILLY is speeding up, moving through pedestrians, desperate
          to see Colin's face.
          
          COLIN will be caught up to within seconds. He turns down
          another street. BILLY starts into a half-run. He turns the
          corner.
          
          ANOTHER STREET painted with neon light (quiet).
          
          BILLY'S POV:
          
          COLIN is halfway down the street.

          BILLY is nearly up to COLIN on this quieter street
          
          (And COLIN is aware of the tail)
          
          when...
          
          BILLY'S cellphone rings. His phone has fucked up, as they
          do. Instead of turning around, COLIN accelerates. The only
          thing on his agenda is to not have his face seen.
          
          BILLY spins into a door-opening and silences the ringer.
          
                                 TEXT MESSAGE DETAIL
                       Make arrest.
          
          COLIN takes a right at the end of the street, into an alley.
          
          EXT. AROUND THE NEXT CORNER. MOMENTS LATER
          
          COLIN is waiting, in a doorway of his own. He has a knife
          open in his hand. He waits, listening to (faltering)
          footsteps: a MAN, face invisible in shadow, turns the corner.
          COLIN pulls him into the doorway and rips upwards with a
          knife.
          
          As the body falls we see: it isn't Billy. It's a CHINESE MAN.
          COLIN backs away in horror, and hurries off down the street.
          
          EXT. ANOTHER STREET. MOMENTS LATER
          
          COLIN, sweating, staggering, hurries along. No sign of Billy,
          no sign of a follower. But he does notice: CCTV cameras at
          the intersection. He spins and gets out of there, heading off
          through. CHINATOWN. Colin, holding his envelope, walks,
          sweating, fast, then faster, past repeated ideograms in neon
          (the ideograms say--flash--"Departed").
          
          EXT. CHINATOWN. MOMENTS LATER
          
          BILLY has lost Colin. He hears a hubbub from the corner where
          a small crowd of Chinese speakers is gathering and pushes
          through the crowd to see: blood running on the pavement.
          BILLY backs away, gets out of there.
          
          INT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT
          
          COLIN is looking at CCTV tapes. We see COLIN, unrecognizable
          on cheap video. Then we see a blurred image of BILLY.
          Crossing the street in beats. No more use as ID than the
          Shroud of Turin.
          
                                                                 102.
          
          
          
          EXT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. NIGHT (RAINING)
          
          Through grated windows we can see Madolyn finishing up her
          packing. BILLY KNOCKS on the door, which leads only into
          Madolyn's basement apartment. A long beat and she opens the
          door. The chain on.
          
                              BILLY
                    Your name's on the pill label. I
                    thought you weren't supposed to be
                    in the book, in case of obsessive
                    patients.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    How obsessive are you?
          
                               BILLY
                    Medium.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Are you okay? Why are you here?
          
                              BILLY
                    I really liked our conversations.
                    I've been...regretting that we
                    didn't continue...our
                    conversations.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    I'm glad you want to see me...it's
                    nice to see you...I enjoyed
                    talking...I enjoyed having coffee
                    with you, very much...but I don't
                    see people...I don't see people in
                    my home.
          
          Billy gets soaked.
          
          INT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS
          
          BILLY looks around and sees: boxes, transition. The furniture
          already gone. An air-mattress on the floor. There are still
          tea things on the counter. A basic life is still possible
          here. Madolyn has been making tea here, sleeping here,
          reading in bed. Billy, soaked, a drowned rat, is looking
          vulnerable and honest.
          
                              BILLY
                    Thanks. If this is inappropriate...
                    I can leave.
          
          MADOLYN takes a moment to react.

                       No, it's, it's, it's not
                       inappropriate...you're not a
                       patient...
          
                                 BILLY
                       You moving in or out?
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I still have three weeks on the
                       lease...
          
          BILLY is looking at THE PICTURE to which Colin objected. A
          young girl in front of a rust belt slum, tilted in a box of
          effects.
          
                                    MADOLYN (CONT'D)
                       That's me.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah, I know.
          
          He hangs the picture on a nail.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                           (the kettle whistles OS)
                       Would you like a cup of tea?
          
          BILLY nods.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah. Yeah I would. Thank you.
          
          Madolyn leaves him looking vaguely around the apartment. In
          the kitchen, it appears that Madolyn has forgotten how to
          make a cup of tea. She perseveres, comes out holding two
          cups. Billy is looking at the handful of books still in the
          apartment.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Do you want some...
          
                                  BILLY
                       Sugar?   No...
          
          She hands him the cup of tea. Strung out, he spills his tea,
          slightly, unobserved by Madolyn. Madolyn looks over at the
          bed, the book, the lamp, the incontrovertible evidence that
          she's probably really, in fact, not that into Colin..
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I've always needed my own place.

                              MADOLYN
                    No. I'm not "hedging my best"...I
                    told you when we had
                    coffee...There's a choice. You

                    Yes. Stick by what you...otherwise
                    it's... I have to say that your
                    vulnerability is really freaking me
                    out right now. Is it real?
          
                              BILLY
                    Yeah, I think so.
          
          Tick...tick...tick.
          
                              BILLY (CONT'D)
                    You don't have cats.

          Colin is still studying the blurry image of Billy.
          
          INT. MADOLYN'S BASEMENT APARTMENT. NIGHT
          
          In the tiny kitchen BILLY is kissing MADOLYN and unbuttoning
          her shirt. Her hands start to move to push him away. He
          continues.
          
                                                                 105.

          Still studying the blurry image of Billy, COLIN tenses as
          someone comes into the office and switches off the tape. He
          glances at his coat. The envelope is visible folded into the
          breast pocket. He takes his coat and goes.
          
          EXT. CHARLES STREET. NIGHT
          
          Wet empty streets. The "gaslights" are on. About midnight.
          
          INT. CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. NIGHT
          
          A Costello business. The restaurant is closed for the night.
          One bartender is sweeping up and the other is counting the
          takings. In a darker alcove of the bar COSTELLO sits alone at
          a broad table, drinking brandy. On sound, classical music. As
          a knocking is heard Costello looks up. A BARTENDER lets Billy
          in. COSTELLO watches Billy approach. We hear him sit down.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    You got a girlfriend?
          
                                BILLY
                    No.   No.   What does that matter?
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Depends. I'm sure you know by now
                    there's an informer in my crew.
                    Cop. Staties or Boston Police
                    department, I'm not sure.
          
          He pours Billy some brandy. Then starts to draw a sketch.
          
                              BILLY
                    What about the FBI.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    It ain't. Trust me. The ex-wife,
                    an old friend or stupid...that's
                    what brings you down in this
                    business.
          
                              BILLY
                    Stupid...Well, that leaves me out.

                    Past days, case like this...I

                              BILLY
                    Better safe than sorry, I suppose.

                       French.
          
          But COSTELLO, maybe, is sorry.
          
                                 BILLY
                       I look around at your guys.
                       They're all murderers right? I
                       think "could I do murder?" And all
                       I can answer myself is, "what's the
                       difference".
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Give em up to the Almighty.   Like

                                 BILLY
                       Yeah, that's my point. You accuse
                       me once, I put up with it. You
                       accuse me twice, I quit. If you
                       make me fear for my life, I put a
                       fucking bullet in your head as if
                       you were anybody else.
          
          COSTELLO looks up. This is new: but he's impassive. And
          impressed.

                           (to Billy)
                       You got something you want to say

                                 BILLY
                       You're seventy fucking years old.
                       One of these guys is going to pop
                       you. As for running drugs, what the
                       fuck. You don't need the pain in
                       the ass, and they're going to catch
                       you. And you don't need the money.
          
          COSTELLO smiles, and continues with the sketch.    Later he
          will light up the paper.

                       I haven't needed "the money" since
                       I took Archie's milk money in the
                       third grade. Tell the truth, I

                       still like it.

                    of what I do on the idea that
                    you're pretty fucking good at what
                    you do.

                    How many of these guys been with
                    you long enough to be disgruntled?
                    Who needs more money than you pay
                    them? You don't pay much, you know.
                    It's almost a feudal fuckin'
                    enterprise.
                        (COSTELLO nods, accepting
                         this)
                    The question is, who thinks that
                    they would do what you do better
                    than you?

                    Only one that can do what I do is
                    me. You want to be me?
          
          BILLY stares over a precipice: he knows this as well.
          
                              BILLY
                    I probably could be you. I know
                    that much. But I don't want to be
                    you.

          Everybody is busy in the office. It's COLIN's first day of
          Internal Investigations. COLIN'S moving through the bullpen.
          COPS stare at him with resentment.
          
                                    COLIN

          He comes up to Queenan's door just as Dignam comes out.

                       Yeah, I run rat fucks like you.   I
                       don't like them.
          
                                 COLIN
                       The day you wouldn't take a
                       promotion, you let me know. And I
                       wouldn't even have a job if you did
                       yours.
          
                                 DIGNAM

                                 COLIN
                       I need to know the identity of your
                       undercovers.
          
                                 DIGNAM

                    Especially Staff Sergeant Dignam.
          
                              QUEENAN
                    What do you expect? Everybody
                    knows you're assigned here to find
                    Costello's rat. They want to find
                    the leak as much as you do. What
                    they do not want is to be accused
                    of being the rat.
          
          COLIN sits uneasily.
          
                              COLIN

                    Lots of luck. (Not a chance.) You
                    can go over my head, high as you
                    like. You still won't get an

                       Follow Costello and you'll find his
                       informer.
          
          In the fishbowl of his glass office, COLIN is being stared at
          by pissed-off cops. COLIN calms down. He opens the gray
          envelope. He takes out the forms that he was given by
          Costello, opens up POLICE PERSONNEL DATABASE and starts
          searching. He types in SS numbers. One, then another, then
          another. The result is always: "Person not found". He types
          in Costigan, William M, hits return. It comes up: "Person not
          found". COLIN keeps working.
          
                                                                   112.

          out).COLIN closes the curtains on his fishbowl office (not
          fast enough to avoid seeing Dignam give him the finger),
          locks his door. He picks up the phone.

          INT. COLIN AND MADOLYN'S NEW BEDROOM.   SAME NIGHT
          
          COLIN is lying in bed, his back to MADOLYN.
          
                              COLIN
                    If I wasn't with the Mass State

                    school, I'd be through in a year.
                    I'm thinking that. If I wasn't a

                              COLIN
                    Nothing. Nothing. There's nothing
                    going on. Just thinking.

                         a breath)
                    And what about money?
          
                              COLIN
                    I got some money. Another
                    city...I'm thinking that.
          
          Another city doesn't seem unattractive to Madolyn, who's in
          her own cut-and-run crisis -- but maybe she can't believe
          that Colin is thinking about it. She blows a breath.
          
                              MADOLYN

          six hard customers, come in through the fire door. At the
          BAR, BILLY is drinking coffee. He notices the NEW GUYS. Off
          the boat Dublin toughs. COSTELLO and FRENCH come in from the
          kitchen. FRENCH tells the NEW GUYS to move to the back.
          COSTELLO HAS BLOOD ON HIS SLEEVES. He comes over to the bar
          and looks at BILLY.

          COSTELLO heads to the back of the restaurant. MISTER FRENCH,
          grabs the BAR KNIFE from behind the bar. BILLY looks up at
          him.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       Go out the back. Some guys answer
                       the questions right. Some don't.
          
          MISTER FRENCH goes towards the back of the restaurant,
          holding the big knife. BILLY closes his paper.

                    He's crazy. I just saw the man.
                    He had blood all over him. I can't
                    get any more information for you.
                    I can't trust it. He's not
                    including his regular guys... I'm
                    telling you, he's gonna find out
                    who I am. He's gonna fuckin' kill
                    me, I know it.
          
                              QUEENAN
                    All right, all right. I hear you.
                    I'm sorry for you trouble. Look,
                    I'm not gonna jeopardize your
                    safety any longer. I'll get you
                    out. I can't do it overnight but
                    I'll do it. We can bust him for

                                 DELAHUNT
                       Two days...two days ago the Boss
                       says to me, it's been ten years
                       already, and you've never done me
                       wrong. He asked me, if one of the
                       other guys is a rat, would I take
                       him out. I told him I would but I
                       don't know if I would. Now I know I
                       can't. I've done a lot of bad
                       things but I've never been a
                       murderer.
          
          BILLY realizes that DELAHUNT is dying.
          
                                 DELAHUNT (CONT'D)
                       Hey Billy, I don't want no one to
                       put me in a dumpster. Just don't
                       put me in a dumpster.
          
                                 BILLY
                       When you're dead it makes no
                       difference where they put you.
          
          BILLY lights him a cigarette.
          
                                 DELAHUNT
                       You know what I thought today?
          
                                 BILLY
                       What's that?
          
                                 DELAHUNT
                       Who didn't show up today is the
                       rat.
          
                                   BILLY
                       Yeah, so?
          
                                  DELAHUNT
                       You never been late in your life.
                       And when I called you... I made a
                       mistake. I gave you the wrong
                       address. But you showed up at the
                       right one.
          
          DELAHUNT grips his arm. BILLY is terrified.
          
                                 DELAHUNT (CONT'D)
                       Tell me why I didn't say anything.
                       Tell me why.

          He waits for DELAHUNT to continue. But DELAHUNT after an odd
          smile of complicity, finally dies. BILLY, the only one who
          knows that DELAHUNT is dead, stares down at him.

                    That cop was tough. We were
                    excessive with the cop.
          
          BILLY walks past the table.
          
                              BILLY
                    He's dead. I'm going home.
          
          BILLY leaves by the front door.
          
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM. NIGHT
          
          All hands present. Dignam is in a black silent rage.

                    Do you know why Queenan went to
                    that building?
          
                              COLIN
                    No.
          
                              DIGNAM
                    A better question is why your
                    fuckers were following him.
          
                              COLIN
                    I told Internal Investigations to
                    follow him.
          
                              DIGNAM
                    Why?
          
                              COLIN
                    That's internal Investigations
                    business.
          
          DIGNAM grabs COLIN by the neck and runs him into a wall.
          COLIN gets a palm under Dignam's chin and comes close to
          breaking his neck. The men at length are separated. COLIN
          straightens his good clothes.
          
                              COLIN (CONT'D)
                    I have to investigate everybody and
                    anybody. I don't have to justify
                    anything. Nor does anyone have to

                       from a very good source...that
                       Queenan may have been killed by his
                       own undercover.
          
          COLIN is trying this on.

                       That's a fucking lie.

                       Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant
                       Dignam here have information on
                       this undercover, and other
                       informants, in a locked file. I
                       need those files unlocked.
          
                                 DIGNAM
                       I don't have the password.   Why
                       don't you come down to the
                       garage...
          
                                 COLIN
                       That's a lie.
          
          DIGNAM hits COLIN in the face. COLIN goes down hard, into the
          crook of a file cabinet and the wall. Blood from his mouth.
          
                                 DIGNAM
                       No one calls me a liar. Especially
                       when I'm lying.

          he sees PLASTIC BAGS which contains Queenan's bloodstained
          effects-- broken glasses, smashed wristwatch, and CELLPHONE.
          He glances around, and picks up the CELLPHONE. Blood gets on
          his fingers. He moves into the office, and seen through the
          glass, he seizes the phone and with trembling fingers punches
          up the last incoming number.
          
          INT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          BILLY is looking at a chipped SANTA MUG from his childhood
          and is eating something--sheer maintenance, and drinking wine
          from the bottle. His phone rings. He looks at the ID and is
          stunned. Queenan's number! He picks up the call but remains
          silent. The caller is also doing the same.
          
          INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS
          
          COLIN hears that the other side has hung up the phone. He
          sees: ELLERBY looking at him through the glass. But Ellerby
          hasn't seen the phone.
          
          INTERCUT BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT/COLIN'S OFFICE #2.
          CONTINUOUS
          
          BILLY is agitated. Exhausted. Frightened. He paces, and looks
          at the phone. He begins to pack, assembling clothes, money.
          Finally, like a man committing suicide--it's that intense--
          he dials the number. INTERCUT.
          
                              COLIN
                    Yeah.
          
                              BILLY
                    You called this number on a dead
                    guy's phone. Who are you?
          
                              COLIN
                    So it is you. Thank God you're all
                    right. We were very worried.

                       You're talking to Sergeant
                       Sullivan. I'm taking over
                       Queenan's unit.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Let me talk to Dignam to confirm
                       it.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Staff Sgt. Dignam has... taken a
                       leave of absence. He's very upset.
                       We're all very upset. The best
                       thing would be for your to come in.
                       We need you to come in.
          
          BILLY listens to Colin go on. Then shuts off the phone. His
          other phone rings.
          
          COLIN dumps out the box of Queenan's belongings. In the
          diary he sees an entry showing undercover suspects Costello
          is FBI informant.

                       tail?
          
          COSTELLO looks at him.

                                 COSTELLO
                       Were you in the fuckin' car?
          
                                 BILLY
                       What if they took one off and put
                       another one on, Frank?
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Load.
          
          The drugs having been loaded fast by the crew, including
          FNG's, the container is hosed out. BILLY turns from FITZY'S
          CAR as everyone gets it.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Frank told me to check out the
                       back. You guys go ahead.
          
                                 FNG DENNIS
                       Watch your ass.
          
          Instead of getting into COSTELLO'S CAR on the other side of
          the container, he steps back into shadows as both cars leave.
          
          INT. COSTELLO'S CAR. NIGHT
          
          FOUR CARS with no headlights bracket the vehicles as soon as
          they come out of the garage. COSTELLO realizes that something
          has gone wrong.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Cocksucker.
          
          LIGHTS come on, and Policemen are everywhere, guns in their
          hands. COLIN is not visible among them.
          
          POLICE open fire at Costello's car. THE CAR reverses back
          into the garage. MISTER FRENCH (the driver) is shot in the
          arm, and the car crashes into a wall. A gunfight opens up.
          FNG's exchange fire with brutally efficient tactical cops and
          are shot down expertly. COSTELLO, limping, gets out of the
          action, fast. He runs into the parking garage. French drives
          away (alternately is shot, or commits suicide).
          
          INT. PARKING GARAGE. NIGHT
          
          COSTELLO, shot through the stomach, is moving through the
          dark. All that's stored in this garage is heavy equipment for
          the big dig. Plenty of places to hide. We hear gunfire in the
          distance. COSTELLO hides between two pieces of heavy
          equipment and dials his telephone. To his surprise the phone
          rings quite nearby. And keeps ringing.

          CONTINUED:
          
          COSTELLO moves out into the open, and sees, at a near
          distance, COLIN, his shadow long on the concrete. He has a
          gun in his hand. Costello moves out to face him.
          
                                 COLIN
                       You're an FBI informant.
          
          COSTELLO comes out of the shadows.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Jesus Colin, grow up. Course I'm
                       talking to the FBI.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Do they know who I am?
          
          COSTELLO says nothing for a moment.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I never gave up anybody who wasn't
                       goin' down anyway.
          
          COLIN instantly raises the pistol to shoot him.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Did you give me up?
          
          COLIN'S PISTOL wavers.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Nobody knows nothin'.
          
          COLIN shakes his head and cocks the gun.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Frank, Frank, do they know about
                       me?
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I know you, Colin. You know I'd
                       never give you up. You're like...
          
                                 COLIN
                       A son...to you? Is that what it is
                       about, all that murderin' and
                       fuckin' and no sons? What are you,
                       shooting blanks?
          
          COSTELLO tries to raise his gun which is inside his sleeve.
          He's sitting on his coat so that the shot goes off sideways
          as COLIN shoots him.

          COSTELLO topples backward into the bucket of the bucket
          loader.
          
          ANGLE ON COLIN.
          
          Then from the bucket loader, a post death tremor sets off one
          last shot from COSTELLO'S gun. Ricochet. COLIN fires into the
          dead body again and again. He backs away.
          
                              COLIN (CONT'D)
                    I got Costello! I got Costello
                    here!
          
          INT. POLICE HQ/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Colin is debriefed concerning the shooting of Costello.
          [Dialog separate document].
          
          INT. BULLPEN AREA. DAY
          
          COLIN enters, tired from a debriefing. Applause from everyone
          in the office--the full crew. COLIN is embarrassed by the
          attention. BROWN is leading the whole team to a standing
          ovation. COLIN looks past the heads of the crowd and sees:
          Dignam, staring at him evenly.
          
                              COLIN
                        (to crowd)
                    It's not any reason for, ah...
          
          QUEENAN'S SECRETARY brings him some wine.
          
                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.
          
                              QUEENAN'S SECRETARY
                    No, thank you.
          
          He takes a glass of wine. Then guiltily, almost in tears, he
          drinks. BROWN jerks a thumb towards Colin's office #2.
          
                              BROWN
                    He's waited a long time for you.
                        (COLIN looks up and sees
                         BILLY)
                    How'd you get him without the
                    files?
          
                              COLIN

          INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. NIGHT
          
          In Colin's office BILLY sits with his ankle on his knee. He
          looks very tired, dirty. Wearing a VISITOR badge.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Good to see you Trooper.

                       Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the
                       phone. How long have you been
                       undercover?
          
                                    BILLY
                       Long time.     Long fuckin' time.
          
                                 COLIN
                       I can't begin to tell you what a
                       debt we owe you. I want you to
                       know I'll be recommending you for
                       the Medal of Merit.
          
                                 BILL
                       Medal of Merit. Oh, yeah. That's
                       kinda like a gold star around here,
                       right?
          
                                 COLIN
                       It's the highest honor we got.
          
                                 BILLY
                       I just want my identity back.

                       I want my identity back.

                       Fair enough. You've given a lot.

          MADOLYN, carrying work, breakfast, rounds the corner and sees
          him standing and waiting for her. She's a little spooked,
          opens her mouth to speak...
          
                              BILLY
                    I know. I'm not here to...I'm not
                    here for that. I've got something
                    to...to give to you...something I
                    need you to keep. For me.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    What is it?
          
          
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                 BILLY
                           (stopping her from
                            speaking)
                       I need you to be my friend here and
                       not ask any questions. That's for
                       you to hold.
          
          He gives her a manila envelope.
          
                                 BILLY (CONT'D)
                       Only you. Open this if I'm dead or
                       if I call you and tell you to open
                       it. Please do exactly what it
                       says. Exactly what it says,
                       please.
          
          Madolyn is a friend. She's not going to ask questions.           She
          accepts the envelope.
          
                                    MADOLYN
                       All right.
          
                                 BILLY
                       I'm sorry to show up here like
                       this. There was no one else I
                       could give it to. I'm sorry.
                       There was no one else.
          
          He backs away, and then turns to go.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I...we...
                           (he turns)
                       I've, it's, been so confused... I
                       just want to say...
          
          He turns and looks at her.          She doesn't speak: can't.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Whatever you have to say, really
                       think about it, and if you still
                       want to tell me, tell me in two
                       weeks, all right?
          
          She moves her head slightly, watches him go.
          
          INT. MADOLYN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER.
          
          MADOLYN sits at her desk, devastated, looking at a fall of
          light. The envelope lies on her blotter. She sits on ...
          then straightens up, takes a marker and writes "COSTIGAN" on
          the envelope and puts it in her desk drawer.
          
          
                                                                    (CONTINUED)

          We DISSOLVE to a SONOGRAM.
          
          INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. MORNING
          
          A SONOGRAM picture of a fetus. It looks to him at first like
          a CCTV picture blown up. COLIN stares as if at something in a
          horror film.
          
                                 COLIN
                       I was dreaming...
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       What?
          
                                 COLIN
                       I was dreaming I was dead.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Death is hard. Life is much
                       easier.
          
          Referring to the envelope
          
                                 COLIN
                       What's this?
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Open it
          
          He does.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Really?
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Yeah.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Really?
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Yeah.
          
                                 COLIN
                       You're joking...
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       It's not a joke, it's a human
                       being.
          
          Colin belatedly thinks of what a human being might do in
          these circumstances and kisses her.

          INT COLIN'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          COLIN is in the shower. MADOLYN moves into the     kitchen and
          puts the kettle on. She checks the mail, lying     there on the
          counter. It's tied with a string. She undoes       the string and
          sorts through the mail. Suddenly, she freezes      looking at:
          
          AN OVERSIZED ENVELOPE addressed to COLIN: [COLIN SULLIVAN, 20
          Pickering Street, Apt TK, Boston, MA, zip TK], with a return
          address of Wm. Costigan, 13 Conant St., Boston, etc., etc.]
          
          MADOLYN stares at the envelope, listening to the shower
          going. Billy has written to her fiance. She starts to put
          the envelope down, and then realizes...she has to hide
          it...she has to open it.
          
          Inside the envelope is a jewel case: EXILE ON MAIN STREET.
          And a note: PLAY ME NOW. MADOLYN puts the CD into the
          machine. She puts on the headset and listens...and listens.
          
          COLIN comes out of the bathroom, dressed in jeans and t-
          shirt, barefoot, his hair wet. He looks at Madolyn,
          realizing that something is wrong.
          
                                 COLIN
                       What?
          
          MADOLYN pulls the headphone jack out of the stereo and
          roughly the following booms out of the speakers. [NOTE: THIS
          RECORDING WAS DONE IN POST -- I THINK FROM THE PORN THEATRE
          DIALOGUE.]
          
                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                       Your guys shouldn't have done that.

                       One of us was going to have to die.
                       It tends to be the other guy.
          
          COLIN stares at her and we ought to think murder is a
          possibility.
          
                                 COLIN
                       I'm now in charge of everything
                       here. Including Queenan's
                       informers. Theoretically. I can't
                       unlock the files until after the
                       brass squeezes Dignam. If the brass
                       squeezes Dignam.

                              COLIN
                    He's fucking resigning. He put his
                    papers in. He's not talking.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Give me his location. Tonight.
          
          COLIN and MADOLYN stare at each other.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    I thought I was the liar.
          
                              COLIN
                    I can explain.
          
          She goes into the bedroom. COLIN'S PHONE RINGS. He answers
          it.

                              BILLY
                    Costello recorded everything. He
                    put all the tapes in a little box
                    and kept them with his lawyer. That
                    was his insurance. His lawyer came
                    to me. Costello trusted me the
                    most. Imagine that you rat fuck.
                    Sound quality good enough? I was a
                    little worried.

          COLIN closes a door to speak privately.

          COLIN goes to the bedroom door and tries it. Locked. He
          knocks. No answer.
          
                                  COLIN

                       is my job.

          EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING. DAY
          
          COLIN comes along and walks into the lobby. He is not looking
          for a tail...
          
          EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. DAY
          
          COLIN looks out through the door, no gun drawn, but very much
          a cop clearing his corners. He steps out and--BILLY takes him
          from behind the door, his only blind side, and grabs the back
          of his collar and crams a pistol into the bottom of his
          skull.
          
                                 BILLY

                       Put the fuckin' gun down.
          
          BILLY turns Colin around and puts the pistol to Colin's
          forehead, hard enough to break the skin. He takes out Colin's
          belt gun and puts it in his pocket. (Billy screams "hands!"
          at Colin every time he makes a move).

                       Arrested? Arrested for what.
                           (as BILLY cuffs him)
                       So you got tapes of what? Costello
                       was my informant. I was his rat?
                       Fuck you. Prove it. I say he was
                       my informant.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Get up and shut your fuckin' mouth.
          
                                 COLIN
                       What is this, a citizen's arrest?
                       Blow me, prick. Only one of us is
                       a cop, here, Bill. Nobody knows who
                       you are. Nobody knows who you are.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Would you shut the fuck up.
          
                                 COLIN
                       I'm a sergeant in the Mass. State
                       Police. Who the fuck are you?
                       Nobody. I ERASED YOU.
          
          BILLY puts the gun to Colin's head.
          
                                 BILLY
                       You erased me?
          
                                 COLIN
                       Go ahead. Shoot a cop, Einstein.
                       See what happens.

                       would go right through your fuckin'

                    What, you think you're gonna get
                    the parade? The bagpipes and
                    bullshit? Fuck you.
                        (safeties the gun)
                    I'm arresting you.
          
                              COLIN
                    That's the stupidest thing you
                    could do.
          
                               BILLY
                    Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up.
                         (hits him)
                    I don't give a fuck if these
                    charges don't stick.
                         (whaling him in the beats)
                    But I'm still fucking arresting
                    you.
          
          COLIN is hammered to his knees. Head down, blood in his
          hair, drooling blood, thinking (impossibly) about his next
          move. He seems to realize he's fucked.
          
                              BILLY (CONT'D)
                    [You are what you do.] Get up.
                        (COLIN doesn't move.)
                    I said get the fuck up.
          
          BILLY grabs the back of Colin's collar and puts the gun to
          Colin's head. A crunch of gravel, off. BILLY and COLIN both
          hear it.
          
                              BROWN
                    Put down the weapon and step away
                    from Sergeant Sullivan.
          
          BILLY drags COLIN to his feet and using Colin as a shield
          aims the pistol at: BROWN. Brown is aiming his weapon.
          
                              BILLY
                    I called you. You specifically.
                    You know who I am. I'm not gonna
                    shoot. I told you to meet me
                    downstairs.

                              BROWN
                    Put the weapon on the deck and step
                    away from Sergeant Sullivan.

                              BROWN
                    Put the weapon on the ground and
                    we'll discuss it.

                              BROWN
                    Maybe you do, but right now I need
                    you to drop the weapon.
          
                              BILLY
                    I told you I've got the evidence

          looks back at BROWN, still in a Mexican stand-off.
          
          COLIN, nose broken, blood masking his face.
          
                              COLIN
                    I can't wait for you to try to
                    explain this to a Suffolk County

                                 BILLY
                       I am killing you.
          
          The doors open and for a frozen moment BILLY, holding the gun
          on COLIN, stares out of the car. A LOUD BANG. BILLY is shot
          through the head. BLOOD sprays the walls, and COLIN is hit by
          flying blood and matter. BILLY falls, crumpled, on his face,
          half in and half out of the elevator. The doors try to
          close...open...COLIN, covered with blood, looks up.
          
          BARRIGAN lowers his pistol.
          
          COLIN slumps, covered with blood. BARRIGAN uncuffs him. COLIN
          feels his wrists. BARRIGAN picks up BILLY'S gun. The other
          elevator doors open and BROWN emerges. He looks into the
          bloody elevator and down at the dead man.

                       Shit...
          
          BARRIGAN raises BILLY'S GUN and shoots BROWN in the head.
          COLIN stares at him.
          
                                 BARRIGAN
                       Did you think you were the only one
                       he had? Costello was going to sell
                       us to the FBI. It's you and me now.
                       We have to take care of each other.
                       You understand?

                       All right. Give me that.
          
          BARRIGAN casually hands COLIN BILLY'S GUN. COLIN presses the
          gun against BARRIGAN's forehead and fires.

                       At that time, Trooper Barrigan, who
                       I now understand to have been
                       Francis Costello's informer in SIU,
                       intercepted us in the lobby and
                       shot Trooper William Costigan once
                       in the head.
                           (drinks water)
                       At that time Barrigan retrieved
                       Trooper Costigan's undercover
                       weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he
                       was approaching our location. I
                       attempted to subdue Trooper
                       Barrigan and in the ensuing
                       struggle was struck several times
                       with the Walther pistol. I was
                       able to wrestle the weapon away, at
                       which time Barrigan drew his own
                       weapon and took aim at me. I was
                       able to get off a single shot,
                       striking Barrigan in the head. I
                       then checked for vital signs of
                       Troopers Brown and Costigan and
                       discovered that they had expired.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. EVENING
          
          COLIN has a bag of expensive groceries and wine. Living the
          Beacon Hill dream. He climbs the steps slowly. He nods to a
          neighbor, an old lady coming down with her dog (who
          incidentally will never accept him as a neighbor, and COLIN
          briefly seems aware of this). (Don't be afraid to get a bit
          French here). He gets to his door, and starts to cry, and
          nearly crumples. But he gets the door open. He looks up and
          sees a gun. Behind it, stepping fast out of the shadows,
          DIGNAM. Avenging a guy he didn't even like, because it's the
          right thing to do. COLIN looks down and sees that Dignam has
          plastic hospital boots on his feet.
          
                                   COLIN
                             (accepting it, sort of,
                              but only in a COLIN way)
                       OK.
          
          DIGNAM fires. Flash groceries fall all over the floor.
          DIGNAM'S FEET step over COLIN's body, crushing one of a half
          dozen croissants, and DIGNAM goes down the expensive
          staircase, leaving the door to the apartment open. The
          strangest thing happens: a rat emerges and begins to eat the
          dead man's croissants. The rat hears something and runs so
          it's not in the shot when it
          
          FREEZES.
