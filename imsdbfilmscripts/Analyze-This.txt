    DOMINIC MANETTA

    a man in his 70s, narrates nostalgically OVER a MONTAGE
    of related news photos.

                            MANETTA (V.O.)
              1957 was a big year. The Russians
              put that Sputnik into outer space,
              the Dodgers played their last game
              at Ebbets Field, 'that guy' shot
              Frank Costello in the head, and
              missed, and the Gallo brothers
              whacked Albert Anastasia in that
              barber shop in the Park Sheraton
              Hotel. It was total chaos. With
              Anastasia gone, Vito Genovese
              figures he's king shit, but Carlo
              Gambino and 'Joe Bananas' both
              want to be boss of all bosses. So
              they call a meeting -- a big
              meeting.


2   EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY                                  2

    CREDITS CONTINUE. In FADED 16mm documentary-style, we
    see a country road winding through rolling hills. At the
    top of the hill, a black '57 Cadillac appears and sweeps
    through the peaceful landscape.

                            MANETTA (V.O.)
              It was the first time the whole
              commission was ever gonna meet
              face to face. Bosses and wiseguys
              were comin' in from all over the
              country, and all the New York
              families, too -- maybe sixty
              bosses, the whole wiseguy world --
              all headin' toward this little
              town upstate to figure out what's
              what.


3   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          3

    A sign reads, "Entering Apalachin - pop. 342." The black
    Cadillac speeds past the sign, then another black Caddy,
    then a black Lincoln, then another Caddy, a Lincoln, etc.

                            MANETTA (V.O.)
              Your father and me, we were goin'
              up with Tommy D., Fat Tommy.

                               MANETTA (V.O.CONT'D)
                 He was running the family at the
                 time. Anyway, I don't know what
                 anybody was thinking, but some
                 asshole thought it would be a good
                 idea to have this meeting at Joe
                 Babara's farm in the country where
                 nobody would notice.


4   EXT. RURAL GAS STATION - DAY                                  4

    A local state police deputy is gassing up his motorcycle
    when the parade of shiny black cars rolls by. He looks
    up and scratches his head at the unusual sight.

                               MANETTA (V.O.)
                 Turns out the local cops were
                 watching Joe Babara like a hawk.
                 So now you got about fifty Caddies
                 and Lincolns pullin' into Apalachin
                 and some deputy sheriff with cow
                 shit on his shoes notices all the
                 traffic and calls the Feds.


5   EXT. JOE BABARA'S ESTATE - DAY                                5

    The Caddies and Lincolns are all parked around a rambling
    country manor. Bosses and wiseguys are meeting and
    greeting each other on the big front porch.

    One WISEGUY is trying to shoo a cow away from his car.

                               WISEGUY
                 You wanna be a ribeye?   Get away
                 from the fuckin' car.


6   EXT. WOODS - SAME TIME                                        6

    Federal agents start moving in quietly, heavily-armed,
    wearing big FBI arm bands.

                               MANETTA (V.O.)
                 The meeting never even got
                 started. The Feds moved in --


7   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                              7

    Agents with weapons drawn charge the house and start
    breaking down the front door.

                                                              3.

8    EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - SAME TIME                                  8

                             MANETTA (V.O.)
               -- and we moved out.

     Gangsters in shiny suits are squeezing through windows
     and leaping off balconies.


     WIDE - WISEGUYS

     fleeing into the surrounding woods and fields.

                             MANETTA (V.O.)
               Your papa and me hid in a field
               with hay or corn, some kinda
               foliage, I don't know.


9    EXT. FARM FIELD - DAY                                           9

     Two wiseguys in suits crouch in the tall grass.
     Suddenly they see a John Deere harvester bearing down on
     them.

                             MANETTA (V.O.)
               Then along comes this farmer who
               almost runs us over in a tractor,
               so your father hauls out his piece,
               this .44 cannon he used to carry,
               and hijacks the goddamn tractor.
               Funniest fuckin' thing I ever saw.


10   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                                         10

     The farmer goes flying off the harvester and the two
     wiseguys drive off on it.

     The farmer looks up to see the John Deere disappear in a
     swirling cloud of dust that FILLS the SCREEN.

     END CREDITS.

     on top of an espresso. PULL BACK as a hand reaches in
     and runs a lemon rind along the rim of the cup. The
     espresso is picked up and sipped by MANETTA, the aging
     boss of a prominent New York crime family.

     INT. RITZ CLAM BOX - LATE AFTERNOON (PRESENT)

     The place is nearly empty. Manetta is talking to PAUL
     VITTI, a dark, intense, intelligent man in his late
     forties, and a powerful boss in his own right.

                                MANETTA
                  Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of
                  it capo de tutti capi, and that
                  was the last time the whole
                  commission tried to meet -- until
                  now.

                                VITTI
                         (brooding)
                  I don't know. I don't like it.
                  What do we need a meeting for?
                  Let everybody worry about their
                  own business.

     They finish eating.

                                MANETTA
                  The '57 meeting was about how we
                  were going to divide up the whole
                  country. This meeting is about
                  how we're gonna survive. You got
                  'made' guys informing for the
                  Feds; bosses going to jail;
                  everybody's dealing drugs; people
                  are getting whacked without
                  permission. And on top of
                  everything, now we got the Chinese
                  Triads and these crazy Russians to
                  deal with. Everything's changing.
                  We need a leader. Someone with
                  fresh ideas. Someone like you.
                  It's gonna be a new century, Paul.
                  We gotta change with the times.

                                VITTI
                  What are we gonna get, a fuckin'
                  web site?

                                MANETTA
                  You remember what else happened in
                  1957, Paul?

                                VITTI
                  Yeah, I remember.

                                MANETTA
                  When your father died, I promised
                  him I'd always look out for you.
                  Come to the meeting.
                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                5.

     They get up to leave. Vitti drops some money on the
     table. Bodyguards follow them to the door. The waiters
     and the owner bow to them as they pass. They are almost
     out the door when Vitti hesitates.

                                VITTI
                  Wait a second. I'm just gonna
                  grab a toothpick.

     The instant he steps back inside, Manetta and his
     bodyguard are struck by an incredible VOLLEY of GUNFIRE,
     which BLOWS OUT all the GLASS in the DOOR and WINDOWS.

     Vitti's bodyguard, JELLY, grabs him and throws him behind
     the counter, shielding him with his body.

     Outside, the shooting has stopped and curious bystanders
     are looking in the broken windows. Vitti's eyes well up
     with tears.

                                                      CUT TO:

     being pulled out of a box. CAROLINE, a woman in her
     early thirties, dabs at her eyes with the tissue. She's
     sitting on the couch in --


     INT. BEN'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

     The office is warm, comfortable, and nicely decorated.

                                 CAROLINE
                         (weepy)
                  I kept telling him that I needed
                  room to grow and find myself as a
                  person. Not just as a woman but
                  as an independent entity.

     BEN SOBOL

     her therapist, seems to be listening intently.

                                CAROLINE
                  I told him I needed to get in
                  touch with my uniqueness, but he
                  couldn't handle that. He said I
                  was driving him away. Do you
                  think I was driving him away, Dr.
                  Sobol?

     Ben leans forward sympathetically.

     He's in his mid-forties, has an expressive face and a
     quick wit, and despite the occasional lapse, he is a
     gifted and caring psychologist.

                                BEN
                  Things end, Caroline. That's just
                  a part of life. It's how we deal
                  with things ending that's important.

                                CAROLINE
                  I just can't believe it's over between
                  me and Steve. Maybe there's still
                  hope.

                                BEN
                  Well, he did take out a restraining
                  order against you. I have to be
                  honest, that's usually not a good
                  sign.

                                CAROLINE
                  But what should I do?

                                BEN
                  Well, Caroline, I think the first
                  thing you have to do...
                         (voice rising)
                  ... is stop whining about this
                  pathetic loser! You're a tragedy
                  queen!
                         (mocking)
                  'Steve doesn't respect me. Steve
                  doesn't love me anymore.' Who gives
                  a shit! Get a fucking life! You
                  are, without a doubt, the most
                  boring human being I have ever met!
                  Please, say something interesting
                  before I lapse into a goddamn coma!

     Caroline looks curiously at Ben, unperturbed.

                                CAROLINE
                  Dr. Sobol?


     BEN

     Lost in his fantasy, not really listening.    He comes
     to attention and tries to cover.

                                BEN
                  Yes. Yes. I was just reflecting
                  on your whole -- situation. It's
                  very interesting what you were
                  just saying. I want you to think
                  about it, and I'm going to think
                  about it, so we'll both think
                  about it and we'll continue next
                  week when I get back from my
                  vacation.

     Caroline bursts into tears again.

13   INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY                                     13

     Ben rushes upstairs and into his bedroom. His 14-year-old
     son MICHAEL is in his room putting on a tuxedo.

                                 MICHAEL
                  You're late.

                                BEN
                         (changing hurriedly)
                  I know. I couldn't get rid of my
                  last patient. I think she was a
                  tick in a past life.

                                MICHAEL
                  Yeah, what's Caroline's problem?
                  Your boyfriend's gone, he hates
                  your guts, get over it.

                                BEN
                  Michael! What did I tell you?
                  You can't listen to my sessions!
                  It's private stuff.

                  I can't help it. I hear you
                  through the vent in my room.

                                 BEN
                  Funny how that happens when you
                  lie on the floor and put your ear
                  up against it.

                  Okay, okay. How's that guy who

                  bass. Put on your cummerbund.
                  Boy, have you grown. Did your
                  mother move next door to a
                  nuclear power plant?

                  Why do we have to wear rented
                  clothes to Grandpa's party? This

                  We have to dress up because
                  Grandpa can't have a good time
                  unless everyone else is extremely
                  uncomfortable.

                  Your mother and I, when we
                  got divorced, we agreed we wouldn't

      tied to a chair under a strong overhead light. When he
      speaks, we get a hint of mental incompetence.

      Vitti winds up to brain him with the pipe. They all
      wince in anticipation of the blow. But Vitti just
      freezes there with his arm upraised. Then he drops his
      arm and seems to sag.

                                 VITTI
                   Forget about it. He doesn't know

     The minivan has rear-ended a black Lincoln Town Car. The
     trunk has sprung open and Nicky Shivers can be seen in
     the trunk, bound and gagged, kicking and squirming.
     Muffled shouts can be heard through the duct tape over
     his mouth.

     Jelly and Jimmy jump out of the Lincoln and slam the top
     of the trunk just as Ben gets out of the minivan to
     inspect the damage.

                                JIMMY

     Ben looks at the damage. The Lincoln has gotten the
     worst of it. The rear bumper is hanging off, and Jelly
     is struggling to latch the trunk.

                                JIMMY

                  That's all right, sir. It's our
                  fault for being in front of you
                  like that.

                  Well, I should have been watching.
                  Let me give you my insurance

                  Really? It looks like your whole
                  rear end might be screwed up.

     Jimmy is reattaching the rear bumper and securing the
     trunk lid with duct tape.

                                JELLY
                  No, it was like that before.

                  Right!   Fuck 'em.

                  At least take my card. You might
                  look at the damage in the morning
                  and change your mind.

                  We understand it's a special day
                  for you, Benny, but your father
                  and I can't just pick up and

                  We want to be there, but I have
                  three book signings next weekend.
                  I can't piss off these big book
                  stores. If I cancel, they'll
                  stick me down on the bottom shelf.
                  That's how they are.

                  Yeah, that's the word on the
                  street. The self-help book
                  business is full of vindictive

                  met someone I want to spend the
                  rest of my life with and I would
                  really like you to meet her
                  before we get married. You're
                  going to be her family. I think
                  it's better she knows that up
                  front.

                  know it before I walk into that

     He feels a stabbing pain in his chest.

                      (concerned)
               You havin' one of those
               mindgrains?

     Sweating profusely now, Vitti feels another stabbing
     chest pain.

                              VITTI
               Get the car.

20   INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - LATER                                     20

     Vitti is putting on his shirt. He looks considerably
     better. Jelly is sitting down, tapping his own knee with
     the little rubber hammer. Nothing moves.

     DOCTOR SHULMAN, a young cardiology resident, enters.

                             DOCTOR
               Good news, Mr. Evans.   Your heart
               is just fine.

                             VITTI
               How could it be fine? I've had
               like eight heart attacks in the
               last three weeks.

                             DOCTOR
               Well, based on everything, I'd say
               you probably had an anxiety
               attack.

                              VITTI
                       (a beat)
               What?

                             DOCTOR
               An anxiety attack. A panic
               attack. I can give you some Xanax
               if it happens again soon --

                                VITTI
                         (menacing)
                  Look at me. Do I look like a guy
                  who panics?

                                DOCTOR
                         (nervous now)
                  There's nothing -- I mean -- it's
                  a common thing --

                                 VITTI
                  Where did you go to medical
                  school? I had a heart attack, you
                  quack bastard.

                                DOCTOR
                         (very scared now)
                  Well, not according to these --

     As Vitti moves toward the Doctor, Jelly instinctively
     grabs the Doctor from behind and holds him while Vitti
     wraps the blood pressure cuff around his neck.

                                VITTI
                         (low and deadly,
                          pumping up the
                          cuff with the
                          squeeze-ball)
                  Listen to me, jerk-off. I had a
                  mild heart attack and now it's
                  over. You understand?

     The Doctor nods vigorously, his eyes bugging out as the
     pressure around his neck increases.

                                VITTI
                  If anyone asks you, you never saw
                  me, and I was never here. Is that
                  clear?

                                 DOCTOR
                          (strangled)
                  Yes.

                                 VITTI
                  Good.
                         (to Jelly)
                  Take the chart.

     Jelly releases the Doctor, grabs all the papers and
     follows Vitti out the door.

21   EXT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER                                 21

     Vitti and Jelly come walking out the emergency room exit.
     Vitti stops.

                             VITTI
               Jelly, I need you to do something
               for me as my friend.

                                JELLY
               Anything.

                             VITTI
               You have to find me a doctor.

                             JELLY
               We just came from the doctor.

                             VITTI
               Not that kind of doctor.   I need a
               head doctor.

                             JELLY
               You're gonna change your face like
               Sonny Black? Don't get his nose
               though, he looks like a pig.

                             VITTI
               Not a plastic surgeon, ya spoostud.
               Do I have to spell everything out?

                                JELLY
               It saves time.

                             VITTI
               I need you to find me a
               psychiatrist.

                             JELLY
               Wow. This is like the Psychic
               Network or something. I just ran
               into a psychiatrist. Actually he
               ran into me.

                             VITTI
               Is he any good?

                             JELLY
               Yeah, he seemed like a smart guy.
               He had a business card and
               everything --

                             VITTI
               He had a card? That's a real
               fuckin' achievement.

                  What do you need a shrink for
                  anyway?

                                VITTI
                  It's not for me. It's for a
                  friend. This friend is having
                  some problems, so I'm going to ask
                  the shrink some questions and get
                  some answers for my friend.

                                  JELLY
                  Got it.

                                VITTI
                  And nobody can know. If anyone
                  hears I'm talking to a shrink, it
                  could be interpreted the wrong
                  way. You know what I mean?

                                JELLY

     Ben is with a patient, CARL ANDERSON, a high-strung
     milquetoast in his late forties.

                  Carl, I'm detecting a pattern
                  here. You seem to settle too
                  easily for things.

                                  CARL
                  You're right.    I do.

                                BEN
                  No, well, there you go. You
                  just did it again. I suggested
                  something and you immediately
                  agreed.

                  I don't know.

                                 BEN
                  Well, sometimes people do it
                  because they fear rejection or
                  disapproval, but you can't let
                  that worry you, Carl. And you
                  can't agree with things just for
                  the sake of agreeing. Stand
                  your ground. Don't let people
                  roll over you.

                  session.

     Jelly pulls a big roll of bills out of his pocket,
     removes the rubber band, and peels off a couple of
     fifties.

     Carl looks at the money, then he gives Ben a plaintive
     look.

                                BEN
                  Don't take it, Carl.

                  You're not that fuckin' crazy.

     Carl takes the money, gives Ben the thumbs up and
     exits. Jelly follows him to the door and waves for
     someone to come in.

                  Jelly, wait outside.

     Jelly exits. Vitti walks around the room, taking
     everything in. He picks up the phone and listens.          Hangs
     up.

                                    VITTI

                  Sure.

     Ben sits quickly on the coffee table. He crushes a box
     of tissues, then moves them out from under his ass.
     Vitti picks up a stack of CDS and looks through them.

                  wouldn't take it. Seriously, I
                  tried several times because it was
                  all my please don't kill me.

                                VITTI
                  I was just gonna ask if you liked
                  baseball.

                  Yes.   Big Yankee fan.

     Vitti puts the bat down.

                                BEN
                  Mr. Vitti. Not that it's your
                  fault, but your friend, he
                  interrupted a patient's session
                  and that's -- not good. I think
                  this is a matter for our insurance
                  companies, don't you think?

                                VITTI
                  I don't care about the car.

                                   BEN
                  Then what -- ?

                                VITTI
                  A friend of mine is having a
                  problem and he might have to see a
                  shrink, so I'm going to ask you a
                  couple questions. Do we sit?

                                BEN
                  Whatever makes you comfortable.

     Ben starts for his chair, but Vitti sits in it first.
     Ben sits on the couch. Vitti adjusts the cuffs of his
     shirt, and runs a hand down the crease in his slacks.

                                VITTI
                  Okay, the first thing I gotta know
                  about is privacy. You must hear
                  a lot of weird shit in here. How
                  do I know you won't go testifying
                  -- not testifying -- but, you know,
                  talking about it to somebody else.

                                BEN
                  I won't discuss a patient with
                  anyone for any reason, unless I
                  know the patient may be a danger
                  to himself. Like if I'm concerned
                  a patient might kill himself...

                                VITTI
                  Not fuckin' likely --

                                BEN

     Ben looks to Vitti for a response.    Vitti stares at him
     for a long, uncomfortable beat.

                                VITTI
                  I don't need therapy. I'm helping
                  out my friend. You didn't hear me
                  say that?

                                 BEN
                  Right.   I'm sorry.

                                VITTI
                  You guys are supposed to be so
                  great when it comes to listening.
                  You can't remember what I said two

                  I have to tell you, Doc, I'm not
                  thrilled with the level of service
                  up to this point.

                                BEN
                  Why don't you tell me about your
                  friend?

                                VITTI
                  He's a powerful guy. Never had
                  a problem dealing with things,
                  you know? Now all of a sudden,
                  he's falling apart. He cries
                  for no reason. He's having
                  trouble sleeping. And then he
                  started having these attacks. You
                  know, can't breathe, dizzy, chest
                  pains -- like you think you're
                  gonna die.

                  Right. So the question is, what
                  can he do to make it stop?

     Ben decides to go for it.

                   think you'd have to say that

                   'off-season' in Miami Beach this
                   summer. Now, on a personal note,
                   this is my last report for

                   Oh, I missed you.

                   I missed you too. Michael, say
                   hello.

                                 MICHAEL
                   Hi, Laura.

                                 LAURA
                          (a little too big)
                   This is Michael? I don't think so.
                   If I remember correctly, Michael
                   was a little boy, and this, this
                   is a great big kid. Hey, you.
                   Tell us what you did with Michael
                   Sobol.

      Ben and Michael look at each other out of the corners of
      their eyes.

                                LAURA
                   Okay. Come on. Give me a break.
                   I'm trying.

                                 MICHAEL
                   No, it was nice, but I'm fourteen
                   so it wasn't -- you know -- age
                   appropriate.

                                  LAURA
                          (smiles
                           appreciatively)
                   Sorry. Just smack me if I do that
                   again.
                          (hugs him)
                   How are you, Michael?

                                 MICHAEL
                   Great.

      There is an awkward silent moment, everyone smiling
      uncomfortably.

                                 BEN
                   Mike, you want to go look at the

                   Go ahead. If you break something,
                   don't worry. I'm out of here.

      Michael crosses to the camera crew.

                   You think he likes me?

                   Michael?   He's crazy about you.   I
                   am too.

      They embrace.

                   You are? And you still really

                   Of course.

                                 LAURA
                   But what if you get tired of me?
                   I know so many couples that were
                   really happy, then they got
                   married and just completely lost
                   interest in each other.

                                 BEN
                   That's not going to be us.

                                 LAURA
                   I just don't want to lose the
                   passion.

                                 BEN
                   Yes, I'm brimming with passion.

                   You know just screaming and
                   sweating and tearing at each
                   other all the time --

                   The sweating shouldn't be a
                   problem. The tearing sounds
                   painful.

      The SOUND GUY crosses over.

                   Uhh, Laura? You want me to take
                   your mic, or at least turn it off?

      Laura looks over at the crew. It's obvious that Michael
      and the crew have heard this whole exchange.

                                VITTI
                  I got news for you. I'm still
                  fucked up. Whatever you did the
                  other day, it didn't take. You
                  did nothing for me.

                         (indignant)
                  I did nothing? What did you
                  expect? I saw you for five
                  minutes. I don't work miracles,
                  Mr. Vitti. And I'll tell you
                  something else. I don't appreciate
                  it when someone breaks into my
                  hotel room and kidnaps me. I don't
                  go for that. I have a family and
                  a life and a serious practice, and
                  I don't have time for your

                  There was another time. But it
                  was after a big meal, so, you

                  Maybe not to you -- look at you --
                  but if I can't get it up, that
                  makes me less of a man and I can't

                  In my business I deal with
                  animals. They may seem dumb to an
                  educated guy like you, but make no
                  mistake about it, Doctor, animals
                  are very cunning. And they sense
                  weakness. Right now I'm an
                  injured animal. It's only a
                  matter of time before one of the
                  lions out there catches the scent.
                  Then I'm dead. That's the way it
                  is. If you don't understand that,
                  then you don't understand the life
                  I live and you don't understand
                  me.

                   up, you were gone, no note or
                   anything. I've been going out of
                   my mind, Ben. I walked all over

                   I told him I couldn't see him
                   again. He understood and it's
                   over.

31   INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION                               31

     This is Sindone headquarters. A few of his trusted guys
     are in attendance: HANDSOME JACK, POTATOES, and MOONY,
     his consigliere.

                             MOONY
               It doesn't figure. We take out
               Manetta, what does Vitti do?
               Nothing. Why doesn't he move?

     PRIMO SINDONE, a vain, pompous Mussolini, is standing on
     a stool in his underwear, being fitted for a suit by a
     nervous tailor.

                              SINDONE
               Fuck him.

                             MOONY
               I'm telling you, Primo, he's
               planning something big. The shit
               is really gonna come down.

                             SINDONE
               Then let it come down. Vitti's a
               tough guy but a lot of tough guys
               got fed to the crabs off Red Hook
               over the years.
                      (looking down at
                       the tailor)
               You been down there a long time.
               Are you measuring my inseam or
               contemplating a lifestyle change?

     Sindone nods for the tailor to get out.

                              MOONY
               Primo?   What about Vitti?

                             SINDONE
               Vitti. Vitti. The whole time we
               were growing up, he was the smart
               guy; I was the dope. My father
               was a nickel-and-dime shitheel;
               his father had it all. Vito
               Genovese blew it at Apalachin
               because he forgot to kill Gambino
               before the meeting.

                   I don't understand. They jump
                   out of the water, they splash,
                   they eat fish. It's not a real
                   stretch for a whale. If they
                   did a number from West Side
                   Story, then I'd be into it.

                  a jerkoff.

     TINO, a local Miami hitman, is covertly watching Ben and
     Vitti on the beach. He talks into a cell phone.

                                TINO
                  I don't know what they're doing.
                  He's talking to some guy. Looks
                  like Vitti is drawing something in
                  the sand... What's he drawing?
                  What am I, Superman? I'm a
                  hundred yards away -- I can't see
                  shit... No way, he's got that fat
                  Jelly with him and his partner,
                  Jimmy Boots. We could take him
                  out with a rifle and a scope, but
                  I don't have any of that shit with
                  me. My scope's in the shop...
                  Nah, it's a warranty item... Hey,
                  don't sweat it. You told me to
                  take care of him, I'll take care
                  of him... Okay, I'll call you
                  back.

                  a house.

                                BEN
                  I know. But usually when people
                  draw a house they draw people.

                  say hello, but the whole family's

                  It's very sad. What the fuck you

     They start walking.

                  I'm just speculating, but maybe in
                  some way you wanted him to die.

      Laura's family, the MacNamaras, and a few close friends
      have gathered for the rehearsal dinner. There are three
      tables in a roped-off section of the restaurant with large
      floral centerpieces, a small bar in the corner. The
      MacNamaras, SCOTT and BELINDA, are standing with Laura,
      Ben, Michael and a couple of other relatives.

                              BELINDA
                Well, isn't this wonderful, all
                of us finally getting to spend
                some time together.

                   Yes, thanks for going to all this
                   trouble, and I have to thank you
                   and the Captain for something

      Michael makes a face.

                          (to Ben)
                   Would you like a drink, because
                   I'm definitely having eight or
                   nine.

                   Shall we go to the table?

      As the woman go to their seats, Scott holds Ben back for a
      private moment.


                          SCOTT
                   Ben, there's a lot I'd like to
                   say to you, but I'm going to
                   skip the big father-in-law
                   speech because I know you've
                   been married before.

                   Technically, it wasn't considered a

                       (to Ben)
                Okay, listen. I had a really
                weird dream last night.

                              BEN
                I feel like I'm having one right
                now. How could you interrupt
                our party?

                              VITTI
                You know, you're very rigid about
                certain things.

                              BEN
                Just tell me the dream.

                              VITTI
                Okay. I'm asleep. I hear a baby
                crying. I go to the refrigerator,
                I get a bottle of milk, I take it
                to the baby, but when I go to give
                it to him, I see that the milk is
                black.

                              JELLY
                That's fuckin' weird.

                              VITTI
                Okay, get out of here!

                              JELLY
                Sorry.

      Jelly exits.

                               VITTI
                        (to Ben)
                What's it mean? And I don't want
                to hear any more filth about my
                mother.

                   does it mean to you?

                                 VITTI
                   This is what I'm paying you for? I
                   say something, you say it right
                   back to me? I could get Jelly to

                                 BEN
                   Then get Jelly.

      Ben starts to walk off the patio and comes face to face
      with Laura's father, Scott.

                                    BEN
                   Mr. MacNamara.

      Ben exits. Scott MacNamara stares suspiciously at Vitti,
      wondering about his connection to Ben.

      Jelly walks up to one of the bodyguards.

                   I'm gonna get something to eat.
                   You want like a sandwich or
                   somethin'?

                                  BODYGUARD
                   Yeah. What kinda sandwich isn't
                   too fattening?

                                 JELLY
                   A half a sandwich.

                                  BODYGUARD
                   Sounds good.

                                 JELLY
                   I'll be back in about twenty
                   minutes.

      The elevator arrives, Jelly gets in and the doors close
      behind him.

      The doors open and the Bodyguard turns to look. TWO
      SHOTS from a PISTOL with a SILENCER strike him in the
      chest and he falls to the floor dead. Tino steps out and
      drags the body to the stairwell.

      The guests are seated, Ben and Michael stand with the
      justice of the peace as Scott walks Laura down the aisle.
      The harpist is playing and all's right with the world.
      Scott shakes Ben's hand.

                              SCOTT
                       (quietly, to Ben)
                Nod your head and smile. Now, you
                listen to me, goombah. I know what
                your game is, and you'd better
                call it quits, because if you and
                your paisans do anything to hurt

      Using a stolen pass key, Tino quietly opens the door and
      enters. He steps into the living room and hears WATER
      RUNNING in the bathroom. He stealthily approaches the
      bathroom door and draws his pistol with a silencer on it
      from under his jacket.

                                                               70.

      Vitti stares at his reflection in the mirror, then starts
      washing his face. In the mirror we can see the door
      starting to open behind him, and the long barrel of
      Tino's pistol through the crack. Vitti blindly gropes
      for a towel and starts drying his face.


47    INT. VITTI'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME                               47

      Tino is about to shoot when Jelly comes up behind him,
      throws one strong arm around his neck in a powerful
      choke-hold, and grabs Tino's gun-hand with his free hand.

      Vitti hears the sounds of a scuffle, steps out of the
      bathroom, and sees Jelly struggling with Tino.

      Tino gets off a couple of wild SHOTS, but Jelly finally
      shakes the GUN loose from Tino's hand.

      Vitti picks up the gun and puts it to Tino's head. Tino
      shuts his eyes and turns away, expecting the shot, but
      then Vitti's hand starts to shake and he breaks into a
      cold sweat.

      Tino opens his eyes, sees Vitti frozen, and starts
      fighting with renewed strength. Jelly hangs on, looks at
      Vitti with concern, then wrestles Tino out onto the
      balcony.

      A beat, then a SCREAM is heard from above, then Tino
      crashes into a buffet table in the b.g. Wedding guests

     Jimmy and Jelly are hastily throwing clothes into
     suitcases. Vitti comes out of the bedroom hurriedly
     buttoning up his shirt.

                                LAURA
                  Thank you, but it's not about the
                  dress! We were supposed to get
                  married!

                                  VITTI
                  You're upset.

                                LAURA
                  Of course I'm upset!
                         (to Ben)
                  I'm going downstairs to pack, then
                  I'm going to New York and I'm
                  getting married with you or
                  without you. Okay?

                                BEN
                  I'll be right there.
                         (walks her
                          to the door)
                  Everything's going to be all
                  right. I promise.

     He kisses her and closes the door behind her.

                  Are you happy now?      You ruined my

                  What, you think I wanted this?
                  I'm the victim here! I swear,
                  I'm going to kill that
                  son-of-a-bitch!

     Vitti is on the phone, struggling to contain his rage.
     Ben watches.

                                SINDONE
                  What kind of feelings?

     of Ben and Paul Vitti taken in Miami and just about
     everywhere else.

                  So.   FBI.

                                AGENT STEADMAN
                  Can you explain these photographs,
                  Doctor Sobol?

                                BEN
                  I'm a psychotherapist.    Paul
                  Vitti is my patient.

                                LAURA
                  Was your patient.

                                  BEN
                  Right.   Was.   That's what I meant.

                                LAURA
                  But not like a real patient.

                                  BEN
                  Right.

                                PROVANO
                  So why did he send you that
                  fountain?

                                BEN
                  That was a gift to celebrate the
                  completion of his therapy. We
                  got our television from an
                  agoraphobic, so it's not that
                  unusual -- you know, maybe you
                  should discuss this with my
                  attorney.

                                LAURA
                  Yeah, maybe you should.

                                AGENT STEADMAN
                  Doctor Sobol, Paul Vitti is an
                  extremely dangerous man. We're
                  talking conspiracy, fraud,
                  extortion, racketeering,
                  grand theft, murder...

                                BEN
                  Well, yeah, but don't forget, the
                  man is a sociopath. You've got
                  to expect that kind of behavior --

     Ben looks out the window and does a double take.

                  would be my first choice. Can I

                  Honey, maybe the federal agents
                  would like something to drink?

     Ben rushes up to Isaac and Dorothy.

                              BEN
               Hi!   What a surprise.

     Ben kisses his mother as she stares at the fountain.

                             DOROTHY
               That certainly makes a statement.
               It's a little big for the yard,
               don't you think?

                             BEN
               What can I tell you, Mom? It
               looked much smaller in the store.

                             ISAAC
               Think it'll affect your water
               pressure?

                             BEN
               I think it'll affect the tides.
               What are you doing here?

               Your father and I are just very
               concerned about what happened
               in Florida.

                             ISAAC

               We got in last night, we couldn't
               sleep a wink. Is Laura inside?

                             BEN
               Yeah, but she and Michael are
               spending some time alone, you
               know, getting to know each other.
               That's important. I don't want
               to disturb that dynamic.

                             DOROTHY
                      (a beat)
               So you're not going to invite us

                  Well, I'm going to wait in the

     Dorothy crosses away.

                               ISAAC
                  All right. What's with you and

                                BEN
                  Well, Dad, I'm not at liberty to
                  discuss that.

                                ISAAC
                  He's your patient? Are you
                  joking? Have you thought about
                  what this could do to your
                  reputation?

                                BEN
                  You, know, I always wanted to be
                  great, but then I realized that I
                  might have to settle for just being
                  good enough. Now I've got this guy
                  who's hurting and I'm thinking that
                  if I can help this guy, maybe I can
                  be a little bit great.

                                ISAAC
                  Jesus, Ben, you're the one who's
                  going to be hurting. I want you
                  to stop seeing him.

                                BEN
                  Didn't you read your own book?
                  Instead of trying to run my
                  life, why don't you just close
                  your eyes, take a deep breath, tell
                  me what you feel, tell me what
                  you want.

                  You know why I became a shrink?
                  Because I grew up with a great
                  one walking around the house.

                                ISAAC
                  I thought you became a shrink
                  because you were sleeping with
                  your psychology professor at
                  Columbia.

                  Okay, so you were saying?

                                AGENT STEADMAN
                  Let me cut to the chase. Sometime
                  in the next week or so, the heads
                  of every major crime family in the
                  United States are going to meet
                  together somewhere in the New York
                  area.

     Ben nods, finally understanding Vitti's two week deadline.

                  We think the stage is set for a
                  major bloodbath. Has he mentioned

                  No. If he said anything about a
                  bloodbath, I probably would've
                  remembered it. Bloodbath is one
                  of those words that, you know,
                  stands out in a conversation.

                  can break into our home and
                  intimidate us? That ain't the
                  way it works here, boys. Whatever
                  he and Paul Vitti talked about is

64   INT. OLD LION SOCIAL CLUB - DAY                                   64

     Vitti is conferring with Sal Masiello, his consigliere.

                                 MASIELLO
                  Paul, I don't mean this in a
                  disrespectful way. You know I was
                  a good friend to your father and I
                  will always be a good friend to
                  you. But the word is out that
                  you've been talking to a shrink.
                  Is that right?

     Vitti shoots Jelly a sharp look.      Jelly looks away.

                                VITTI
                  What's the point here?

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 84.

                                MASIELLO
                  This concerns the whole family.
                  Right now, we're the only ones who
                  know about it, but if it gets out
                  on the street -- what then? Who
                  knows what you've been saying in
                  there?

                                VITTI
                  It's none of anybody's business
                  what I say in there.

                                MASIELLO
                  Paul, I beg to differ. If you're
                  doing this to establish some kind
                  of insanity defense later, that's
                  one thing. But everybody's gonna
                  think you're falling apart, and
                  that ain't good. They'll take it
                  as a sign of weakness, and that
                  makes us all vulnerable. Sindone
                  would take over everything.

                                VITTI
                  So what do you want me to do?

                                MASIELLO
                  It's time to end it.

                                VITTI
                  What do you mean, end it?

                                MASIELLO
                  Get rid of this shrink.   He knows
                  too much already.

                                VITTI
                  You want me to whack my doctor?

                                MASIELLO
                  If you don't do it, somebody else
                  will. It's the only way.

                                VITTI
                  No. Nobody touches him. You hear
                  me? Anybody lays a finger on him,
                  I'll kill 'em. Is that clear?

64A   FLASHBACK - EXT. STREET ON LOWER EAST SIDE - DAY              64A

      Vitti and Ben are walking down the street.   For some
      reason, Vitti is wearing a hat.

                              BEN
                I'm going to buy some fruit.
                You want anything?

                                VITTI
                No, go ahead.

      Ben crosses to a sidewalk fruit stand and starts picking
      out oranges. Vitti leans up against a car waiting for
      him to finish. SHOTS are FIRED. He runs toward the car.
      More SHOTS are FIRED. Ben is hit. Vitti pulls out his
      gun but he fumbles and drops it. The gunmen run off.
      Ben sinks to the pavement, mortally wounded. Vitti kneels
      next to him and sobs loudly. He puts his hand to his
      head, knocking off his hat.

                                VITTI
                Papa!   Papa!


64B   INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    64B

      Ben jerks upright in bed, knocked awake by the nightmare.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


65    HOLY WATER FONT                                               65

      Someone dips their fingers in.


      INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - NEXT DAY

      It's Vitti. He goes down on one knee and genuflects in
      front of a big crucifix. Ben wiggles his finger in the
      holy water, just kind of curtsies and waves at Jesus on
      the cross.

                              VITTI
                You look lousy. You all right.

                              BEN
                Listen, Paul, please don't send me
                any more gifts.

                              VITTI
                You didn't like the fountain?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                BEN
                  That's not the point.   It's a
                  boundary issue.

                                 VITTI
                  Boundary issue? I say if more
                  people gave from the heart, we'd
                  all be better off. Let's see your
                  watch.
                         (as Ben shows his
                          wrist)
                  Piece of junk. You're getting a
                  Rolex.

                                BEN
                  Don't buy me a Rolex.

                                VITTI
                  Who said anything about buying it?

     They cross to the main aisle of the church.

                                BEN
                  Listen, I really need to talk
                  to you.

     Ben stops cold. A casket sits in front of the altar.
     A funeral service is in progress.

                                VITTI
                  Tommy Angels. We grew up together.
                  Worked for a crew out of Jersey
                  City.

                                BEN
                  How did he die?

                                VITTI
                  He was on his way to talk to a
                  federal prosecutor. Got hit by
                  a truck -- twice.

                                BEN
                  Do I need to know that? I'm
                  having nightmares as it is.

     The funeral procession comes down the aisle.

                                BEN
                  Last night I dreamed we were
                  walking down the street, I stopped
                  to buy some fruit, and they shot
                  me -- like Brando in The Godfather.

                   Good scene.    Was I there?

      A mourner walks up to Vitti, bows his head in respect and
      kisses Vitti on both cheeks. Vitti on both cheeks. Vitti
      gives him a consoling pat on the shoulder, then the man
      kisses Ben and walks off.

                                 BEN
                   You dropped your gun, then you ran
                   over to me and started yelling,
                   'Papa, Papa!'

                                   VITTI
                   I was Fredo.    I don't think so.

      An older woman kisses Vitti's hand, then both his cheeks.
      Vitti whispers a few words to her, then she kisses Ben's
      hand and moves on. More old ladies kiss their hands as
      they walk by.

                                 VITTI
                   You're losing it, Doc.   You may
                   need therapy yourself.

      A man comes up to Vitti, kisses him on both cheeks,
      embraces him with excessive energy, then repeats the
      whole scene with Ben and exits. Ben looks at Vitti.

                                 VITTI
                   Him I don't know. Let's get
                   private.

                   Don't you see? You called me
                   'Papa.' It's all about your

                                 VITTI

                  milk dream was about, too.

                                VITTI
                  Uh-uh. I don't buy it. In my
                  dream, I'm bringing the baby
                  the black milk.

                  to hear about. I can't even call
                  my mother on the phone after that
                  thing you told me.

                                BEN
                  Let's say you are the baby. What
                  kind of milk did you get from

     Jelly and Jimmy walk away, leaving Ben alone with Vitti.

                                VITTI
                  You know why I have to do this,
                  don't you?

                                 BEN
                  Because you're a paranoid? No,
                  actually you're a reverse
                  paranoid. You think you're out to
                  get everybody.

                                VITTI
                  Don't bullshit me! You betrayed
                  me! You stabbed me in the back.

     They start shouting at each other.

                                BEN
                  I betrayed you? What are you
                  talking about? Who's got the gun?

                                VITTI

                  insult my intelligence. You
                  cooperated! You talked to the

                  They played me a tape! You said
                  you were going to kill me.

                                 VITTI
                  Never.   I never said that.

     They glare at each other for a moment.

                                BEN
                  It doesn't matter. I didn't
                  betray you, Paul. Yes, they
                  made me wear a wire, but I took it
                  off, because I think I know how to
                  help you now.

                                VITTI
                  I don't want to know what you

     Vitti emerges from behind the car looking red-eyed but
     composed again and looks at Ben.

                  Pretty fuckin' ironic, isn't it?
                  You can give me back the gun now,
                  Doctor.

     Vitti holds out his hand.      Ben hesitates for a moment,
     then hands him the gun.

                                VITTI
                  It's okay. I wasn't really gonna
                  whack you.
                         (off Jelly's
                          skeptical look)
                  All right, maybe I was gonna whack
                  you, but I was real conflicted
                  about it. Progress, right?

                                BEN
                  I don't think I can see you
                  anymore.

                  Yeah, I figured.

                  This was big tonight. You might
                  feel a little raw for a while.

                                  VITTI
                  Yeah.

     on the couch across from Ben. Ben looks bored and
     depressed.

                  I want to please him in bed, but
                  whatever I do it seems like it's
                  never enough. Now he wants me to
                  say things when we're making love.

                                ELAINE
                  Well, he wants me to call him 'big
                  boy.' And he's my bucking bronco,
                  and I'm supposed to ride him hard
                  and put him back in the barn wet.

     Michael's laughter is heard coming through the vent.        Ben
     closes his eyes and sighs deeply.

                                ELAINE
                  Are you all right, Dr. Sobol?

                                BEN
                  Let me suggest something, Elaine.
                  If the man wants you to say things
                  ... damn it, you should get down
                  on all fours and bark like a dog
                  if that's going to get the job
                  done. Break out the wine, baby.
                  Smoke a joint. Do what you have
                  to do, because life is too short.
                  It's just too fucking short.

     Elaine stares, taken aback, then she smiles.

                                ELAINE
                  Okay.

      the TV and starts knotting his tie as a PRUDENTIAL

                   We are put on this earth to find a
                   love, a soulmate, someone with whom
                   we can create joy. How glad we are

                   richer, for poorer, in sickness and

                                   JELLY
                    Hey!   Watch that.

                                  BEN
                    You just said it yourself.

                                  JELLY
                    It's different when I say it.
                    When you say it, it sounds very
                    negative.

                                  BEN
                    I'm sorry, Jelly, but I'm not going.
                    I'm not on the payroll anymore, so
                    forget about it. My wife is waiting --

                    Doc.

       Ben feels a gun pressed against his back.

                                   BEN

                    You can't shoot me, Jelly.

                                  JELLY
                    Correction. Mr. Vitti couldn't
                    shoot you. But here's something
                    about me you should know. I never
                    got married, Doctor Sobol. I
                    don't have a hobby. I never got a
                    dog or a cat. I don't even have a
                    goldfish. I live for one reason
                    only, and that's to serve Mr. Paul
                    Vitti. He's what I'm thinking about
                    when I wake up, and he's what I'm
                    thinking about when I close my eyes
                    to sleep. If he told me to jump off
                    a tall building, not only would I do
                    it, I would hope to survive so I could
                    do it again and again until he told me
                    to stop. This is all I know. This is
                    all I got. So please don't think I
                    won't kill you, because I'd hate for
                    your last thought to be a wrong one.
                    You're going to that meeting.

105A   INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY                                           105A

       Ben is in the back with Jelly and Jimmy. One of their
       crew, IRON MIKE, is driving. Ben is putting on a suit
       of Jimmy's. He looks very anxious.

                               JIMMY
                        (his shoulder bandaged)
                 Just remember. That's a fuckin'
                 $1200 Valentino suit. You spill
                 anything on it, I'll mess you up
                 good.

                               JELLY
                 Shut up. You're making him
                 nervous. If he gets nervous and
                 fucks up, they'll kill him for
                 sure.
                        (to Ben)
                 Let's go over it again.

                               BEN
                 This is insane.

                               JELLY
                 Mr. Vitti's been detained,
                 apologies all around, blah, blah,

                 consigliere, and you're prepared
                 to speak for Mr. Vitti.

                 If you have to talk, just be
                 vague. Can you do that?

      Vitti is lying on the bed staring at the ceiling. Marie
      is stroking his forehead. Then he looks over and sees
      Anthony sitting in a chair at the foot of the bed,
      watching him with concern.

                              VITTI
                Shouldn't you be outside playing
                or something?

                              ANTHONY
                No, it's all right.

                              VITTI
                How long you gonna sit there?

      Ben, Jelly, and Jimmy enter a garage the size of a small
      airplane hangar. The floor has been cleared and long
      tables set up to form a square in the middle of the room.
      Wiseguys with shotguns patrol the catwalks above the floor
      and soldiers are posted at all the doors.

                       (sotto voce)
                I can't do this. I'm telling you,
                I cannot do this.

                Don't fucking whine! Whining's a
                dead giveaway. Come on! You're

      Around the tables sit forty or fifty of the biggest
      gangsters in the world. A few captains stand around the
      perimeter, ready to serve their bosses.

                                 BEN
                   These are the bosses? That one
                   looks like my Uncle Max.

      Jelly steers Ben to an empty seat next to Carlo Mangano.

                          (surprised)
                   What's goin' on? Where's Vitti?

                                  JELLY
                   On his way.   Don't worry.

      Mangano eyes Ben with contempt.

                                 MANGANO
                   What's he doin' here?

                                 JELLY
                   He's -- it's okay. Forget about
                   it.

                                 MANGANO
                   Forget about it? What the hell is
                   that?

      Seated directly across the room from Ben is Primo
      Sindone. He stares hard at Ben, trying to place him,
      then leans over to Moony, his consigliere.

                                 SINDONE

      Moony stands up and gets everyone's attention.

                   All right, gentlemen. I think we
                   better start. We have a big
                   agenda, so for now let's stick to
                   the big issues. And it would help
                   if you identify yourselves when
                   you speak, since we don't all know
                   each other, and we didn't think
                   anybody would be into wearing any
                   fucking name tags.

      Laughter around the table.

      Sindone stands up and looks straight at Ben.

                                 SINDONE
                   I'm Primo Sindone. They call me
                   Sonny Long. It's good to see so
                   many of the old faces here, and to
                   welcome the new ones from all over
                   the country. I see Frank Zello,
                   and Joe Baldassare, but I'm a
                   little disappointed to see that
                   the head of our other New York
                   family isn't here today. All I
                   see is his man Jelly and some
                   sawed-off little prick nobody
                   knows.

      Jelly looks at Ben, waiting for him to speak, but Ben
      just sits, frozen, looking down at his hands.

                                 JELLY
                          (stands up, rattled)
                   Yeah, well, the thing is Mr. Vitti
                   has been detained and he sends his
                   apologies for -- being detained --
                   and he apologizes for his --
                   detainment.

                                 SINDONE
                   Detained? What kind of bullshit
                   is that? What's more important
                   than this? As the host of this
                   meeting, I take his not being here
                   as a sign of disrespect to me and
                   to all these other men, too, who
                   came a long way to be here.

                                 JELLY
                   Mr. Vitti meant no disrespect.
                   The thing is, he's not feeling
                   well. He's sick and he -- didn't

                   me -- 'The doctor.' As for your
                   second question. I'm here
                   representing Paul Vitti. As his
                   conser -- conghili --

                   Don't you ever correct me again!
                   As his consigliere, I'm intimately
                   involved in all aspects of the
                   family business and I'm prepared
                   to speak for Mr. Vitti on all
                   matters.

                                 SINDONE
                   Okay, Doctor, then let's get down
                   to business. Everybody knows
                   there's been this thing between me
                   and Paul Vitti for a long time.

                                 BEN
                   Which thing are you talking about?
                   The first thing or the second
                   thing?

                                 SINDONE
                   What second thing? I only know
                   one thing.

                                 BEN
                   Well, I don't see how we can
                   discuss the first thing without
                   bringing up the second thing.
                   Didn't you talk to the guy?

      He tugs meaningfully on his earlobe.

                                   SINDONE
                   What guy?

                                 BEN
                   The guy with the thing.

                                  SINDONE
                   What thing? What the fuck are you
                   talking about?

                                 BEN
                   How should I know? You brought it
                   up.
                          (gestures helplessly
                           to the others)
                   This is the whole problem. You
                   can't have an intelligent
                   conversation with the man.

                                 SINDONE
                   How about if I just break your
                   fuckin' neck? What do you think
                   of that?

                                 BEN
                   It's not important what I think.

                                 SINDONE
                   What do I think? I think it's a
                   good idea! Why would I say it if
                   I didn't think it was good?

                                   BEN
                   I don't know.    Why would you?

                           (frustrated)
                   I wouldn't! That's what I'm

                   feel you have to get angry to be
                   heard?

      Sindone turns to a couple of other bosses, FRANK ZELLO
      and JOE BALDASSARE.

                                 SINDONE
                   What's he talking about?

                                 ZELLO
                   I don't know. But you do have a
                   tendency to get angry a lot.

                                 BALDASSARE
                   I agree, Primo.

                                 SINDONE
                   I'm trying to talk about Vitti!
                   Why are we talking about me?

                                 SINDONE

                   when this prick won't stop with

                   That's it!   You're a dead man!

      Sindone whips out a pistol and points it at Ben, but just
      as he's about to shoot --

                                  VITTI (O.S.)
                   Primo!

109   PAUL VITTI                                                       109

      He's standing there, staring at Sindone, cool, clear, and
      unafraid. He looks like a king. The room goes silent.
      Vitti looks around the table, nods, and crosses to Ben.
      Jelly gets up to greet him.

                                 VITTI
                          (quietly, to Jelly)
                   Wait outside with the car running.

      Jelly nods and exits.

                                 BEN
                   What are you doing here?

                                 VITTI
                   Saving your ass. Sit down.    I'll
                   take it from here.

      Ben sits, greatly relieved.

                                 VITTI
                          (to the group)
                   I'm Paul Vitti. I'm sorry I was
                   late. Those of you who know me
                   will know I meant no disrespect.
                   If it's all right with you,
                   there's something I'd like to say,
                   then I'll leave you to your
                   business.

      Ben looks at Vitti and sees a kind of serenity and
      clarity he's never seen before.

                                 VITTI
                   About two and a half weeks ago,
                   somebody killed my friend, Dominic
                   Manetta.

      He looks straight at Sindone.

                                 SINDONE
                   Don't look at me. Everybody knows
                   you whacked him so you could take
                   over everything.

                                 VITTI
                   What I really came here to say is
                   that I've come to a very important
                   decision in my life. I want out.

      A great murmur of surprise sweeps around the room.      Ben
      looks at him proudly.

                                 VITTI
                   I'm going away for a while, but I
                   will respect the oath I took the
                   day I was made, and whatever I
                   know about anyone else's business,
                   I take with me to the grave. You
                   have my word.

      A negative buzz among the bosses.

                                 VITTI
                   As for my own organization, I know
                   Carlo Mangano would like to be the
                   new boss.

      Mangano smiles gratefully.

                                 MANGANO
                   Thank you, Paul.

                                 VITTI
                   That's why he betrayed Dominic and
                   me to our enemies and sent his own
                   man to kill me in Miami.

      Mangano is stunned.

                                 VITTI
                   But I leave it to my people to
                   deal with that and choose their
                   own boss. And even though it's my
                   right, I won't take revenge,
                   mostly because I'm in a good place
                   mentally and feeling good about me.

                   I don't know, Paul. I can see
                   where some people might have a
                   problem with this.

                                 VITTI
                   I realize that, so as an extra
                   token of good faith between us,
                   I've taken the liberty of writing
                   down everything I know and putting
                   it in a safe deposit box in case
                   anything happens to me or my
                   family.

      There's a long tense silence while the other bosses
      consider all this. Then, finally --

                   I don't know what anybody else

                   God bless, Paul.

                   Good luck, Paul. Salut.

      They all raise their glasses and toast Vitti.     Ben raises
      his glass to Vitti and drinks.

110   EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER                                   110

      Ben and Vitti come out of the building and cross to the
      car. Jelly is waiting, Iron Mike has the MOTOR RUNNING,
      and Jimmy is in the front seat with him.

      Sindone and Mangano come out with guns drawn, flanked by
      two wise guys.

      across the parking lot.

                   I don't want to do this, Primo.

                   of shit I always knew you were?

      Mangano stares at him, cold and hard.

                   I'm not gonna stab you in the
                   back, Paul. I want to see your
                   face when I do it.

                                 VITTI
                   I don't think so.
                          (calls out)
                   Mo-Mo!

      Mo-Mo stands up from behind a car pointing a shotgun at
      Mangano and Sindone.

                                 VITTI
                   Bigs!

      Johnny Bigs steps out from behind a shed holding an
      assault rifle.

                                 VITTI
                   Eddie!

      The back of a van opens to reveal Eddie "Cokes" and Tuna
      manning a military air-cooled machine gun on a tripod.

                                 VITTI
                   It's over, Primo. Now get the
                   fuck outta here.

      Sindone glares at him, then lowers his gun, turns, and
      starts to walk back into the building joined by Mangano
      and the soldiers.

       Vitti and Ben relax.

                                  BEN
                    Good thinking. I was going to
                    bring a machine gun but I don't
                    have one. Of course, we haven't
                    opened the wedding gifts yet.

       Suddenly, Sindone whirls and FIRES at Vitti.

       Ben staggers in front of Vitti and takes the bullet in
       the shoulder.

       An NYPD armored assault vehicle bursts through the gates.
       Police cruisers and SWAT vans come racing up to the scene,
       SIRENS SHRIEKING.

       Then, from out of the sky, the FBI helicopter descends,

      Agent Ricci, wearing a flak jacket and FBI baseball cap,
      has Sindone down on the ground with his foot on Primo's
      neck and a .45 aimed at his head.

                Hey!   Take a pill, Robocop.

      Vitti is tending to Ben who is on the ground leaning
      against the side of the limo.

                       (deeply moved)
                I can't believe it. You took a
                bullet for me. What doctor ever
                did that much for a patient? I'll
                never forget that.

                Paul -- I tripped.

                             VITTI
                Yeah. You tripped over your
                unconscious.

                   listens when I talk. She never
                   listened.

                   It makes me feel angry.

                   I'll bet you feel hurt, too, don't

                   Paul, what would you say about
                   what Donny's feeling?

                                 VITTI
                   Donny, when you're thirsty, you
                   don't go to the wall -- you go to
                   the well. You know what I'm
                   saying? Your mother may never be
                   able to listen to you, but you
                   have friends here who will.
                   Okay?

      Ben is proud of Vitti's new sensitivity.

                                 BEN
                   And be patient, Donny. Most
                   people's problems take months,
                   sometimes years to resolve.
