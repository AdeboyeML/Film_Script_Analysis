          In the darkness, we hear a voice, a woman's voice.  Her name
          is Evey.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November, the gunpowder treason and
                    plot.  I know of now reason why the
                    gunpowder treason should ever be
                    forgot."
          
          Her voice has a strength that is metered by a calmness, a
          deep centered peace that we can feel.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Those were almost the very first
                    words he spoke to me and, in a way,
                    that is where this story began,
                    four hundred years ago, in a cellar
                    beneath the Houses of Parliament.
          
          In the darkness, we find a lantern.  Guy Fawkes, a dangerous
          man who wears a goatee, is struggling with a wheelbarrow
          stacked with barrels of gunpowder.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to
                    blow up the Houses of Parliament.
          
          The wheelbarrow bumps over the heavy stone mortar of the
          cellar floor.  From the dark depths, we hear the sound of
          dogs.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    He was caught in the cellars with
                    enough gunpowder to level most of
                    London.
          
          Guy sees lanterns coming from both sides.  He tries to run as
          the dogs reach him first.  He grabs for his sword as dozens
          of pole axes pin him against the tunnel's stone wall.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Sometimes I wonder where we would
                    be if he hadn't failed.  I wonder
                    if it would have mattered.
          
          In the dim pre-dawn light, Guy is led to the gallows.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I suppose the answer is in the
                    rhyme.  More than the man, what we
                    must remember is the plot itself.
          
          The coarse noose of rope is snugged up to Guy's throat.  He
          looks into the crowd until he finds a face, a woman's face,
          staring up at him.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    For in the plot we find more than
                    just a man, we find the idea of
                    that man, the spirit of that man,
                    and that is what we must never
                    forget.
          
          The lever is thrown and the woman looks down, a tear falling
          down her face.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    This, then, is the story of that
                    idea, of that spirit that began
                    with an anarchist's plot four
                    hundred years ago.
          
          Guy's body hangs in silhouette, lifeless against a red
          morning sun.
          
                                                          FADE OUT.
          
          FADE IN:
          
          INT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE
          
          A young Evey sits on her father's lap, combing her Barbie's
          hair.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I was born near the end of the
                    millennium, the year 1997.  My
                    father used to say that people were
                    so afraid that the world was going
                    to end that they were willing it to
                    happen.
          
          Her father sits beside her mother on the living room couch,
          watching the news.  From the look on their faces, the news is
          bad.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I don't remember much of the
                    century's turn.  I don't remember
                    the market crash or the plague or
                    any of the Trafalgar riots.
          
          The television flickers with images of heavily armed soldiers
          fighting in a shelled city.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I've read about them since but I
                    don't recall how any of them
                    impacted my life except for the
                    fear.  They would hide it from me,
                    like a secret between them.
          
          Little Evey sees her father staring at her mother.  They
          take hold of each other's hand, clasping them tight.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    But I could feel it.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          It is a new day.  People are gathered along the street as if
          they were waiting for a parade.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Of the chaos that seemed to swallow
                    the beginning of the 21st century,
                    there is one thing I do remember.
          
          Evey holds her father's hand.  Unable to see what is coming,
          she can hear it.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Very clearly, I can remember that
                    sound.
          
          We hear them, hundreds of marching soldiers.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    And I remember those boots, black
                    leather that gleamed bright in the
                    morning sun.  I had never seen such
                    boots.  All moving in perfect
                    unison.
          
          Little Evey hides in the forest of adults, clinging to her
          father's leg, staring as row after row of boots march by with
          military precision.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          In the midst of a political rally for the emerging new party
          calling itself Norsefire, we find little Evey now on her
          father's shoulders.
          
          Dascombe, a young man, paces the podium, inciting the crowd.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    The time has come, London, to
                    return to a bygone age, an age of
                    tradition, an age of values that
                    have been disparaged and all but
                    forgotten.  What this country needs
                    is a leader!  A true leader to
                    remind us of that age.  A righteous
                    leader with the strength of his
                    moral convictions to do what must
                    be done.  I give you that man!  I
                    give you our leader!  Adam Susan!
          
          Adam Susan rises and the crowd cheers.  Evey's father looks
          at her mother and again they clasp hands.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    It must have seemed so easy to
                    them.  They offered such a simple
                    deal; give up control and we will
                    restore order.
          
          INT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE
          
          Little Evey is asleep in her bedroom.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    At first, the arrests were
                    political.  Dissidents.  Radicals. 
                    Liberals.
          
          A loud crash of splintering wood wakes her up.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    When my parents were younger, they
                    had been activists.  They had
                    marched with Labor in the great
                    train strike.
          
          The sound of heavy boots swarms through the house.
          
                              LITTLE EVEY
                    Mommy?
          
          Her bedroom door bursts open and a heavily armed soldier
          scoops her up.
          
          She is carried through the dark house which is filled with
          soldiers.  On the floor of the living room, she sees her
          parents being bound with plastic zip-ties.
          
                              MOTHER
                    My daughter!  Don't take my
                    daughter!
          
                              FATHER
                    Evey!  Evey!
          
                              LITTLE EVEY
                    Mommy!  Daddy!
          
          A heavy black hood is pulled over each of her parent's heads
          as Evey is carried out of the house.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I never saw them again.  Overnight,
                    my life, my entire world was
                    erased.
          
          INT.  BATHROOM
          
          A nun with a switch in her crossed arms watches as Evey and
          several other little girls scrub the floor of a dormitory
          bathroom.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    It was done so quickly and
                    violently, so completely, that it
                    began to seem that it had never
                    even existed.
          
          A tear rolls down Little Evey's cheek.
          
          EXT.  HOUSE
          
          A gay man is dragged violently from his Piccadilly home. 
          Outside, he sees his lover being forced to the cobblestones.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    The homosexuals were next.  What
                    God had started with AIDS had to be
                    finished by man.  It was God's
                    work.  That's what we were told.
          
          He reaches for him as the clubs rise and fall, vicious and
          bloody.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    But once they were gone, there was
                    someone else.  Someone different.
          
          In another neighborhood, we see the police arresting
          Pakistanis.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Someone dangerous.
          
          In a different area, young black men are packed into a caged
          van so tightly they are unable to move.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    There were those who understood
                    what was happening, who knew it was
                    wrong but who kept silent.
          
          A young detective named Finch looks down as the van pulls
          away.  When he looks up, another man in a military uniform
          whose name is Almond is watching him.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    And in the vacuum of that silence,
                    order was imposed.
          
          Finch sticks his pipe in his mouth and turns away.
          
          EXT.  STREET
          
          Again, we see the marching boots.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Order that was like those boots,
                    order that required rigorous
                    discipline.  Order that is exactly
                    the same, where each single step
                    falls with every step.  The order
                    of the many shaped into one.
          
          We move through the columns of marching soldiers to a wall
          where a poster has been plastered up.  The poster reads,
          "Strength Through Purity, Purity Through Faith."
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Somehow in my heart, I knew it
                    wouldn't last.
          
          As the sound of the marching fades, a shadow falls over the
          sign.
          
          After a moment, we hear the hiss of spray paint.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    What they thought they had crushed,
                    the spirit they believed trampled
                    and ground beneath the marching of
                    their boots, rose up, rose as if
                    from a four hundred year old grave,
                    rose to remind us all that day.
          
          The shadow sprays a "V" over the poster.
          
                                                          FADE OUT.
          
          FADE IN:
          
          Close on a loudspeaker.  There is one on every major street
          corner.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Good evening, London.  It's nine
                    o'clock, the fourth of November in
                    the year 2019 and this is the voice
                    of Fate broadcasting on 275 and 285
                    of the medium wave.
          
          Beneath the loudspeaker is a surveillance system labeled,
          "For your protection."
          
          Bubble eyed lenses iris at the end of stalks that move,
          insect-like, racheting and clicking as they watch a little
          girl pedal her bicycle.  The little girl glances nervously
          over her shoulder up at the mechanical eyes watching her.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    People of London, be advised --

          There is a radio on a small makeup table.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    -- that Braxton and Streathon are
                    quarantine zones as of today.
          
          Evey is now a young woman.  She slips into a dress that is
          little more than a nightgown.  She tries to adjust it,
          pulling it down at the hem, pulling it up at the thin
          shoulder straps, but it is like trying to hide behind a
          lamppost.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    It is suggested that these area be
                    avoided for reasons of health and
                    safety.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Another radio in a room that seems to be of another world.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Good news following the
                    productivity reports from
                    Herefordshire indicating a possible
                    end to meat rationing starting mid
                    February.
          
          A man enters the room as he once entered the world.  His body
          is lean and strong and though we do not see his face, there
          is a strength in his carriage, a power to his presence.
          
          INT.  EVEY'S APARTMENT
          
          She packs tissue paper into the toes of a pair of high heels
          that are too big for her.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Police raided seventeen homes in
                    the Birmingham area, uncovering
                    what is believed to be a major
                    terrorist ring.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          We move over a dressing bureau, past a wig and over a pair of
          black leather gloves, moving until we find the mask; it is
          like something from the masquerade ball of another era.  It
          has an exaggerated goatee, harlequin cheeks and a smile,
          forever fixed, at once be-guiling and be-deviling.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Twenty eight people, eight of them
                    women, are currently in detention
                    awaiting trial.
          
          INT.  EVEY'S APARTMENT
          
          Evey coats her lips with a lascivious red.  She stares into
          the mirror, her makeup like a mask over her own face.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    And that is the face of London
                    tonight.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          The man, now fully dressed in cloak, hat, and mask gazes into
          the mirror.
          
          This is V.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    And this is the voice of Fate
                    signing off and bidding you a
                    pleasant evening.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Close on Evey's high heels, stumbling and awkward as she
          walks down a dark cobblestoned street.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Close on V's boots walking in the opposite direction so that
          it seems they are walking towards each other.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I don't know what brought us
                    together that night.  I had never
                    been to that part of Westminster
                    but ever since I've known him, I've
                    stopped believing in coincidence.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Evey looks up and sees a man standing mostly in shadow.
          
                              EVEY
                    Excuse me?  Uh... excuse me,
                    Mister?
          
          The man turns around.  It is not V.
          
                              EVEY
                    Would you like... uh, would you
                    like to sleep with me?
          
          He smiles.
          
                              EVEY
                    I mean, for money.
          
                              MAN
                    That is the clumsiest bit of
                    propositioning I've ever heard.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, I'm sorry.
          
                              MAN
                    Is this your first time, darling?
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, no, I mean for money.  But I
                    know what you want and I'll do it.
          
          She presses her body to his, using her little girl eyes and
          her woman's mouth.
          
                              EVEY
                    Anything you want, mister.  Please,
                    I need the money.  I know I'm young
                    but I promise I know what I'm
                    doing.
          
                              MAN
                    No.  You don't know what you're
                    doing.
          
          He pulls out his wallet and shows her a badge.  The sight of
          it knocks the breath out of her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Christ, you're a Fingerman.
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    Give the little lady a prize.
          
                              FINGERMAN 2
                    I've got something to give her.
          
          Evey turns and there are more Fingermen behind her.
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    Prostitution is a class H offense. 
                    Know what that means?  It means
                    that we get to exercise our own
                    judicial discretion --
          
                              FINGERMAN 2
                    And you get to swallow it.
          
          The Fingermen laugh.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, please.  It's my first
                    time.  Please don't hurt me.
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    Gosh, fellas, look at those big
                    innocent eyes.  What do you think?
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    Spare the rod, spoil the child.
          
          Fingerman 2 laughs hard as he drops his pants.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh no!
          
          He shoves her face first against a brick wall, lifting her
          dress to expose her bottom.
          
                              EVEY
                    Please, don't!
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    You heard the man, sweetie.  This
                    rod's for your own good.
          
          Suddenly, they are no longer alone.
          
                              V
                    "The multiplying villainies of
                    nature do swarm upon him."
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    What the hell --
          
                              V
                    "And fortune, on his damned
                    quarrel, smiling, showed like a
                    rebel's whore."
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    We're police officers, pal.
          
                              FINGERMAN 4
                    We're with the Finger.
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    So bugger off!
          
                              V
                    "Disdaining fortune with his
                    brandished steel, which smoked with
                    bloody execution."
          
          In the clenched fist of black leather, we see a flash of
          steel.
          
                              FINGERMAN 1
                    He's got a knife!
          
          V attacks and at once we know this is no normal human being. 
          A single blow sends the largest of the Fingermen flying
          backwards.
          
          But more than his strength, it is his speed.
          
          A gun is cocked but before the hammer falls, a knife is
          buried in the Fingerman's chest and --
          
          Before the body falls, the knife is gone.
          
          It takes a handful of seconds and three bodies lay on the
          ground.  V turns to the last Fingerman who is struggling to
          pull his pants up.
          
                              FINGERMAN 3
                    Jesus Christ!  Don't hurt me!
          
          V steps forward and he screams, bolting while holding his
          pants up.
          
                              V
                    Good evening.
          
                              EVEY
                    Who -- Who are you?
          
                              V
                    Me?  I imagine all manner of names
                    shall be heaped upon my humble
                    visage but, for now, let us simply
                    say I am the villain.
          
          He throws wide his cloak and bows deeply to her.
          
                              V
                    And you would be?
          
                              EVEY
                    Evey.
          
                              V
                    Of course.
          
          They hear sirens rushing towards them.  In a blink, he scoops
          her up and dashes into the shadows of a narrow alleyway.
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOPS
          
          Police cars and several ambulances swarm over the area with
          the dead Fingermen.
          
          V watches them from above.
          
                              EVEY
                    Why did you do that?  Why did
                    you... help me?
          
                              V
                    Why indeed?
          
          He takes out an old antique pocket watch.  It is almost
          midnight.
          
                              V
                    Almost time.
          
                              EVEY
                    For what?
          
                              V
                    For the music.
          
                              EVEY
                    Music?
          
                              V
                    Yes, music.  My music.  You see. 
                    Evey, I am a performer.
          
                              EVEY
                    Is that why you're wearing a mask?
          
                              V
                    We all wear masks.  Life creates
                    them and forces us to find the one
                    that fits.  Do you know what day it
                    is?
          
                              EVEY
                    Uh... November fourth.
          
                              V
                    Not for long.
          
          He looks out where, rising above the rooftops, he can see Big
          Ben.
          
                              V
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November, the gunpowder treason and
                    plot.  I know of no reason why the
                    gunpowder treason should ever be
                    forgot."
          
          The second hand sweeps into the final minute.
          
                              V
                    Tell me, Evey, what good is an
                    actor that plays his part to an
                    empty theatre?
          
                              EVEY
                    I don't know.
          
                              V
                    Nor do I.  That's why you are here. 
                    I need you, Evey.  I need someone
                    to listen.
          
                              EVEY
                    To your music?
          
                              V
                    Yes.  Yes, to my music.
          
          From his sleeve, he pulls a conductor's wand.
          
                              V
                    Can you hear it?  It's already
                    begun.
          
          He begins to lightly tap the wand in the air and, very
          faintly, we hear it.
          
                              EVEY
                    I can't hear anything.
          
                              V
                    At first, you have to listen very
                    carefully...
          
          He continues to conduct and we begin to hear the music,
          violins and horns that seem almost like a whisper or a wind
          that steadily swells.
          
                              V
                    Ahh, yes.  There it is.  Beautiful,
                    is it not?
          
          He turns to the parapet, his gestures growing grander as the
          music rises and we recognize Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture.
          
          The music mounts a climax and V points the wand at Big Ben as
          cymbals crash --
          
          Big Ben explodes with such force the world seems to shake,
          while --
          
          V, smiling, always smiling, points again with another
          crescendo and --
          
          The statue of justice is blown to smithereens.
          
          V nods in appreciation while mustering the music towards it's
          finale as fireworks begin lighting up the sky.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh my...
          
          Everywhere across the city, people stand transfixed by the
          dazzling shimmer of the fireworks until --
          
          A strobing final blitz leaves a single, starry image floating
          in the smoke filled sky.
          
          It is the letter V.
          
                              EVEY
                    It's beautiful...
          
                              V
                    Thank you.
          
          From every direction, the city screams with the panicked
          sound of sirens.
          
          EXT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          A massive modern building that is the seat of the new
          government.
          
          A long, black car pulls up to the entrance.  Adam Susan gets
          out, wearing a long black trenchcoat over his pajamas.  He is
          the Leader and he looks older, heavier, and meaner.
          
          He hurries past the heavily armed guards, barely
          acknowledging the snap and cock of their Nazi-like salute.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader enters his main chambers and we see the Fate
          computer system.
          
          It is a cerebral cortex for a vast intelligence network. 
          Information can almost be felt coursing through its hard
          drives.
          
          The Leader sits, at once regaining a measure of composure. 
          He takes a deep calming breath and accesses the system.
          
          Dozens of monitors fill with images from all across the city,
          most of them are of the damage caused by V.
          
                              LEADER
                    Gentlemen, I will hear your reports
                    now.  Mr. Heyer, speak for the Eye.
          
          Conrad Heyer appears on one of the screens.  He is at his
          desk inside the command center for the Eye, the governmental
          organization responsible for the visual surveillance systems.
          
                              CONRAD
                    We have less than two minutes of
                    usable footage, Leader.  It took
                    the suspect less than a minute to
                    dispatch the Finger's vice patrol.
          
          On an insert screen, we see grainy footage of V rescuing Evey
          from one of the pole-mounted cameras.
          
                              CONRAD
                    As you can see, the suspect's
                    reflex speed is extraordinary.  As
                    is his strength.
          
          As the last body falls, V seems to pause and looks back over
          his shoulder straight into the camera.
          
                              LEADER
                    Freeze it!
          
          The Leader stares at the smiling face.
          
                              CONRAD
                    I'm afraid the mask makes retinal
                    identification impossible.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Etheridge, report for the Ear!
          
          Bunny Etheridge appears on another screen.  Behind him, huge
          spooling reels of audiotape wind constantly.
          
                              ETHERIDGE
                    We were able to triangulate the
                    origin of the fireworks.  We also
                    are currently monitoring a lot of
                    phone surveillance indicating a
                    high percentage of conversation
                    concerned with the explosions.  All
                    suspect or significant transcripts
                    are being forwarded to Mr. Almond.
          
                              LEADER
                    Very good.  Mr. Finch, speak for
                    the Nose.
          
          Finch, no longer the same young man, stands at the site of
          the fireworks launch.
          
                              FINCH
                    Thanks to Etheridge, we found the
                    launch for the fireworks.  These
                    appear to be individually weighted
                    flares and we have found traces of
                    the same chemicals at both of the
                    detonation sites which leads us to
                    conclude that, despite a level of
                    sophistication, these devices are
                    all home-made with over the counter
                    chemicals, making them impossible
                    to trace.  Whoever he is, Leader,
                    he's good.
          
                              LEADER
                    Thank you for that professional
                    annotation.
          
          An intercom opens.
          
                              LIEUTENANT (V.O.)
                    Leader, Mr. Almond has arrived.
          
                              LEADER
                    Very good.  Gentlemen, keep me
                    informed of any further
                    developments.  England prevails.
          
          They answer in unison as Almond enters the office.  His face
          is harder but he has the same violent gleam in his eye.
          
          The Leader turns in his chair.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Almond, do you know what this
                    is behind me?
          
                              ALMOND
                    Uh... the Fate computer system,
                    sir?
          
                              LEADER
                    No.  No sir.  It's more than that. 
                    This, this computer is a symbol,
                    Mr. Almond.  A symbol of the
                    highest attainable goal of mankind. 
                    Do you know what that goal is, Mr.
                    Almond?
          
          Almond does not.  The Leader leaps from his chair while
          pounding the desk.
          
                              LEADER
                    Control, Mr. Almond!  Control!  The
                    world around us is a changing,
                    directionless, amoral morass and it
                    is up to man and man alone to set
                    things right!
          
          He moves around the desk at Almond.
          
                              LEADER
                    Without control, man is nothing
                    more than any other stinking,
                    sweating, brute animal.  Control,
                    Mr. Almond.  The control that we
                    have painstakingly built up over
                    the last ten years.  Now, do you
                    understand what happened last
                    night?
          
                              ALMOND
                    We... lost control.
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, Mr. Almond.  Last night
                    someone did the unthinkable. 
                    Someone hurt us.  It is imperative
                    that we act swiftly and precisely. 
                    I want that man found, Mr. Almond. 
                    I want his head or, by god, I'll
                    have yours.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey is wearing a blindfold and V leads her by her
          fingertips, guiding her almost as if they were dancing...
          
          His fingers slip free of her and she reaches out.
          
                              EVEY
                    Wait.  I've lost you.
          
                              V
                    No, you haven't.
          
          He is behind her and he removes the blindfold, revealing his
          house to her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh...
          
          It is a labyrinth of interconnecting underground tunnels and
          rooms.
          
          The gallery is the main room as it is filled with an amazing
          collection of human culture.  There is art that spans from
          the renaissance to the painted covers of Eerie comics,
          literature that ranges from Shakespeare to Spillane,
          philosophy from Plato to Bukowski, and a vast collection of
          nonfiction.
          
          There are movie posters everywhere and an entire wall is
          lined with videocassettes.
          
          A jukebox stands in front of an enormous vinyl and CD
          collection of music.
          
                              EVEY
                    A jukebox?  Where did you get it?
          
                              V
                    I saved it.  Like everything here.
          
          She punches a button and Billie Holiday begins to sing.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh, it's beautiful.  I've never
                    heard anything like it.
          
                              V
                    Of course not.  You grew up in
                    their world.  Art is created by
                    individuals and there are no
                    individuals in a world where you
                    are told what to think.
          
                              EVEY
                    This place is amazing.
          
                              V
                    You're welcome to stay.
          
          She stops suddenly and looks at him.  The offer is terribly
          exciting but it is so unlike anything she has ever done that
          it's almost impossible to imagine.
          
                              EVEY
                    Stay here... with you?
          
                              V
                    Yes.  If you like.
          
                              EVEY
                    I... I don't even know your name.
          
                              V
                    I don't have a name.  But you can
                    call me V.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?  V... I like that.
          
          And she returns his smile.
          
          EXT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          The only operating broadcast tower in London; home of the
          Mouth.
          
          INT.  RADIO BROADCAST BOOTH
          
          Lewis Prothero leans forward and lets his voice pour like
          syrup over the microphone.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Good morning, London.  This is the
                    voice of Fate -- Damn.
          
          He stops and coughs.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Good morning -- ack.  Good morning
                    Lond-- Goddammit!  Where is my
                    bloody tea?!
          
          In the control booth, Roger Dascombe, his hair thinner now,
          rubs his temple.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Would someone get his lordship his
                    bloody tea?
          
          He clicks on the microphone.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Lewis, they want this report on the
                    first hour --
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I know.  I know.  Damned
                    inconvenient this entire affair. 
                    Fine.  Let's try again.
          
          He clears his voice and the red "record" light turns on.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Good morning, London.  It is 6 am,
                    the fifth of November 2019 and this
                    is the voice of Fate.  The new day
                    brings good news and bright
                    prospects from overseas, where
                    negotiations with New China are
                    moving in a positive direction. 
                    Last night's scheduled demolition
                    of two deteriorating landmarks went
                    off without a hitch.
          
          Dascombe is unable to stop himself from smiling.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Spokesman for the Interior ministry
                    said both structures were severely
                    damaged and judged to be a danger
                    to the unsuspecting public.  Plans
                    for new landmarks are well
                    underway.
          
          Prothero sits back, shaking his head.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Do you believe this crap, Dascombe?
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    It's not our job to believe it,
                    Lewis.  Our job is to tell the
                    people --
          
                              PROTHERO
                    "Exactly what they tell us."  I
                    Know but do you think that people
                    will believe it?
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    They will if it's you that's
                    telling it to them.  Now let's try
                    it again.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V is alone, listening to the first morning broadcast.
          
                              PROTHERO (V.O.)
                    ... plans for new landmarks are
                    already well underway.
          
          He clicks off the radio.  Walking down a hall, he stops and
          peers into Evey's new bedroom.
          
          She is fast asleep, looking remarkably at peace.  Quietly, he
          shuts the door.
          
          EXT.  TRAIN STATION
          
          People are hurrying to board a departing train.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Prothero is staring out his window.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November..."
          
          He talks to his bodyguards almost as if talking to himself.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Do you suppose that's why he did
                    it?
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    Sir, who did what, sir?
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Guy Fawkes.  He tried to blow up
                    Parliament.
          
          The guards look at each other, confused.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Don't they teach history in school
                    anymore?
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    Sir, we're both straight military,
                    sir.
          
                              BODYGUARD 2
                    Sir, yes, sir.  I was fighting in
                    Ireland by the time I was sixteen.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Yes, of course.  My mistake.
          
          He turns back to his window.
          
          EXT.  RAILROAD
          
          The train rumbles along, heading for a tunnel.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Prothero watches the countryside rolling past.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I love trains.  I remember riding
                    the underground with my father. 
                    Shame they shut them all down.
          
          Bodyguard 1 looks out the opposite window just as the train
          enters the tunnel.
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    What the hell's that!
          
          EXT.  TRAIN
          
          For a flashing instant, we see V in silhouette, cloak
          swirling around him like dark wings as he jumps from the
          bridge onto the train.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Prothero and Bodyguard 2 stare at Bodyguard 1.
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    I thought I saw a man jumping onto
                    the train.
          
                              BODYGUARD 2
                    The train's doing almost seventy. 
                    It would break his legs.
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    You're right, I... It must have
                    been rags.
          
          EXT.  TRAIN
          
          Deep in the tunnel, a dark figure glides across the rooftops.
          
          INT.  CONDUCTOR'S CAB
          
          The conductor hears something on the roof.  He peers up just
          as V swings down, smashing feet first into the cab.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          The brakes suddenly lock, throwing Bodyguard 2 into Prothero.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Get off of me!
          
          A moment later, the lights are cut off and the entire train
          is plunged into complete darkness.
          
                              BODYGUARD 2
                    What the fuck is going on?
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    Lock the car doors.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I have a lighter... somewhere...
          
                              BODYGUARD 2
                    I can't find the lock -- wait.  Hey
                    wha--
          
          There is a muffled shriek followed by a sharp snap.
          
                              BODYGUARD 1
                    What's happening --
          
          There is another sound, like the leather slap of a boxer
          pounding a heavy bag, followed by the sound of the heavy bag
          collapsing onto the floor.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I found it!
          
          He flicks on the lighter and, in the dim light of its flame,
          he sees the smiling face.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Oh god.
          
          V sits casually, arms folded, across from Prothero.  The
          bodyguards lay dead on the floor.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Who are you?  What do you want? 
                    Money?  Is that it?
          
          V just smiles.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Wait, wait.  You're, you're the one
                    that blew the Bailey.
          
          V nods and Prothero's eyes go wide.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    You're making a mistake.  I'm
                    nobody --
          
          On the floor, he sees the bodyguard's gun.  He kills the
          lighter and dives for it.
          
          In the darkness, we hear the struggle.  It ends quickly. 
          When the lighter flicks back on, V is holding it and the gun.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Oh god, what do you want?
          
                              V
                    I've come to offer you a choice. 
                    Commander Prothero.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    What -- What did you call me?
          
                              V
                    Commander Prothero.
          
          Prothero's heart begins to pound.
          
                              V
                    That was your title at Larkhill. 
                    You remember Larkhill, don't you,
                    Commander?
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL RESETTLEMENT CAMP - FLASHBACK
          
          A sign reads, "Larkhill Resettlement Camp."
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Where they sent the undesirables.
          
          A caged truck packed with minorities rolls into the gates
          which are topped with spools of razor wire.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Prothero is sweating.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I don't know what you're talking
                    about.
          
                              V
                    Maybe I can help your memory. 
                    Let's see.  Larkhill opened in the
                    summer of 2009.  You were appointed
                    it commander.  You wore a uniform
                    in those days.  You looked very
                    good in it.
          
          INT.  LARKHILL - PROTHERO'S OFFICE - FLASHBACK
          
          Prothero admires his uniform in the mirror.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    You were a man of many
                    responsibilities.  You made sure
                    Larkhill made all its quotas,
                    especially the oven quotas even
                    though they required an excessive
                    amount of maintenance.
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL OVENS - FLASHBACK
          
          We see a detail of black and Indian men, shoveling mounds of
          black ash from a series of furnace like ovens.
          
          As the shovels lift, we see blackened bones and burnt skulls.
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL MAIN YARD - FLASHBACK
          
          Prothero saunters through the lines of camp prisoners.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    But there was one task you took to
                    with exceptional relish.  Remember
                    the medical block, Commander?  I
                    believe you called it the funny
                    farm.  You were the one that
                    selected the prisoners.  You hand
                    picked each one.
          
          Prothero steps in front of a woman who remains beautiful
          despite the suffering she has endured.  Prothero smiles.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Her.
          
          As the guards grab her, we become aware of a man that is
          staring at Prothero.  He is one of the prisoners but we do
          not see his face.
          
          Prothero notices the man.  He doesn't like the way the man is
          staring at him.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    You.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Prothero is terrified.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    You!  You're him, aren't you?
          
          V nods.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Oh my god!  What are you going to
                    do?
          
                              V
                    You gave us a choice, remember,
                    Commander?  You said we could
                    cooperate with the doctors or...
          
          V cocks the gun.
          
                              V
                    Hold out your hand.
          
          Trembling, Prothero sticks out his hand.  V lets the light
          die for a moment.
          
          When he flicks it back on, Prothero is holding a long, metal
          syringe filled with a murky liquid.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Oh no, no!  Please I was just doing
                    what I was told!
          
                              V
                    Of course you were.  Now I'm
                    telling you to make a choice. 
                    Either you stick that syringe into
                    your neck or --
          
          He presses the gun barrel to Prothero's forehead.
          
                              V
                    I can kill you right now.
          
          Prothero begins to blubber.
          
                              V
                    Crying doesn't help, Commander.  I
                    remember there was a woman who had
                    been screaming for two days.  You
                    winked at the doctor and laughed,
                    "All in the name of science."
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Please, don't make me do this...
          
                              V
                    It's a difficult choice, isn't it? 
                    Certain death versus something that
                    might be... worse.  But you never
                    know.  There is still a chance. 
                    You could survive.  Look at me. 
                    Now, time's up, Commander.  Choose.
          
          Anger galvanizes his fear and steadily Prothero lifts the
          needle towards his neck.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    I'll see you in hell.
          
          He jams the needle in and sinks the plunger.
          
                              V
                    Yes.  I'm quite sure you will.
          
          INT.  TRAIN
          
          Train workers with flashlights hurry through the cars.
          
                              TRAIN MAN
                    This door's locked!
          
          He slams a shoulder against it and the door gives in.
          
                              TRAIN MAN
                    Holy Christ!
          
          Flashlights sweep over the dead bodyguards.  The train man
          hears a strange gurgling rasp and he turns, finding Prothero
          in his light.
          
                              TRAIN MAN
                    What happened here?
          
          Prothero is foaming at the mouth while a thick mucus bubbles
          from his nose.  His breath comes in tiny rasps.
          
                              TRAIN MAN
                    Good lord!  I need a medic here.
          
          Prothero becomes more animate, trying to tell the man
          something.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Fi... Fi... Fi...
          
                              TRAIN MAN 2
                    He's trying to say something.
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Five.
          
                              TRAIN MAN 1
                    Five?  Where's the goddamn medic?
          
                              PROTHERO
                    Room five.
          
          Suddenly, his body convulses and blood pours out his ears. 
          His body slumps over.
          
                              TRAIN MAN 2
                    I think he needs a priest.
          
          EXT.  TRAIN STATION
          
          The station is swarming with police.  A stretcher wheels a
          body in a black plastic bag out from Prothero's car.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Finch puffs on his pipe, staring at something spray painted
          on the wall of the train car: a "V" with a circle around it.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    What do you make of this, Mr.
                    Finch?
          
          Dominic, Finch's younger assistant, is holding a flower in
          his rubber gloved hand.
          
                              FINCH
                    Hmm.  It's a rose.  A violet
                    carson, I believe.  Strange.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Strange?
          
                              FINCH
                    I didn't think they still existed.
          
                              SOLDIER
                    Mr. Finch!  Sir!
          
          Finch turns as a soldier with a radio steps into the car.
          
                              SOLDIER
                    Sir, they want you at headquarters,
                    sir.
          
                              FINCH
                    Now?
          
                              SOLDIER
                    Yes, sir.  I'm to transport you
                    immediately.
          
                              FINCH
                    Send the rose to the lab.  Also,
                    scrape a sample of this paint and
                    have it analyzed as well.  I'll be
                    back as soon as I can.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The door opens and Finch steps in.
          
                              LEADER
                    Ah, Mr. Finch.  I sent for you
                    because what I have to say cannot
                    be said over a phone or a radio. 
                    What I have to say cannot leave
                    these four walls.  Do I make myself
                    clear?
          
                              FINCH
                    Yes, sir.
          
                              LEADER
                    I believe in a few things, Mr.
                    Finch.  I believe in god.  I
                    believe in the destiny of the
                    Nordic race.  And I believe in
                    fascism.  The romans invented
                    fascism.  They had a symbol for it;
                    a bundle of twigs bound together. 
                    One twig could be broken but a
                    bundle would prevail.  That is the
                    heart and soul of fascism. 
                    Strength in unity.  I tell you
                    these things knowing full well that
                    they make you uncomfortable.
          
                              FINCH
                    Well, I...
          
                              LEADER
                    You have in fact expressed your
                    discomfort in several arrest
                    reports, arrests that were, in your
                    opinion, "unnecessary."  The fact
                    that you are here, that you are not
                    rotting in a prison cell, is a mark
                    of my respect and admiration for
                    you, for your craft, and for what
                    you have done for this country.
          
          Finch looks at the ground.
          
                              LEADER
                    It is also because I know you,
                    Finch.  I know what you are. 
                    You're a man like me.  A man who
                    understands when they are given a
                    job what must be done.  I
                    understand you, Finch, and that is
                    why I can trust you.
          
          He moves in close to Finch.
          
                              LEADER
                    This terrorist knows us, Finch. 
                    These attacks are perfectly
                    calculated and they are divisive. 
                    He knows what he's doing, Finch. 
                    He knows us all too well.
          
                              FINCH
                    You think he's an insider?
          
                              LEADER
                    What I think is that this man must
                    be stopped.  Stopped at all costs
                    and no one, I repeat, no one is to
                    be placed above suspicion.  Do I
                    make myself clear?
          
                              FINCH
                    Perfectly.
          
                              LEADER
                    England prevails, Mr. Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    England prevails.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey, alone in the Shadow Gallery, stares up at the
          inscription above the crooked staircase.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, v, v, v, v.
          
                              V
                    I hear your summons, my lady.  And
                    obey.
          
          She jumps, V suddenly appearing behind her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh, V, you scared me.
          
          She turns back to the carving.
          
                              EVEY
                    I was reading the inscription. 
                    What is it?
          
                              V
                    A Latin quotation.  A motto.  "Vi
                    veri veniversum vivus vici."  "By
                    the power of truth, I, while
                    living, have conquered the
                    universe."
          
          She nods.
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, I suppose you have.  This
                    place is the only universe I have
                    right now.
          
                              V
                    Does that bother you?
          
                              EVEY
                    I don't know.  I'm so grateful to
                    you -- I just feel I should help
                    you, you know, the way you're
                    helping me.  I mean, that's the
                    deal, isn't it?
          
          V drifts over to the big old Wurlitzer, fingers scanning the
          song list.
          
                              V
                    No deals, Evey.  Not unless you
                    want them.
          
          She looks up at the inscription as an old blues song begins
          to play.
          
                              EVEY
                    I think I do.  Part of me wants to
                    stay here forever and never have to
                    face what's going on outside.  But
                    that's not right.  Is it?  That's
                    not taking responsibility.  Not
                    conquering my universe.
          
          She turns to him.
          
                              EVEY
                    I want to help you, V.  I want to
                    do something.  Can we make a deal?
          
                              V
                    Yes.  I think we can make a deal if
                    you like.  I think I know a way you
                    could help me very soon indeed.
          
          Evey smiles nervously.
          
                              EVEY
                    Good.  That's that, then.
          
          The blues song curls in the air around them like a heavy
          incense.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, you said that Latin thing was a
                    quote.  Who said it?
          
                              V
                    Nobody you'd have heard of.  A
                    German gentleman named Dr. John
                    Faust.
          
          He spins her.
          
                              V
                    He made a deal too.
          
          EXT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY
          
          The church doors have opened with the flow of parishioners as
          the final mass of the day has ended.
          
          The tide slowly pours out onto the sidewalk, separating
          around the clumps of people that conglomerate to network and
          gossip.
          
          Church bells toll in the orange dusk above them.
          
          Helen Heyer, a woman whose spite and guile are hidden behind
          her looks and clothes she drapes them with, charges into the
          gossipers, her trophy husband in tow, a timid looking man
          that we recognize as Conrad Heyer.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Hello, Rosemary.  Derek, how --
          
          Helen's head snaps over at the mention of the name.
          
                              HELEN
                    Derek!
          
          She pushes past Conrad, giving Derek Almond an exuberant kiss
          on both cheeks.
          
                              HELEN
                    Darling, how are you?  Hello,
                    Rosemary.
          
          Always behind her husband, Rosemary Almond smiles nervously
          as she straightens her drab church dress.
          
                              ROSEMARY
                    Hello.
          
                              DEREK
                    It's so good to see you.  Since
                    this bloody terrorist business, the
                    old man has me literally chained to
                    the office.
          
          Helen pouts at him.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh, you poor dear.
          
          Derek taps the bottom of his cigarette box, drawing one with
          his lips.
          
                              DEREK
                    It comes with the job.  How are
                    things in the Eye, Conrad?
          
                              CONRAD
                    Well, we've been working some bugs
                    out of the new Mark IX fiber optic
                    network, actually --
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh, Conrad, don't be such a bloody
                    bore.  Do tell us about the
                    terrorist, Derek.  Is it true he
                    blew up Big Ben and the old Bailey?
          
                              DEREK
                    I'm afraid so.  We're dealing with
                    a pathological psychotic in the
                    most extreme case.  We'll catch him
                    though.  I promise.
          
          Helen rubs her white sable against her body.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh, it sounds dreadfully exciting. 
                    Aren't you glad you've got such a
                    ruthless, implacable brute for a
                    husband, Rosemary?
          
                              ROSEMARY
                    Yes, well --
          
                              HELEN
                    Believe me, you're lucky.  You
                    could be struck with a professional
                    peeping tom like Conrad.  England's
                    highest paid voyeur, aren't you
                    darling?
          
                              CONRAD
                    Helen, I think we'd better --
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh yes, of course.  We have to get
                    back so the little pervert can
                    watch what the neighbors do after
                    Sunday lunch.  He's so exciting.
          
          Derek laughs as they climb into their car.
          
                              HELEN
                    Ciao!
          
                              DEREK
                    Goodbye, Helen.  Conrad.
          
          Rosemary waves as it pulls off.
          
                              ROSEMARY
                    She's a bit hard on him, isn't she?
          
          Derek sneers at her.
          
                              DEREK
                    Until you're half the woman of
                    Helen's sophistication, I'd keep
                    your little mouth shut.
          
          He throws the cigarette at her feet.
          
                              DEREK
                    Really, just look at the way you
                    dress.
          
          INT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY
          
          From above, a hand sweeps aside the red plush curtain.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Ah, there they go.  My happy and
                    contented flock.  Spiritually
                    refreshed and ready to face the
                    world again.
          
          Bishop Anthony Lilliman is a slender man of pious elegance
          with a warm, beautiful smile.
          
          He turns from the window to his valet, Dennis, as Derek and
          Rosemary get in their car.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Did you enjoy the sermon today,
                    Dennis?
          
                              DENNIS
                    Very inspiring, your grace.  Though
                    the segue of the forces of Satan
                    among us did strike me as a bit of
                    a curious digression.
          
          He whisks a lint brush over the Bishop's robes before putting
          them away.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Hmm, yes.  A trifle purple, I
                    thought.  Still, Fate wanted it
                    included and who are we to question
                    the will of the almighty, miserable
                    sinners that we are?
          
          A gentle smile spreads across his mouth.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    And speaking of sin, I wonder which
                    of the seven deadlies the good lord
                    will see fit to tempt me with
                    today.
          
          Dennis finishes with the Bishop's robes and sweeps the closet
          door shut.
          
                              DENNIS
                    Perhaps pride, your grace.
          
          Lilliman chuckles.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    I was thinking of something a
                    little less ethereal.  Has the
                    young lady arrived?
          
                              DENNIS
                    The agency informed me she'll be
                    here directly.  However, there was
                    a mixup.  It's not one of the usual
                    girls.  She's a little older.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Oh dear.  Oh dear.  Not too old, I
                    trust?
          
                              DENNIS
                    They promise me she's no more than
                    fifteen.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Fifteen, hmm.
          
          The Bishop rubs his cheek, ponderously.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Ah well, if Job could bear his
                    disappointments, I suppose I must
                    have the good grace to bear mine. 
                    Show her in when she arrives.
          
                              DENNIS
                    Yes, your grace.
          
          EXT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
          
          A pair of headlights melt through the heavy night's fog as a
          taxicab pulls into the circle drive.
          
          INT.  BISHOP'S QUARTERS
          
          Dennis peers into the Bishop's living quarters.
          
                              DENNIS
                    The young lady, your grace.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Oh my!
          
          Standing next to Dennis is Evey, wearing a frilly pink summer
          dress, pigtails and bows and white ruffled socks.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    And to think I doubted your
                    loveliness for even an instant. 
                    Mea culpa, my child, mea culpa. 
                    You are a vision.  An angel.
          
          Evey smiles awkwardly.
          
                              EVEY
                    Uh... thank you.
          
          EXT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
          
          A shadow begins moving across the manicured grounds borne on
          the thick mist like a dark phantom.  V glides toward the
          rectory, cloak undulating against the dark, wet wind.
          
          INT.  BISHOP'S BEDROOM
          
          It is extravagantly furnished, somewhere between posh and
          pimp.  The Bishop is sitting very close to Evey on his plush
          water bed.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Of course, "hate the sin, love the
                    sinner."  I always say.  Take your
                    dress off, please.
          
          Evey stammers, backing up along the bedside.
          
                              EVEY
                    Listen -- I was kind of hoping --
          
          He paws at her, groping hands pushing the front of her dress
          down as she backs up against the nightstand.
          
                              EVEY
                    No --
          
          EXT.  MAIN GATE - NIGHT
          
          The guards look out into the night, fear suddenly gripping
          their faces.
          
          V emerges demonically through the parting veils of fog, the
          white smiling mask bobbing eerily up and down as he rushes
          them.
          
          A cigarette drops from the first guard's mouth, red embers
          exploding when it hits the wet cement.
          
          Close as the two guards claw for their arms and the white hot
          flash of V's knives --
          
          That slice like talons.
          
          The two men crumple to the ground, clutching their gaping,
          gurgling wounds.  A whisper.  V sprints into the courtyard.
          
          INT.  BISHOP'S BEDROOM
          
          Evey grabs a metal table lamp and swings it down on the
          Bishop's head.  There is a shuddering clank and he collapses
          to the floor.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    You -- You filthy whore!
          
          His blood speckles the white bearskin throw rug as the Bishop
          slowly rises after the retreating Evey.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    I'll kill you, you fucking sow.
          
          He charges after her but freezes dead in his tracks as V
          swings around the corner in front of him.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    What's this?  Who --
          
                              V
                    Please allow me to introduce
                    myself...
          
          V bows.
          
                              V
                    I'm a man of wealth and taste.
          
                              LILLIMAN
                    Dennis?
          
          Instantly, the point of one of V's knives is against the
          Bishop's throat.  V presses a finger to his frozen smile.
          
                              V
                    Shh.  It isn't polite to disturb
                    the dead on their journey.
          
          Evey watches from around the corner.
          
                              V
                    A courtesy I'll most respectfully
                    extend to his grace.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?
          
          Lilliman swallows audibly.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, what are you doing?
          
                              V
                    Vi veri veniversum vivus vici,
                    Evey.
          
          Evey looks down at the knives on his belt, dripping blood.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh no.
          
          She begins backing to the door.
          
                              EVEY
                    You can't kill him!
          
                              V
                    Death has followed his grace the
                    whole of his career.  Is it any
                    coincidence it has finally followed
                    him here?
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, V.  I can't -- I can't --
          
          V turns back to Lilliman as Evey runs.
          
                              V
                    Let us pray.
          
          EXT.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
          
          Evey sprints past the dead guards at the man gate and into
          the fog.
          
          INT.  THE EAR
          
          A cramped control room that looks like something between a
          radio and television switching room, though it does not
          broadcast.  It receives.
          
          Two operators sit at the main substation as the sounds of
          lovemaking come over the speakers.  The moans are stifled and
          low, however, as if they were afraid someone was listening.
          
                              OPERATOR 1
                    Bloody hell.  Doesn't anybody fuck
                    with feeling anymore?
          
          Operator 2 does not look at him, scrolling through an
          intricate city map on his computer.
          
                              OPERATOR 2
                    Hey, it's Sunday.  Children's hour
                    over at the Abbey.
          
                              OPERATOR 1
                    Let's see what that filthy old
                    pervert is up to.
          
          Operator 1 punches in some coordinates and the sound over the
          speakers changes to a garbled fart of noise.  Two voices
          drown beneath a cacophony of classical music.
          
                              OPERATOR 1
                    What the --
          
          He tries to dial out the background and suddenly the voices
          rise clearly above the din.
          
                              VOICE 1
                    ... And I saw a black shape against
                    the flames.  Oh god.  It's you. 
                    The man from room five.  You've
                    come --
          
                              VOICE 2
                    To collect what's mine.
          
                              VOICE 1
                    I beg you!  I don't want to die! 
                    Please have mercy!
          
          The two men look at each other, Operator 1 lunging for a red
          phone.
          
                              OPERATOR 1
                    Get me the Finger.  This is an
                    emergency!
          
          EXT.  BISHOP'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
          
          Close on a stain of white vomit and blood on the thick pile
          of a Persian rug.  It is encircled in police chalk.
          
          Pull back to reveal the chalk outline where the body of
          Bishop Lilliman was found.  The circled bloodstain floats
          above the head like the last word balloon of a crude comic
          strip character.
          
          The Bishop's quarters is slowly being picked over by a
          forensic team from the Nose.  A photographer's flash bursts
          against a painted "V" on the wall near the body outline.
          
          At the window, Finch chews on his pipe, staring at a plastic
          evidence bag that contains a single violet carson rose.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    No prints yet, sir.  Just like
                    Prothero.
          
                              FINCH
                    I want those tapes from the Ear in
                    my office tonight, Dominic.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Yes, sir.  They're on top of it.
          
          Finch turns to a muscular man named Creedy, second in command

                              FINCH
                    Any word from your superior, Mr.
                    Creedy?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Mr. Almond doesn't seem to be
                    answering his page, sir.  I'm sure
                    he's in the field.
          
                              FINCH
                    Quite.
          
          INT.  CONRAD HEYER'S BEDROOM
          
          Grunting like an animal, Derek's face is frozen, locked in
          the rigor of a violent orgasm.  After a moment, he collapses
          beside Helen onto the sweat soaked sheets.
          
                              HELEN
                    There you go, baby.  Now my baby
                    boy can think so much clearer. 
                    Can't he?
          
          She grabs her cigarette case and her lighter.
          
                              HELEN
                    You have been thinking, haven't
                    you?
          
          She straddles his chest then lights two cigarettes.
          
                              HELEN
                    I know you have.  Ever since this
                    terrorist appeared.
          
          He smiles as she puts one of the cigarettes in his mouth.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh jesus, that smile.  That smile
                    turns me on like nothing else.
          
          She whispers in his ear.
          
                              HELEN
                    Tell me.  Tell me what's going on
                    in that ruthless sadistic brain of
                    yours.
          
                              DEREK
                    Everyone is so worried about the
                    terrorist.  Especially Susan.  You
                    know why?  Because nobody knows
                    what he's going to do.
          
          He exhales through his grinding teeth.
          
                              DEREK
                    If I were him, I know what I'd do.
          
          He whispers.
          
                              DEREK
                    I'd blow that fat bastard to
                    kingdom come.
          
          Helen bolts up.
          
                              HELEN
                    No.  You're kidding.
          
                              DEREK
                    Am I?
          
          He smiles, blowing more smoke.
          
                              DEREK
                    There's an old train line under the
                    New Government Building.  It
                    collapsed when they poured the
                    foundation.  You could haul in
                    enough TNT to launch our Leader's
                    ass all the way to the moon.
          
          Helen's eyes gleam as he laughs.
          
                              HELEN
                    You're serious, aren't you?
          
          He eyes her sucking on the cigarette.
          
                              DEREK
                    You need to be careful, Helen. 
                    Your mouth is going to get you into
                    trouble one day.
          
                              HELEN
                    Is that the same trouble you love
                    putting in my mouth?
          
                              DEREK
                    You never know who might be
                    listening.
          
                               HELEN
                    I know, Derek.  You love your
                    country and you love your party,
                    just like you love your wife.
          
          He glares at her.
          
                              HELEN
                    Derek.  I'm sorry.  I know I can be
                    a bitch.  But that's why you're
                    here, isn't it?
          
          He smiles again and she presses her body to his.
          
                              HELEN
                    This is it, isn't it, Derek?  What
                    we've been waiting for.  At last,
                    you'll be rid of Susan.  I'll be
                    rid of Conrad.  And we'll be free. 
                    Free, won't we?
          
          His eyes close as he grinds his hips into hers and we rise,
          drifting up to the ceiling light fixture --
          
          Where we see a tiny hidden microphone.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE - THE NOSE
          
          Finch sits at his desk, staring into the silence of his
          notepad.  He has doodled a little "V" with a circle around
          it.
          
          He looks up as Dominic enters, holding up a portable cassette
          player.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Sorry it took so long.  The boys
                    had a devil of a time trying to
                    filter out the background noise.
          
                              FINCH
                    Background noise?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    The perpetrator apparently turned
                    on the Bishop's stereo. 
                    Subsequently, a great deal of the
                    tape is useless.
          
          He hands the player to Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    What music did he play?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Beethoven.  The fifth, I believe.
          
          Finch smiles.
          
                              FINCH
                    Da, da, da, dum.  That's code. 
                    Morse code.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Sir?
          
                              FINCH
                    For the letter "V".
          
          Finch punches "play".
          
          Over the small speaker, we sear Evey protesting to V, then
          run.  He stops it.
          
                              FINCH
                    Anything on the girl yet?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    No.  The agency said somebody
                    claiming to be Lilliman's valet
                    canceled his Sunday appointment.
          
          Finch starts it again and this time the tape is very fuzzy.
          
                              FINCH
                    What is it?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    23rd Psalm.
          
          We recognize some of the words though muted and crackly.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    Though I walk through the valley of
                    the shadow of death...
          
                              DOMINIC
                    It goes on like that for a while. 
                    Fairly incoherent except we could
                    make out a few words in this part. 
                    Transubstantiation.
          
          Finch nods, understanding.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    That miracle business when the
                    wafer transform into the body of
                    Christ.
          
                              FINCH
                    He made him eat a host.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Yes, listen to this part.
          
          The tape becomes somewhat clearer as the music rests.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    ... And at the moment this enters
                    your mouth it becomes the flesh of
                    the savior?  Yes... please... And
                    whatever it is made of now it will
                    become the body of Christ?  Yes...
                    yes...
          
          They eye each other.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    I want you to swallow it.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    There's a couple of funny human
                    noises...
          
                              FINCH
                    And then just Beethoven's fifth.
          
          He shuts off the tape.
          
                              FINCH
                    We have got the initial path report
                    back.  The host was full of
                    cyanide.
          
          Finch picks up the bag with the violet carson.
          
                              FINCH
                    And do you know what?
          
          He rises, sliding into his jacket.
          
                              FINCH
                    When it reached his abdomen, it was
                    still cyanide.
          
          INT.  MORGUE
          
          Close on the heavy stitching of a "Y" incision sewn into the
          chest of a corpse.  It is one of the Bishop's guards.
          
                              DELIA
                    Do you have a motive?
          
          Finch is standing next to the cadaver gurney with the
          coroner, Delia Surridge.  She is a serious woman, hair wound
          tight behind her head in a severe bun.
          
                              DELIA
                    I mean, was anything taken?
          
          She fills the dead man's head with cotton and replaces the
          top of his skull.
          
                              FINCH
                    Just lives.
          
          Pulling at the man's scalp, she stretches it over the
          replaced skull piece.
          
                              FINCH
                    I know it's too early for your
                    profile but do you have any initial
                    impressions?
          
                              DELIA
                    Well...
          
          She points at a jagged puncture wound at the base of the
          man's sternum with a ball point pen.
          
                              DELIA
                    He's incredibly powerful.  This
                    man's sternum was split like dry
                    wood from the base all the way up
                    to the manubrium.
          
          Finch peers into the hole.
          
                              DELIA
                    And he's resourceful.  On that
                    table behind you is a breakdown of
                    all the chemicals found in
                    Prothero's blood stream.
          
          Finch hefts the pile of computer paper.
          
                              FINCH
                    Bloody hell.
          
                              DELIA
                    There were hundreds of different
                    chemicals in him.  From
                    trinitrotoluene to estrogen to
                    motor oil.
          
          He flips through the document, biting into the wooden end of
          his pipe.
          
                              FINCH
                    Perhaps Fate will make something
                    more of all this.  I certainly
                    can't.
          
                              DELIA
                    The Leader finally authorized an
                    uplink for you?  He must be getting
                    nervous.
          
                              FINCH
                    Quite.  Government directed
                    terrorism never sews healthy ideas
                    into the public.  Oh, that reminds
                    me.
          
          Finch pulls the evidence bag from his pocket.
          
                              FINCH
                    Can you tell us anything about
                    this?
          
          Delia's eyes lock onto the violet carson.
          
                              FINCH
                    We found one in the carriage with
                    Prothero and this one in the
                    Bishop's quarters.  A violet
                    carson.
          
          He hands it to her.
          
                              FINCH
                    I heard that strain had died off. 
                    Thought a botanist might shed some
                    light on it.  Delia?
          
          Delia, riveted to the rose, suddenly looks up to him.
          
                              DELIA
                    Yes -- Yes, of course.
          
                              FINCH
                    Magic.  I'll drop by tomorrow then.
          
          He turns, leaving her with the rose.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V relaxes with a book in an overstuffed reading chair, a
          violet carson rose resting on a table next to him.  He begins
          to read a passage aloud.
          
                              V
                    "There is more behind and inside of
                    V than any of us had suspected. 
                    Not who, but what: what is she?"
          
          He places the book down.  Thomas Pynchon's "V".
          
          V rises, lifting the rose and moving into the darkness of the
          Shadow Gallery.
          
          EXT.  EMPTY STREET
          
          A small figure moves down the dark wet street, the
          cobblestones glistening like black scales.
          
          The huddled figure arcs across the street in the shadows,
          avoiding the pools of streetlight.  It is Evey, a frightened
          look on her face.
          
          INT.  KITTY KAT KELLER
          
          A woman in combat boots, fishnets, and a tight fitting
          soldier's uniform is in the middle of a cheeky number on
          stage in this smoky burlesque bar.  It is a popular place
          with locals and Fingermen.
          
          Peter Creedy squeezes through the crowd, angling for the back
          of the bar where a number of loud Fingermen are drinking.
          
                              CREEDY
                    What's all this, then, Harper?  I
                    get a radio that a man's down and
                    in need of assistance?
          
                              HARPER
                    I ain't gone down yet but I sure do
                    need some assistance.
          
          Creedy leans in.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Are you flat broke already?
          
          They break up in laughter, led by Creedy who sits next to
          Harper, pouring himself a drink.
          
                              LOUT
                    How'd you sneak away, Creedy? 
                    Almond off buggering that blonde
                    chippy?
          
                              HARPER
                    The one with the tits?
          
          They all begin to hoot and whistle.
          
                              CREEDY
                    What I wouldn't give for a piece of
                    that.
          
                              LOUT
                    She could serve a tray of drinks on
                    those thingies.
          
                              HARPER
                    I bet you get your chance with her
                    sooner than later, Creedy, with the
                    way Almond's crackin' up.
          
                              LOUT
                    Bloody bugger's losing his marbles.
          
                              HARPER
                    Terrorist or no, if that bastard
                    gives me another double shift, I'll
                    stomp his fucking head.
          
          Creedy raises his drink.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Aye.  This nonsense has put a
                    serious strain on my drinking.  I
                    think I was actually sober today.
          
                              LOUT
                    I'll drink to that.
          
                              HARPER
                    We need to get a real man of the
                    people in that director's position. 
                    Like Creedy here.
          
          Everyone cheers in agreement.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Well, it's good to know when the
                    shit hits the fan who your real
                    friends are.
          
          They salute and drink.
          
          INT.  ALMOND HOME
          
          Derek Almond sits hunched under a desk lamp, pumping the
          cylinders of his revolver with a wire brush.
          
          Rosemary shuffles up to him, her frumpy gown gathered around
          her.

                    Derek --
          
          He blows down one of the cylinders, not looking up.
          
                              DEREK
                    I don't want to hear it, Rosemary.
          
                              ROSEMARY
                    Derek, please!  We can't carry on
                    like this.
          
          Derek stares at the gun, rage building.
          
                              ROSEMARY
                    You don't talk to me.  You don't
                    eat with me.  You don't have sex --
          
          Derek leaps up, slugging her.
          
          Rosemary clatters to the ground in tears.  Derek glowering
          over her.
          
                              DEREK
                    I don't have to take any crap from
                    you!  I have that fat bastard
                    riding me all day.  I don't want to
                    listen to you, so shut your fat
                    gob!
          
          He leans into her face.
          
                              DEREK
                    And me not wanting to fuck you is
                    obvious.  Take a look at yourself.
          
          He sits back in front of the gun, wiping it down.
          
                              DEREK
                    Get out of my sight.  I'm cleaning
                    my gun.

          Dr. Surridge sits somberly in the dark, street light
          filtering in from the open curtains.
          
          Her eyes fixed on the violet carson as she slowly turns it
          over in her hands, fingers tracing the soft petals.
          
          After a moment, she stands, letting it fall from her lap.

                    help positions there at similar

                    Most of Larkhill's records were
                    destroyed for security reasons but
                    I did uncover an old standard
                    procedures and operations manual.

          The covers pulled protectively up around her, Delia rests in
          a light, uneasy sleep.
          
          Suddenly, an eye pops open as she awakens, catching a
          familiar scent.  She slowly sits up and inhales.
          
                              DELIA

                    It's you, isn't it?  You've come to
                    kill me.

                    I'm not.  I'm --
          
          She looks at the hovering, smiling mask.
          
                              DELIA
                    Relieved.
          
          She starts to cry again.
          
                              DELIA
                    Oh god, all these years.  All this
                    waiting.  And somehow I always knew
                    you'd come back.
          
          Delia thinks back.
          
                              DELIA
                    When I saw you that night -- the
                    night you escaped, you were
                    standing against the flames and you
                    looked straight at me.
          
          The mask almost nods.
          
                              DELIA
                    I knew then that one day you'd come
                    looking for me, that you'd find me.
          
          Her voice drops to an almost confessional whisper.
          
                              DELIA
                    What -- what happened at Larkhill. 
                    What we did -- What I did.  That
                    terrible knowledge, it's been with
                    me so long.  That I could do things
                    like that.
          
          Delia rubs the salty tears from her eyes.
          
                              DELIA
                    For years, I blamed it on the
                    government, on the authority I
                    could never stand up to.  But
                    living so long with the knowledge
                    of what I did has made me
                    understand otherwise.  I alone was
                    accountable.
          
          V watches her.
          
                              DELIA
                    There is something wrong with us. 
                    With all of mankind.  With me. 
                    Something evil that made me enjoy
                    what I did.  Some hideous flaw.
          
          Her voice almost trails off.
          
                              DELIA
                    We deserve to be culled.  We
                    deserve it.

                    Almond.  What?!  Where?
          
          Derek's drunk eyes light up.
          
                              DEREK
                    Oh god, yes!  God, thank you!
          
          He slams the phone down, charging out of the room.
          
          EXT.  KITTY KAT KELLER
          
          A gaggle of drunks exit the bar, laughing and singing as they
          pass a small figure.
          
          INT.  KITTY KAT KELLER
          
          Evey wanders into the bar amidst the lustful screams and cat
          calls for the line of high stepping, semi-clothed girls on
          stage.
          
          She stares out into the crowd, not sure why she is here when
          a man approaches her: Creedy.  His sloppy smile indicates he
          has had a few drinks.
          
                              CREEDY
                    You look lost.
          
          She looks blankly at him.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Can I buy you a drink?
          
                              EVEY
                    No... I made a mistake.
          
          She turns for the door.
          
                              EVEY
                    I have to find someone.
          
          Creedy frowns as his radio crackles.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Well I didn't like the looks of you
                    anyway --
          
                              RADIO (V.O.)
                    All units, all units.  Code red. 
                    Converge in Plaistow to apprehend
                    codename V.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Bloody hell!
          
          He screams to the Fingermen at the back.
          
                              CREEDY
                    It's him!  We got him!
          
          Evey watches as they storm out of the bar, then follows.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          The emergency lights blaring, Finch's car squeals around a
          corner.
          
          INT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S BEDROOM
          
          V hovers ghostly at Delia's bedside.
          
                              DELIA
                    It's funny, I was given one of your
                    roses today.  I wasn't sure you
                    were the terrorist until I saw it.
          
          She manages a smile.
          
                              DELIA
                    What a strange coincidence.  That I
                    should be given it today.
          
                              V
                    There are no coincidences, Delia. 
                    Only the illusion of coincidence.
          
          He reaches into his cloak.
          
                              V
                    I have another rose.  This one is
                    for you.
          
          He hands it to her.
          
                              DELIA
                    Then you are going to kill me now?
          
          V produces an empty syringe.
          
                              V
                    I killed you ten minutes ago. 
                    While you slept.
          
                              DELIA
                    Is there any pain?
          
          V sits on the bed.
          
                              V
                    No.  No pain.
          
                              DELIA
                    Thank you.
          
          She stares at the mask.
          
                              DELIA
                    Can I -- Can I see your face again?
          
          V slowly pulls off his hat and lifts his mask.  Delia stares
          into his face.
          
                              DELIA
                    It's beautiful...
          
          The rose falls from her hands.
          
          INT.  HALL
          
          V quietly shuts the door as if not to wake her and turns just
          as --
          
          Derek Almond reaches the top of the stairs.
          
                              DEREK
                    Don't move an inch, you bloody
                    bastard.
          
          He trains his gun.
          
                              DEREK
                    You didn't hear me arrive, did you? 
                    Didn't know we'd rumbled you?
          
          He squints.
          
                              DEREK
                    It's all finished, chummy.  All of
                    it.  The old man told me it was my
                    head or yours and what do you know. 
                    It's yours.
          
          The smiling mask stares.
          
                              DEREK
                    Because you're standing over there
                    with your bloody stupid knives and
                    your fancy karate gimmicks --
          
          Derek pulls back the hammer.
          
                              DEREK
                    And I've got a gun.
          
          He smiles.
          
                              DEREK
                    Bang.
          
          Click.  He never loaded it.
          
          There is an awkward moment of silence, then V moves --
          
          Cloak opening, filling the hall like a black tidal wave that
          envelopes Derek.  He chokes a scream as V embraces him,
          slipping a knife above his floating rib.
          
          Derek Almond sputters as he claws at V's mask.
          
                              DEREK
                    Who -- Who are you?
          
                              V
                    Yes, look.  Look and tell me what
                    you see.
          
          He rips V's mask off as V thrusts the knife in deeper.
          
          Derek's eyes widen in horror as his life pours out the knife
          wound.
          
                              DEREK
                    Horrible!  God, it's horrible!
          
          V jerks his blade free, letting Derek slip to the ground.
          
          EXT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME
          
          Finch's car bucks up onto the sidewalk.
          
          Finch and Dominic tear out of the car and barrel into the
          house.
          
          INT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME
          
          At the top of the stairs, they find the dead Derek.  Finch
          rushes past him for the bedroom.
          
                              FINCH
                    Delia?
          
          Inside, he finds her.  Her eyes fixed, cold, and dead, a
          single violet carson in her lap.
          
                              FINCH
                    Get an ambulance.
          
          EXT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME
          
          Evey rushes around a corner to see a crime scene bathed in
          siren light.  She pushes up to the police barricade as the
          M.E.'s load a draped body into their van.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh no... V?
          
          She tries to angle around to get a better look when a man in
          a brown overcoat grabs her from behind and drags her into the
          alley.
          
          INT.  DELIA SURRIDGE'S BEDROOM
          
          From the corner of the room, Finch sits, watching as the
          M.E.'s wheel out Delia's body.
          
          Dominic squeezes past the gurney and crosses toward Finch.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    I'm sorry, sir.  You knew the
                    doctor pretty well?
          
          Finch nods.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    We found this on her bureau, sir. 
                    It's Dr. Surridge's journal.  It
                    covers her years at Larkhill.  It
                    might contain the whole story.
          
          Dominic searches for something more to say when Finch does
          not answer.
          
          After a moment, Finch looks at the book in Dominic's hand,
          then takes it, leafing through the pages.  They flip by, a
          breathy sigh, rising to a cold wind.

          A younger Dr. Surridge, one by one, administers a series of
          injections to her research stock.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    Prothero has hand picked my
                    subjects.  Four dozen of them, none
                    of which will be any use to me if I
                    don't get to work soon.
          
          She finishes an injection, Prothero encouraging the next
          subject.  We recognize her as the woman Prothero pointed at.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    They're so weak and pathetic I find
                    myself hating them.
          
          Delia prepares the next dose, a sour look on her face.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    They don't fight or struggle.  Just
                    stare at you with weak eyes.

          Two inmate orderlies are hefting sacked cadavers from a cart
          into an incinerator.

                    June 9th: Of the original four
                    dozen, over 75% are now deceased. 
                    Strangely, no clear patterns have
                    emerged as of yet.
          
          Another body thuds onto the pile.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    Batch 5 seems to have no common
                    discernible effect on any specific
                    group though the men seem slightly
                    more resilient than the women.
          
          When it is full, they move to the next door until the cart is
          empty.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    I'm hoping the survivors will
                    provide more answers or my time
                    here will have gone to waste.
          
          Red heat suddenly glows from the oven vents as the orderly
          throws a series of switches.

          Dr. Surridge moves down the drab aseptic hallway accompanied
          by an armed guard.  Roman numerals on the doors to each cell
          ascend to five.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    June 18: And only five left now. 
                    Two men and three women.  Which
                    tends to contradict my entry on the
                    9th.
          
          She pauses at room five.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    The man in room five is a
                    fascinating case.
          
          She looks through the small chicken wire glass window in the
          door.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    Physically, there doesn't seem to
                    be anything wrong with him.  No
                    cellular anomalies, nothing.
          
          In the back, just on the edge of the room's shadow, sits the
          man in room five, silently staring back.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    Batch five, however, seems to have
                    brought on some kind of psychotic
                    breakdown.  He's quite insane.
          
          Dr. Surridge can't seem to break her stare.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    He has this way of looking through
                    you.  Reverend Lilliman won't go
                    near him.  He claims that it is the
                    devil in room five.  I see him
                    cross himself whenever he passes
                    his door.  Still, there's something
                    about him...
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL GARDEN - DAY - FLASHBACK
          
          Dr. Surridge slowly moves through the Larkhill garden, an
          incredible abundance of fruits, vegetables and violet carson
          roses.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    I'm glad Prothero let room five
                    have a go at the gardening project. 
                    He is quite proficient.  Prothero
                    was reluctant to allow an inmate
                    access to the tool and chemical
                    supply at first but now the fat
                    toad is delighted.  The crop has
                    almost doubled.
          
          She traces the petals of a rose with her finger.

                    He also grows roses.  Beautiful
                    roses.
          
          INT.  LARKHILL LOUNGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
          
          Dr. Surridge and several other Larkhill appointees relax
          after dinner.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    December 24th: I was in the mess. 
                    It was about half past ten when we
                    heard the first explosion.
          
          A massive explosion shakes the building to its very core, its
          windows shattering and hooded pendulum lights swinging.
          
          EXT.  LARKHILL LOUNGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
          
          Men and women clutch at their throats as they tumble out into
          the yard.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    The ones at the front ran straight
                    into the gas.  It was horrible.
          
          They drop to the ground, gasping and vomiting.
          
          The back door is kicked open, Dr. Surridge following two
          guards.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    A few of us made it out through the
                    rear door.  You could hear men
                    screaming everywhere.  I hate the
                    sound of men screaming.
          
          She looks out, men running, collapsing, dying in a yellow
          green haze that seems everywhere.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    In the center of the camp,
                    everything was on fire.  Everyone
                    running in all directions.  We had
                    hardly enough time to get our
                    bearings when the ovens exploded.
          
          Another explosion wracks the compound.  The pillar of flame
          rises into the black sky, dwarfing the men in the camp.
          
          Dr. Surridge sees a gaping hole in the medical block, its
          insides turned out like an unholy birth.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    It was the man in room rive.  I
                    couldn't have known.  The chemical
                    supplies, grease solvents, ammonia,
                    fertilizer.  He'd been making
                    things with them.
          
          Close on a soldier, doubled over, hacking up bile.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    Mustard gas...
          
          A sticky blue fire licks up from a blackened body like a dura
          flame.
          
                              DELIA
                    And napalm.
          
          Dr. Surridge turns as a silhouette crosses the yard, backlit
          by a curtain of fire.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    And in the yard, I saw him.  He had
                    the flames behind him.  He was
                    naked.
          
          The man stops.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    He looked at me...
          
          Dr. Surridge seems to wilt under his stare but cannot look
          away.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    As if I were an insect.  Oh god. 
                    As if I were something mounted on a
                    slide.
          
          The flames convulse hypnotically behind him.
          
                              DELIA (V.O.)
                    He looked at me.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          Finch snaps Dr. Surridge's journal shut.
          
          He sits in front of the Leader's desk puffing on his pipe
          while Susan stares coldly.
          
                              FINCH
                    That's the last entry until six
                    months later when Dr. Surridge is
                    back in London.  There is no
                    mention of the man in room five
                    again.  End of story.
          
          He tosses the journal on Susan's desk.
          
                              FINCH
                    Except that it wasn't the end of
                    the story.
          
          Finch rises, crossing to the wastebasket.
          
                              FINCH
                    Between 2009 and 2012, over forty
                    men and women who were previously
                    stationed at Larkhill met with what
                    were believed to be accidental
                    deaths.  Eventually, only three
                    remained.
          
          He taps his pipe into his hand, pouring the contents into the
          wastebasket.
          
                              FINCH
                    The three he'd been saving until
                    last.
          
          Finch brushes the ashes from his hands and begins repacking
          his pipe.
          
                              FINCH
                    Everyone who worked at Larkhill. 
                    Everyone who could have identified
                    him.  You see there are two
                    possible motives here.  Not one.
          
          Susan raises his head.
          
                              FINCH
                    The first is revenge.  He escapes
                    from Larkhill and vows to get even
                    with his tormentors.  The whole
                    exercise an elaborate, chilling
                    vendetta.
          
          When he finishes repacking the pipe, he replaces it in his
          mouth.
          
                              FINCH
                    That's the explanation that I find
                    most reassuring, funnily enough. 
                    Because that means he's finished. 
                    It's over now.
          
          Finch begins relighting his pipe.
          
                              FINCH
                    The second motive is more sinister. 
                    Like I said, everyone who could
                    have identified him is dead.
          
          A flame leaps into the air.
          
                              FINCH
                    What if he's just been clearing the
                    ground?
          
          Another burst.
          
                              FINCH
                    What if he's planning something
                    else?
          
          The lighter slips back into his pocket.
          
                              FINCH
                    You see, the diary we found was in
                    full view.  We didn't have to
                    search for it.  He left it there. 
                    He wanted us to find it.  He wanted
                    us to know the story.  Or...
          
          Finch returns to his chair, letting out a huge cloud.
          
                              FINCH
                    For all we know, the diary could be
                    a complete and utter fake. 
                    Codename V could have written it
                    himself.
          
          Finch leans forward.
          
                              FINCH
                    He's playing games with us.  He
                    might never have been at Larkhill
                    at all.  Do you see?  It could all
                    be another smoke screen, a false
                    trail, another cover story --
          
                              LEADER
                    Enough!
          
          Susan punches the desk.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch, would you please explain
                    to me the nature of this meeting?! 
                    Because I was under the impression
                    that you had some information about
                    the terrorist, codename V!
          
          And punches it again until his fist hurts.
          
                              LEADER
                    No more questions, understand!  I
                    want answers!  I am not interested
                    in where he grew up, what kind of
                    flowers he likes or his favorite
                    color!
          
          Susan's collar chokes his face to an unnatural crimson.
          
                              LEADER
                    Do I make myself clear?
          
                              FINCH
                    Yes, Leader.
          
          After a moment, Finch stands, Susan hanging on his last word.
          
                              LEADER
                    Dismissed.  England prevails, Mr.
                    Finch.
          
          Finch turns, Susan calling after him as he leaves.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch, the girl.  Do you have
                    anything on the girl?
          
          Finch pauses at the door.
          
                              FINCH
                    No, Leader.  Not yet.
          
          INT.  CELL
          
          Evey stirs as voices drift in from the hall outside her door.
          
                              MAN
                    Wake up, cow.
          
          Three guards are silhouetted in the doorway of a cramped jail
          cell.  Still sluggish from the chloroform, Evey looks down at
          the coarse slipover she's now wearing.
          
          One of the men, Rossiter, crosses toward Evey, swinging a
          pair of shackles.  He grabs Evey, slamming her face down into
          the hard cot, driving a knee between her shoulder blades.
          
          Evey screams.
          
                              GUARD 1
                    Tsk.  This pathetic whore is the
                    famous Miss Hammond?
          
          The shackles bite down on her wrists as they laugh in the
          hall.
          
                              EVEY
                    You've made a mistake.
          
          Rossiter stands her up, shoving her into the wall.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    Shut up.
          
                              EVEY
                    Please.  I haven't done anything --
          
          He slides a thick hood over her head.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    I said shut your hole!
          
          INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          The hood is lifted from her head.  Evey squints hard, awash
          in a blinding, burning light.
          
          A man sits, unmoving, at a desk across from her, a guard at
          his side, both backlit by a harsh white kliegs.
          
          Evey's eyes start to water as she blinks.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Do you know why you're here.  Evey
                    Hammond?
          
                              EVEY
                    No, please, I didn't do anything.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Allow me to be more precise.  Did
                    you participate in the murder of
                    Dr. Delia Surridge?
          
                              EVEY
                    No.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Did you participate in the murder
                    of Derek Almond, director of the

                              EVEY
                    No, I --
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Did you participate in the murder
                    of Bishop Anthony Lilliman?
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, I don't --
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Have you ever participated in a
                    terrorist act against your country?
          
                              EVEY
                    No --
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    What is the identity of codename V?
          
                              EVEY
                    I don't know.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    You are a lying cunt.
          
          A monitor next to the desk lights up.  From the snowy static,
          an image begins to form.
          
          A girl is talking to a man.  She is shoving her hips at him,
          propositioning him.  When more men appear from the alley,
          Evey realizes she is watching herself.
          
                              EVEY
                    They were going to rape me, kill
                    me --
          
          Rossiter grabs a handful of her hair.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    Shut up.
          
          She swallows hard when she sees V emerge on the screen.  The
          image freezes on his smiling face.

                    This board will not tolerate any
                    more of your lies, Miss Hammond. 
                    We have over 120 minutes of audio
                    and videotape and 75 pages of
                    testimonials from eye witness that
                    identify you as an accomplice to
                    the terrorist, codename V.
          
          The monitor blinks off.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Do you want to know why you're
                    here?  You are formally being
                    brought up on charges of murder on
                    fourteen counts and sedition
                    against your Leader and country
                    which brings an automatic sentence
                    of death.
          
                              EVEY
                    Please.  I didn't do anything.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Process the prisoner and return her
                    to her cell until she is more
                    cooperative.
          
          Rossiter slips the hood back over Evey's head.
          
          INT.  PROCESSING ROOM
          
          Evey cries as a rough hand runs a pair of electric clippers
          over her head.  Huge sheaves of her hair fall to the ground.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT.  CELL
          
          Evey lies crumpled on the hard floor, unmoving, as a tray of
          food is slid through a slot at the bottom of the door.
          
          She watches as a rat crosses from a hole in the wall,
          sniffing the murky rendered gelatin in the wooden bowl.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT.  PROCESSING ROOM
          
          Evey hangs limply from a set of manacles as she is washed and
          deloused by heavy hands.
          
          She coughs in the yellow bug powder cloud as it burns her
          eyes and the red welts on her back.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT.  CELL
          
          Evey is curled up on the cot like a dry fetus, now gaunt arms
          wrapped around her legs.  She blinks when she hears something
          moving in the rat hole.
          
          Evey raises her head as something is pushed through the
          crevice.
          
          Tentative fingers search the hole, pulling out a length of
          toilet paper.  Over every inch of it is a delicately scrawled
          message.
          
          We move into the rathole, its edges slowly filling the frame
          until black.

          Pull back from a shadow, the outline of the interrogator's
          silhouette against sharp light coming into frame.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I read her letter.  Hid it.  Slept. 
                    Woke.  They questioned me.  And I
                    read her letter again.
          
          Rossiter is buckling Evey's thin arms and legs into a chair. 
          Her now frail frame can barely hold up the frayed brown
          slipover.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Over and over...
          
          On the table in front of her, there is a large wash basin of
          water.  Rossiter dunks her head into it.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Her name was Valerie.
          
          INT.  CLASSROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK
          
          A teacher reads from her lesson plan in front of rows and
          rows of uniformed pubescences in this all girl private
          school.  Her voice drones on and on like Muzak.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I was born in a rainy burg in
                    Nottingham in 1975.  I passed my
                    eleven plus and went to girl's
                    grammar.
          
          A blonde tomboy sneaks a smile to her curly haired friend
          next to her.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I met my first girlfriend at
                    school.  Her name was Sara.  Her
                    wrists.  Her wrists were beautiful.
          
          Her hand slides across the desk, fingers tickling the young
          flesh of Sara's wrist.
          
          The teacher's voice slows, dropping octaves, becoming --
          
          INT.  BIOLOGY LAB - DAY - FLASHBACK
          
          A man's voice.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I sat in biology class staring at
                    the pickled rabbit fetus while Mr.
                    Herd said it was an adolescent
                    phase that people outgrew.
          
          Valerie looks at Sara across the room, her head down in
          shame.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    Sara did.  I didn't.
          
          INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK
          
          Two teenage girls stand in front of a middle aged couple. 
          They are holding hands.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    In 1994, I stopped pretending and
                    took a girl called Christine home
                    to meet my parents.
          
          The greying woman repeats the sign of the cross over and
          over, sobbing into a handkerchief.  Her husband's face is
          contorted in disgust.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    A week later I moved to London to
                    go to college and study drama.  My
                    mother said I broke her heart.
          
          EXT.  PARK - DAY - FLASHBACK
          
          Two young women cuddle on a park bench under a London summer
          sky, feeding the pigeons.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    But it was my integrity that was
                    important.  Is that so selfish?  It
                    sells for so little but it's all we
                    have left in this place...
          
          The black haired girl nibbles on the blonde's ear.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    It is the very last inch of us...
          
          INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Evey struggles against Rossiter's weight who keeps her head
          submerged.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    But within that inch we are free.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Enough.
          
          Rossiter wrenches back and Evey sucks hard for air, coughing
          out water.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Now Miss Hammond, let us review the
                    facts.
          
          Evey stares at him, eyes red, heart pounding in her ears.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    You work for codename V.  Codename
                    V killed Delia Surridge and then
                    Derek Almond with your help and
                    that is why you were found outside
                    her home.
          
          Evey begins to shake her head, water sluicing off her thin
          face.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Isn't that what happened, Miss
                    Hammond?
          
                              EVEY
                    No.  No, that isn't true --
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Oh dear, Rossiter?
          
          Rossiter grabs Evey's neck --
          
                              EVEY
                    No, wait!
          
          Plunging her head into the bowl.  Water fills Evey's nose and
          ears.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    London.  I was happy in London.
          
          INT.  THEATRE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
          
          The packed house watches as a Prince kneels before a woman's
          bare foot with a slipper of glass.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I played Dandini in Cinderella.
          
          The woman glances into the dark sea of faces.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    The world was strange and rustling
                    with invisible crowds behind the
                    hot lights and all that breathless
                    glamour.
          
          EXT.  MEADOW - DAY - FLASHBACK
          
          Two women weep in each other's arms, embracing in a perfect
          knee high meadow.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    Work improved.  I got small film
                    roles, then bigger ones.
          
          The blonde woman brushes away a tear from the other's cheek.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    In 2006, I starred in "The Salt
                    Flats."  That's where I met Ruth. 
                    We fell in love.
          
          We pull back and see we are on location for a movie and the
          two women are being filmed.
          
          INT.  CONDO - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
          
          Ruth and Valerie sit on the couch watching television.  On
          the table behind them is a bouquet of violet carson roses.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    Every Valentine's Day she sent me
                    roses and, oh god, we had so much. 
                    Those were the best three years of
                    my life.
          
          The two women stare at the newscast in tears, the sound of
          marching coming from the set's speakers.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    In 2010, they came.
          
          EXT.  LONDON STREET - DAY - FLASHBACK
          
          The sound of marching explodes as columns of men in brown
          uniforms and jack boots fill the streets.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    And after that there were no more
                    roses...
          
          INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Rossiter presses his elbow onto Evey's neck, holding her
          submerged.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    Not for anybody.
          
          Rossiter lets Evey up.  Her red burnt lungs gulp at the air.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    After the takeover, they started
                    rounding up the gays.  They took
                    Ruth while she was out looking for
                    food.
          
          Evey blinks hard, black fireworks exploding in her eyes.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    Why are they so frightened of us?
          
          She wheezes, on the edge of unconsciousness.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    They burned her face with
                    cigarettes and made her give them
                    my name.  She signed a statement
                    saying I'd seduced her.
          
          The interrogator's voice melts into a slag heap of sound with
          the hot, rhythmic pounding in her ears.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I didn't blame her.  God, I loved
                    her but I didn't blame her.
          
          Rossiter uncuffs Evey, slipping the black bag over her head.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    But she did.
          
          Evey's knees buckle as he forces her to stand.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    She killed herself in her cell. 
                    She couldn't live with betraying
                    me, with giving up that last inch. 
                    Oh, Ruth.
          
          Evey weaves down the hall.  Rossiter shoving her from behind.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    They came for me.  They shaved off
                    my hair.  They held my head down a
                    toilet and told lesbian jokes. 
                    They brought me here and pumped me
                    full of chemicals.
          
          The cell door swings open.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I can't feel my tongue.  I can't
                    speak.
          
          Rossiter yanks the hood from her head and pushes her in.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    It is strange that my life should
                    end in such a terrible place but
                    for three years I had roses and
                    apologized to nobody.
          
          The iron door slams shut, lock ringing in the stale air.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I shall die here.  Every inch of me
                    shall perish...
          
          Evey rolls to her knees.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    Except one.
          
          She crawls for the rat hole.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    An inch.  It is small and fragile
                    and it's the only thing in the
                    world that's worth having.
          
          Her shaking hand pulls the letter from the stone crevice.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    We must never lose it or sell it or
                    give it away.  We must never let
                    them take it from us.
          
          Evey clutches it like a rosary as she begins to cry.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I don't know who you are but I hope
                    you escape this place.  I hope that
                    the world turns and things get
                    better and that one day people have
                    roses again.
          
          She holds the note to her face, her tears soaking into the
          fragile paper.
          
                              VALERIE (V.O.)
                    I don't know who you are but I love
                    you.  I love you.  Valerie.
          
          Slowly, Evey slips away, succumbing to blackness.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I had come to know every inch of
                    those four walls in that dark hell
                    and they knew every inch of me. 
                    Every inch...
          
          INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Loud lights blare against Evey's solemn face.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Except one.
          
          A typed document sits on a small tray table in front of her.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    "My name is Evey Hammond.  On the
                    5th of November 2019, I was
                    abducted by the terrorist known as
                    codename V and then taken against
                    my will to an unknown location."
          
          Rossiter hovers just behind her as the Interrogator reads her
          confession.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    "Once there, I was systematically
                    brainwashed by means physical and
                    psychological.  I was frequently
                    subjected to sexual abuse during
                    this period."
          
          Evey's expression is unchanging.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    "Eventually I was terrorized into
                    helping him commit the murders of
                    Derek Almond, Dr. Delia Surridge,
                    and Anthony Lilliman, Bishop of
                    Westminster."
          
          Rossiter drops a pen on the table.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    "I, the undersigned, swear that the
                    above statement is genuine and that
                    it was not signed by means of
                    intimidation."
          
          The pen slowly rocks to a stop.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    We'd like you to sign that for us,
                    Miss Hammond.  Where we've put the
                    little cross.
          
          She blinks.
          
                              EVEY
                    No.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    As you wish.
          
          Rossiter begins unbuckling Evey's restraints.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Escort Miss Hammond back to her
                    cell, Rossiter, where she will wait
                    while you arrange a wet detail of
                    six men.
          
          He forces Evey to her feet.
          
                              INTERROGATOR
                    Then take her out behind the
                    chemical sheds and shoot her.
          
          INT.  CELL
          
          The door opens behind Evey as she rereads Valerie's letter
          for the last time.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    It's time, unless you want to
                    change your mind.
          
          She holds the tattered piece of toilet paper to her chest.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    Sign that statement.  You could be
                    out inside three years.  Perhaps
                    they'd find you a job with the
                    Finger.
          
          Evey closes her eyes.
          
                              EVEY
                    Thank you but I'd rather die behind
                    the chemical sheds.
          
          Her last words hang in the air.
          
                              ROSSITER
                    Then there's nothing left to
                    threaten you with, is there?  You
                    are free.
          
          He turns and leaves.
          
                              EVEY
                    What?
          
          She listens as his footsteps fade down the hall, the door
          hanging weirdly open.
          
          Evey takes a few tentative steps toward the door and sticks
          her head out into the empty hall, peering down both ways.
          
          Slowly, she emerges from her cell, retracing her path down
          the hall that her blindfold never allowed her to see.
          
          Quietly inching along the wall, Evey peeks around a corner,
          gasping at the rigid guard standing off to the side.  There
          is something about the man's frozen stare that keeps her from
          running.
          
          Evey straightens and crosses to the guard.
          
          It is a mannequin.
          
          She touches him, the wheeled platform he is mounted on
          rolling back against the wall.
          
          INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          The door creaks open as Evey enters the room where for so
          long she was questioned and tortured.
          
          She crosses to the frozen Interrogator sitting at his desk.
          
          Her finger brushes lightly against the plastic hand, then
          Evey raps a knuckle on his hollow wooden head.  Around his
          neck a small speaker hangs from a cord.
          
          Evey drifts uneasily into a back room where a discarded
          prison guard's uniform hangs on a rack.  On a table next to a
          wig and pair of gloves, the rat looks up at her through the
          bars of its tiny cage.
          
          She moves through another door, the wind suddenly knocked
          from her chest as she finally sees where her prison was
          built --
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V steps from the shadows.
          
                              V
                    Welcome home, Evey.
          
                              EVEY
                    You...
          
          Her mouth hangs open.
          
                              EVEY
                    You did this... to me.
          
          Evey's rail thin figure begins to shake.
          
                              EVEY
                    You did this to me!
          
          She stumbles against the wall, unable to support herself.
          
                              EVEY
                    You -- You hit me and -- and cut my
                    hair.  It was you.  It was just you
                    all this time.
          
          She doubles over, covering her face as she bursts into tears.
          
                              EVEY
                    You tortured me.  You tortured me --
          
          Evey looks up at him, body shivering as he quietly glides
          toward her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, why?
          
                              V
                    Because I love you, Evey.  Because
                    I wanted to set you free.
          
                              EVEY
                    Love?
          
          A look of horror twists her starved face.
          
                              EVEY
                    Set me free?  Don't you realize?
          
          Slender fingers ball into fists.
          
                              EVEY
                    Don't you realize what you did to
                    me?  You nearly drove me mad!
          
          Disgust and anger light up her eyes.
          
                              EVEY
                    I hate you.
          
          Her little, wiry body coils tight as she circles him.
          
                              EVEY
                    I hate you!  Set me free?  You put
                    me in a prison to set me free?!
          
                              V
                    You were already in a prison. 
                    You've been in a prison all your
                    life.
          
                              EVEY
                    Shut up!  I don't want to hear it. 
                    I wasn't in a prison.  I was happy! 
                    I was happy here --
          
                              V
                    Happiness is the most insidious
                    prison of all, Evey.
          
                              EVEY
                    That's warped!  That's evil and
                    it's wrong!  What gives you the
                    right to judge?  Who are you to say
                    what's not good enough?!
          
                              V
                    You were born in a prison, Evey.  I
                    didn't put you there.  I just
                    showed you the bars.  You've been
                    in a prison so long, you no longer
                    believe there's an outside world.
          
          She wheels away from him, covering her ears, trying to get
          away from his voice.
          
                              EVEY
                    Shut up!  You're mad!  I don't want
                    to hear it!
          
                              V
                    That's because you're afraid, Evey. 
                    You're afraid because you can feel
                    freedom closing in on you.  You're
                    afraid because freedom is
                    terrifying.
          
          Evey falls, stumbling through the labyrinth of the Shadow
          Gallery.
          
                              EVEY
                    I can't feel anything!  There's
                    nothing left to feel!  Don't you
                    understand?
          
                              V
                    Don't back away from it, Evey. 
                    Part of you understands the truth
                    even as part pretends not to.
          
          She collapses, head pounding.
          
                              V
                    Woman, this is the most important
                    moment in your life.  Don't run
                    from it.
          
                              EVEY
                    I don't know what -- Oh god -- I
                    can't breathe --
          
          V couches next to her.
          
                              V
                    Good.  You're almost there.  Go
                    closer.  Feel the shape of it.
          
                              EVEY
                    What are you doing to me?  I can't
                    breathe --
          
                              V
                    You were in a cell.  They offered
                    you a choice between the death of
                    your principles and the death of
                    your body.
          
          He cradles her as she hyperventilates, tears streaming down
          her face.
          
                              EVEY
                    I feel -- I feel like I'm going to
                    burst.
          
                              V
                    You said you'd rather die.  You
                    faced the fear of your own death
                    and you were calm.  Try to feel now
                    what you felt then.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god -- I felt --
          
          The mask hovers over her.
          
                              EVEY
                    Like an angel --
          
          He squeezes her shuddering body.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, V, I'm so scared.  What's
                    happening to me?
          
                              V
                    The door of the cage is open, Evey. 
                    All that you feel is the wind from
                    outside.  Don't be afraid.
          
          Gently, he lifts her.
          
                              V
                    Try to walk.  The lift will take us
                    to the roof.
          
                              EVEY
                    The roof?  Outside?
          
          He helps her to an open elevator.
          
                              EVEY
                    I -- I don't want to be
                    blindfolded.
          
                              V
                    No, Evey.  No more blindfolds.
          
          The cage in the elevator rattles shut.
          
          EXT.  ROOF - NIGHT
          
          The two figures stand in the door of the roof access, a
          raging tempest oozing from a split sky.
          
          Something draws Evey out into the storm.
          
          Slowly, she walks beneath it, the wind and rain pounding
          against her thin frame.  Evey lets the coarse slipover fall
          to the ground and stares straight up into the storm, naked,
          the elements soaking into her very being.
          
          V moves up behind her.
          
                              V
                    Do you feel it?
          
                              EVEY
                    Everything's so -- different.
          
                              V
                    I know.  Five years ago, I too
                    stared beneath a night like this. 
                    Naked under a roaring sky.
          
          A low rumble of thunder washes over London.
          
                              V
                    The night is yours, Evey.  Seize
                    it.  Encircle it within your arms.
          
          His words buffet against her with the sheets of rain.
          
                              V
                    Bury it in your heart up to the
                    hilt.
          
          She raises her arms to embrace the raging torrent.
          
                              V
                    Become transfixed and
                    transfigured -- 
                    
          A jagged bolt of lightning shatters the sky.
          
                              V
                    Forever.
          
          EXT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          Finch gets out of a police car and looks up the black face of
          the modern building.  He sighs and taps his pipe against the
          heel of his shoe.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Finch!
          
          Finch turns to find Dascombe hurrying towards him.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Do you know what this is all about?
          
                              FINCH
                    No, but I can guess.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    What?
          
                              FINCH
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November."
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Oh come on.  He's long gone.  He
                    has to be.  He did what he came to
                    do and it's over.
          
          Finch chews on his pipe.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Isn't it?
          
                              FINCH
                    Not for us.
          
          He turns and heads into the building.
          
                                                          FADE OUT.
          
          FADE IN:
          
          EXT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING - DAY
          
          A dark November sky hangs like a shroud over the building.
          
                              LEADER (V.O.)
                    A year, gentlemen.
          
          INT.  COUNCIL CONFERENCE ROOM
          
          The heads of each department are gathered around a table of
          black granite.
          
          Peter Creedy, sitting back out of the lights, is the new head
          of the Finger.
          
                              LEADER
                    I have given you almost a year and
                    you have given me nothing. 
                    Nothing!
          
          He glares at Finch.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    Now Adam, there is no one better
                    than Finch and you know it.
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, Mr. Dascombe, I do know it. 
                    It is that very fact that keeps me
                    awake at night, wondering if
                    perhaps there is a reason that Mr.
                    Finch has failed.
          
                              FINCH
                    What are you saying?
          
                              LEADER
                    I'm saying that perhaps I don't
                    know you as well as I thought I
                    did.
          
                              FINCH
                    Are you asking for my resignation?
          
                              LEADER
                    No, I am asking for some goddamn
                    results!
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    It's not Finch's fault, Adam.
          
                              CONRAD
                    We've all been looking.  The man
                    simply disappeared.
          
                              ETHERIDGE
                    Vanished.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    He's gone, Adam.  It's over.
          
          The Leader trembles like a volcano set to blow.
          
                              LEADER
                    It's over, is it?  He's gone. 
                    Vanished, you say?
          
          The Leader grabs a large box from the floor and hurls reams
          of computer printout across the table.
          
                              LEADER
                    Transcripts recorded over the last
                    thirty days in which the terrorist
                    was talked about or mentioned in a
                    positive context.  This is only
                    thirty days!
          
          He punches a "play" button and a wall of monitors blink on. 
          It is a recording of a television variety show.
          
          A character that is made to look like Adam Susan is giving a
          speech.  A woman is dressed like V except that the only thing
          she is wearing under her cloak is a garter belt, stockings
          and high heels.
          
          V sneaks up behind Susan and yanks his pants down.  Susan is
          outraged but when he gives chase he trips over his pants. 
          The audience hoots and howls.
          
          The Leader kills the tape.
          
                              LEADER
                    Is this what you consider,
                    "disappeared?"
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    For god's sake, Adam, it's a stupid
                    variety show.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Creedy, I want the producers,
                    writers, and actors of that "stupid
                    variety show" arrested and charged
                    with sedition.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Yes, sir.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    You can't be serious --
          
                              LEADER
                    Push me, Roger, push me and you'll
                    find out how serious I am.
          
          He stares each of them to silence.
          
                              LEADER
                    This, this V is still out there.  I
                    can feel him like a sickness
                    worming its way into the hearts and
                    minds of the public.  Something
                    must be done, and done quickly, to
                    exorcise this demon for the very
                    soul of this country is at stake.
          
          He pauses.
          
                              LEADER
                    That is why I am compelled to give
                    each and every one of you notice
                    that if by the fifth of November
                    you are still giving me nothing
                    more than excuses, I will have to
                    revoke your party status and
                    terminate your positions.
          
          Everyone is stunned.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Creedy, I will speak with you
                    in private.  The rest of you are
                    dismissed.  England prevails.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S PRIVATE QUARTERS
          
          The Leader stands at the window.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Creedy, as the new head of the
                    Finger, you are the most important
                    member of my cabinet.
          
                              CREEDY
                    I, uh, appreciate your faith in me.
          
                              LEADER
                    Your predecessor, Mr. Almond, was a
                    good man, a man who understood what
                    strength in unity meant, a man who,
                    above all, loved his country.  I
                    need to know if you are such a man.
          
          His eyes bore into him.
          
                              LEADER
                    Do you love your country, Mr.
                    Creedy?
          
          EXT.  ALLEYWAY
          
          A police car is parked in a dark alley.  It is raining and
          the windows of the car are completely steamed.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Oh god, yes!
          
          He is sweating, his knuckles white as he squeezes the
          steering wheel, panting.
          
          We hear a noise like a very wet kiss and then a woman's
          voice.
          
                              HELEN
                    "The most important member of my
                    cabinet."  Yes it is, isn't it,
                    dear?
          
          Helen lifts her head out of his lap.  Her lipstick is smeared
          about her mouth.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Oh, don't stop.
          
                              HELEN
                    I stop when you stop.  What did he
                    say next?
          
                              CREEDY
                    I can't --
          
          She whispers in his ear while playing with his lap.
          
                              HELEN
                    Come on, Peter, what are you afraid
                    of?  Almond used to tell me
                    everything and you're twice the man
                    he was.
          
                              CREEDY
                    He asked me... if I loved my
                    country.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh yes, I can tell you do love your
                    country, almost as much as you love
                    this...
          
          She lowers her head into this lap.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Oh god...
          
                              HELEN
                    Go on.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Then he asked me to do something...
                    oh, oh...
          
                              HELEN
                    What?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Helen, I can't.  I can't tell you.
          
          Helen lifts her head.
          
                              HELEN
                    He told you to frame someone as the
                    terrorist.
          
                              CREEDY
                    My god?!  How did you know that?
          
                              HELEN
                    I know Adam Susan.  Now who was it?
          
                              CREEDY
                    No way.  I can't tell you that.
          
                              HELEN
                    Yes you can, honey.  You can and
                    you will.  You have to trust me,
                    love.  We're going to help each
                    other.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Helen, please.
          
                              HELEN
                    Look at that face.  You see? 
                    You're just bursting to tell me.
          
          Her head drops back down.  Creedy moans.
          
                              HELEN
                    Now who was it?
          
                              CREEDY
                    It was... Fi... Fi... FINCH!
          
          The name seems to orgasm from his mouth.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S APARTMENT
          
          Finch sits alone in his modest apartment, reading a book. 
          The book is Koesterler's, "The Roots of Coincidence."
          
          An old CD player is playing music, a Bach piano concerto.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V is playing the exact same concerto on his piano, his gloved
          fingers gracefully flitting across the keys.
          
          Evey enters the gallery.  Her hair has grown out but is still
          short.  She projects a kind of strength that comes from a
          deep inner peace.
          
          V coaxes the final delicate notes and lets them softly fade.
          
                              EVEY
                    That was beautiful.
          
          She walks up to him and takes the smiling face in her hands.
          
                              EVEY
                    I've wanted to do this for a long
                    time.
          
          She bends and gently kisses the frozen lips.
          
                              EVEY
                    Thank you, V.  Thank you for
                    everything you've done for me.
          
                              V
                    You did it all yourself, Evey.  I
                    just provided the backdrop but the
                    drama was all your own.
          
                              EVEY
                    It was a good backdrop.  I believed
                    it.  I really did.  It's still a
                    bit hard for me to accept that it
                    wasn't real.  That it was just you. 
                    Especially the letter.
          
          She takes the letter from her pocket.
          
                              EVEY
                    It is a beautiful letter, V.  Every
                    time I read it I could feel
                    Valerie, almost like she was
                    holding me.  I believed in her most
                    of all.  I believed that she loved
                    me and I loved her back.
          
          She looks down.
          
                              EVEY
                    I feel a bit foolish telling you
                    this.  I know that you must have
                    written it and thought you should
                    have it back.
          
                              V
                    But I didn't write that letter,
                    Evey.
          
                              EVEY
                    What?
          
                              V
                    Come with me.
          
          INT.  VALERIE'S ROOM
          
          It is a shrine.  The walls are covered with movie posters and
          reviews and pictures of an actresses named Valerie Page.  We
          recognize her as the woman chosen for the medical block just
          before V.
          
          Everywhere there are flower boxes filled with blooming roses;
          violet carsons.
          
                              EVEY
                    Valerie?
          
                              V
                    Yes.  Valerie Page.  She was the
                    woman in room four.
          
                              EVEY
                    She's beautiful.
          
                              V
                    She wrote the letter just before
                    she died.  I delivered it to you as
                    it was delivered to me.  The words
                    you wept over were the same words
                    that transformed me.
          
          Evey smiles and bends to smell the roses.
          
                              EVEY
                    Roses.  You grew them for her.
          
                              V
                    Yes.
          
                              EVEY
                    They're beautiful.
          
                              V
                    Evey, do you know what day it is?
          
                              EVEY
                    Two days before the first day we
                    met.
          
                              V
                    You remembered.
          
                              EVEY
                    You're planning something, aren't
                    you, V?
          
                              V
                    You know me too well now.
          
                              EVEY
                    What are you going to do?
          
                              V
                    I'm going to fulfill an old
                    promise.
          
          Evey cocks an eyebrow.
          
                              V
                    I'll show you.
          
          INT.  UNDERGROUND STAIRWELL
          
          Carrying a lantern, V leads Evey down a dark stone staircase.
          
                              EVEY
                    I've never been here before.
          
                              V
                    Yes.  It is the deepest part of my
                    home.  Once you know it, I should
                    think you'll know everything.
          
          He pushes a button and a secret passage opens in a heavy
          stone wall.
          
          There is a small narrow series of passageways that he guides
          her through, leading to another door.  Evey steps out into an
          underground subway station.
          
          INT.  VICTORIA STATION
          
          Parked beside the concrete platform is a beautiful antique
          train car.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh, V, it's lovely.  Where on earth
                    did you find it?
          
                              V
                    In a way, I suppose it really found
                    me.
          
          Evey steps into the train car and finds it filled with little
          packages wrapped in wax paper.
          
                              EVEY
                    What's in these packages?
          
                              V
                    Gelignite.
          
          She screams and almost drops one.
          
                              V
                    Careful.
          
                              EVEY
                    What are you going to do with all
                    of it?
          
                              V
                    I told you.  I'm going to finish
                    what was started four hundred years
                    ago.
          
                              EVEY
                    Where does this train go?
          
                              V
                    This is the old Victoria line but
                    it is blocked, blocked somewhere
                    between Whitehall and St. James.
          
                              EVEY
                    Whitehall... V, that's the New
                    Government Building.
          
          V nods.
          
                              EVEY
                    But the underground has been shut
                    down for years.  How are you going
                    to make it run without any power?
          
                              V
                    I just thought I might ask them to
                    turn it on for me.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader sits bathed in the flickering images of the Fate
          computer.
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, Mr. Creedy?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Everything's set, sir.  No worries.
          
                              LEADER
                    When?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Tonight.
          
          On one of the screens, a television program has just begun.
          
                              ANNOUNCER
                    Tonight on Tales from the Bible, a
                    story of treachery and betrayal
                    from the Book of Daniel.
          
          We cut from that screen to another screen --
          
          INT.  JORDAN TOWER - CONTROL BOOTH
          
          The television studio where Roger Dascombe surveys a large
          bank of monitors filled with the images of typically vapid
          television entertainment.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    All of London's waiting.  Ready,
                    two.  And here we go --
          
          A player locks on as a recorded program begins.  We move in
          as the logo slashes across the screen: Storm Saxon.
          
                              ANNOUNCER
                    Tonight, England's greatest hero
                    repels the forces of darkness in a
                    brand new episode.
          
          We pull back from the show's opening teaser and find
          ourselves looking at a small television.
          
          INT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          In the delivery bay at the back of Jordan tower, five
          security guards are riveted to the heroic actions of Storm
          Saxon.
          
                              HEIDI
                    Oh, Storm.  Save me!  Save me!
          
                              STORM
                    You mongrel trash, if you harm her!
          
                              MONGREL TRASH
                    Look out, de white debil has a
                    laser lugar!
          
          Behind them, a shadowy figure in a cloak and tall hat enters
          the loading bay.
          
                              GUARD
                    Hey, what the -- ?
          
          They all turn and find a smiling V.
          
          They go for their weapons.  V goes for them.  It is brutal
          and quick, knives slicing in bloody arcs, bodies kicked and
          thrown with superhuman power.
          
          The TV crashes to the ground and we move in at it as Storm
          Saxon stands triumphant beside his buxom lass.
          
                              HEIDI
                    Oh Storm, hold me.  Hold me tight.
          
          We pull back on another television screen inside --
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          Dominic is chewing on a hamburger, engrossed in Storm Saxon. 
          Across the room, Finch is reading the "Roots of Coincidence."
          
                              FINCH
                    I don't know how you stand that
                    tripe.
          
          Dominic answers with a mouthful of cheeseburger.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Es gooh.
          
          Finch shakes his head, reaching for his pipe.  He realizes he
          is out of tobacco.  He slides open the bottom desk drawer and
          his eyes almost pop out of his head.
          
          He stares into the drawer like someone staring at his own
          tombstone.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Finch?  Finch, what's wrong?
          
          Slowly, he lifts something from the drawer.  On his desk, he
          lays out several knives, a cloak, a hat, and a smiling mask.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    What the hell?
          
          Finch lifts the mask and almost has to laugh.
          
                              FINCH
                    Don't you see, Dominic?
          
          He puts the mask to his face.
          
                              FINCH
                    I'm V.
          
          INT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          V emerges from an elevator and immediately attacks several
          more guards.  A surveillance camera watches as V steps over
          their slumped, broken bodies.
          
          INT.  CONTROL CENTER
          
          The security guard sees V on the monitor coming directly down
          the hall.
          
                              GUARD
                    Bloody hell!
          
          He grabs the machine gun, aiming it just as V kicks open the
          door.
          
                              GUARD
                    Freeze!
          
          V stops.  At least five guards have trained their weapons on
          him.  He is surrounded.
          
          Slowly, he lifts his arms as though surrendering.  His cloak
          opens, revealing enough TNT to level the entire building.  In
          his hand is the plunger detonator.
          
                              GUARD
                    Fuck all.
          
          V nods.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          The door bursts open as Creedy and a group of heavily armed
          Fingermen muscle in.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Creedy?  What the hell's going on?
          
                              CREEDY
                    I'm here to arrest Mr. Finch for
                    acts of treason and terrorism.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    You can't be serious.
          
                              CREEDY
                    If I were you, boy, I'd shut my
                    hole unless you want to start
                    explaining why you didn't say
                    nothing about Mr. Finch's secret
                    identity.
          
          INT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          V follows Roger Dascombe into the main control booth.  The
          door shuts behind them and they are alone.
          
          All around them are the laugh tracks and gunshots of the
          evening's entertainment.
          
          V puts his hand into his cloak and pulls out a videotape.  He
          hands it to Dascombe.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          Finch glares at Creedy.
          
                              FINCH
                    Why don't you just shoot me,
                    Creedy?  Wouldn't that make
                    everything a lot simpler?
          
                              CREEDY
                    Yeah, I suppose it would.
          
          Creedy smiles, his finger tightening on the trigger when --
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Holy Christ!  Creedy, you stupid
                    ape!  If Finch is V then tell me
                    who is that?
          
          He points at the television where V sits calmly at a desk in
          front of the "VTV" logo.
          
                              V
                    Good evening, London.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Bloody fuckin' hell.
          
                              V
                    I thought it was time we had a
                    little talk.
          
                              FINCH
                    He has to be at Jordan tower.  Come
                    on!
          
          Finch and Dominic rush out of the room.  Creedy looks at his
          confused men.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Don't just stand there!  Follow
                    them!
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          V smiles at the horrified Adam Susan.
          
                              V
                    Are you sitting comfortably?  Good. 
                    Then I'll begin.
          
          The Leader screams, pounding on Fate.
          
                              LEADER
                    Damn you!  Damn you!
          
          He hits the intercom.
          
                              LEADER
                    Lieutenant, ready my transport.  I
                    want every armed man within a
                    hundred miles at Jordan tower. 
                    Now!
          
          We move in at VTV.
          
                              V
                    Right now, I imagine there are
                    hundreds of soldiers rushing here
                    to kill me because someone does not
                    want us to talk.
          
          We pull back in --
          
          INT.  LIVING ROOM
          
          A family watching television.  In the background, two
          children are squabbling.
          
                              MOTHER
                    Hush.  Turn it up.
          
          The husband does.  V's voice gets louder as we move towards
          him.
          
                              V
                    They are afraid that I am going to
                    say the things that are not
                    supposed to be said.  They are
                    afraid that I am going to say the
                    truth.
          
          INT.  APARTMENT
          
          A man sits on his couch, mesmerized by V.
          
                              V
                    The truth is that there is
                    something terribly wrong with this
                    country, isn't there?  If you look
                    about, you witness cruelty,
                    injustice and despotism.  But what
                    do you do about it?  What can you
                    do?
          
          He pops his beer tab and the beer foams over the couch but he
          doesn't seem to notice.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S POLICE CAR
          
          The car races wildly towards Jordan tower as Finch and
          Dominic listen to the broadcast on the radio.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    You are but a single individual. 
                    How can you possible make any
                    difference?  Individuals have no
                    power in this modern world. 
                    That is what you've been taught
                    because that is what they need you
                    to believe.  But it is not true.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S TRANSPORT
          
          The Leader seethes, staring at three television monitors in
          his limo which are all filled with V.
          
                              V
                    This is why they are afraid and the
                    reason that I am here; to remind
                    you that it is individuals who
                    always hold the power.  The real
                    power.  Individuals like me.  And
                    individuals like you.
          
          INT.  KITTY KAT KELLER
          
          The bar is almost completely soundless except for the voice
          of V.  People stare at the television as if the moment were
          somehow suspended in time.
          
                              V
                    I have come to offer you a deal. 
                    If you accept, I will give you a
                    different world.  A world without
                    curfews, without soldiers and
                    surveillance systems.  A world that
                    is not run by other men but that is
                    run by you.  I am offering you a
                    second chance.
          
          EXT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          The military forces have begun to swarm.
          
                              V
                    Four hundred years ago, a great
                    citizen made a most significant
                    contribution to our common culture. 
                    It was a contribution forged in
                    secrecy and stealth although it is
                    best remembered in noise and bright
                    light.
          
          EXT.  TELEVISION STORE
          
          A crowd has gathered, watching through the window.
          
                              V
                    To commemorate that glorious night
                    at precisely the stroke of
                    midnight, the edifice of their
                    world will erupt with enough sound
                    and fury to shake the earth.  All I
                    ask is that you join me at the
                    gates to watch as the past is
                    erased, the pathway cleared so that
                    together we can start toward a new
                    day.
          
          EXT.  JORDAN TOWER
          
          The Leader climbs out of his limo and is met by one of his
          captains.
          
                              LEADER
                    I want this man dead!  I want him
                    shot on sight!
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    Yes, sir.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S CAR
          
          Finch can see the forces gathering outside Jordan tower.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    But, you ask, who am I to make such
                    promises?  A fair question but
                    hardly necessary as you know me
                    already.  To know me any more you
                    need only look to a mirror.
          
          Finch catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror.
          
          INT.  CONTROL BOOTH
          
          VTV fills every screen.
          
                              V
                    Truth be told, this wasn't even my
                    idea, was it?  If you think back,
                    you'll remember that night,
                    whispering in your lover's arms.  I
                    became a part of your plan just as
                    you have now become part of mine. 
                    Give me the line of the queen and
                    I'll give you your secret dream.
          
          INT.  JORDAN TOWER - HALLWAY
          
          A heavy battering ram is rushed down the hall, carried by
          four soldiers.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    On the twelfth stroke of the fifth
                    day of the eleventh month, I hope
                    we shall all meet again.
          
          EXT.  TELEVISION STORE
          
          The crowd is much larger.
          
                              V
                    Until then, I bid you goodnight.
          
          Every screen suddenly goes black.  The crowd turns to each
          other, unsure of what to do.
          
          INT.  CONTROL BOOTH
          
          The door explodes open.  V is standing alone, almost as if
          waiting for them.
          
          Before he can even move, they shoot.  Machine gun fire lights
          up the room.  V's body dances and jerks backward, smashing
          through an observation window --
          
          Falling to the television stage below.
          
          INT.  HALL
          
          A path is cleared for the Leader.  As he heads into the
          television studio, an armed soldier is heading in the
          opposite direction.
          
          It is impossible to tell because of the dark face plate but
          it looks like the soldier is smiling.
          
          The Leader shoves his way onto the main stage.  A group of
          soldiers is gathered around the body.
          
                              LEADER
                    Who was it?  Who was he?
          
          The mask is pried off, revealing the lifeless face of Roger
          Dascombe.  To the Leader, it is an obvious revelation.
          
                              LEADER
                    Roger Dascombe!  Of course.  Of
                    course!  It makes such perfect
                    sense.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    Sir, I think there has been a
                    mistake.
          
                              LEADER
                    No!  There is no mistake!
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    But sir, there are people that say
                    they saw both the terrorist and
                    Dascombe together --
          
                              LEADER
                    Who?  Who are these people?  They
                    must be detained immediately. 
                    Whatever they saw or whatever they
                    think they saw is subordinate to
                    the truth and that truth is that
                    Roger Dascombe is the terrorist and
                    the terrorist is dead!
          
                              FINCH
                    But I thought I was the terrorist.
          
          Finch's voice stops the Leader cold.
          
                              LEADER
                    Finch, what are you doing here?
          
                              FINCH
                    Since I'm not in jail and since you
                    have another, even more convenient
                    suspect.  I'm guessing the charges
                    have been dropped.
          
                              LEADER
                    Be careful, Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    I am careful, sir.  Always.  That
                    is why I suggest that a search of
                    this building begin immediately.

                    The terrorist is dead!
          
                              FINCH
                    With all due respect, I disagree
                    and I believe that he is presently
                    trying to get out of this building
                    disguised as one of us.

                    Are you challenging my authority?
          
                              FINCH
                    No sir, I'm trying to run an
                    investigation --
          
                              LEADER
                    I am trying to run a country!  When
                    I tell you, Mr. Finch, the
                    terrorist is dead, then the
                    terrorist is dead!  If you continue
                    to suggest otherwise then you will
                    leave me no choice but to have you
                    arrested on charges of sedition. 
                    Do I make myself clear?

                    Now, it is imperative for the
                    people of London to know that they
                    are safe, that the terrorist is
                    dead and everything is under
                    control.
          
          The Leader storms past Finch who looks at Dascombe and bites
          down on his pipe.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          One of the Ear's black vans has been modified with large
          speakers wired to the roof.  As the van rolls down the
          street, the speakers drone with a looped message.
          
                              SPEAKERS
                    The terrorist is dead.  No further
                    threat exists.  Everything is under
                    control.
          
          Out of the back, soldiers hurl leaflets that swirl and
          flutter in the van's wake.
          
          The little girl on the bicycle that we saw earlier stops and
          picks up one of the leaflets.
          
          It has a picture with the body of Roger Dascombe beneath the
          headline, "The terrorist is dead!  London is safe once
          again!"
          
                              LITTLE GIRL
                    Bollocks.
          
          She crumbles the leaflet and throws it.
          
                              LITTLE GIRL
                    Bollocks!
          
          She gets off her bike and takes something out of the
          backpack.
          
                              LITTLE GIRL
                    He's not dead!  It's all bollocks!
          
          Turning to a nearby wall, she spray paints a large circle
          around a "V".

                    dream.
          
          Dominic freezes the image; V stares at them, smiling.

                    Come on, Finch.  We've seen it
                    fifty times.  I mean, after what
                    they done to you, I don't know why
                    we're even trying to stop him.
          
          Finch stares out the window.
          
                              FINCH
                    I don't know.  For twenty seven
                    years, I've been at this job. 
                    Twenty seven years, I've done what
                    I've been told to do.  Maybe that's
                    all there is to it.  I'm just a
                    dumb old dog.  A dumb old dog that
                    only knows one trick.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    That ain't it, Finch.  It's more
                    than that.  I know you.  It's
                    something personal with this one.
          
          Finch smiles.
          
                              FINCH
                    Maybe.  And maybe I'm not ready for
                    a revolution.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    Well, we got less than thirty hours
                    to stop it.
          
                              FINCH
                    We will.

                    How?
          
                              FINCH
                    It's on the tape.  I know it.  I
                    can feel it.  He did this for a
                    reason.  He needs something.

                    The line of the Queen?
          
                              DOMINIC
                    But what does that mean?
          
                              FINCH
                    Maybe it's a line from Shakespeare. 
                    Or a book.  I don't know.
          
          He rewinds and starts the tape.

          Helen Heyer is lying on her bed, eating chocolates, watching
          V through calculating eyes.
          
          At her feet, we hear a suckling noise that suddenly stops.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Helen?  Helen, why did you want
                    that tape?
          
                              HELEN
                    Shut up, Conrad.  I'm thinking.
          
          She shoves her foot back into his mouth and he continues to
          suck on it and each of her toes.

                    How?  How did you know that?
          
          Conrad moves up her ankle, licking and kissing his way to her
          knee.

          She freezes the tape.  Her eyes light up and she smiles back
          at him.

                    All right.  You have a deal.
          
          Conrad licks along the inside of her thigh until she slaps
          him.

                    Oh no!  Not you.  Conrad.  Not yet. 
                    Here you can have a chocolate. 
                    Open up.  Open!
          
          She shoves the candy in his mouth.

                    Good boy.  As for the rest of the
                    box, perhaps when you're Leader.
          
          She smiles.

                    Right now I need something else
                    Conrad.  I need you to use that
                    pretty little brain for me.  You
                    know all about the old underground,
                    don't you?
          
          He nods still gagged with the candy.
          
                              HELEN
                    I need to know everything,

                    imperative to speak with you and to
                    assure you once and for all that
                    the shadow that recently fell
                    across our land has indeed passed.

                    What we have endured this long year
                    was no accident, no mere
                    coincidence.  This was not a simple
                    act of terror conducted by a
                    singular madman.  No, this was a

                    this year.  It was our beliefs. 
                    Our faith.  I believe that God
                    himself bore witness to our
                    struggle and like Job I believe
                    that we have been vindicated.

                    on the Earth by the means of those
                    miracles which he had the power to
                    do --"
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh, V, turn it off, please.
          
                              V
                    Of course, my dear.
          
          He reaches over and changes the frequency.  We hear voices,
          hushed and secret but we recognize them.
          
                              CREEDY (V.O.)
                    But how does he know?
          
                              HELEN (V.O.)
                    I don't know.  All I know is he
                    does... And I know what he wants.
          
          The voices are labored, punctuated by gasps and moans.
          
                              EVEY
                    What is that, V?
          
                              V
                    That, Evey, is what I have been
                    waiting for.
          
                              CREEDY (V.O.)
                    Do you know what I want?  I want
                    you just like this... Bent over
                    that black leather chair...
          
          We are pulled by the radio into --
          
          INT.  CREEDY'S BEDROOM
          
          Where we see a tiny microphone hidden in the ceiling light
          above the bed.
          
          Helen moans as we drift down, glimpsing Helen, her arms
          reaching for the edges of the bed, her back arching up
          towards Creedy, behind her, smiling.
          
                              CREEDY
                    What about Conrad?
          
                              HELEN
                    I told you, I'll handle Conrad and
                    V will take care of Susan.  The mob
                    will take care of the guard and
                    then... You can use the Finger to
                    take over.
          
                              CREEDY
                    Use the Finger?  You mean like
                    this?
          
          He inserts a finger into her.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh... oh... that is vulgar...
          
                              CREEDY
                    But you like it?
          
                              HELEN
                    Yes, oh yes, oh you're a pig,
                    Peter...
          
                              CREEDY
                    That I am, misses.  But I'm the pig
                    that's gonna be running this
                    country.
          
          That sends a shiver through Helen's body.
          
                              HELEN
                    Yes and I'm... I'm going to be
                    Eva... Oh Eva...
          
          Her eyes close and her fists knot the sheets.
          
                              HELEN
                    "Don't cry for me Argen... oh
                    Argen... Argen... tina!
          
          The word is almost lost in her orgasm.
          
          EXT.  LONDON
          
          The sun rises over London.  It is the morning of the fourth.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          Finch looks through the blinds at the morning sun.  He has
          been up all night.  He checks his watch: 6:00am.
          
                              FINCH
                    Eighteen hours.
          
          Rubbing the knot in his neck, he turns back to his office
          which is now buried beneath mounds of paper.
          
          Dominic is passed out, sprawled on the couch, and clutching a
          printout from Spencer's "Fairy Queen."
          
                              FINCH
                    Dominic!
          
          Dominic jumps, immediately searching the printout.
          
                              FINCH
                    Dominic, go home.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    But I've still got over three
                    hundred lines from The Fairy Queen.
          
                              FINCH
                    Forget it.  There's no more time. 
                    You go home and get some rest. 
                    You're going to need it tonight.
          
          Dominic lets the papers fall to the floor.
          
                              DOMINIC
                    He's got us, doesn't he, Finch?
          
                              FINCH
                    Yes, he does.
          
          EXT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          Conrad pulls his car into his reserved space.
          
          INT.  CAR
          
          Helen holds Conrad's chin the way a mother holds a child when
          she is telling them something important.
          
                              HELEN
                    Now listen to me, Conrad.  This is
                    the most important moment of our
                    lives.  Everything I've worked and
                    hoped for comes to this.  Susan is
                    a very dangerous man, especially
                    now, that's why I need you, Conrad. 
                    I need you to be stronger than him. 
                    I need you to be the better man. 
                    Understand?
          
          Conrad nods.
          
                              HELEN
                    If you do this Conrad, and you do
                    it right, I'm going to turn you
                    from the little man I married into
                    the man of my dreams.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Oh, Helen.
          
          He embraces her to kiss but she turns her perfectly painted
          lips.
          
                              HELEN
                    Not on the lips.
          
          Ardently, he kisses her cheek.
          
          INT.  FINCH'S OFFICE
          
          Finch sits alone, palms pressed to his bleary eyes.
          
                              FINCH
                    Give it up, old man.  You're not
                    even sure you want to stop him.
          
          With a red pen, he begins absently drawing red circles around
          any V he sees on any piece of paper.
          
          Victims.  Vectors.  Values.  Victory.  Words from quotes and
          lists.
          
          Suddenly, he stops.  Carefully, as if reaching to touch a
          butterfly, he slips a single sheet out from the sheaves
          covering his desk.
          
          The paper has a long list: the names of all the Queens of
          England.  He has circled in red the V in Victoria.
          
          When it hits him, it hits him like a falling safe.
          
                              FINCH
                    Christ!  That's it!  It's got to be
                    it!
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The intercom clicks on.
          
                              LIEUTENANT (V.O.)
                    Sir, Mr. Heyer is here to see you. 
                    Says it's urgent.  And he's here
                    with his wife, sir.
          
                              LEADER
                    His wife?
          
                              LIEUTENANT (V.O.)
                    Sir, yes, sir -- Wait, you can't
                    go --
          
          The door slaps open.
          
                              HELEN
                    Leader, I'm terribly sorry but I
                    absolutely must speak with you.
          
          The Leader waves the Lieutenant off.
          
                              HELEN
                    I have something to tell you,
                    something important but --
          
          She glances at Conrad.
          
                              HELEN
                    I can tell you and only you.  In
                    private.
          
          The Leader studies her.
          
                              HELEN
                    It is a matter of national
                    security.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          In his car, Finch races to a corner and slams on the brakes. 
          He gets out, staring at a shadow on the ground: a "V" in a
          circle.
          
          The shadow is cast by a sign for Victoria Station, part of
          the abandoned subway.
          
          The gates are chained shut.  He fires his pistol into the
          lock, kicks open the rusting gates, and descends into the
          underground.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S PRIVATE QUARTERS
          
          The Leader closes the door behind them.
          
                              LEADER
                    Now what's this all about, Mrs.
                    Heyer?
          
                              HELEN
                    Please, forgive me.  I've been so
                    afraid, afraid to come here to talk
                    to you.  I thought he must know.  I
                    was terrified he knew but I had to
                    come because I knew you were the
                    only one that can protect me.
          
                              LEADER
                    Protect you from what?
          
          She is unable to go on, seemingly about to burst into tears.
          
                              LEADER
                    Come now, Mrs. Heyer.
          
          He touches her and it is all she needs.  She buries her face
          into his chest.
          
                              HELEN
                    You won't let him hurt me, will
                    you?
          
                              LEADER
                    Let who hurt you?
          
                              HELEN
                    The terrorist.
          
                              LEADER
                    The terrorist is dead.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh, how I wanted to believe it,
                    Leader, but I know it's not true.
          
                              LEADER
                    How?
          
                              HELEN
                    Because I know who the terrorist
                    is.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          Conrad is alone with Fate.  He glances about nervously,
          moving closer and closer.  His fingers reach out and graze
          the main keyboard.  Taking a deep breath, he turns and begins
          to type.
          
          INT.  PRIVATE QUARTERS
          
          The Leader takes hold of Helen by her shoulders.
          
                              LEADER
                    Who?  Who is it, woman?
          
                              HELEN
                    It's Conrad, Leader.  Conrad.  My
                    husband is the terrorist.
          
                              LEADER
                    What?!
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          Conrad accesses the department of water and power.  He finds
          the correct file and begins rerouting power to a once dead
          system.
          
          INT.  V'S TRAIN STATION
          
          A hanging light suddenly sizzles to life.  V looks up,
          smiling.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S PRIVATE QUARTERS
          
          The Leader stares hard at Helen.
          
                              LEADER
                    How do you know?
          
                              HELEN
                    I saw him, Leader.  In the middle
                    of the night.  I heard something. 
                    I went to the landing and that's
                    when I saw it.
          
          She clutches him.
          
                              HELEN
                    That mask.  That hideous smiling
                    mask.
          
                              LEADER
                    But how did you know it was Heyer?
          
                              HELEN
                    I know, Leader.  I know the way a
                    woman knows.
          
                              LEADER
                    But you have no proof?
          
                              HELEN
                    Proof?
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, proof?  This is an extremely
                    delicate situation, Mrs. Heyer.  It
                    has been reported that the
                    terrorist is dead.  It would be a
                    catastrophe to arrest a man now
                    without concrete, conclusive proof. 
                    Do you have any evidence at all?
          
          Tears well up in Helen's eyes as she shakes her head.
          
                              LEADER
                    But if you're right, if Heyer is
                    indeed the terrorist...
          
          His eyes fly wide and he spins away from her, throwing open
          the door.
          
                              HELEN
                    Leader!  Wait!
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          Conrad sits calmly across the room.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Is everything all right?  Helen?
          
                              LEADER
                    Yes, Mr. Heyer, your wife has done
                    her duty to her country.
          
          He turns to Helen.
          
                              LEADER
                    Don't worry, Mrs. Heyer.  You will
                    be taken care of.  I will launch an
                    immediate investigation and I
                    promise, you will be the first to
                    know when an arrest will be made.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Investigation of what?
          
                              LEADER
                    Subversion, Mr. Heyer.  Your wife
                    was privy to the dialogue of
                    subversives.  That's all you need
                    to know at this time.  Lieutenant!
          
          The Lieutenant appears almost instantly.
          
                              LEADER
                    The Heyers are leaving.  I need to
                    see Mr. Creedy at once.
          
          Helen looks up at the Leader, a smile hidden near the corners
          of her perfect red lips.
          
                              HELEN
                    Thank you, sir.
          
          The Leader nods.
          
          INT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          Helen and Conrad get out of the elevator, standing beneath
          the rows of new party flags that line the lobby.
          
                              HELEN
                    I want you to go straight to your
                    office and wait for me to call. 
                    When I do, I want you to come
                    immediately home.  Understood?
          
                              CONRAD
                    Yes, Helen.
          
          She embraces him, pressing her body against his.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh, Conrad, I'm so proud of you.
          
                              CONRAD
                    I did it, Helen.  I did it, didn't
                    I?
          
                              HELEN
                    Tonight, Conrad.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Tonight.
          
                              HELEN
                    I promise you will never forget
                    tonight.
          
          She almost kisses him.
          
                              HELEN
                    Goodbye, Conrad.
          
          Smiling, she pivots on her heel and heads for the door.  He
          reaches for her when --
          
                              GUARD
                    Mr. Heyer!  Mr. Heyer!
          
          The front desk guard rushes towards him.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Yes?
          
                              GUARD
                    Sir, this package arrived for you,
                    sir.
          
          He hands him a small, brown wrapped box.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Thank you.
          
          He looks back for Helen but she is already gone.
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          A single flashlight beam creeps toward us as Finch searches
          the detritus of the dead train line.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S CAR
          
          Sitting at a stoplight, Conrad decides to open the package. 
          Inside is a cassette tape.  The light changes and a car
          behind him honks.  He starts forward and inserts the tape.
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          Finch crawls up onto the platform of V's hidden station,
          staring at the beautiful old train car.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S CAR
          
          Strangling the steering wheel, Conrad listens to the tape. 
          The speedometer climbs as everything seems to accelerate.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    Do you know what I want?  I want
                    you just like this... bent over
                    that black leather chair.
          
          Helen moans.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Finch steps inside the car, his flashlight sweeping over the
          stacks of gelignite.
          
                              FINCH
                    Oh my god.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S CAR
          
          A scream builds in Conrad.  With tears in his eyes, he stares
          out the windshield but sees only the images created by the
          tape.
          
                              TAPE (V.O.)
                    Use the Finger?... You mean like
                    this?... Oh... That's vulgar... But
                    you like it?... Yes... oh yes.
          
          Conrad loses control and the car careens up onto the sidewalk
          and smashes into a brick wall.
          
          Lifting his bloodied forehead, Conrad looks out and sees the
          ubiquitous poster partially destroyed by the crash: "Strength
          through purity, purity through faith."
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Finch hears something and jerks back, almost falling out of
          the car.  Aiming his gun, he finds no one.  He turns and
          bolts.
          
          As the sound of his footsteps fade, V steps out of the
          shadows.
          
          INT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          The Leader's Lieutenant looks up from his desk and sees Finch
          rushing towards him.
          
                              FINCH
                    Is the Leader in?
          
                              LIEUTENANT
                    Yes, but he's meeting with the
                    Captain of the Guard.
          
                              FINCH
                    Perfect.
          
                              LIEUTENANT
                    Mr. Finch, you can't go in --
          
          Finch charges through the doors.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader and his Captain turn.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch?
          
                              FINCH
                    Leader, I need as many men the
                    Captain can spare and I need them
                    right now.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    What for?
          
                              FINCH
                    To capture codename V.
          
          EXT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          Creedy opens the trunk of his car.  In the phosphorescent
          glow of the streetlight, the set of knives gleam.  He bundles
          the costume that he tried to planet on Finch into his arms,
          then slams the trunk.
          
          Above, a window blind that was cracked open snaps shut.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader moves towards Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    He's underground.  The old subway. 
                    I know exactly what he's going to
                    do.  If we move quickly, we can be
                    there, waiting for him.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          Conrad waits, hidden inside a bedroom closet.  He hears the
          front door close and his grip tightens around the handle of a
          long, steel-necked hammer.
          
          INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE
          
          The Leader is steadily convincing himself of something.
          
                              FINCH
                    Leader, every second we delay...
          
          The Leader lifts his hand, silencing Finch.
          
                              LEADER
                    I'm coming with you.
          
                              GUARD
                    Sir --
          
                              LEADER
                    There will be no discussion --
          
                              GUARD
                    But if Mr. Finch is right --
          
                              LEADER
                    I am sick to death of this
                    terrorist being everywhere and
                    nowhere!  I will judge whether Mr.
                    Finch is right and I will judge it
                    with my own eyes!  Do I make myself
                    clear, Captain?
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    Sir, yes, sir!
          
          Finch is suddenly overwhelmed by a feeling that is common to
          chess players.  It is the disturbing sense that you have just
          done exactly what your opponent wanted.
          
                              LEADER
                    Is there a problem, Mr. Finch?
          
                              FINCH
                    No... no sir.
          
                              LEADER
                    Good.  Captain, mobilize your men.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    Sir, yes, sir.
          
                              LEADER
                    We'll find this bloody bastard and
                    we will finish him.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey sits in the gallery, reading Pynchon's "V" just as V had
          done.  She suddenly feels V watching her.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?

                    Yes.
          
          Evey smiles as V steps out of the shadows.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, what's going to happen?
          
                              V
                    Change, Evey.  That's all.  Just
                    change.
          
                              EVEY
                    Is it going to be violent?
          
                              V
                    Yes, I suppose it will.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          Creedy empties a bottom drawer, making room to hide the
          costume.  As he does, the closet door behind him slowly
          creeps open.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V stands at the jukebox.
          
                              EVEY
                    But why?  Why must is be violent?
          
                              V
                    Because, Evey, that is the nature
                    of change.  She is a temperamental
                    creature that appears in earnest
                    rarely but, when she does, she will
                    wear one of two faces.  The first
                    face is the destroyer.  It is
                    lamentable but all true change
                    begins with death.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          A dark figure stands over Creedy.  The hammer raises, a slash
          of silver against the velvety darkness.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V punches a button on the jukebox just as --
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          The hammer falls with a sickening soft crunch.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          The song begins to play; a melancholy song that says goodbye
          to love.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          Blood pours down Creedy's snarling face, he snatches one of
          V's knives as another hammer blow cracks through his collar
          bone.
          
          He screams, lunging at Conrad.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          V listens to the song, the smiling eyes somehow knowing.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          The hammer falls again and again until the metal head is
          slick with blood and meat.
          
          Conrad stumbles back, dropping the hammer.  He looks down at
          the hilt of the knife protruding from his stomach.  He yanks
          it out and holds V's knife which is bright red with his own
          blood.
          
          He collapses to the floor.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          The song continues.

                    What is the other face, V?
          
                              V
                    The other face?  She is the true
                    face of change.  The face of the
                    creator.  She is the one that
                    remakes the world.  Evey?
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, V?
          
                              V
                    May I ask you for a favor?
          
                              EVEY
                    Of course.
          
                              V
                    It is a small thing but it would
                    mean a great deal to me.
          
                              EVEY
                    Tell me.
          
                              V
                    I've never danced before.  I've
                    thought about it many times, here
                    in this room, listening to the
                    music.  But I've always been alone.
          
          Evey smiles and crosses to him.
          
                              EVEY
                    It would be my pleasure.
          
          He opens his arms and she steps into them.  They dance,
          standing very close, his gloved hand holding tightly to hers,
          her smile against his.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Dozens of military vehicles swarm around the entrance to
          Victoria Station while heavily armed men pour through the
          gates of the underground.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          The song ends.
          
                              V
                    Thank you, Evey.  You are an
                    excellent dancer.
          
                              EVEY
                    All it takes is a little practice.
          
                              V
                    Alas, I have run out of time.
          
          He bows, pressing his frozen lips to her hand.  Evey is
          suddenly nervous.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?  What are you going to do?
          
                              V
                    Don't you remember?  I have a date
                    tonight, Evey.
          
                              EVEY
                    You're coming back though, aren't
                    you?
          
          She seizes hold of his hand.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, I won't let you leave unless you
                    promise me that you will come back.
          
                              V
                    Of course, I'll be back.  You don't
                    think you can be rid of me now, do
                    you?
          
                              EVEY
                    Just promise.
          
                              V
                    I promise.
          
          She lets him go.
          
          INT.  TRAIN STATION
          
          Soldiers swarm through the station.  Susan stares in shock,
          outraged by the mere presence of the train.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mark my words, Mr. Finch, this man
                    is going to become an example so
                    that every man, woman, and child in
                    this country will remember what
                    happens to those who would ever
                    think to stand against the state.
          
          He turns to the Captain.
          
                              LEADER
                    Captain, I need a gas unit down
                    here with enough nerve gas to fill
                    every rat-hole in these tunnels.
          
          Suddenly the lights go out.
          
                              FINCH
                    I don't think that will be
                    necessary.
          
          The Leader smiles.
          
                              LEADER
                    There are over one hundred of the
                    best trained soldiers in this
                    country down here.  Let him come.
          
          INT.  TRAIN TUNNELS
          
          Five soldiers creep forward in a tight formation, their
          flashlights probing every nook and cranny.
          
          Behind them, a secret passage opens and V steps out.
          
          He is among them with frightful speed, a grinning dervish
          with blades like metal fangs ripping and rending flesh,
          slashing bright in the flashlight.
          
          Other soldiers rush towards the screams and gunfire but they
          find only five bodies and warm blood running down the walls.
          
                              LEADER
                    Captain, what's happening?
          
                              RADIO (V.O.)
                    No sign sir.  Repeat, no sign of
                    him.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    They lost him.
          
          From the opposite end, there is another series of screams and
          machine gun fire that lights up the dark tunnel for a moment. 
          Then, nothing.
          
                              FINCH
                    This... this is a mistake.
          
                              LEADER
                    Don't tell me you're a coward, Mr.
                    Finch.
          
          Back in the tunnels, V drops from above, his cloak a swirling
          cloud of squid ink that hides him in the darkness.
          
          Again, quicksilver knives lash out, drawing fonts of blood.
          
          INT.  TRAIN STATION
          
          Finch can feel the panic that is spreading through the
          tunnel.
          
                              FINCH
                    Leader, we have to get out of here!
          
                              LEADER
                    This was your idea.
          
                              FINCH
                    It was a mistake.  This is what he
                    wants.  He knows us, Leader.  He
                    knows us too well.  We have to get
                    out of here before it's too late --
          
          A voice rings out from hidden speakers, echoing through the
          tunnels.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Good evening citizens of London. 
                    This is the voice of Fate.  Your
                    fate...
          
                              LEADER
                    What trick is this?
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Tonight, the face of London is
                    going to change and I am going to
                    offer you the chance to change with
                    her.  Your Leader is finished.  He
                    will not leave these tunnels alive.
          
          The Leader screams to be heard over the resonant voice of V.
          
                              LEADER
                    This is an outrage!  I order you
                    not to listen to this!
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    At midnight tonight, the Head will
                    be destroyed and a new era will
                    begin.  You must now decide if you
                    are going to be a part of that era.
          
          Everywhere, terrified soldiers listen to the voice.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    You can choose to stay here and die
                    with your Leader or you can choose
                    to be free.  The decision is yours
                    and yours alone.
          
                              LEADER
                    Captain, order all your men to fall
                    back and secure this position!
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Some of you have wives.  Some of
                    you have families.  All of you have
                    lives.  Consider each of them as
                    you ask yourself, are they a part
                    of the past, or are they a part of
                    the future?
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    Fall back.  Fall back and secure
                    the central platform.
          
          Deep in the tunnel, two soldiers look at each other. 
          Simultaneously, they drop their guns and run.
          
                              LEADER
                    Any man that disobeys this order
                    will be court marshaled!
          
          Groups of solders drop their weapons and disappear into the
          shadows.
          
                              LEADER
                    Captain!  Captain, where are your
                    men?
          
          The station fills with the sound of boots running wildly
          away.
          
                              LEADER
                    Goddammit, I will not tolerate this
                    insubordination!  I want those
                    deserters shot, Captain.
          
          Finch slowly draws back away from the Leader.
          
                              LEADER
                    Shot on sight!
          
          The few men on the platform are soon the only men left.
          
                              CAPTAIN
                    You!  You!  Point position.  We're
                    getting out of here!  Now!
          
          A knife sings through the air and buries itself in the
          Captain's chest.  With a tiny rasp, he falls to the ground.
          
          The remaining men bolt.
          
                              LEADER
                    Traitors!  You cowards!
          
          He grabs for the Captain's machine gun.
          
                              LEADER
                    I know who you are!  I'll see you
                    hang!  Every last one of you!
          
          "You" echoes down the dark empty throat of the tunnel.
          
          The Leader looks around, his flashlight sweeping in big arcs
          as he realizes that he is alone.
          
                              LEADER
                    Finch?  Finch!  Finch, goddammit,
                    you can't leave me!  Don't leave
                    me!
          
                              V
                    You are going to die as you ruled --
          
          The Leader screams, whipping around towards the voice.
          
                              V
                    Alone.
          
          The smile is as cold and as sharp as the knife that flicks
          from his hand.
          
          The Leader raises his gun just when the knife sinks into his
          shoulder.
          
          Howling in pain, he drops the gun.
          
                              LEADER
                    Damn you!  Damn you!
          
          V smiles into the spot of his flashlight.
          
                              LEADER
                    Conrad?  Is that you?  You're
                    working with Finch, aren't you? 
                    And Creedy!  You're all in this
                    together!
          
          V closes in.
          
                              LEADER
                    Who are you?
          
                              V
                    You, most of all, should know,
                    Leader.  You created me.  Without
                    you, I would never be.  More than
                    life, Leader, you gave me purpose.
          
          V draws his final blade.
          
                              V
                    "He that killeth with the sword,
                    shall be killed with the sword."
          
          V raises the knife.
          
                              LEADER
                    Noooo!
          
                              FINCH
                    Don't move!
          
          V and the Leader turn to find Finch aiming a machine gun at
          V.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch!  Oh god, Mr. Finch!
          
                              FINCH
                    Drop the knife.
          
          V does and Susan begins an almost hysterical laugh.
          
                              LEADER
                    Oh, I knew it, Mr. Finch.  I knew
                    you wouldn't desert me.  You're a
                    good man, Finch.  A damn good man.
          
                              FINCH
                    No, Mr. Susan.  No, I'm not.  I'm a
                    man who does his job and does what
                    he's told.  For twenty seven years,
                    that's all I've been.
          
          He steps toward V, staring into his smiling black eyes.
          
                              LEADER
                    Careful, Mr. Finch.  He's quick as
                    the devil.
          
          Finch ignores the Leader.
          
                              FINCH
                    I've read Delia's diary over and
                    over all year.  It sickens me but I
                    am unable to judge her.  I am as
                    guilty as she.
          
                              LEADER
                    Mr. Finch, what are you doing? 
                    Shoot him.  Kill the bastard,
                    Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    I have no excuse.  I did what I was
                    told to do.
          
                              LEADER
                    Finch, I order you to shoot him! 
                    Finch!
          
                              FINCH
                    My job was to find you and catch
                    you.  I've done my job.  I've done
                    it for the last time.  I'm tired of
                    it.  I'm tired of it all.
          
          He tosses the gun to the Leader.
          
                              FINCH
                    Kill him yourself if you can.
          
          The Leader seethes, his eyes boring into Finch.
          
                              FINCH
                    Thank you, V.  And goodbye.
          
                              V
                    Goodbye, Mr. Finch.
          
          The machine gun burst shatters the quiet concrete silence. 
          Finch falls dead at V's feet.
          
                              LEADER
                    I warned you, Finch, the penalty
                    for treason is death.
          
          He aims the gun at V.
          
                              LEADER
                    Are you ready to die?
          
                              V
                    The real question is, are you?
          
          The Leader laughs.
          
                              LEADER
                    Do you really believe you can pick
                    up that knife before I pull this
                    trigger?
          
                              V
                    No.  But I don't have to.
          
          Almost casually, V bends down to pick up the knife --
          
          The Leader screams and fires.
          
          Bullets knock V back a bit but he continues, grabbing the
          knife and standing.
          
          Eyes widening with disbelief, the Leader fires another blast
          as V begins walking towards him.
          
          The machine gun roars, bullets shredding out through the back
          of V's cloak as he continues with short deliberate steps
          until --
          
          The hammer clicks against the pin.  The gun is empty.
          
          V stands before him.
          
                              V
                    You see?  You cannot kill me. 
                    There is no flesh and blood within
                    this cloak to kill.  There is only
                    an idea.
          
          V smiles.
          
                              V
                    And ideas are bulletproof.
          
          The Leader screams.
          
          V drives the knife into his heart, killing him instantly.
          
          V stands alone amidst the carnage and seeping pools of red.
          
          His body wavers.  He takes his hands out from beneath his
          cloak and reveals his gloves, wet with blood.
          
          INT.  CONRAD'S HOUSE
          
          The front door opens and Helen enters.
          
                              HELEN
                    Creedy?  Creedy, you dumb bastard,
                    you left your car parked in front.
          
          She walks up the stairs to the bedroom.
          
                              HELEN
                    What did I tell you?  Creedy.
          
          INT.  BEDROOM
          
          She steps into the room, her sole and heel sinking into the
          plush carpet soaked with blood.
          
                              HELEN
                    Oh my god.
          
          When she sees Creedy's head mashed open, she covers her
          mouth.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Helen...
          
          Conrad has propped himself against the bed.
          
                              HELEN
                    Conrad!  What have you done?
          
                              CONRAD
                    I won, Helen.  I did it.  I won. 
                    I'm the better man.
          
          He crawls toward her, slipping on the wet carpet.
          
                              CONRAD
                    We've been through a bad patch,
                    Helen.  But now, he's gone...
                    There's nothing to come between
                    us...
          
          He reaches for her foot, his hand gloved with wet red.
          
                              HELEN
                    Don't touch me!  You stupid piece
                    of shit!  You've ruined it!  I had
                    it all planned perfectly and you've
                    ruined it!
          
          She checks her watch; two hours to midnight.
          
                              HELEN
                    I have to get out of here!  I have
                    to get away!
          
          Conrad seizes hold of her ankle.
          
                              CONRAD
                    Helen --
          
                              HELEN
                    No!  Let go!  Now!
          
          The look in his eyes frightens her.  She tries to kick free
          of him but he won't let go.  Twisting, she reaches for the
          door but slips on the carpet.
          
                              HELEN
                    Conrad, damn you!  Let me go!
          
                              CONRAD
                    No, Helen, you're not leaving me...
                    not this time... not ever.
          
          He crawls up her body still clutching the bloody knife.
          
                              HELEN
                    No, please!  Oh god, no!  Oh god,
                    please help me!
          
          Conrad raises the knife.
          
                              CONRAD
                    No one can help us, Helen.  God is
                    dead.
          
          The knife falls.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey hears V on the spiral staircase.
          
                              EVEY
                    V?
          
          Scarlet footprints trail behind V as he struggles down the
          stairs.
          
                              EVEY
                    You came back.
          
          He nods and then collapses, rolling down the rest of the
          stairs.
          
                              EVEY
                    V!  V!
          
          Running to him, she falls to his side.  His clothes are slick
          with blood.
          
                              EVEY
                    Oh god, what happened?
          
                              V
                    Evey...
          
                              EVEY
                    You need a doctor.
          
                              V
                    It's too late for that...
          
                              EVEY
                    No, don't say that!
          
                              V
                    Evey, listen to me.  I've not long
                    and there are things that must be
                    said.
          
          His voice strains beneath the mask.
          
                              V
                    I have done that which I came to
                    do.  Now, it is time for me to rest
                    and with me the past will, at last,
                    find peace.
          
          Trembling, Evey holds him.
          
                              V
                    But the world, the world is not
                    saved... Do not think that, when
                    the fires die and the smoke clears,
                    there is no miracle... there is
                    only a path... upon which they must
                    learn to rule themselves.
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, they need you, V.
          
                              V
                    Not me, Evey, not me.  I told you I
                    am the villain.  The destroyer...
                    But yes, they will need help...
          
          He reaches up and wipes a tear from her cheek.
          
                              V
                    I kept my promise to you, Evey...
                    Now you must promise me.
          
                              EVEY
                    What?
          
                              V
                    Promise me... you will discover the
                    face under this mask... but you
                    will never look beneath it.
          
                              EVEY
                    I don't understand.
          
                              V
                    Promise me.  Please...
          
                              EVEY
                    I promise.
          
                              V
                    Sweet Eve.  Wherever I shall go, I
                    shall always love you.
          
                              EVEY
                    V, you are not going anywhere!
          
                              V
                    Midnight... Midnight.  Eve... Make
                    them remember...
          
                              EVEY
                    You're not going to die, V!
          
                              V
                    Let me be there, Evey, when it
                    begins... Please, let me hear the
                    music, one last time... my music...
          
                              EVEY
                    I won't let you die!
          
                              V
                    I know you won't... I know...
          
                              EVEY
                    V!
          
                              V
                    My love... Ave Atque vale...
          
          Holding him as tight as she can, she feels his life drain
          away, slipping through her arms in the way the last grains of
          sand pour through the neck of the hourglass.
          
          She buries her face beside his and weeps.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          An enormous crowd has begun to gather in the streets
          surrounding the New Government Building.  With the crowd, a
          restlessness swells against each barricade erected by the
          military.
          
          A sergeant stands on an armored car, speaking through a
          megaphone.
          
                              SERGEANT
                    Return to your homes!  There is
                    nothing to see!  The terrorist is
                    dead!
          
                              RABBLE ROUSER 1
                    He ain't dead!
          
                              RABBLE ROUSER 2
                    He'll be here, just like he said!
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Evey huddles against the stair railing, her face tear
          stained, staring at the lifeless body of V.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I remember... I remember staring at
                    the mask, at that smile.
          
          She touches the mask, her fingers finding its edge.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Part of me couldn't believe he was
                    dead and maybe that was why.  The
                    smile was still the same. 
                    It made me want to tear it off so I
                    could see the face, so I could see
                    that he was dead.
          
          Her fingers stop.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    But I had promised.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    You will discover the face under
                    this mask but you will never look
                    beneath it.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I began to try to imagine his face. 
                    Of course, I had long pictured my
                    father behind that smile but I knew
                    in my heart that V was not my
                    father.
          
          Evey stares into the eyes, the dark, empty eyes.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Yet every time I pictured another
                    face, any face, something was lost,
                    something important was somehow
                    diminished.  V was more than a
                    face.  V was V.
          
          Her expression changes.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    And then, quite suddenly, quite
                    naturally, I realized whose face
                    must be beneath that mask.  It was
                    the only face that mattered.
          
                              EVEY
                    I won't let you die.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    I know you won't... I know.
          
          A small smile creeps across her face.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Midnight approaches and the crowd feels it.  Spilling
          everywhere, they fill the streets like a flood.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Evey sets a final violet carson on the chest of V.  He is
          lying on a bed made of gelignite, covered in roses.
          
          Touching his mask, she bends over him.
          
                              EVEY
                    Goodbye, my love.
          
          Tenderly, she presses her lips to the smile, her eyes
          closing, her final tears blinking free.
          
          She backs away and V smiles, his lips wet with her kiss, his
          cheek wet with her tears.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    "Ave Atque vale."
          
          On the train platform, Evey reaches through the window and
          starts the train.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I looked it up the next morning.
          
          The wheels churn as the train lurches forward.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    "Hail and farewell."
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    "Make them remember..."
          
          She watches the train disappear into the tunnel.
          
                              EVEY
                    They will, my love.  They will.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          The crowd surges against a barricade when a voice cries out
          across the city echoing through the megaphone on every
          corner.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November!"
          
          High above the gathered mass, a masked figure steps out onto
          a roof parapet.
          
          The crowd explodes.
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          The train barrels along, screaming against its rusted rails.
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOP
          
          Dressed as V, Evey stands on the roof's edge, speaking into a
          microphone.
          
                              EVEY
                    I have come here tonight to keep a
                    promise.  A promise that is over
                    four hundred years old.  Tonight I
                    am here to give you your freedom!
          
          Again, the crowd bursts into a frenzy.
          
                              EVEY
                    Since mankind's dawn a handful of
                    oppressors have accepted the
                    responsibility over our lives,
                    responsibility that we should have
                    accepted ourselves.  By doing so,
                    they took our power.  By doing
                    nothing, we gave it away.
          
          The voice booms over the mesmerized crowd.
          
                              EVEY
                    Tonight, our world will change. 
                    Our leaders will be gone and we
                    must choose what comes next.  A
                    return to the chains of others or
                    lives of our own.  A world of the
                    past or one of the future.
          
          She feels the sea of humanity beneath her, almost channeling
          their energy.
          
                              EVEY
                    Let us choose carefully, London,
                    and when we do, let us mark well
                    and remember, remember this fifth
                    of November!
          
          The crowd screams as one and their scream becomes --
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          The train hurling like a bullet through a gun barrel.  Ahead
          the tracks end, buried beneath the rubble of the collapsed
          tunnel.
          
          INT.  TRAIN CAR
          
          Inside the rattling train, V lays in perfect repose.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Let me be there, Evey, when it
                    begins...
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOPS
          
          Hidden and alone, Evey pulls the mask from her face.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Please let me hear the music... one
                    last time... my music.
          
          Almost unconsciously, Evey raises her hand and coaxes the
          first soft notes as he had once done.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    At first, you have to listen
                    carefully.
          
          The violins of the 1812 overture steadily rise.
          
                              V (V.O.)
                    Ah, yes.  There it is.  Beautiful,
                    is it not?
          
          Evey smiles, her hand still gently conducting.
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, my love.  Yes it is.
          
          INT.  SUBWAY
          
          With the clash of cymbals, the train crashes into the wall of
          rubble.
          
          EXT.  NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
          
          The entire building opens like a time-lapsed rose blooming
          with brilliant orange petals of flame.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          The crowd is awash in the baptismal glow of erupting flame.
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOP
          
          Evey watches the explosion, a star-burst of flaming debris
          searing against the night sky like fireworks.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          The masses burst through the barricades with a euphoric
          frenzy.
          
          EXT.  ROOFTOP
          
          The explosion begins to slowly die.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I know that there is only one way
                    to repay him for what he did.
          
          She looks down at the mask.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    And I know that that way is going
                    to take a lot of hard work.
          
          She smiles.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I know this like I know the sun
                    will rise tomorrow and beneath that
                    new sun, our work will begin.
          
          The fire fades and Evey turns, cradling the mask, and walks
          away.
          
                                                          FADE OUT.
