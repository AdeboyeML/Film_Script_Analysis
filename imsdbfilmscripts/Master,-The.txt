                         DOCTOR
          What are you going to do when you get out
          of here? You're going to have to wear a
          belt for six months, maybe a year...

                         FREDDIE
          What kind of belt?

                         DOCTOR
          A surgical belt. You won't be able to do
          very heavy lifting.

                         FREDDIE
          .I try to stay away from that.

                         DOCTOR
          But you spend time outdoors.

                         DOCTOR
          You didn't have very much on you when you
          were admitted. Where were you going?

                         FREDDIE
          I was on my way to Placerville. To the
          Fair. Had a job waiting for me, with a
          friend of mine. He doesn't know where I
          am.

          Why don't you turn honest?
          You seem like an intelligent fellow.
          'Quick on your feet - you like to drink?

                         FREDDIE
          It's a weakness. But I like it.

                         DOCTOR
          I know what the other is too.

                         FREDDIE
          How can you tell that? I'm clean.

                         DOCTOR
          The tattoo's.

                         FREDDIE
          Is that a weakness...

                         DOCTOR
          No one ever made money chasing girls.

                         FREDDIE
          You're wrong. This tatoo's my Auntie.

                         DOCTOR
          Who's that?

                         FREDDIE
          My Auntie Bertha, (she raised me.) But
          that doesn't mean I don't have a
          weakness...

                         DOCTOR
          College?

                         FREDDIE
          I tried that, it didn't work.

                         DOCTOR
          Why'd you leave?

                         FREDDIE
          Sometimes my hypo's get the best of
          me, I really feel like walking into the
          street and hitting people's hats off.

                         DOCTOR
          That's how you end up like this. With a
          burst appendix.

          That's when I know it's time to get to
          the sea.. what kind of belt?

                         DOCTOR
          A medical belt. Similar for lifting.
          You're going to need some money. What do
          you plan to do?

                         FREDDIE
          I'm going to pay back the hospital. And
          you.

                         DOCTOR
          You don't owe me anything. I'm on surgical
          duty. But you're expected to pay the
          hospital for medicines. And your belt.

                         FREDDIE
          Alright. I intend to do that. You saying
          you have a job for me? What? As an
          orderly?

                         DOCTOR
          You couldn't be an orderly, it's too much
          lifting -- and a lot of things you'd have
          to learn. But maybe you could run an
          elevator, something of that sort.

                         FREDDIE
          I want to get out of here, but I also
          like it here. You think I was gonna die?

                         DOCTOR
          I know you were, Freddie.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't know. I'm not saying you didn't
          save me... . but...I can't seem to die.

                         DOCTOR
          Too lucky?

                         FREDDIE
          Something like that.

          burst of a scene, establish he wants to get back to sea,
          wants work, but there's nothing for a few weeks.

          VARIOUS ANGLES. Freddie makes his way around the docks,
          looking for something/anything. PLAY OUT.
          He comes across a SHIP that's being readied for voyage.
          It's an old cattle TRAWLER that seems converted to some
          kind of CRUISE SHIP/PRIVATE YACHT-type vessel.
          There's a buzz of getting ready around the ship also a
          minor cocktail party in progress. (light music playing
          from the ship...) DECKHANDS preparing to ship out, etc...
          Freddie approaches the gang-plank...no one is there to
          guard it. He walks straight up the gang plank and gets on
          board the ship.

          ANGLE, ON BOARD.
          CAMERA follows him around... no one seems to notice or
          care...

          can't be hard to find.

          appendix, your work, your need to batter
          your body with booze...) I resolve that
          they can be fixed.

          to do, I can do it.

          I am many things. I am writer, a doctor,
          a nuclear physicist, a theoretical
          philosopher. Above all, I am a man, A
          hopelessly inquisitive Man, just like

                         MASTER
          Many years of successful writing and
          publishing has made me self sufficient.
          Reader's in all languages have enjoyed my
          work - but now I'm retired to study the
          mid and the spirit...my life's true work.

                         FREDDIE

                         MASTER
          These studies have made me a target and I
          am hunted for what I know. Which is
          why... it is so un-wise to go lurking and
          jumping on strange ships.. .how do we know
          what your motives are?

          out of hand last night - I'm just...
          looking for work and your ship looked
          good, so...it's a nice looking ship.

                         MASTER
          Don't apologize. You're a scoundrel. How
          I miss the days of working a four
          mastered schooner with nothing but salt
          horse, dried peas and a couple quarts of
          water.. .the present-day maritimer's seem
          so much more fragile, don't you think?

          It's mid-dinner, post-wedding ceremony party, everyone is
          celebrating, drinking. Master talking a blue streak,
          acting this out.

                         MASTER
          Now, now, now, how 'bout this: Here it
          comes - swooping down on me: A LARGE

          DRAGON, TEETH AND BLOOD DRIPPING! RED

          EYES!
          What do I go? A lasoooo! Whip it up, wrap
          it around it's neck. I wrastle, wrastle,
          wrastle'em to the ground - I snap up, I
          say: sit.
          Everyone laughs, Master is acting all this out, rolling
          around, etc as if he's training a dog...

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Dragon sits. I say: stay. Sragon stays.
          So now he's got a leash on and he's
          staying on my command - THAT"S WHAT WHERE
          WERE AT WITH IT NOW - it stays on
          command.
          Everyone is laughing, lapping it all up. He glances;

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Next we're gonna teach it to roll over
          and play DEAD.
          Master sits down, starts speaking to someone about his
          days studying Judo ...
          FREDDIE, sitting up at the dinner table-across the
          table is: VAL, strikes up conversation:

                         VAL
          Freddie, I'm Val, the son.

                         FREDDIE
          Hello.

                         VAL
          Are you having a good time?

                         FREDDIE
          Yes.

                         VAL

                         VAL
          Have you done any time-hole work?

                         FREDDIE
          I don't think so.
          VAL is distracted by a WELL WISHER who comes over.
          FREDDIE looks around at everyone. All the faces having a
          good time and celebrating...
          He catches the eye of a YOUNG WOMAN. . .then sees her

          HUSBAND...
          The BARTENDER comes over to FREDDIE

                         BARTENDER
          Alright, old man?

                         FREDDIE
          Yeah.

          This one's alright. Chink, chink.

          ANGLE, LATER.
          Master is saying good-night to everyone, passes FREDDIE
          and says quietly:

                         MASTER
          When can we have some of your potion?

                         FREDDIE
          Whenever you'd like. I'll get making it -

                         MASTER
          When I'd like it - I will give you a
          signal. I will scratch my ear and rub my
          nose. What will you need?

                         FREDDIE
          I'll take care of it.
          MASTER makes his way down the table trying to say goodbye
          to everyone, he finally tears away from the party by

                         SAYING:

                         MASTER
          Enough! Enough! I must get back to work!
          Keep going! Dont stop all night long!
          He leaves. FREDDIE just looks around, caught up in it
          all.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. ROOM - LATER.

          Freddie comes down into his little room. A cot has been
          made for him, some fresh clothes and a BOOK
          (hardcover,400pages) on the bed. It reads, very simply:

                         THE CAUSE

          CU. BOOK "THE CAUSE"
          The cover is opened, CAMERA SEES IN CU the opening line
          from the book: "Shall a man be master of his memories? Or
          shall his memories be the master?"

          ANGLE, FREDDIE
          He lays in bed and reads the book. He reads about to
          lines and his eyes slam shit, asleep, still holding the
          book.

          It's the next morning, EVERYONE IS HERE FOR BREAKFAST,
          BUFFET STYLE, FREDDIE mixed in amongst it all.
          FREDDIE sits down to eat with MARY SUE, who feeds her
          baby. The other children around. VAL and NORMAN CONRAD
          are here...

                         MARY SUE
          He's been writing all night ...I think
          you've inspired something in hi,. When
          we're at home, on land, there's too much,

          MARY SUE (CONT'D)
          He was working on a book that showed how
          the Russians used narcosynthesis and
          physical torture and how it worked as it
          did. That was interrupted.
          He had a technology oh psychological
          warfare to present to the Defense
          Department. All that was interrupted,
          lost. Each time he sits to write, a new
          attack is launched against him and he
          spends too much time on defending
          himself. I tell him to ignore it, but
          he's so sensitive...

                         FREDDIE
          Who's attacking him?

                         MARY SUE
          People that are scared. People that are
          greedy. Ex-wives...That's what's so nice
          about being at sea. He gets his studies
          done, advances the learning, and he
          writes BOOK II.

          DUNBAR (late 20s) are on stage. She is lying down, eyes
          close, he is sitting in a chair next to her, students

          children that well and I have my job to

          But that doesn't mean it's not there,
          does it? No. It doesn't. That flimsy
          little piece of tape is just nothin'
          without all the other equipment lined up
          properly, isn't it? We CAN access the
          past, traumas and seeds that abberate us
          in present time and once we access them -
          we challenge them and throw them away.

          these aberrations and painful memories to

          beyond that. The Whole-of-time with which
          we are now working. At last count,
          perhaps sixty-seven trillion years our
          studies show...
          Besides the everyday struggles of how we
          become better, more able, more productive
          homo sapiens, the uses for this new
          science is the location and removal of
          certain leukemias, apathies, manics.
          Depressives, perverts, stuttering,

          it happens every time I come to Manhattan

          and I'll tell you how I found out about,
          because I never knew what in the H was
          happening...
          Well I did some processing to find out.
          Took Mary Sue to ay me down and lead me
          back...we processed over three hours! And
          something came up. It was this:
          I lived a life before and suffered a
          great injury. Knee injury...
          It was just around 1888. A great number
          and year. Significant as the creation .
          year of the new york city sewer system if
          I'm not wrong...
          I was a thief and criminal, working late
          into the night robbing a bank in the
          western side of the island.

          The crime was committed with a revolver
          in hand. A Cole .45. My accomplices and I
          made it clear across town when we were
          ambushed by the local authorities.
          -- but I made a slip away. A digression
          into the under constructed sewer system.
          It was here that I could no be found - or
          so my thinking went. All my confidence
          and all my arrogance was brought upon me.
          Full in the face. For I was nose to nose
          with a twenty-five foot alligator in the
          New York City sewer. Oh brother! What a
          scare I was in for. Now if you've veer
          seen the SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! OF A GATOR -
          you'll remember the fear.
          You see, this being an island, and in
          those days more inhabited by creature
          than man, why wouldn't I meet such a
          beast?
          In my evasion -- I dropped the gold. The
          money I'd stolen in my getaway.. .not
          dropped, but stuffed in a newly cemented
          drain hole just around 125th
          Street... present day Harlem County I
          believe today. Yes. Yes.
          I stuffed it and made a getaway from both
          man and beast âshattered my knee in five
          different places-turned into a piece of
          glass..woke up early in the morning

          Square-which was nothing more than a
          farm..quite a farm..but that's another
          story.
          So what does this say? Injuries stay with
          us don't they??..They sure do. How's it
          gonna go away. How? How? How'm I gonna

          Oh no, this is funny. It's quite the

          Yes. Well. They are very different. No.

          no. Don't associate us with such people!

          modern psychotherapy, does it not?

                         MASTER
          No it does not. This is an exact science,
          you see. Comparable to physics or
          chemistry - but simpler. It's
          engineering. Herr Freud had his chance
          and contributed some very workable data,
          but in the end, he failed. So that's
          that.

          We are not incorporated as a religion,
          no. But remember this: that religion has
          come uniformly from a philosophy.
          Philosophy is senior to religion. You
          could call us a religion of religions.

                         JOHN MORE
          Are you saying then that any religion is
          rather narrow in its outlook?

                         MASTER
          No, no, no. I have no quarrel with man's
          belief's, but religions in general can be
          pre-occupied with a God or Idol or
          something of some such nature who is
          merely trying to fill the universe with a
          lot of little replicas of himself - we
          are trying to free the individual - not
          bend to a will of a God, you see. And if
          our teachings can reconcile these views
          it would be doing a great service to

                         CLARK
          I read the first book. I worked at Boeing
          for three years. When I read the book, I
          didn't want to waste my time there
          anymore. I came to help the Cause.

                         FREDDIE
          What did it say?

                         CLARK
          I'm skeptical of everything. Always have
          been. All I know is I used to not be able
          to sleep. Now I sleep through the night.
          I spent 18 months at the Presidio with
          every Army head-shrinker they had and not
          one did as much for me as Book One did.
          That's simple arithmetic to me. And I met
          Elizabeth, so...

                         FREDDIE
          That's good.

                         CLARK
          He changes things. And the research is
          hard to keep up with. None of this is
          done by a long shot. Sometimes it's easy
          to get lost.

                         FREDDIE
          He's a very smart man. I can tell that. I
          don't understand myself but - more time
          with it and I might - I feel better - I
          feel like I've more to do with my life
          since I met him... and I JUST met him.
          So - that can't be a bad thing, right?

          He listens to her chest and says, "She's

          FREDDIE and VAL are sitting in the front foyer of the
          house, facing each other in two folding chairs...we see

          watches VAL. FREDDIE kicks his chair --

          next - free for a moment - it was free

          you around in a device not unlike a
          grinder and hit you with waves of high
          wattage electrical impulses - quaver
          bolts to damage you. The impulse lodges
          and plants the push-pull instinct, dumped
          in scalding hot water, then freezing cold
          - a control mechanism - any legal action,
          a summons to court, the sight of a police

          I think I won it in a card game. He he
          he.

                         MARY SUE
          You look sick, Freddie. You don't look
          healthy.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't look that way, that's not the way
          I look. (must be a bad habit.)

                         MARY SUE
          You should.
          You can.
          You don't think you can. ?

                         FREDDIE
          It's just not how I look.

                         MARY SUE
          Can't take this-life straight, huh?

          BEAT.

                         MARY SUE
          What do you want? What did you hope would
          happen by coming here today?

                         FREDDIE
          I don't know..
          I had a dream.

                         MASTER
          The pull and the dream. The intersection
          of astral planes. Only a man as strong as
          you can listen to those calls...

          PAUSE.

                         FREDDIE
          Do you need some photographs taken? I
          could do that for you.
          You know. Whatever I do for you, I'm only
          gonna do for a minute. It's only gonna be
          a minute before I go somewhere else
          again... just the way it's built.

                         MASTER
          I know it. But this is not fashion. This
          is something to do for billions of years
          or not at all...

                         MARY SUE
          We don't need any photo's taken, Freddie.
          They all sit and look at each other. MARY SUE gets
          restless. She stands up...
          She leaves. It takes her a minute to walk across the huge
          room. . .PAUSE, THEN:
          MASTER looks at Freddie..MASTER goes into his desk, takes
          out a CONTRACT.

                         MASTER
          We have a new contract. . .it says that you
          will serve the Cause above all other laws
          and regulations in this or any other
          neighboring galaxy for three billion
          years...
          .would you sign it? And join with me?

                         FREDDIE

                         MASTER
          It's not that long in the scheme of
          things, Freddie.. .he he he he he..
          PAUSE. SILENCE between them ...then: MASTER starts to
          sing. . .and walk over to Freddie... serenades him;
