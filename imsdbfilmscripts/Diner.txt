          FENWICK walks along the dimly lit basement. Heavy wiatei
          coats hang from hooks on the wall. In the b.g., there
          is constant traffic of pecple coming and going from the
          rest rooms. From above we hear the MUFFLED SOtJV OF THE

          ROCK AND ROLL BAND.
          Fenwick is in his early 20s and dressed in the "JOE
          COLLEGE." style of the late fifties. Sports jacket, button-
          down shirt, chino pants, and Bass weejuns. We sense
          that he is a little lost in himself, confused. He looks
          out one of the windows that views the parking lot. Then
          without any outward anger, he punches his fist through a
          window pane. Seconds later he breaks another window with
          his fist.

          Fenwick, picking up the music beat from above, struts to
          the sound as he approaches another bank of windows. He
          calmly breaks another window pane with. his fist.
          A GUY coming out of the bathroom in the b.g . sees Fenwick's
          actions and then heads up the steps.

          As the crowd swings the verse back to the Band Leader.
          The Guy who spotted Fenwick breaking windows approaches
          BOOGIE. Boogie is something of a "Dandy," flashiar
          in dress than others in his crowd. Although he isn't
          particularly good looking there is something about his
          attitude that is very appealing to girls. Boogie

          and white.
          The guests sit in fold;.ng chairs eagerly waiting for, the
          wedding procession to begin.
          The MUSIC BEGINS. However, it is not the traditional
          wedding math but rather the Baltimore Colts'Fight Song.
          Even though the organist has softened it, there is still
          _a _"rah-rah" quality to it. The flower girl comes down the---
          aisle throwing white flowers on the blue aisle.
