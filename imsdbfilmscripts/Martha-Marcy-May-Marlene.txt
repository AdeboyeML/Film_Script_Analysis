          EXT. FARM - DAY
                         
          It is a hot summer day. A large run down farm house,
          several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit
          between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated
          valley.
                         
          TWO MEN tack together a broken fence that encloses an
          overgrown paddock.
                         
          THREE WOMEN work in a vegetable garden.

          TWO MEN work in a cluttered garage on an old car.
                         
          FOUR WOMEN sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling
          front porch. One woman breast feeds a new born. The
          others knit a large blanket.
                         
          TWO WOMEN and TWO MEN swim naked in a swimming hole.

          A large room with unfinished wood walls has several
          blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor.
                         
          TWO WOMEN are in the kitchen preparing food.
                         
          MARTHA, sets a table for eight. Martha is beautiful but
          appears run down. She is 24 years old but her weathered
          face makes her look older. A bell rings off screen.

          One man sits at the head of the table, this is PATRICK.
          Patrick is older than the other men. To his right is

          beard.

          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The women are scattered around the kitchen waiting. The
          men finish dinner, pass through the kitchen and walk
          outside.
                         
          The women file into the dining room, clear the men's
          dishes, put more chairs around the table, and bring out a
          new serving of food.

          TWO BABIES sleep next to each other in an old broken
          crib. A teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the
          crib.
                         
          People are strewn all over the house sleeping. Suddenly,
          a figure passes quickly through frame.

          Martha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up
          the driveway. She carries a small bag.
                         
          Her pace becomes increasingly faster. She looks back to
          see a teenage girl, SARAH, standing in the window
          watching.
                         
          Martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the
          woods. As she gets to the edge of the trees she begins
          to run.
                         
          SLOW ZOOM: MARTHA DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK WOODS.
                         
          Off screen, the house DOOR SLAMS SHUT. A MAN urgently
          yells out: "MARCY MAY"
                         
          The camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind.
          For a moment everything is quiet.

          The woods are dark. Martha runs as fast as she can. She
          hears the MAN's voice calling her from a distance. A man
          and two women are chasing her.
                         
          Martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill. She keeps
          running at full speed, then slips, falls, and rolls.
                         
          Martha ducks behind a fallen tree and looks back to see
          the group arrive at the ridge to survey the woods and
          begin their descent.
                         
          Martha holds still, listening as the people chasing her
          pass by.
                         
                         
          EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - DAY
                         
          Martha uses a pay phone at a diner. She dials and waits.
          She is struck by the voice that answers, she transforms
          from being a zombie to being flooded with emotion.

          Martha stops eating. He slides into the booth and sits
          across from her.
                         
          Watts reaches over and takes some french fries. He eats
          them slowly, enjoying every bite. She can't look at him.

          Watts stares at Martha for another moment before reaching
          into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers. He
          sorts through them and separates a $20 bill. He stuffs
          the rest of the papers back into his pocket. He grabs her
          hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           I'll get this.
                         
          He lets go. Her hand goes limp and the money falls on the
          table. She does not look at him. He leans in and forces
          eye contact with her.
                         
          Watts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances
          around the diner. It is very busy. He does not want to
          make a scene in front of all these people.
                         
          He leans down and kisses Martha on the cheek. She doesn't
          kiss back. He holds his forehead to her forehead until
          she reacts. She reluctantly kisses him on the lips.
                         
          Martha watches him walk outside. As soon as his back is
          turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly

           overconsume.

           Not if you don't want to. There are

           I called my dad today to ask for money.

           He asked me to. Sometimes, if there's 
           something we really need I'll call.

           Did he give you the money?

           Yeah. He thinks I'm on drugs.

           No, that's why he gives it to me. I guess 
           he'd rather pay for it than think I'm 
           sucking dick for it.

           I've done drugs. Not a lot but I've tried 
           everything pretty much, except heroin. 
                         
                          ZOE 
           It's good to try everything at least 
           once. You find out who you are that way. 
           What about drinking, do you drink?

           I have, but I don't. 
                         
                          ZOE 
           Good, we don't drink. It just makes you 
           angry and less focused.

           Don't get the wrong idea Sarah. We don't

          green drink which we now see is just water.

          Martha leaves. Holding the glass tightly, Martha walks to
          her bedroom.

          Sarah sits in a chair wearing a WHITE ROBE. The room is

          the next room. She removes Sarah's robe and lays her on
          the ground. Martha shuts the door locking her in.

           You know that death is the most beautiful
           part of life, right? Death is beautiful
           because everyone fears death. And fear is
           the greatest human emotion of all because
           it creates complete awareness. When
           you're scared it forces you to be
           completely aware of your surroundings and
           the moment you're in. It brings you to
           NOW and that makes you truly present. And
           when you are truly present, that's
           nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is
           pure love.

          It is an overcast, unusually cold Labor Day. Lucy works
          in the garden.
                         
                          LUCY

                          LUCY
           It's a bit chilly.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't mind.
                         
                          LUCY
           I think we both said some things last
           night that we didn't mean.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           We scheduled an appointment for you
           tomorrow morning.
                         
          Martha looks into the back of the flower bed and notices
          footprints.
                         
                          MARTHA
           What's it like there?
                         
                          LUCY
           It looks nice.
                         
          Martha turns and walks down to the water.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           We're heading back to the city in about
           an hour. You'll be ready to go?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yep.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAKE HOUSE DOCK - DAY
                         
          Martha stands on the dock. She strips down to her
          underwear and dives in.
           80.
                         
                         
                         
          Martha swims out into the lake. She drops under the water
          and out of sight, a burst of bubbles pop up to the
          surface. A few seconds pass by and she is not coming up.
                         
          Suddenly she breaks back through the water and gasps for
          air.
                         
          She looks around at the thick woods and a handful of nice
          homes that appear to be empty now. No one else is
          swimming.
                         
          Martha sees a scruffy MAN sitting on a neighboring dock,
          he seems familiar. He is in his mid twenties, his jeans
          are rolled up and his feet dangle in the water. His shirt
          is slung over his shoulder and he smokes a cigarette. He
          looks directly at Martha. They make eye contact.
                         
          He finishes his smoke, throws the cigarette in the water,
          puts on his shirt and just sits there.
                         
          Martha swims back to the house.
                         
                         
          INT. TED'S CAR - DAY
                         
          Martha sits in the back seat of Ted and Lucy's car. Ted
          drives and Lucy sits up front. They drive up the driveway
          and turn out onto the road. Ted and Lucy talk. Martha 
          gets a concerned look on her face. Ted slams on the 
          breaks. 
                         
                          TED 
           Jesus Christ. 
                         
                          LUCY
           Are you okay?
                         
                          TED
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           Fucking idiot. What was he doing?
                         
          The MAN from the dock walks past the car. They almost hit
          him. As they drive away, Martha turns to see him get into
          the a brown car, start the engine and drive. The car
          drives behind Ted's car.
                         
          Martha looks forward for a long moment, then turns back
          again to see that he is still there.
           81.
                         
                         
          She is frozen with fear, she thinks about saying
          something but then stops herself. Instead she sits in
          silence.
