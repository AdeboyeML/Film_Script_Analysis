ACE VENTURA
PET DETECTIVE
Written by

EXT. STREET - DAY
A UPS Man with a big pot belly is walking down the street, whistling and carelessly tossing a 
package in the air. We hear the sound of broken glass in the box. He passes a professional woman.
UPS MAN
 Good morning, UPS!
He tosses the box behind his back like a basketball, then acknowledges another passerby.
UPS MAN
 UPS, good to see you!
He takes a couple of steps, then flings the package incredibly high into the air, spins completely 
around and expertly drops to one knee and catches the box. A Hispanic man passes.
UPS MAN
 Buenos dias. Uo Pay eSsay.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
The UPS Man dodges a couple of black kids as though playing basketball. He runs up the front 
steps of the building. He reaches out to open the front door and inadvertently flings the package 
behind him and back down the steps.
He goes back, retrieves the package, then enters the building.
INT. LOBBY - DAY
Several people stand in the elevator. The UPS Man just makes it, but the door closes on the 
package... REPEATEDLY. He feigns embarrassment.
INT. 3RD FLOOR - DAY
ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. The UPS Man throws the package out onto the floor and starts 
kicking it down the hall like a soccer player. With one last big kick the parcel lands in front of 
APARTMENT 3B. He picks it up and knocks on the door.
We hear a small dog barking.
GRUFF MAN (O.S.)
 Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!
An angry, burly man pokes his nose hairs out the chained door.
GRUFF MAN
 What do you want?
UPS MAN
 UPS, sir. And how are you this
afternoon? Alrighty then!
The man grumpily unchains the door. He's a big guy - 6'5", 250, and 50 of that is chest hair. A 
small Shiatsu stands beside him.
UPS MAN
 I have a package for you.
The UPS guy thrusts the package toward the man. We can clearly hear broken glass inside. The 
man takes the package.
GRUFF MAN
 It sounds broken.
UPS MAN
 Most likely sir! I bet it was
something nice though! Now... I
haver an insurance form. If you'll
just sign here, here, and here,
and initial here, and print your name
here, we'll get the rest of the
forms out to you as soon as we
can.
The man begrudgingly begins to fill out the form. The dog wags his tail and whines. We can see 
that he likes the UPS guy.
UPS MAN
 That's a lovely dog you have. Do
you mind if I pet him, sir?
GRUFF MAN
(mumbles)
 I don't give a rat's ass.
The UPS Man bends down and talks to the dog in a really sucky pet talk.
UPS MAN
 Oo ja boo ba da boo boo do booo!
GRUFF MAN
(under breath)
 Brother.
Before the Gruff Man can finish, the UPS Man stands back up and takes the form again.
UPS MAN
 That's fine sir. I can fill out
the rest. You just have yourself
a good day. Take care, now! 'Bye
'bye, then!
THRASH MUSIC STARTS
INT. HALLWAY -- CONT'D
The UPS Man moves swiftly down the hall and into the stair well.
INT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D
The Gruff Man shakes the box, tosses it down and sits in front of the TV.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONT'D
The UPS Man bursts from the front door and hustles down the street very quickly. He passes 
several people.
UPS MAN
(quickly)
 UPS, S'cuse me. UPS, comin'
through.
INT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D
We see the back of the Shiatsu staring at the crack in the front door. He has not moved an inch. 
The Gruff Man looks over.
GRUFF MAN
 Hey, stupid! Get away from the
door!
The dog doesn't budge and this really pisses him off. He gets up and heads for the dog.
GRUFF MAN
 What's the matter with you, I said
GIT!!!
He roughly picks the dog up by the scruff of the neck, but as he turns it around we see that it is a 
stuffed dog. Around it's neck is a business card that reads, "You have been had by Ace Ventura - 
Pet Detective." He breathes fire.
GRUFF MAN
 Son of a bitch!
He smashes the dog to the ground.
EXT. ALLEY - CONT'D
As the UPS Man/Ace rounds the corner, his shirt opens up at his pot belly and the Shiatsu's head 
sticks out. Ace is gloating.
ACE
(announcer's voice)
 That was a close one, ladies and
gentlemen. Unfortunately, in
every contest, there must be...
A LOOSER!
He jumps into an old beat-up Chevy Bel Air, and lets the dog out onto the passenger seat.
ACE (CONT'D)
 LOOOHOOOSERRRHERRR!
He then pulls open the car's ashtray, and to the dog's delight, it's filled with puppy chow.
He tries to start the engine but it won't turn over. The dog shoots him a look.
ACE
(to dog)
 No problem, it gets flooded.
We'll just wait a few seconds.
Ace sits back. SMASH!!!
From Ace's POV we see a Baseball bat shatter the front windshield.
ACE
 Or, we could try it now.
Ace frantically tries to start the car. His new friend continues around the car beating the living shit 
out of it.
ACE
 Oooh, boy.
ACE'S POV
We see the creep wailing on the car in Ace's side view mirror.
ACE
 Warning! Assholes are closer than
they appear!
The dog is barking insanely.
ACE
(to dog)
 You think you can do better?!
The baseball bat is now pummeling the trunk.
ACE
 Wanna give me a push while you're
back there?
BOOM! The back window shatters. Then the car's engine roars to life. Ace rejoices.
ACE
 FARFEGNUGENNNNN!!!
Ace leaves the bad guy in a cloud of dust and gravel, screaming bloody murder.
EXT. MIAMI CITY STREETS - DAY
Ace and his new pal speed away freely.
Close on the happy dog, hanging his head out the car window. PAN across the broken windshield 
to Ace, also hanging his head out the window to see where he's going.
The car drives by a sign on a telephone pole: "Reward" -- with a picture of the Shiatsu in Ace's 
seat.
THRASH MUSIC ENDS
INT. HOUSE - DAY
A very sexy woman is hugging and kissing the Shiatsu.
WOMAN
 My little baby. You missed mommy
didn't you? Did daddy hurt you?
I won't let him, no I won't. He
may have kept the big screen TV,
but he's not gonna keep my baby.
No he isn't.
(very sexy to Ace)
 Thank you, Mr. Ventura. How can I
ever repay you?
She slinks over to Ace and puts her arms around his neck.
ACE
 Well, the reward would be good,
and there was some damage to my 
She cuts Ace off with a devastating kiss.
WOMAN
 Would you like me to take you
pants off instead?
ACE
 Ummmm Sure.
She pulls him toward the bedroom.
WOMAN
 It takes a big man to stand up to
my husband. He's already put two
of my lovers in the hospital.
ACE
 How did he find out? Does he have
you followed.
WOMAN
 No I tell him
She plants a kiss on Ace's neck and pulls him down out of frame onto the bed.
EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - DAY
The stands are empty, but there's plenty happening on the field. The Miami Dolphins are 
practicing. Dan Marino is in top form, hitting pass after pass.
Behind one of the goal posts, the team's mascot, a rare dolphin (SNOWFLAKE), wearing #4, is 
practicing his routine. The Trainer is dressed like a quarterback.
TRAINER
Blue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut!
Snowflake swims over, snatches a small football out of the Trainer's hand, and does an end zone 
dance on his tail. He then returns the ball to the trainer.
The Trainer now sets the ball on the dolphin's tail and snowflake "kicks" a perfect field goal. The 
Trainer blows a whistle and raises both arms.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - NIGHT
The stadium is now completely empty. Snowflake peacefully swims around his tank.
Suddenly, the water is illuminated by the headlights of an n.d. panel truck.
The rear door slides open. Two men jump out in wet suits.
They slip into the water while a third waits outside the tank.
Snowflake surfaces to check out the action. One of the men holds out a fish. Snowflake eagerly 
takes it, then shudders as a large syringe is stuck into his back. Snowflake thrashes around.
Quick cut of a hand with the blur of a ring slamming against the tank. But the needle has done its 
job. Snowflake quickly goes limp.
Snowflake is loaded into the back of the truck. Move in on Snowflake's face. His excited cackle 
has turned into a painful whimper.
The truck skids away passing the guard gate. The guard is hog tied and gagged, struggling to free 
himself.
INT. ADELLE'S FRIENDLY PET SHOP - NEXT DAY
Close up on a dead goldfish laying on a newspaper. We pull back to reveal ADELLE 
ROSENBERG, the seventy year old owner of a cluttered pet shop. She's handing a live goldfish in 
a bag to JENNIFER,  a very sweet nine year old.
ADELLE
 Here you go, honey. Now
remember this kind of fish
doesn't like it in the freezer.
JENNY
 But what's gonna happen to Dolly?
ADELLE
 Don't worry, I'll make sure she
gets a proper burial.
Jennifer exits. Adelle calls to her cat, and tosses it the goldfish. The cat catches it in mid-air.
ADELLE
 Rest in peace.
Ace enters the pet shop. It looks like he slept in his clothes.
ADELLE
 Well here comes another dead
fish.
ACE
 Hi, beautiful. What time do you
get off?
ADELLE
 Uh oh.
ACE
(suggestively)
 I've heard some pretty great
things about your kibble.
ADELLE
 Well, I hope I'm not getting a
reputation.
ACE
(switching to mock anger)
 Just get me the food!
She chuckles at Ace as she loads a couple of bags with different kinds of pet food.
ADELLE
 So ahh, when can I expect you
to pay your tab?
ACE
 I'm a little bit Sli  Pickins,
right now, I'm a little Tight
Squeeze Louise, a little Welfare
Wolly, Potless Pissing Pete, I'm
ah 
ADELLE
 If you were a horse I'd shoot ya'.
Just take it.
ACE
 Gravy! I'm good for it, Adelle.
I'm on a very big case right now.
Ace reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a flyer with a picture of a white pigeon.
ACE
 See this pigeon? It's a true
albino. Some rich guy lost it.
He's offering a ten thousand
dollar reward.
ADELLE
 Wow, albino pigeons are very
rare. How are you going to find
him?
ACE
 Just keep my eyes open, and hope
to god it doesn't snow.
Ace grabs his bags and heads for the door.
ADELLE
 You're a good boy, Ace. A good
boy.
He holds the door open for an elderly gentleman who is entering at the same time. The gentleman 
is walking a toy poodle on a leash. The poodle is dragging its butt along the entire length of the 
floor. Ace and Adelle just stare.
ELDERLY MAN
(in a loud voice)
 Do you have anything for ringworm?
EXT. SURFSIDE APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY
Ace enters the courtyard of a two story U-shaped apartment complex carrying his groceries. It's a 
crappy joint but he calls it home. Inside an open apartment on the ground floor, the landlord, MR. 
SHICKADANCE, sits watching TV, stuffing his face with cheese doodles. Ace sneaks past the 
door and up the stairs.
EXT. SECOND FLOOR - DAY
Ace is just putting the key in the door when the landlord steps up behind him. Ace is startled by 
the dreaded 'Shickadance Rasp' (not unlike Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST).
LANDLORD
 Venturaaaaa?
Ace straightens up, but doesn't turn around.
ACE
 Yes, Satan?
Now Ace turns around in mock surprise.
ACE
 Oh, I'm sorry, sir. You sounded
like someone else.
LANDLORD
 Never mind the wise cracks
Venturaaa. You owe me rent!
ACE
 Mr. Shickadance I told you,
you're my first priority! As soon
as I find the white pigeon,
you're paid!!
LANDLORD
 I heard animals in there Ventura!
I heard 'em again this morning,
scratchin' around.
ACE
 I never bring my work home with
me, sir.
The landlord notices the bags of kibble.
LANDLORD
 Oh, yeah? What's all this pet
food for?
ACE
(beat)
 Fiber.
The landlord isn't buying it.
ACE
 You wanna take a look for
yourself? Go head.
Ace rattles his keys in the door. Then he swings it open and turns on the light. The house is clear. 
Ace walks in as the landlord stands there snooping and sniffing the air.
ACE
 Well are you satisfied?
LANDLORD
(still suspicious)
 Yeah, but don't ever let me catch
you with an animal in there,
that's all!
ACE
 Okay then. Take care now. 'Bye
'bye.
The landlord walks away as Ace closes the door.
ACE
(quietly to himself)
 LLOOSER.
He then turns to the room and gives a distinct whistle.
CHAOS ENSUES! Animals jump out from every direction. Lizards crawl out of drawers, birds fly 
through the air, all of them gravitating to Ace.
ACE
(to his flock)
 Ooshhooboobooboodoodoo!
INT. MIAMI DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - LATER THAT DAY
The very imposing office of BOBBY RIDDLE, owner of the Miami Dolphins. Riddle, 70, is a 
take charge, doesn't take crap from anyone type of guy. He is yelling at ROGER PODACTER, 
an ex-linebacker in his early sixties, and MELISSA ROBINSON, Podacter's attractive assistant.
RIDDLE
 I just want to know one thing; How
the hell do you lose a 500 pound
fish?!
Melissa's about to speak but hesitates.
RIDDLE (CONT.)
 What?
MELISSA
 It's not a fish, sir. It's a
mammal.
An angry Riddle stands up.
RIDDLE
 Oh, thank you very much, Mrs.
Jacque Cousteau!
PODACTER
 Bob, she didn't mean anything by
it.
RIDDLE calms down a little, and sits.
RIDDLE
(calmer)
 Listen, personally, I don't give a
good god damn about a fish.
He looks at Melissa. She doesn't dare say anything.
RIDDLE (CONT.)
 All I care about is winning this
Super Bowl! I want the players'
head in the right place. Shit,
Roger, you've been in this game
long enough, you know how
superstitious players are. Our
quarterback's been putting his
socks on backwards since high
school. And I got a lineman who
hasn't washed his jock in two
years because he thinks flies are
lucky! I want that god damn fish
on the field Super Bowl Sunday!
FIND THE FISH, OR FIND NEW JOBS!
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
An upset Podacter and Melissa walk through the hallway.
PODACTER
 Why did it have to happen now? I
got three stinking years left till
retirement.
MELISSA
 I've got forty.
PODACTER
 I'll tell you who did it. It was
those goddamn animal rights nuts!
Always out there with their
goddamn signs, ANIMALS WERE BORN
FREE, STOP TORTURING SNOWFLAKE!
That goddamn fish lives better than
they do!
They stop outside Melissa's office by her secretary's desk.
MELISSA
 The police are checking into the
animal rights people.
(to secretary)
 Martha, have the police called
back about the dolphin yet?
MARTHA
 No, but I wanted to tell you, when
I lost my Cuddles, I hired a pet
detective.
PODACTER
 A what?
MARTHA
 A pet detective.
MELISSA
 Thanks Martha, but we'd better
leave this to professionals.
MARTHA
 Well actually, he was quite good.
Pet detection is a very involved,
highly scientific process.
CUT TO:
EXT. ROOF OF HOUSE - SAME TIME
CLOSE ON ACE - COOING like a pigeon. Widen to reveal, Ace precariously perched on the 
roof of a two story building. He is four feet away from "The" pigeon. Ater a beat, he makes a 
mad, spastic, yet scientific, lunge for the bird.
ACE
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
The bird makes a clean getaway. Unable to stop his momentum, Ace flies past the edge of the 
building and slides down the side of the roof.
EXT. GROUND - CONTINUOUS ACTION
BAM!!! Ace crashes to the ground. As he lies face down, in a heap of trash, his beeper goes off.
EXT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS/BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY
Parking lot. Ace's clunker drives by some real nice cars. Employees stare at him.
INT. SECURITY CHECK POINT - DAY
A stern guard is admitting people into the stadium. He scans each one with a security detection 
wand.
MAN #1
 Art Wheeler. Sporting supplies.
The guard scans him. He goes.
MAN #2
 Tom Anderson. Concessions.
The guard scans him. He goes.
ACE
 Ace Ventura. Pet detective.
The guard stares at Ace, accusingly.
INT. MELISSA'S OFFICE - DAY
Martha enters.
MARTHA
 Ah Mr. Ventura to see you.
MELISSA
 Okay, send him in.
Martha exits, Ace enters.
MELISSA (CONT'D)
 Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson. Did you
have any trouble getting in?
ACE
 No, the guy with the rubber glove
was surprisingly gentle.
MELISSA
(apologetically)
 Super Bowl week. Security's
tight. Mr. Ventura, I'll get
right to the point
She slips a tape in the VCR and gestures for Ace to sit.
MELISSA
 Our mascot was stolen from his
tank last night. Are you familiar
with Snowflake?
The tape shows Snowflake doing a trick. The trainer, dressed like a quarterback, shouts out 
signals.
TRAINER (ON TAPE)
Blue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut!
Snowflake swims over, snatches the small football out of the trainer's hand, swims the length of 
the pool, does an end zone dance on his tail, then returns the ball to the trainer.
MELISSA (O.S.)
 We got Snowflake from the Miami
Seaquarium. He's a rare Bottle
Nose Dolphin. That's the new
trick he was going to do during
the half-time show.
While Ace studies the tape, he chews sunflower seeds in a bird-like fashion, placing the shells in a 
neat little pile on her desk.
MELISSA
 Would you like an ashtray?
ACE
 No, I don't smoke.
He adds more shells to the pile.
Melissa is already wondering if she has made a mistake.
MELISSA
 To be honest, Mr. Ventura.
I'm pretty skeptical. Before
today, I didn't even know there
was such a thing as a pet
detective.
ACE
 Well, now that you do, you'll know
who to call if your Schnauser ever
runs away.
MELISSA
 How did you know I have a
Schnauser?
Ace pulls a, invisible-to-the-naked-eye dog hair off here blouse and presents it to her.
ACE
 He's young, about five pounds,
black coat, white speckles
(sniffs the hair)
 likes to chase cars.
MELISSA
 Very impressive.
ACE
 You should see what I can do with
a good stool sample.
MELISSA
 I can hardly wait. Look, we've
got a problem. Can you help me or
not?
ACE
(coy)
 Well, sea faring creatures aren't
really my expertise
MELISSA
 We'll give you three thousand
dollars on delivery.
Ace immediately becomes the narrator of a nature show.
ACE
 The dolphin is a social creature.
Capable of complex communication.
Traveling in large groups or
schools
EXT. PLAYING FIELD - A SHORT TIME LATER
The Dolphin players practice. A crowd of reporters interview Marino.
MARINO
 We just choked in 82. We had a
chance to win it and we didn't.
Nobody's gonna choke this time,
and if they do, I'll kill 'em.
Ace and Melissa head for Snowflake's tank.
MELISSA
 The police were here this morning.
Apparently, the kidnappers used
the back gate.
Ace bends down to look at some tire tracks on the field.
MELISSA (CONT'D)
 They said some kind of a 
ACE
 Four wheel drive van loaded from
the rear.
Ace sniffs the turf. Podacter enters nervously.
MELISSA
 Oh, hi, Roger. How are you holding
up?
PODACTER
 Well if it looks like I'm walking
funny it's because I have a bunch
on reporters up my ass. They've
been asking me about Snowflake all
day. Who's this?
MELISSA
 Roger Podacter, meet Ace Ventura.
Ace is our pet detective.
Podacter shakes his hand.
PODACTER
 Nice to meet you. Martha Metz
recommended you very highly.
ACE
 Martha Metz? Martha Metz. Oh
yeah, the bitch.
PODACTER
 What?
ACE
 Pekinese. Hyperactive. Lost in
Highland Park area. She was half
dead when I found her. Is that
the tank?
They both follow Ace as he makes a B-line.
EXT. SNOWFLAKE'S TANK - MOMENTS LATER
The tank is empty.
ACE
 Cops drain it?
MELISSA
 Yes. This morning.
Ace hops on the ladder.
ACE
 If I'm not back in five
minutes call Lloyd Bridges.
INT. DOLPHIN TANK - MOMENTS LATER
While eating sunflower seeds, Ace meticulously examines the tank, including the scratches where 
the hand banged up against the wall when Snowflake was stolen. All the while, he is singing a 
bastardized version of the theme from, "Flipper."
ACE
 Wonderful Flipper glorious
Flipper magnificent
Flipper The flippiest Flipper
Podacter and Melissa, watching from the rim, look at each other like, "What have we gotten 
ourselves into?" Podacter spots something.
PODACTER
 Oh, great.
A hoard or reporters are headed their way.
PODACTER (CONT)
 I'll try to head them off.
MELISSA
(to Ace)
 Get out of the tank.
ACE
(still singing)
 Can't hear you Flipper,
Flipper Lookin' for Flipper,
gotta find Flipper
MELISSA
 I said, get out of the tank! Now!
The reporters draw closer. Podacter heads them off.
REPORTER
 So where's Snowflake?
PODACTER
 Ah Snowflake is just, ah, not
available right now.
REPORTER
 Come on, I'm supposed to get a
shot of his new trick for the
evening news.
REPORTER #2
 What? Is he sick?
Other reporters chime in.
VARIOUS REPORTERS
Did something happen to
Snowflake?! What're you
hiding..?!
Melissa and Podacter don't know what to say. Then, a strange voice is heard.
ACE/HEINZ (O.S.)
(unrecognizable accent)
 How cun I be getting dis vork dun
mit all da shouting? What for is
dis shouting?
REPORTER
 Who the hell is that?
MELISSA
 That? That's
ACE/HEINZ
 Heinz Kissvelvet. I am Trainer of
Dolphins. You vant to talk to ze
dolphin, you talk to me!
REPORTER
 What happened to the regular
trainer?
ACE/HEINZ
 Vy do you care about the dolphin?
Do you know him? Does he call you
at home? Do you have a dorsal
fin?
(beat)
 To train ze dolphin, you must zink
like ze dolphin. You must be
getting oonside ze dolphin's head!
Just yesterday I'm asking
Snowflake "ee, eee, eee." He
said, "Eee, eee, eee, eee." Und
you can quote him.
Ace spits at the reporters' feet. Podacter jumps in.
PODACTER
 Gentlemen, please, Coach Shula's
press conference is just about to
begin. Why don't I take you over
there and let, ah, Heinz, do his
job.
He ushers the press away.
MELISSA
(sotto to Ace)
 Are you finished, Heinz?
ACE
 Not yet.
Ace goes to the filter outside the tank, opens it, and pours out its contents  mainly leaves, small 
twigs and gunk. He roots through it, notices a very tiny amber stone. He smiles to himself.
ACE
 Now I'm finished.
EXT. METRO POLICE DEPARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY
A flurry of activity in the detective division. As Ace enters, several cops taunt him on sight, led by 
the obnoxious, SERGEANT AGUADO.
AGUADO
 Hey, Ventura! Make any good
collars lately?
ANOTHER COP
Or were they leashes?
They all bust up. Aguado spots a bug on the ground.
AGUADO
 Uh oh.
(steps on the bug)
 Homicide, Ventura!
The cops are falling all over themselves laughing.
AGUADO
 How you gonna solve this one?!
Ace walks up to them and looks at the squashed bug.
ACE
 Good question, Aguado first I'd
establish a motive. In this case
the killer saw the size of the
bug's dick, and became insanely
jealous.
The other cops all react with a big "ooooooo". Aguado has no comeback. Ace comes face to face 
with him.
ACE
 Then I'd lose thirty pounds
porking his wife.
Aguado suddenly loses it and swings at Ace.
With a lightening move, Ace sidesteps the punch and forces Aguado's face down next to the dead 
bug.
ACE
 Now kiss and make up.
Ace walks off.
ACE
(to himself)
 LLLOOOSER!
Ace walks to the desk of EMILIO ECHAVEZ, a young energetic member of the homicide 
division. Ace has a silly impish look on his face.
ACE
(playfully)
 I miss you.
EMILIO
 It's not a good time, Ace. If
Einhorn sees me talking to you I'm
gonna be history.
ACE
 Okay. Just tell me what you got
on Snowflake. That's all I need.
EMILIO
 I can't say anything. My hands
are tied.
ACE
(effeminate)
Sounds like my kind of a party.
A cop comes to Emilio's desk.
COP
Look alive, Einhorn's on her way
down.
EMILIO
 Ace, please?!
ACE
 Just tell me who's working the
case?
EMILIO
 Aguado.
ACE
 Aguado?! He's pimple juice! He's
the poster child for lead paint
chip eaters!
EMILIO
 Look, Ace. We're a little busy
with murderers and drug dealers.
A missing dolphin isn't exactly a
high priority.
The elevator is getting closer.
EMILIO
 Ace, gimme a break will ya?
Ace nonchalantly sits back in a chair, pops a sunflower seed into his mouth and cracks it loudly.
EMILIO
(quickly)
 Okay, okay. We checked all the
local animal rights groups,
taxidermists, and we're running a
check through DMV on all recent
van rentals. So far, nada.
ACE
 Any unusual bets being made?
EMILIO
 Ace, it's the Super Bowl, of
course there's bets being made.
ACE
 What'd you find out about the
tank?
EMILIO
 Nothing weird. Just the tire
tracks and the exit route. The
guard didn't see anything.
ACE
 That's it?
EMILIO
 That's it. I swear. Now please
go away!
ACE
 You know something?
(again impish)
 YOU'RE NICE!
Ace gets up and exits the room. Then just as Emilio sighs with relief, Ace pops back in.
ACE
 What about crazy Philly fans?
The elevator bell rings. Out steps police LT. LOIS EINHORN, mid 30s, with a slender build, a 
great pair of legs and a bad tude.
ACE
 Holy Testicle Tuesday!
EINHORN
(to Emilio)
 What the hell is he doing here?
ACE
 I came to confess. I was the
second gunman on the grassy knoll.
EINHORN
 Spare me the routine, Ventura. I
know you're working the Snowflake
case. May I suggest you yield to
the experts on this one? We'll
find the porpoise.
ACE
(mock relief)
 Whewww now I feel better!
Ace turns to go.
ACE (CONT)
 Of course, that might not do any
good. You see, nobody's missing a
porpoise. It's a dolphin that's
been taken. The common Harbor
Porpoise has an abrupt snout,
pointed teeth, and a triangular
thorasic fin, while the Bottlenose
Dolphin, or Tursiops Truncatus,
has an elongated beak, round,
cone-shaped teeth, and a
distinctive serrated dorsal
appendage. (beat) But I'm sure
you already knew that. (beat)
That's what turns me on about you.
Hey maybe I'll give you a call
sometime, lieutenant. Your number
still 911? Alrighty then!
Ace exits.
CUT TO:
INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT
A wild thrasher club. An incredible thrash band is on stage cranking. Kids jump wildly into the 
moshing pit.
Ace enters, sees a burnout at the bar whose head is circling insanely to the music.
ACE
(shouting)
 Excuse me?! Is Greg here?!
The burnout's head thrashes on. No acknowledgement of Ace.
ACE
 Thank you!
Ace heads for the basement stairs.
INT. BASEMENT STAIRS - NIGHT
Ace descends the stairs, stopping at a large steel door. Ace bangs on it three times. A voice is 
heard from inside.
VOICE (O.S.)
 Password!
ACE
 Tom Vu! I pay for sex! You can
too!
CLICK! The door electronically unlatches and slides open.
INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
Ace enters. Green Peace "Save the Whales" posters abound. GREG/WOODSTOCK, a laid 
back, ex-hippy with long gray hair, sits at a very impressive computer set up. Ace and he have 
their own distinct banter.
A thud from above. Ace looks up.
ACE'S POV
Part of the ceiling is made of metal grating, so you can see the bottom of the dance floor. A guy's 
face gets smashed into the grate. We see that it is the burnout from the club.
ACE
(to burnout)
 Found him!
WOODSTOCK
 Hey! St. Francis! How's it goin?
ACE
 Super, and thank you for asking.
Hope you're having a nice day.
WOODSTOCK
 Do you?
ACE
 Don't I? And what are you up to?
WOODSTOCK
 Just watching the fishies, man.
There is a BLIP on the computer screen.
WOODSTOCK
 Alright, you're just in time for
the party. You see those blips?
ACE
 I certainly do.
ON THE SCREEN
A map with several ships on the ocean.
He quickly taps in some commands and the ships start sailing in all different directions.
WOODSTOCK
 That's a Norwegian whaling fleet.
I'm sending them new directional
coordinates They'll find Jimmy
Hoffa before they find any
Humpbacks.
ACE
 Gravy.
Woodstock moves to a different screen.
WOODSTOCK
 Check this out.
More computer graphics come up on the screen.
WOODSTOCK
 Just changed the formula for
Purina's puppy chow.
(turns to Ace)
 Too much filler, don't ya' think?
ACE
(acting turned on)
 I'm very attracted to you right
now.
Woodstock chuckles.
WOODSTOCK
 Are you?
ACE
 Aren't I? Can you still tap into
all the aquatic supply store in
the area?
WOODSTOCK
 Of course I can. Why?
ACE
 I want to trace the sale of any
equipment for transporting or
housing a dolphin within the past
few months
WOODSTOCK
 C'mon, Ace. I thought you might
have a challenge for me
Woodstock starts hacking away.
ACE
 Okay then, try to remember the
sixties.
WOODSTOCK
 Wow! God one! Let's see
Marine winch sling, feeder fish,
20,000 gallon tank
He waits. We hear a beep.
WOODSTOCK
 That's it. I found the culprit.
ACE
 Who is it?
WOODSTOCK
(dramatically)
 Sea World.
ACE
 bastard.
WOODSTOCK
 Hang on, hang on
(He taps a couple keys)
 Well, what do we have here?
That's a lot of equipment for a
civilian.
The printer spits out some data. Woodstock rips off the page and hands it to Ace.
ACE
 Ronald Camp? The billionaire?
WOODSTOCK
 Billionaire and rare fish
collector.
ACE
 RRREHEHEALLY!
A PICTURE OF CAMP
Comes up on the computer screen.
WOODSTOCK
 That, my friend, is the face of
the enemy.
He pages through his file on screen.
WOODSTOCK
 Always tryin' to get his hands
on endangered species
Newspaper articles fill the screen. One shows a picture of Camp and some Dolphin players.
ACE
 Hold on, this guy's connected with
the Dolphins?
Ace leans in.
WOODSTOCK
 Camp donated the land the new
stadium's built on.
(re: article)
 Oh, look at this, he's throwin'
another, "I'm the richest man in
the universe" party.
ACE
(thinking)
 Hmmm I wonder if I can find
myself a date.
INT. CAMP'S MANSION - NIGHT
It's a magnificent home. There is an extremely formal party in progress. Twenty to thirty people 
having champagne, caviar, and hot air. We see Dan Marino sitting with an audience around him.
DAN
 We just choked in 82. We had a
chance to win and we didn't. But
nobody's gonna choke this time; if
they do, I'll kill 'em!
Everybody laughs.
EXT. CAMP'S MANSION - NIGHT
Ace and Melissa climb an impressive stairway leading to Camp's mansion.
MELISSA
 I'm really going out on a limb
here, Ventura. Camp's social
events are strictly A-list.
ACE
(a la Love Connection)
 'Well, Chuck the date started
off good, but just before we got
to the party, she seemed to tense
up.'
Melissa rolls her eyes, then taps a huge door knocker.
MELISSA
 I swear, if you do anything to
embarrass me in front of Camp
ACE
 You mean like this?
Ace starts doing a spastic body convulsion. Just then a bald-headed butler, who looks a little like 
Gavin McCloud, opens the door. Ace doesn't notice until Melissa hits him with her purse.
ACE
 Owwwe!!!
He sees the butler.
ACE
 Oh, hi Captain Stubing.
Melissa storms in, already pissed.
INT. CAMP'S MANSION - CONT
Ace and Melissa enter. Camp looks over.
CAMP
 Melissa! Glad you could make it!
Oh, and who is this?
MELISSA
 This is my date. He's a
lawyer.
CAMP
 Well, does he have a name, or
should I call him "Lawyer"?
MELISSA
 I'm sorry, it's Ace - ah, Tom Ace.
Ace is very unimpressed with her lying ability. He jumps in.
ACE
 Tom Ace. Wonderful to meet you,
Mr. Camp, and congratualtions on
all your success. You smell
terrific.
CAMP
 Ah, well, thank you. Please, come
in.
Ace boldly leads the way over to an hors 'oeuvre table. Melissa closely follows.
MELISSA
(sotto)
 This is insane. There's no way
that Camp stole Snowflake.
ACE
(spreading pate' on a cracker)
 Will you just keep him occupied,
while I work my magic please.
She crosses the room. He puts the cracker in his mouth and begins to crunch. A man in a tux 
beside Ace spreads pate' on his own cracker.
ACE
(with a mouthful, to man)
 Smooshy, isn't it?
Off the stuffy man's reaction
INT. CAMP'S MANSION - SECONDS LATER
Ace approaches Camp.
ACE
 Excuse me, Ron, I need to use the
bathroom?
(palms his stomach, whispering loudly)
 I think it's the pate'.
CAMP
 Um, it's just over there.
ACE
 Thanks. Stuff probably looks
better on the way out, huh?
Ace laughs, slaps Camp hard on the back and heads for the bathroom.
INT. BATHROOM - CONT
Ace wastes no time. He locks the door, turns on the water faucet, steps onto the toilet seat, opens 
and climbs out a window.
EXT. MANSION COURT YARD - CONT
Ace drops to the ground. He follows a pathway, through a gazebo and into a doorway, all the time 
quietly singing the musical score to 'Mission Impossible'.
INT. CAMP'S MANSION - FISH TANKS - CONT
Ace browses through a myriad of dramatically lit, salt water tanks, still singing. They're all filled 
with colorful exotic fish. Very impressive, but nothing large enough to house a dolphin. He 
continues on towards a large door.
INT. TANK ROOM - SECONDS LATER
A huge above-ground tank is covered with curtains to discourage onlookers. Ace swings open the 
large door and enters.
ACE
 Gravy.
Ace climbs a ladder on the side of the tank, singing more intensely now. The ladder leads to a 
narrow catwalk over the center of the water. Ace grabs a feeder fish from a pail and walks 
carefully out there.
CLOSE ON ACE. THIS IS IT.
He looks into the dark pool, but sees nothing. Now he stops singing, quietly squats down and 
dangles the fish over the water.
ACE
(gently)
 Snowflake Here, Snowflake
Snooowflaaaake
A GREAT WHITE LUNGES OUT OF THE WATER AND SNAPS ITS JAWS AN INCH 
FROM ACE'S FACE!!! NEEDLESS TO SAY, ACE IS A TAD SURPRISED.
He reels back, falling off the catwalk, into the water.
INT. CAMP'S MANSION - SAME TIME
Melissa is admiring some beautiful tropical fish. Camp approaches.
CAMP
 Wonderful, aren't they?
MELISSA
(nervously)
 Yes. They're incredible.
CAMP
 No matter what is going on in my
life, I can always watch them
swim and be completely at peace.
INT. INDOOR POOL ROOM - SAME TIME
The water is still for a moment. Then, Ace breaks the surface.
ACE
(frantic, to himself)
 It's not Snowflake It's not
Snowflake.
Instantly, Ace's body is thrashed around back and forth through the water, the entire length of the 
pool.
ACE
(screaming)
 IT'S NOT SNOWFLAAAAKE!!! IT'S NOT
SNOWFLAAAA!!!
INT. CAMP'S MANSION - LATER
A line is forming outside the bathroom. Camp and Melissa are seated nearby. He's getting curious.
CAMP
 Are you sure he's okay? It's been
an awfu;;y long time.
MELISSA
 Who, Tom? Oh, I'm sure he's fine.
Ace suddenly opens the bathroom door and stands there, completely drenched from head to toe, 
with his pants in shreds. Everyone stops. They all stare at Ace in amazement.
ACE
(loudly to the entire room)
 DO NOT GO IN THERE!
(fanning the air)
 Whewww!!
EXT. CAMP'S MANSION - LATER
Ace and Melissa are exiting. Camp stops in the doorway.
CAMP
(still confused)
 I'm very sorry, Mr. Ace. I'll
have the pluming checked
immediately.
ACE
 Be sure that you do. If I had
been drinking out of that toilet,
I might have been killed!
Ace shakes Camp's hand and notices his ring. He holds on to get a better look. It's a very distinct, 
commemorative ring.
Camp wants his hand back but Ace won't let go. Melissa finally drags Ace away.
MELISSA
 We'd better go.
Camp looks on and shakes his head.
INT. MELISSA'S CAR - NIGHT
Ace is thinking. Melissa is pissed.
MELISSA
 Y'know, I don't even want to
know why your pants are missing!
I don't care what happened! You
could have cost me my job.
ACE
(on his own wavelength)
 I was wrong about Camp. He's
breaking the law but he's not our
guy.
MELISSA
 It's a sure thing! It's
definitely him! Just get me in
there! Let me work my magic!
Ace takes the stone out of his pocket and studies it intensely.
ACE
 This is the key. Right here!
MELISSA
 Hiring you was the biggest mistake
I ever made!
ACE
 So small! So unnoticeable! Yet
an invaluable piece of our
twisted little jigsaw puzzle!
Melissa stares at Ace like he's gone crazy. There is a flash of headlights and a car horn. Melissa 
swerves back into her own lane. Ace drops the stone somewhere on the seat and begins to search 
for it frantically.
ACE
 Damn it!
(to Melissa)
 Try to keep it on the road.
INT. MELISSA'S LIVING ROOM
Melissa enters, followed by Ace.
MELISSA
 So, you found a pebble in
Snowflake's tank. Excuse me while
I call CNN.
ACE
 I found it in the filter. And
it's not a pebble. It is a rare,
triangular cut, orange amber.
Ace hands Melissa the stone and quickly goes to one of her bookcases.
MELISSA
 What are you talking about?
ACE
 Tonight I saw the exact same stone
in Camp's ring.
Ace finds a book on the Dolphin team and flips through it.
MELISSA
 I thought you said he didn't do
it.
ACE
 N. Camp's clean. His ring
wasn't missing a stone. But
whoever was in that tank had a
ring just like his.
MELISSA
 Wait a second. What ring?
Ace hands her the book. It's open to a photo of
ACE
 The 1982 Dolphin AFC Championship
ring.
Melissa holds the stone up to the picture. It's a perfect match.
ACE
 I find the ring with the missing
stone, I find Snowflake.
MELISSA
 How are you gonna do that?
ACE
 Simple.
MUSIC UP
CUT TO:
EXT. TRACK - DAY
Ace is wheezing and gasping for air as he struggles to jog up beside a large man who's running 
around the track at a very fast pace. When he finally catches up, he awkwardly tries to catch a 
glimpse of the man's ring and trips. The man just keeps going.
INT. FOOTLOCKER - DAY
Ace sits waiting with one shoe off. The store manager, an ex-player for the '82 team, sets down 
several shoe boxes. Ace checks out the ring.
CLOSE ON
A poster of the '82 team. The player we just saw is being crossed out.
EXT. HOTEL - DAY
Pan a few kids getting autographs from Marino and other players, ending on Ace dressed up and 
looking like a pimply kid. As the players sign, he checks their rings.
EXT. TRACK - DAY
Ace is again trying to catch the large man on the track. This time, just as he draws near, the man 
leaves him in the dust.
INT. SPORTS BAR - DAY
Two big guys finish arm wrestling. Ace steps up to challenge. He spends an undue amount of time 
preparing his grip, as he checks out the ring. Ace finally gets set and gives the "go ahead" nod. He 
is instantly thrown across the room.
CLOSE ON
The poster of the '82 team. Another group of players are being crossed out.
EXT. STREET
Ace spots a player driving along side him. He can't see his ring.
Ace deliberately cuts off the player's car and flips him off. The angry player flips Ace off. We see 
his ring is intact. Ace waves and drives off.
INT. MEN'S ROOM
One huge lineman uses a urinal. Ace, using the urinal next to him, nonchalantly tries to catch a 
glimpse of the guy's hands. The Lineman has a very angry look on his face, but after a beat it 
changes to a "come on" smile.
CLOSE ON
The poster of the '82 team. There is only one face that has not been crossed out. Ace circles it.
EXT. TRACK - DAY
Once again we see the large, fast man jogging toward camera. Suddenly Ace runs up behind him, 
with a desperate look on his face, pouring a bottle of chloroform into a cloth. He leaps onto the 
man's back, smothering him with the cloth and holding on for dear life. The man slowly gives up 
the fight and collapses. Ace casually checks the ring, then walks away disappointed.
EXT. MELISSA'S BACKYARD - EARLY EVENING
Ace sits in a lawn chair depressed. Melissa consoles him.
MELISSA
 Ace, that stone could have come
from anywhere. An earring, a
necklace
ACE
(with murder in his eyes)
 It came from an '82 AFC
Championship ring.
MELISSA
 Lt. Einhorn thinks it was an
animal rights group. Have you
heard of FAN?
ACE
 Free Animals Now? Started in 1982
by Chelsea Gamble, daughter of the
famous industrialist, Fischer
Gamble? Over half a million
members from Florida to Finland?
(beat)
 No. Who are they?
MELISSA
 Did you know that last year they
sent threatening letters to 127
college teams, demanding the
release of their mascots? At last
count 
ACE
 What do you feed your dog?
We see Melissa's dog lying near Ace's feet.
MELISSA
 Ah dog food, why?
ACE
 He's miserable.
MELISSA
 What are you talking about?
ACE
 He's just very unhappy, I feel
sorry for him. Bad diet, isolated
environment. It's amazing he's
still alive.
MELISSA
 You're just mad because your
stupid pebble theory didn't work
out and you don't know how to
express your anger.
ACE
 Yeah? And you're ugly.
MELISSA
 I'm not even gonna' talk to you,
please leave.
ACE
 What, so you can beat him? Fatty!
MELISSA
 You are unbelievable.
The phone rings inside the house. Melissa goes to answer it.
MELISSA
 Hiring you was a huge mistake!
The door slams and Ace is alone with the dog. After a moment he reaches down to pet it and we 
all see that it is one of the happiest dogs in the world.
ACE
 You like her, huh? Yeah, she's
alright.
Ace, feeling guilty, walks into the house.
INT. MELISSA'S DEN - CONT
Ace walks toward Melissa.
ACE
 Look, Melissa, I, ah
Ace stops when he sees Melissa. She is sitting, holding the phone in her lap with a completely 
stunned look on her face. Something is very wrong.
EXT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
Chaos. Police, lights flashing, paramedics, crowds of people.
Ace and Melissa see Roger Podacter's body taken away in an ambulance.
ACE
 You okay?
Melissa nods bravely. Emilio joins them.
ACE
 What'd you find?
EMILIO
 Podacter, Roger. Routine suicide.
He was alone. He'd been drinking.
No sign of a struggle. Neighbor
heard him scream on the way down.
Just your classic fifteen story
swan dive.
Melissa shudders. Ace gives Emilio a "way to go" look.
EMILIO
 Sorry.
INT. HIGHRISE LOBBY - NIGHT
The three enter. Emilio pushes the button for the elevator.
MELISSA
 It just seems so out of character.
He was going to retire in two
years.
ACE
 Did he leave a note?
The elevator arrives.
EMILIO
 No. That's nothing unusual. Some
do, some don't. He didn't.
The elevator doors close.
INT. PODACTOR'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
Police are everywhere. Emilio, Ace and Melissa enter and are immediately approached by one of 
the officers.
EMILIO
 Miss Robinson, this is officer
Carlson.
CARLSON
Evening, ma'am. I wonder if you
could answer a few questions about
the deceased?
Ace slips away, we follow him as he eavesdrops on conversations.
NEIGHBOR
(to a cop)
 I told you, I was across the hall
in my apartment, I heard a scream.
The door was locked, so I called
the manager
The Manager reiterates her story to the cop. The Manager is about 100 years old.
MANAGER
 The place was empty, except for
the damn dog in the other room.
Then I opened the balcony door,
looked over the railing,
and splat, bang, pancake time
Ace, continuing his investigation notices
PODACTER'S DESK
in perfect order.
Next, he notices police coming in and out of the balcony, closing the door behind them, shutting 
out the noise.
INT. PODACTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
A dog is cowering in the corner. Ace tries to comfort the little guy.
ACE
 Hey, fella, have a bad night?
Ace examines its paws.
Ace then gets down and finds scratches in the door. TWO FEET interrupt.
Ace stands. He is face to face with Einhorn.
EINHORN
 Who let Dr. Doolittle in?
Emilio steps in immediately.
EMILIO
 Ah, Lieutenant. He came with Miss
Robinson 
EINHORN
 This is official police business.
We'll let you know if the coroner
finds any ticks.
Cops snicker.
EMILIO
 I just thought since Melissa 
ACE
 E, forget it. She's right.
Besides, I wouldn't want someone
tracing my steps and pointing out
all the mistakes I made.
Ace crosses to
EXT. PODACTER'S BALCONY - CONT
Ace examines the area. Einhorn is in hot pursuit.
EINHORN
 Oh, so, you don't think this in an
obvious suicide, Mr. Pet
Detective?
ACE
 Well, I wouldn't say that. Lord
knows, there is plenty of evidence
here to support your theory,
except of course that spot of
blood on the balcony.
On the railing, sure enough, there is a tiny spot of blood.
Einhorn glares at a couple of nearby cops. They look down.
ACE
 May I tell you what I think
happened? Alrighty then!
Ace moves as he talks.
ACE
 Roger Podacter went out after
work. He had a few drinks, and he
came home. But he wasn't alone. 
Someone was with him in this
apartment. There was a struggle,
and then Roger Podacter was thrown
over that balcony. Roger Podacter
didn't commit suicide. He was
murdered.
A beat as everyone considers this.
EINHORN
 Well, that's a very entertaining
story, but real detectives have to
worry about that little thing
lawyers call evidence.
Ace picks up a lottery ticket on Podacter's desk and becomes a condescending kid show host.
ACE
 Let's take a trip to clue
corner, shall we? Can anyone tell
me why a man buys a lottery ticket
on the day he is going to commit
suicide? Or why the family pet,
suffering from acute canine
trauma, clawed at the bedroom door
until his paws bled? How about
the blood on the railing? I'll
bet if we put our thinking caps on
we'll see that it was the result
of the struggle that took place
inside this apartment while Mr.
Podacter was still alive!
(singing)
 NEXT TIME YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE
COME ON BACK TO CLUE CORNER! BOOP!
Everyone looks to Einhorn.
EINHORN
 Not a bad try for a pet detective,
but not near conclusive enough for
us real investigators.
(beat)
 First, people buy lottery tickets
everyday. It's a habit. It
doesn't prove a thing. Second,
the dog wasn't suffering from
canine trauma, he was suffering
from bladder trauma. Sergeant
Neilson found a piss stain as big
as Lake Huron near the bed. And
third, the blood on the railing.
Simple. He doesn't jump far
enough and whacks his head. A
fact confirmed by the paramedics
who found cuts on his scalp, with
traces of a white chalky
substance. i.e. plaster from the
balcony.
Einhorn shows Ace the paramedics report. Everyone is impressed with Einhorn.
EINHORN
 So much for your murder, Ventura.
AGUADO
 Uh oh, I think I heard a toilet
flush. Maybe someone lost their
turtle?
Everyone has a laugh. Ace looks beaten.
ACE
 Well, maybe I'm just a little out
of my league, here. Einhorn
Ace holds out his hand, Einhorn shakes it.
ACE
 good work.
Ace and Melissa head for the door.
ACE
 Oh, there is just one more thing,
Lieutenant.
(re: the neighbor)
 This man is Roger Podacter's
neighbor. He lives across the
hall. He said he heard a scream,
is that right, sir?
The neighbor nods. Ace turns to the apartment manager.
ACE
 And you said you had to open the
balcony door when you keyed into
the room?
MANAGER
 That's right.
Ace walks out onto the balcony and turns, facing them.
ACE
 You're certain you had to open
this door?
She nods.
EINHORN
 What's the point, Ventura?
ACE
 Only this
AAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW
Ace sustains an incredible Pavorati note, while he repeatedly opens and closes the glass door 
between them. When the door is closed nothing can be heard.
ACE
(tapping the door)
 This is double paned, sound-
proofed glass. There's no way
this neighbor could have heard
Podacter scream on the way down
with this door shut. The scream
he heard came from inside this
apartment, before Podacter was
thrown over the railing! And the
muderer closed the door before he
left!
(celebrates insanely)
 Yes! Yesss! I have exorcised the
demons!
(a la Poltergeist)
 This house is clear.
INT. ACE'S CAR - A SHORT TIME LATER
Ace drives straight ahead.
MELISSA
 What are you thinking?
ACE
 I'm thinking this whole thing is
connected somehow.
(frustrated)
 I'm thinking I want to find that
other ring!
MELISSA
 You checked all the rings.
ACE
 I know, Pessimistress. Could
anyone else have gotten a ring
that year?
MELISSA
 No. Camp was the only honoree.
Just players and coaches.
Everyone in the photo.
ACE
 Receipts! There must be
receipts! You have a key to the
office.
MELISSA
 Ace this has been a really tough
day. Can't we do this in the
morning?
Ace looks at his watch.
ACE
 Absolutely.
EXT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - 1:00 AM
Ace's car screeches to a stop, in front of the building. Ace jumps out, followed by Melissa.
INT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT
It's dark. Team pictures adorn the walls.
MELISSA (O.S.)
 These files go back to seventy-
eight.
INT. DOLPHIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Ace is flipping through a file cabinet, looking at receipts. Melissa is starting to warm to him.
MELISSA
 That was pretty impressive, what
you did back at the apartment.
ACE
(still looking)
 You don't have to tell me. I was
there.
MELISSA
 Maybe you should have joined the
police force become a real
detective.
ACE
(shaking his head)
 I don't do humans.
Melissa gets a bit closer.
MELISSA
 You really love animals, don't
you?
Ace stops searching and looks into her eyes.
ACE
 I feel a kinship with them. I
understand them. Wanna hear
something kinda spooky?
MELISSA
 Sure.
She gets closer still.
ACE
 One time, when I was about twelve,
I had this dream that I was being
followed by a dog with rabies. He
had these really bloodshot eyes
and foam coming out of his
mouth and just before I got to
my front door he jumped on me
and sunk his teeth in. Then I
woke up, and felt the back of my
neck check this out.
Ace motions for Melissa to feel the back of his neck, but when she does, he snaps at her hand, 
barking like a vicious dog.
ACE
 ARARAR!!!
Melissa jumps out of her skin.
MELISSA
 Ohhh!! You bastard!
ACE
(snickering)
 I'm sorry. I couldn't stop
myself. Are these all the
receipts?
MELISSA
(mildly annoyed)
 I don't know.
ACE
 There's only a dozen of them here.
Ace turns from the file cabinet with a hopeless look on his face. Melissa begins to clean up his 
mess.
MELISSA
(pointedly)
 Gee maybe they were misplaced
because somebody didn't put the
files back when he was
ACE
 Who the hell is that?
MELISSA
 What
Ace crosses to a big picture of the '82 team that hangs on the aadjacent wall and points out a 
player.
ACE
 That! Who the hell is that?!
He quickly pulls out his crossed out pictures of the team and begins to compare the two.
MELISSA
 Oh, that's Ray Finkle the
kicker. Don't you know who Ray
Finkle is?
ACE
 No! How come he's not in this
picture?!
Melissa checks Ace's photo.
MELISSA
 This was the picture you were
using? This was taken earlier in
the year. Finkle wasn't added to
the roster till mid-season.
She starts to realize what Ace has already figured out.
MELISSA (CONT'D)
 He's the guy that missed the final
field goal in the Super Bowl that
year. Cost the Dolphins the game.
ACE
 But he got a ring?
MELISSA
 Definitely.
INT. STADIUM/PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE - LATER
Ace and Melissa look through Finkle's file on a microfiche screen. Newspaper articles, headshots 
flash before them
MELISSA
 'Replacement Kicker Having Great
Year' 'Ready For Super Bowl,
Confident Kicker Boasts'.
ACE
 'Field Goal Sails Wide, Dolphins
Lose Super Bowl'.
MELISSA
 The kick heard round the world.
That was Finkle. The Dolphins lost
by one point.
Another headline hits the screen: FINKLE CONTRACT NOT RENEWED.
MELISSA
 Poor guy.
ACE
 Poor guy with a motive, baby.
Where is he now?
MELISSA
 Last I heard, he went back to his
home town, Collier County. He
used to work in a bar up there.
ACE
(pondering)
 REHEHEALLY.
MELISSA
 Can you drop me off before you go?
ACE
(shaking his head)
 No way. It may not be safe at
your apartment, and you shouldn't
be left alone.
MELISSA
 What do you suggest?
CUT TO:
INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - LATER
We see a person's butt under a sheet coming up into frame repeatedly.
SKIN, SWEAT, SHEETS FLY,  as Ace and Melissa roll back and forth on the bed. Ace is taking 
no prisoners.
CUT TO:
50 animals at the bottom of the bed, with eyes as big as silver dollars, watching them silently. We 
cut back and forth between furious lovemaking and shots of staring animals.
Melissa and Ace simultaneously reach the pinnacle of pleasure.
MELISSA
(totally amazed and exausted)
 OH man oh man! Oh wow!
ACE
(mock embarrassment)
 I'm sorry that's never happened
to me before. I must be tired.
EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY
Various traveling shots of Ace en route to a 'Deliverance' type town deep in the Everglades. A 
sign reads "Gas - Food - 2 Miles" but the word "Food" is crossed out.
INT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - DAY
A pitifully sad country song plays on the radio. FERN BILBO sits at his cluttered desk with the 
end of an old shotgun in his mouth. He is struggling to reach the trigger.
Through the glass behind him, we see Ace's car pull up to the only gasoline pump.
DING! The bell rings. Fern begrudgingly takes the gun out of his mouth, sets it down and walks 
out.
EXT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - CONT
Ace gets out of his car.
ACE
 Excuse me, sir. Do you know where
I can find the Pigskin Sports Bar?
FERN
 Do I have a "kick me" sign on my
back, son?
ACE
 I wouldn't know anything about
that, but if you could point me
toward the bar.
Fern breaks down, sobbing.
FERN
 They all left me all of them!
ACE
 Well Hypothetically speaking,
say they all left you and went to
the Pigskin Sports Bar. How would
they have gotten there from here?
FERN
 Two miles down and take the first
left.
ACE
 Thanks very much! Take care now,
'bye 'bye then!
Ace gets into his car and pulls out.
INT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - CONT
Fern enters, sits down at the desk, places the end of the shotgun in his mouth, reaches for the 
trigger and
DING! Another car pulls up to the pump. Exasperated, he takes the gun out of his mouth.
FERN
(murmers to himself as he gets up)
 Can't get anything done around
here
EXT. PIGSKIN SPORTS BAR - DAY
A weathered dive in the middle of a swamp. Ace parks.
INT PIGSKIN SPORTS BAR - DAY
If depression had a home, this is it. Several dejected men, with various degrees of missing teeth, sit 
around the bar. A couple hapless guys play pool. One throws darts.
Ace enters, pops a sunflower seed in his mouth and addresses the room.
ACE
 Excuse me, guy?! My name is Ace
Ventura, I'm a pet detective. I'd
like to ask you a few questions if
 I could.
No one even looks at him.
ACE
 Just a few questions, that's all.
Still no one reacts.
ACE
(very up)
 Who wants gum?!
Again, no reaction. Ace walks over to the bartender and slides a five across the bar.
ACE
 I'm looking for a guy who used to
work here.
The bartender takes the money.
BARTENDER
 That right?
ACE
 He was a kicker for the Dolphins.
Ray Finkle.
A pool ball flies by Ace's head shattering a mirror behind the bar. All eyes are on Ace.
ACE
(to guy who threw it)
 That would be a scratch.
TOOTHLESS GIANT
 You a friend of Finkle's?
ACE
(thinks)
 Yes?
CRASH! The giant guy smashes his bottle.
ACE
 Sorry, I have "say the opposite of
what you mean" disease.
Several undesirables surround Ace.
TOOTHLESS GIANT
 That bastard ruined this town.
ACE
 Ewww I hate that!
HICK #2
 We bet everything we had on that
Super Bowl and that son of a bitch
gagged.
ACE
 What a diiick!
They all move closer in a threatening manner.
HICK #3
 Shanked a goddamn 26 yarder!!!
ACE
 Death to Finkle! Death to Finkle!
The bartender steps in.
BARTENDER
 We had a hell of a thing going
here. Tourists coming to see Ray
Finkle's home town. He was
standing right over there when he
got the call from the Dolphins.
The bartender points to a payphone. It has had the shit beaten out of it. Every expletive you can 
think of is graffitied around it.
ACE
 Did he come back after the Super
Bowl?
BARTENDER
 Yeah but the boys here had ways
of letting him know he wasn't
welcome.
HICK #1
 Excuse me, I gotta take a wicked
Finkle.
Laughter.
TOOTHLESS GIANT
 What's the difference between
Finkle and a jackass? A jackass
can kick.
More laughter.
HICK #2
 Why did Finkle cross the
road?!
ACE
(facetious)
 Wait  I know this one.
HICK #2
 He didn't! And I've got the hair on
my bumper to prove it!
Maniacal laughter and chanting ensues.
MOB
 FINKLE SUCKS! FINKLE SUCKS!
FINKLE SUCKS!
ACE
 It's good you're dealing with the
anger.
(beat)
 I don't suppose anyone's seen him
lately?
The chanting stops and the guys all look at Ace.
BARTENDER
 No but we know where his
parents live! Don't we boys?!
HICK #1
 Yeah! We sure do!
They all laugh insanely again.
EXT. HOUSE - DAY
Ace pulls up outside a two-story stilt house. The place has been completely desecrated by graffiti, 
bullet holes and paint bombs. Toilet paper is strewn through the trees. Ace walks up and knocks 
on the door. A wooden peephole slides open revealing a suspicious pair of eyes.
ACE
 Hi, I'm looking for Ray Finkle.
A gun slides out into Ace's face.
ACE
(with a gulp)
 And a clean pair of shorts.
A deep gruff voice from inside.
VOICE
 What do you know about Ray Finkle?
ACE
 Southpaw soccer style kicker.
Graduated from Collier High in
June, 1976. Stetson University
honors graduate, class of 1980.
Holds two NCAA division one
records. One for most points in a
season, one for distance. Former
nickname The Mule. The first and
only pro athlete ever to come out
of Collier County. And one
helluva model American.
After a beat the peephole closes. The door slowly creaks open revealing MR. FINKLE, an 
unsmiling, taciturn, elderly man holding the gun.
MR. FINKLE
 Are you another one of them
scumbags from 'Hard Copy'?
ACE
 No, sir. I'm just a very big
Finkle fan. This is my Graceland,
sir.
Mrs. Finkle, a sweet, adorable elderly woman comes over.
MRS. FINKLE
 Will you put that gun down. The
boy's a fan of our son. So nice
to meet you. I'm Ray's mother,
and this is Ray's father.
INT. FINKLE HOUSE - DAY
ACE
 It's a real honor.
MRS. FINKLE
 My Ray is so appreciative of his
fans. He'll be so pleased you
stopped by.
ACE
 Are you expecting Ray anytime
soon?
MRS. FINKLE
 Oh, yes. I expect him home any
minute.
Ace is surprised.
MRS. FINKLE
 Would you like some cookies? I
just baked them.
Mrs. Finkle hurries off to the kitchen. Ace smiles at Mr. Finkle. The guy's a corpse.
ACE
 Wow Ray Finkle's house! Can't
wait to meet him!
MR. FINKLE
 Ray ain't comin' home.
ACE
 But your wife said you expect him
home any minute.
MR. FINKLE
 She expects him home any minute.
He points to his head, and looks toward the kitchen.
MR. FINKLE
 Engines runnin but there's no one
behind the wheel. Ten years ago
our son escaped from Shady Acres
Psychiatric Hospital in Tampa.
They're still buggin' us to pick
up his stuff.
Mrs. Finkle returns with a plate of football shaped cookies.
MRS. FINKLE
(sweetly)
 It was all that Dan Marino's
fault, everyone knows that. If he
had held the ball laces out, like
you're supposed to, Ray would
never have missed that kick. Dan
Marino should die of Gonorrhea and
rot in Hell. Would you like a
cookie, son?
Ace takes a cookie. Holding it up.
ACE
 Hey, what do ya know. They're
little footballs.
MRS. FINKLE
 Laces OUT!
CRASH!! A large stone smashes through the window. Outside, a pickup truck filled with drunken 
patrons from the Pigskin Sports Bar drives by yelling their Finkle chant.
MOB
 FINKLE SUCKS! FINKLE SUCKS!
MRS. FINKLE
 I told you he had a lot of fans.
Mrs. Finkle picks up the rock and hurls it out the broken window. It hits one of the vandals, 
knocking him out cold, as the truck peels away.
MR. FINKLE
(aside to Ace)
 She got the arm. The boy got the
leg.
INT. HALLWAY - A SHORT TIME LATER
Mrs. Finkle and Ace are walking down the hallway to Ray's room.
MRS. FINKLE
 When Ray gets back and starts
kicking again, he'll never even
know he was gone. I kept his room
just the way he left it.
She opens the door to Ray's room. Ace steps in.
INT. RAY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
It's a death shrine to Dan Marino. Complete with lifesize cutouts of Dan Marino, some with 
nooses around the neck, other hacked to pieces. Painted on the walls: "Death to Marino!", 
Marino must die!!!, etc.
ACE
 Oooh boy.
MRS. FINKLE
 What a sports nut, huh?
In the center of the room is a movie projector.
ACE
 May I?
MRS. FINKLE
 Oh yes. By all means.
Mrs. Finkle shuts the lights off. Ace turns on the projector.
The film flickers over the "Marino must die!!!" graffiti. It's the final play of the Super Bowl. 
Marino takes the snap, Finkle kicks and the ball sails wide. The film repeats itself ad infinitum.
EXT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - DAY
Ace on the payphone. We see the gas station in the background.
ACE
 Melissa, it's Ace.
INT. MELISSA'S OFFICE - DAY
MELISSA
 Ace? Where are you?
INTERCUT ACE/MELISSA
ACE
 I'm in Psychoville and Finkle's
the Mayor. Where's Dan Marino?
MELISSA
 Marino? Why?
ACE
 Because he's about to join
Snowflake. I gotta know where he
is.
MELISSA
 Okay, hold on
Melissa checks Marino's itinerary. Ace waits, impatiently.
ACE
(to himself)
 Come on. Come on
In the background, we see two paramedics exit the gas station office rolling a dead body on a 
gurney. The area of the sheet that covers the face is a giant red spot. We widen to see them load 
good old Mr. Bilbo into an ambulance and drive away, ringing the station bell one more time. Ace 
doesn't notice.
MELISSA
 Ah, he had practice. Then he
has a commercial shoot out at the
Prescott Sound Stage.
ACE
 Where is that?
MELISSA
 It's on Route One by the Six Cut
Off. Thirty minutes outside of
town.
ACE
 Okay, that's about fifteen miles
from me. Call the police. Get
extra security over there now.
MELISSA
 Ace, tell me what's going on.
(beat)
 Ace?
The payphone dangles off the hook. Ace is
EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY
in his car racing out of the swampland, his heaad now back out the window so he can see. He 
leaves a faded, old, barely legible sign in his wake:
"WELCOME TO COLLIER
COUNTY. HOME OF RAY 
FINKLE"
The "F" in "FINKLE" has been replaced with "ST" in spray paint.
INT. PRESCOTT STUDIOS - DAY
Rehearsal for an Isotoner ad in progress.
MARINO
 So I protect the hands that
protect me. With Isotoners.
Marino gets carted off by FIVE HUGE LINEMEN.
DIRECTOR
 Good. Remember, exit camera
right. That's to your left.
Alright, let's get ready to shoot
this.
FIRST A.D.
(to the linemen)
 Helmets on this time!
The linemen disperse.
EXT. STREET - DAY
Ace runs a red light causing cars to skid in every direction.
INT. PRESCOTT STUDIO - DAY
Marino is in the make-up chair.
MARINO
(to make-up girl)
 See, in 82 we just choked. We had
a chance to win it and we
didn't 
DIRECTOR
 Dan, are you ready?
MARINO
 Ah, sure.
(to girl)
 I'll tell you later.
EXT. STUDIO - DAY
The cops race onto the lot.
INT. STUDIO - DAY
Marino takes center stage.
A.D.
Quiet on the set roll
speed
DIRECTOR
 And action!
MARINO
 Hi, I'm Dan Marino. If anyone
knows the value of protection,
it's me
We see an old clip of Marino getting sacked.
EXT. STUDIO - DAY
Cops scramble on foot to the sound stage.
INT. STUDIO - DAY
The commercial is winding up. The linemen ready themselves.
MARINO
 So I protect the hands that
protect me. With Isotoners.
The five linemen grab Marino and run off camera.
DIRECTOR
 And cut! That was good. Again
from one.
But two of the linemen keep running with Marino
DIRECTOR
 I said cut!!
And they keep running.
DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
 What the hell are they doing?
Right out the studio door. Then the cops arrive and race after them. Two linemen stumble out 
of the dressing room holding their heads.
EXT. SOUND STAGE - DAY
Ace skids around a corner, looking way up ahead.
He sees Marino being shoved into a black 81 Ford Bronco. They drive off.
The cops come out of the building on foot. Too late.
Ace in hot pursuit almost runs the cops down.
ACE
(yelling at cops)
 S'cuse meee! Pet Detective!
EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY
Ace's head is out the driver's window through the entire chase. As he starts gaining on the bad 
guys, they start shooting. Ace wisely puts his head inside the car.
ACE'S POV
He can't see shit through his broken windshield.
He pokes his head out again. They shoot again.
Ace swerves off the road into
EXT. PARK - DAY
Ace's car smashes through benches and tables. Then it flips over a few times and lands on its 
wheels with a horrid SMASH. Ace is still strapped into the drivers seat, unconscious.
Ace's prized WHITE PIGEON lands on the car door right beside him. Ace cracks his eyes and 
sees the bird. Then, with a sudden quick lunge he successfully traps it in his hands, and forgets all 
about Marino.
ACE
 I did it! I did it! I caught the
white pigeon! I caught the white
pigeon!
Ace jumps out of his car and starts skipping around the park with the pigeon held high over his 
head. He looks insane.
ACE (CONT'D)
(singing)
 I caught the white pigeon, I
caught the white pigeon, I caught
the white
Ace slows down and begins to look around warily. There are now an unusual number of birds 
perched on the telephone wires around the park and on the monkey bars, and on the swings.
The sky grows darker. He slowly turns and tries to get back to the car. All the birds take flight.
Ace sets the white pigeon free and starts to run, but it's too late. The birds are on him. Pecking, 
and gouging, and ripping his flesh.
Now we see ten birds flying away with a leg. Five birds flying away with an arm. Twenty others 
are trying to take Ace's left arm off, and half his face is missing
ACE
 AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
CUT TO:
EXT. PARK - DAY
Ace is back in his wrecked car with his arm hanging out the window. A small boy is pulling it.
BOY
 Hey mister. Hey mister.
Ace come to suddenly, and looks at the boy with a crazed expression.
BOY (CONT'D)
 That was a really neat crash,
mister. Do it again!
Ace sighs with relief.
EXT. MIAMI - DAY
Various headlines hit the news stands: "MARINO KIDNAPPED" "STAR QB MISSING" "DAN 
WHERE ARE YOU?"
THE GLOBE HEADLINE: "MARINO ABDUCTED BY ALIEN FRANCHISE!" On the cover, 
Marino stands with several Space Aliens in football gear.
EXT. POLICE STATION - LATER THAT DAY
A chaotic press conference. Zillions of REPORTERS shout all kinds of questions at Einhorn.
REPORTER
 Lieutenant, have there been any
ransom demands?
EINHORN
 There's been no communication with
the kidnappers at this time.
REPORTER #2
 What's going to happen to the
Super Bowl? Will it be postponed?
EINHORN
 As of now, the game is going on as
scheduled.
REPORTER #3
 Why wasn't the public told about
Snowflake's kidnapping?
EINHORN
 Secrecy was essential. We didn't
want any public interference.
REPORTER
 Are the crimes related? And what
about Roger Podacter's murder?
EINHORN
 I'm sorry. I can't comment any
further. Now if you'll excuse me.
Einhorn pushes her way through the crowd of reporters.
INT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER
Einhorn is barking out orders to other cops as she heads for her office.
EINHORN
 Emilio, get me the autopsy on
Podacter! Aguado, send out a
memo. No one talks to the
press
INT. EINHORN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
EINHORN
 And somebody get me a cup of
coffee!
ACE
(TV announcer's voice)
 Tonight on "MIAMI VICE", Crockett
geets the boss coffee!
Ace is in her office, popping sunflower seeds, kicking back. Einhorn walks to her private 
bathroom.
EINHORN
 Ventura, when I get out of this
bathroom, you better be gone.
ACE
 Is it number one or number two?
Einhorn turns and glares at Ace.
ACE
 I just want to know how much time
I have.
Einhorn goes to the sink and begins washing her hands.
ACE
 Oh, by the way, I went ahead and
solved that pesky,
Snowflake/Podacter/Marino thing.
EINHORN (O.S.)
(humoring him)
 Oh yeah?
ACE
 yeah, ever hear of a former
Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle?
The water shuts off. Einhorn appears around the corner.
EINHORN
 Alright, Ventura. Make it quick.
ACE
 I found a rare stone at the bottom
of Snowflake's tank. It's from a
Dolphin '82 AFC Championship ring.
It would have been a Super Bowl
ring, but Ray Finkle missed the
big kick. Blames the whole thing
on Marino. We're talking
paranoid, delusional psychosis. I
saw the guy's room Cozy, if
you're Hannibal Lector.
EINHORN
 So how does Roger Podacter fit in?
ACE
 My guess is Finkle was snooping
around. Podacter recognized him.
End of story. As for Snowflake
they gave him Finkle's number, and
taught him how to kick a field
goal. Finkle took it personally.
Einhorn listens with great interest.
EINHORN
 So where is Finkle, now?
ACE
 He broke out of a metal hospital.
Did a Claude Raines. He's been
planning his revenge for years.
Waiting for the perfect time to
get back at the Dolphins. The time
when it would hurt them the most.
Super Bowl time! Man, I'm tired
of being right!
Einhorn walks in front and sits on the edge of the desk. She's totally softened her demeanor.
EINHORN
 Congratulations. You've done some
fine detective work, Ace.
ACE
 Ahh, could you talk in my good
ear. I thought I heard you call
me Ace.
Einhorn gets real close.
EINHORN
 Maybe I was wrong about you.
Maybe you are more than just a pet
dick.
SHE SUDDENLY PLANTS A MAJOR, TONSIL CLEANING, OPEN MOUTHED KISS ON 
ACE. Objects are knocked off the desk as they lean back.
ACE
 Your gun's digging into my hip.
More kissing, the Ace stops.
EINHORN
(still coming on)
 What's wrong, Ace? Want me to
read you your rights?
ACE
 Maybe later.
EINHORN
 What is it? That bony little
bitch, Melissa Robinson?
ACE
(defensive)
 No. You just don't do anything
for me.
He quickly adjusts his crotch, to conceal the erection. Einhorn withdraws with a coy smile.
EINHORN
 I'll be here if you ever want a
real woman.
There's a sharp KNOCK at the door.
EINHORN
 What is it?
Aguado opens the door.
AGUADO
 Everything okay in here?  Heard
some commotion.
EINHORN
 Fine, Sergeant.
AGUADO
 You want me to throw him out?
EINHORN
 Why don't you throw yourself out.
AGUADO
 Yes, ma'am.
A crestfallen Aguado exits. Ace heads for the door.
EINHORN
 Ace, I want you to leave
everything to us.
ACE
 Can't do that, Lieutenant. I was
hired to find Snowflake.
EINHORN
 When we find Marino, We'll deliver
Snowflake.
ACE
 When I find Snowflake, I'll
deliver Marino.
He exits.
INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT
A full on thrash metal band is cranking on stage. Kids leap wildly into the moshing pit. The same 
Burnout is still thrashing his head wildly to the music.
ACE
(shouting)
 Nice to see you again!
The Burnout just keeps thrashing. Ace spots Woodstock watching the band and joins him.
WOODSTOCK
 St. Francis, how's it goin'?
ACE
(kidding)
 That's none of your damn business.
WOODSTOCK
 Isn't it?
ACE
 Is it?
WOODSTOCK
 Anything new on that dolphin?
ACE
 Got his picture on some tuna cans,
but nothing so far.
A singer ROARS on stage. He sounds like a garbage disposal full of cutlery.
SINGER
Arroohhghhh! Myrrrooohghhhh!
Geroooghhh!
WOODSTOCK
 So, what can I do for you today?
ACE
 I need info on a football flunky
named Ray Finkle.
WOODSTOCK
 Sorry, Ace, I can't help you right
now. I gotta watch this band!
They are the shit!
ACE
 Are they?
WOODSTOCK
 Aren't they?
ACE
 Alright then. Don't worry about
it. I mean dolphins aren't
exactly an endangered species.
It's not like the whole food
chain's gonna be affected if one
highly intelligent mammal dies a
slow and painful death! Hell, if
the band is loud enough, you won't
even hear its pitiful whimpering!!
Ace does his best suffering dolphin impression. Woodstock is no longer enjoying the band.
CUT TO:
INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
Woodstock is at his computer. Ace looks over his shoulder. Finkle's Social Security information 
appears on the screen.
WOODSTOCK
 This guy's last reported income
was September, 1982.
ACE
 Well then. We know he's
incredibly thrifty.
WOODSTOCK
 Is he?
ACE
 Isn't he?
Woodstock types in more information. Finkle's TRW flashes on the screen.
WOODSTOCK
 Well, I think we can be pretty
sure he's involved in the
kidnapping of the dolphin.
ACE
 Really? What makes you say that?
WOODSTOCK
 There's two-thousand dollars worth
of smelts on his VISA card.
After a beat Ace realizes it was a bad joke.
ACE
 Please yank me no further. I beg
of you.
WOODSTOCK
 Alright already. The last time
this guy used his credit card was
June, '84. He rented a car from
Avis. And eww he was a bad
boy. They found it abandoned two
months later in South Miami.
ACE
 Anything else?
WOODSTOCK
 Nope.
ACE
 Well you did all you could.
Thanks for nothin.
WOODSTOCK
 Hey man, according to this, your
friend Ray Finkle doesn't exist.
ACE
 Hmm, I know what that's like.
WOODSTOCK
 Do you?
ACE
 Don't I?
INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT
Ace emerges from the basement. The band is between songs. Ace strolls by the burnout whose 
head has now stopped.
ACE
(to burnout)
 Did you get all the spiders outta
there?
Ace heads out, then freezes. The two thugs that took Marino are standing at the exit. Then they 
see Ace and start towards him, reaching inside their coats.
Suddenly the music starts. The burnout's head wails again. His manic gyrations interfere with the 
thugs long enough for Ace to bolt.
One of the thugs pushes the burnout violently against the wall as they pursue Ace.
BURNOUT
(calling, as he gets up)
 Thanks, man! You're a great
dancer!
Ace pushes his way through the crowd. The thugs follow.
Ace nears the stage. It's wild. People are diving off and getting moshed.
Before the thugs grab him, Ace runs up and throws himself from the stage. The insane crowd 
begins to pass him around over their heads.
The thugs exchange a look, then dive after Ace, and a "mosh" chase ensues.
Ace is passed back onto the stage as the song comes to an end. The singer is lying there 
exhausted. Ace sees the crowd starting to put the thugs down, so he quickly grabs the microphone 
off the floor.
ACE
(screams)
 ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, SPANK ME
MOMMY!!!
The audience looks at Ace for a second. Then the band members exchange a look and go for it!!
It's a nightmarish little ditty. Ace sings like one of Satan's minions.
ACE
 URGHHUURRAAAW! ARGHUURRRREEEW!
The crowd seems to understand. They throw the thugs high in the air again and mosh them away 
from the stage. The Thugs are shooting stray bullets the whole time.
Ace incites the crowd, even more now, with a punching gesture. The crowd follows their new 
leader, punching with one hand, moshing with the other.
The thugs get the living crap "moshed" out of them.
When the song ends, Ace raises fists in the air. The cheering crowd violently drops the thugs. 
They're out cold.
EXT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT
Ace's car PEELS OUT and races by the parked '81 Ford Bronco.
EXT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Ace's car skids to a halt. He hops out.
INT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
There's a loud BANGING at the door. Melissa awakens, looks at the clock: 3:32 a.m. She drags 
herself to the door.
MELISSA
 Who is it?
ACE (O.S.)
 Ira.
MELISSA
 Ira who?
ACE (O.S.)
 I refuse to do a 'knock knock
joke'. Come on, open up!
Melissa opens the door.
MELISSA
 Ace, what are you doing? It's the
middle of the night!
ACE
 You have to commit me.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN
Ace's clunker speeds down the highway.
ACE (V.O.)
 Finkle escaped from Shady Acres in
Tampa. They still have some of
his stuff.
MELISSA (V.O.)
 So you think they're going to let
us just waltz in and look around?
EXT. SHADY ACRES - ESTABLISHING - DAY
A state hospital located on acres of green, manicured lawns.
INT. SHADY ACRES - DAY
The reception area. A DOCTOR is before Melissa.
DOCTOR
 Mrs. Robinson? I'm Doctor Handly.
Now who is it that you'd like to
have us look at?
MELISSA
 My brother Eugene.
ANGLE ON ACE - Looking like the football player who never wore a helmet.
ACE
 I'm ready to go in, Coach. Just
give me a chance. I know there's a
lot riding on it, but it's all
psychological. Got to stay in a
positive frame of mind. Memorize
the play book. Study the films.
Ace strikes a dramatic pose and freezes, with a crazed look on his face.
ACE (CON'T)
 I'm gonna execute a button-hook
pattern!
He begins to make a play in slow motion.
ACE (CON'T)
 Super slo-mo!
CUT TO:
EXT. SHADY ACRES HOSPITAL - DAY
Melissa walks with the Doctor. Patients are sitting around, doing outdoor therapy, etc.
DOCTOR
 You're brother won't be the first
professional football player we've
treated.
MELISSA
 Is that right?
DOCTOR
 Yes. We're very sensitive to the
emotional stress athletes have to
endure.
Ace runs across the b.g. screaming "I'm open! I'm open!"
DOCTOR
 We'll have to do some preliminary
evaluations, but I think your
brother will fit in nicely here.
MELISSA
 That's a relief, Doctor.
Ace takes a "snap" from a three-foot hedge and dives over it into the end zone. Melissa and the 
doctor stop to watch him.
DOCTOR
 He seems to have some difficulty
letting go of the game. Has he
had a long history of mental
illness?
MELISSA
(truthfully)
 As long as I've known him.
Ace does a wild touchdown dance with some of the other patients participating.
INT. SHADY GLADE ACRES - HALLWAY - DAY
The doctor is showing Melissa around. Ace is walking alongside them adjusting his imaginary 
shoulder pads.
DOCTOR
 This is our therapy room Arts
and crafts
They turn a corner. Ace squats to pick the dirt out of his cleats.
DOCTOR (CON'T)
 That's the storage room. This
hallway leads to another
recreational area 
Ace WHISTLES loudly and gestures like a referee
ACE
 HALFTIIIIME!!
Ace sticks his head in the water fountain then sits down on the bench outside the storage room.
MELISSA
 He'll be fine by himself for the
next twenty minutes.
DOCTOR
 Well, why don't I show you the
dormitories, then?
They leave Ace.
After a beat, Ace gets up and does a quick spin pattern into the storage room door.
INT. STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Cartons everywhere. Ace does a quick search and locates several boxes maked FINKLE.
Ace looks through the first couple of boxes and finds only clothes. In the third box, he hits the 
jackpot: He finds sicko arts and crafts dedicated to Marino. Die-Dan potholders, shredded 
Isotoner gloves. He opens a little diary. "Laces Out!" is insanely scrawled on every page.
Ace finds a newspaper clipping, the headline reads:
SEARCH CALLED OFF FOR MISSING HIKER
ACE
(reading)
 A massive search ended today when
rescue workers were unable to find
the body of Lois Einhorn
(stunned)
 a camper reported lost since
Friday
(to himself)
 Lois Einhorn holy shit balls.
Ace sits bewildered.
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
The phone rings at Emilio's desk. He answers it.
EMILIO
 Echavez.
INT. SHADY ACRES - HALLWAY - DAY
Ace is on the phone. A CRAZY GUY is hovering nearby.
ACE
 This is Chicken Little. The sky
is falling.
EMILIO
 What?
BACK TO EMILIO
A beat as he listens to Ace's news.
EMILIO
 I don't get it. What's it mean?
INTERCUT ACE/EMILIO
ACE
 It means she's involved in this.
The article's dated the day before
Finkle disappeared.
EMILIO
 Before who disappeared?
ACE
 Finkle. Ray Finkle the guy who
took the dolphin? The guy you're
supposed to be looking for?!
Einhorn didn't tell you, did she?
EMILIO
 Hey, Ace. I see where you're
goin' with this and you're goin'
alone.
A Crazy Guy stands next to Ace now and begins mimicking everything he says.
ACE
 Come on, E. I tell her about
Finkle, she doesn't tell a soul.
I have an article here that
connects her with Finkle. You
gotta' check her out.
(to Crazy Guy mimicking)
 Do you mind?
The Crazy Guy stops and moves to one of the phones.
EMILIO
 Ace, I like my job. I get health
insurance and benefits.
CRAZY GUY
(into receiver)
 I'm the Lindberg Baby. Come and
get me.
ACE
 Emilio, Einhorn is involved.
You're gonna' have to make a
decision here.
(beat)
 Listen, I gotta get off the phone.
I think I just solved the Lindberg
case.
Melissa and the Doctor return.
DOCTOR
 Well, look who's trying to use the
phone.
Ace covers the phone receiver and whispers to them in a heartfelt voice.
ACE
 Brian Piccalo is dead.
Ace breaks down. Melissa hangs up the phone and leads him away.
We hear a thrash version of the theme to "Brian's Song" as they exit the hospital.
INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
Emilio stands at a window, watching Einhorn drive off. The coast is clear so he sneaks into
INT. EINHORN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
He rifles through her file cabinet. He tears through papers. Then he looks in her desk.
Stuffed in the back of the drawer he finds a personal note: We can make out the signature. 
Roger. He pockets it and walks out.
EXT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Ace and Melissa pull up in the old heap.
ACE
 Good job today. You're quite a
dirty rotten filthy liar.
MELISSA
(flattered)
 Thanks. Are you sure you don't
want to stay here with me?
ACE
 Naw, I got some thinking to do.
Besides, you'd be safer with
Salman Rushdie
MELISSA
 Okay.
She gets out of the car, then turns and leans in the window.
MELISSA
 Listen I know there isn't much
time left. The game is tomorrow.
But I know you've done your best.
It's just an impossible situation.
I don't expect..
ACE
 Hey
Ace leans over and kisses her.
ACE (CONT'D)
 bet on the Dolphins.
INT. ACE'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT
CLOSE UP: ANSWERING MACHINE
Wiggles' nose enters frame and hits the play button.
MESSAGE #1
(Shickadance rasp)
 Venturaaaa? Your time is up!
You're out! You hear me?! No
rent no roof!
We widen to find Ace on the couch listening.
MESSAGE #2
 Ace, it's E. Got something you
might find interesting. It's a
note from Podacter to Einhorn,
thanking her for a wonderful
Saturday night. This is too
weird, man?
ACE
 Wiggles, rewind.
Wiggles obediently hits another button and rewinds the phone tape. Ace pops sunflower seeds, 
and holds some evidence aloft thinking. A bird eats seeds out of his naval.
ACE
 What the hell does Lois Einhorn
have to do with Ray Finkle? Come
on, think!
DISSOLVE TO:
Later. Ace is posed like Rodin's "The Thinker".
ACE
 Finkle and Einhorn. In it
together. How? Why?
A small monkey sits in the same position. Mocking Ace.
DISSOLVE TO:
Later still. Ace pacing, jumping up and down. Trying to get his intuitive juices flowing. The 
monkey is likewise, jumping on the mantle.
ACE
 Alright! Here we go! Answer's
right there! Just gotta get some
blood to the brain! Finkle and
Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn!
Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and
Einhorn!
The animals all watch him like he's crazy.
DISSOLVE TO:
Daybreak. Ace sits staring at a picture of Finkle on the coffee table. He's totally spent and on the 
verge of tears.
ACE
(whimpering)
 Finkle and Einhorn. Einhorn and
Finkle.
He turns to see the monkey crashed out in a heap on a sofa pillow.
ACE
(to sleeping monkey)
 Quitter.
Wiggles jumps up onto the coffee table now. Ace can't be bothered with him.
ACE
 What do you want? Huh?
Wiggles whines at the tone of Ace's voice.
ACE (CONT'D)
 What? I got no food for you. You
gotta have money to buy food. I
gotta find the dolphin to get the
money. I don't see any dolphins
around here, do you? Face it,
it's hopeless your master is a
LOSER.
Ace buries his face in his hands. His dog Wiggles does the same. Then Ace looks up again.
ACE
 LOO HOO
Suddenly he is silenced by something amazing.
Wiggles' dark haired floppy ears are lying around Finkle's picture like a wig. Ace combs the hair 
over the head shot. The "make-over" is unmistakable. It's Einhorn!!
ACE
 Oh, my god! That's it!
He jumps up, estatic.
ACE
 Einhorn is Finkle! Finkle is
Einhorn! Einhorn is a man!!!
Ace's expression quickly turns sour.
ACE
 OH MY GOD!!! EINHORN IS A MAN!!!
MUSIC UP: AEROSMITH'S DUD LOOKS LIKE A LADY
Ace makes a mad dash into the bathroom.
INT. ACE'S BATHROOM - MORNING - QUICK CUTS
Ace furiously brushes his teeth.
Ace rinses with mouthwash, spits it out and gags.
Ace is in the shower. He slowly curls up into a ball under the steaming water with an expression 
of horror on his face.
INT. EINHORN'S HOUSE - DAY
CLOSE UP:
A woman's leg being shaved.
Woman sexily putting on nylons.
Woman hands squeezing perfume bulb.
Woman's hand putting on AFC championship ring. One stone is missing.
EXT. EINHORN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Ace sticks wads of gum in his mouth while he watches Einhorn's house from his car.
ACE
(remembering)
 You're gun is sticking into my hip.
Yeeeekkkk!
Einhorn comes out her front door and gets into her car. Ace shudders once more and then follows 
her.
EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY
The road is jammed in one direction. Going towards the Super Bowl. Einhorn drives in the 
opposite direction. Out of town. Ace tails her at a safe distance, with his head out the window, of 
course.
INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY
Various shots of crazy fans, piling into the stadium.
INT. STADIUM OWNER'S BOX - DAY
Melissa, BOBBY RIDDLE, and GUESTS all amidst the usual pre-game hobnobbing. Most of the 
talk centers on the loss of Marino.
Emilio, in full uniform, and a couple cops are providing extra security for the box.
EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY
Einhorn drives south out of town. The area's getting remote. Ace follows.
Einhorn turns down a deserted road and comes to
EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY
A large, abandoned industrial facility. Einhorn parks, disappears inside
A few beats later, Ace kills the engine and exits singing the score to "Mission Impossible".
INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY
Immense machines and swimming pool sized cauldrons.
Ace cautiously makes his way through the desolate site, singing quietly now. He stops when he 
hears a familiar voice.
JOHN MADDEN (O.S.)
 I particularly like the match-ups
of the defense.
Ace sees a weird sight: A HUGE TV PROJECTION SCREEN tuned to the Super Bowl pre-game 
show. Marino is tied to a football tackling sled. The two thugs take turns running into Dan with 
their shoulders, driving him back five feet each time.
JOHN MADDEN (ON TV)
 But the real story of this game
is the absence of Dan Marino. Him
being kidnapped and all has got to
be a strain on this Miami team. I
really feel sorry for those guys! I
mean, it's hard enough enduring
the pressure of the Super Bowl,
without your star quarterback
gettin' himself kidnapped. This
is the whole ball of wax, folks!
You wanna' get kidnapped, you do
it in the off season!
Marino looks incredulously at the screen. Next to him, Snowflake "watches" from a ground level 
cistern serving as an ad hoc tank.
Ace sneaks closer.
INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY
The crowd quiets as Jon Bon Jovi prepares to sing the National Anthem.
Various shots of fans all standing at attention.
In the owners box, Melissa looks to Emilio. Nothing's new.
INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY
Einhorn is now in front of the big screen TV SINGING the National Anthem along with Bon Jovi. 
The thugs, VINNIE and ROC, are behind her standing at attention.
The song ends. The crowd cheers.
In a sultry fashion Einhorn circles Marino now.
EINHORN
 I just love Super Bowl Sunday,
don't you, Dan? A magical
afternoon where dreams are made
or crushed!
DAN
 Look lady, if you want tickets,
you're going about it in the wrong
way.
EINHORN
 Do I look familiar to you, Dan?
Does it seem as if we've met
someplace before?
DAN
 I don't know I get hit in the
head a lot!
On the TV the ref makes an announcement.
REF
It's tails. The Eagles will
receive.
Dan really struggles now.
EINHORN
 Oops. Looks like we're going to
have to kick, Dan.
Einhorn steps behind a football set up on a tee. And in perfect sync with the kicker on TV, she 
boots a ball through a window of the warehouse.
Marino doesn't know what to think.
EINHORN
 I made some refreshments, Dan.
Would you like some refreshments,
Dan? I'll be right back,
Daaaan!!
She goes. Dan struggles, but to no avail.
MARINO
 Look, I don't know how much psycho
woman is paying you guys, but I
can double it.
VINNIE
 Sorry, Danny boy. Psycho woman
keeps us out of prison.
Vinnie grabs a feeder fish and entices Snowflake to the surface. Roc raises a football.
ROC
Hey, Marino, check it out. I'm
throwin' passes to a Dolphin!
He chucks the ball and hits Snowflake, hard. The thugs both laugh hysterically.
Snowflake makes an angry leap and drenches the thugs. Snowflake laughs now, the thugs are 
furious.
VINNIE
 Get some more fish!
INT. BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUS
Roc walks behind a big piece of machinery, reaches down for the pail of smelts, but sees nothing.
ROC
Where the hell's the smelts?
He stands up straight and we all hear that familiar "Pop" of a sunflower seed being cracked open.
Roc's eyes widen. He turns and sees
Ace coyly smiles at him, blows the sunflower seed shells into his face and CLANG! He whacks 
Roc in the head with a pail full of fish.
ACE
(doing Brando)
 He sleeps with the fishes.
INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - CONTINUOUS
VINNIE
 Hey Roc, what the hell was that?
Vinnie cocks his gun and goes to check out the sound.
INT. BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUS
Vinnie rounds the corner and sees nothing. He walks a little further and notices a trail of smelts 
lined up on the ground.
He follows the trail around a corner and we see Roc, unconscious but moaning. He is sitting 
against the ground, with his legs spread apart and the pail over his head. The trail of smelts leads 
to his crotch. There is one halfway into his zipper, with its tail flipping.
Vinnie takes in this sight, then rushes over to Roc and stands him up.
VINNIE
 Hey man! What happened? What's
goin on?
We see Ace at the top of a giant machine. He is aiming a 200 pound steel hook, that hangs on a 
chain from the ceiling.
ACE
 Guess what, boys, it's nap time.
Ace gently releases the hook. Just as Vinnie and Roc turn to look, the iron hook shears both of 
their heads clean off.
Two headless bodies fall to the ground in slow motion with blood gushing from their necks.
CLOSE ON ACE - HORRIFIED
ACE
 Hooooly Shiiit! Oh my god! I
didn't mean to - Oh man!!!
Ace holds his head and dances around, completely freaking out what he had done.
ACE
(looking to God)
 Lord, I swear! I just wanted to
knock them out!
Ace abruptly stops to think.
ACE
 Is that murder? I don't know.
They were gonna kill me. But they
didn't But they tried. That's
self defense. That's it!! I have
nothing to worry about!!
CUT TO:
Ace nervously whistling as he wipes his fingerprints off the hook.
INT. IRONWORKS FACTORY - FACTORY
Ace checks on Snowflake then goes to Marino. He signals for Dan to keep quiet, then starts to 
untie him.
MARINO
(whispers)
 Who are you?
ACE
(whispers)
 Ace Ventura. Pet detective. I've
been sent in with a special play.
(whispers)
 Quarterback sneak.
WE HEAR THE CLICK OF A GUN.
EINHORN (O.S.)
 Penalty. Too many men on the
field.
Ace turns. Einhorn's holding a gun on them from the other side of Snowflake's tank.
EINHORN (CON'T)
 I warned you, Ventura.
ACE
 What happened to "Ace"?
EINHORN
 Good question.
She pulls out a cellular phone and dials.
ACE
 Be careful with that phone,
lieutenant. I wouldn't want you
to get a tumor.
EINHORN
(into phone)
 Sergeant Aguado, it's Lt. Einhorn.
Get some men over to the old
ironworks factory on Victoria
Road. I've got the kidnapper
trapped in the warehouse. It's
Ace Ventura. He's killed Marino
and Snowflake.
Einhorn smiles as she puts the phone away.
EINHORN
 Vinnie! Roc! Get in here!
Ace gets a very guilty look.
ACE
 What? Who are they? You mean
there's other people here?
EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
A battalion of cop cars screech away as we hear
RADIO DISPATCHER
(V.O.)
 Attention all units. Code 11 in
progress at 343 Victorville Road.
Officer needs back-up
INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM OWNER'S BOX - DAY
The cops and Emilio listen to their ear pieces
RADIO DISPATCHER
(V.O.)
 Suspect's name: Ace Ventura,
male Caucasian, he is armed and
dangerous
Emilio nudges Melissa.
EMILIO
 It's Ace. Let's go.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Emilio high tails it out of there. Dodging concession stand patrons, bathroom lines, etc Melissa 
runs behind, trying to catch up.
MELISSA
 Emilio, is he in trouble?
EMILIO
 Don't worry, there's nothing Ace
can't handle!
INT. IRONWORKS FACTORY - DAY
Einhorn cocks her gun. Ace's face is glistening with tears. He's a complete wreck.
ACE
 Don't kill meeee!!
Pleeheeheeheeheeeezzz!!! I'll
never tell anyone! I swear!
(indicating Marino)
 He's the one you want!! Kill
him!!
MARINO
(indicating Ace)
 No kill him!
The two argue. Einhorn fires a shot in the air to stop them.
EINHORN
 No, I'm gonna kill the dolphin
first.
(to Ace)
 I wouldn't want you to miss that.
Einhorn walks to the edge of the tank. She aims the gun at Snowflake and FIRES!
We see the bullet miss Snowflake under water.
Snowflake swims wildly. She FIRES again! Misses again. Suddenly, Ace HOLLERS!
ACE
 Blue forty-two!!
Einhorn turns to Ace.
EINHORN
 SHUT UP!!
ACE
 BLUE FORTY-TWO!
Einhorn shoots at Ace! He dives out of the way.
ACE
 HUT! HUT!
Suddenly, Snowflake leaps out of the water and takes the gun out of Einhorn's hand, like the trick 
we saw earlier. Snowflake swims around the pool with the gun in his mouth.
ACE
(smug)
 Yes. The highly trained dolphin.
Perhaps the smartest mammal in the
animal kingdom. See how he knew
exactly what I wanted him to do,
as if our minds were somehow in
complete synchronization. They
have been know to save men at sea
you know. They have their own
language.
(to Snowflake)
 Snowflake. Come here, Snowflake!
Bring me the gun!
(makes dolphin sounds)
 EEEEEE! EEEEEE! EEEEEE!
Just like the trick in his routine, however, Snowflake swims around the tank, passes Ace, then 
hands the gun back to Einhorn. He finishes with a tail walk.
ACE
(under his breath)
 Stupid fish.
ON TV: Miami's kicker boots a perfect field goal from fifty yards.
JOHN MADDEN
 He got all of his leg into that
one!
The field goal kicker is hugged by his teammates.
ACE
 Good to see someone who doesn't
buckle under the pressure?
MARINO
 Yeah, not like in 82 when we
choked
Einhorn walks to Ace and puts the gun against his head.
EINHORN
 What would you know about
pressure?
ACE
 Well, I've kissed a man.
JOHN MADDEN (ON TV)
 Of course, there's never been a
more crucial kick than the famous
Kick heard 'round the world
The famous footage airs on TV. They all turn to watch.
JOHN MADDEN
 I mean, it's clear to me that
it was a good hold. Finkle just
booted it.
EINHORN
 The laces weren't out. THE LACES
WEREN'T OUT!!
Einhorn takes a shot at the screen, creating a hole in Madden's forehead. Ace uses the moment to 
smack the gun out of her hand.
A HUGE, NO-HOLDS-BARRED FIGHT ensues. Ace and Einhorn punch each other about the 
face and stomach.
Einhorn throws a punch at Ace. Ace goes down.
Einhorn goes for the loose gun. Ace leaps and tackles her.
They both crash into old rusty equipment, raising a mountain of dust. Marino struggles all the 
while trying to get free.
Einhorn kicks Ace. He flies into Marino.
MARINO
 Having a little trouble with the
lady, Ace?
ACE
(out of breath)
 You don't understand, she's a 
Einhorn grabs Ace, throws him into a head lock and begins wailing on his face.
Meanwhile, cops start arriving, SWAT team members disperse onto the catwalk as the fight 
continues. They try but can't get a bead on Ace as the two roll around on the floor.
More punches. They fight up a flight of stairs, then back down. To the amazement of the SWAT 
team, Ace and Einhorn slug it out as equals.
AGUADO
(caught up)
 Get him, Lois!
Now they crash through a plate glass window together. Ace gets to his knees first and wobbles 
toward the gun. It's the first clear shot the SWAT team has had.
EINHORN
(screaming)
 Shoot him! Shoot him!
We all hear the guns cocked. We see Ace in the rifle sights. We see fingers twitch on triggers.
A loud voice comes from off camera.
EMILIO
 DON'T SHOOT! HOLD YOUR FIRE!
Melissa is holding Emilio's gun under his chin.
MELISSA
 Put down your guns or this cop
gets it!
The SWAT team hesitates.
MELISSA (CONT'D)
 I mean it!!
Much to Emilio's surprise, she cocks the gun.
EMILIO
(whispers to Melissa)
 Ah Melissa? That's a hair
trigger.
(loud to cops)
 She's not joking!
The SWAT team leader signals his men. They lower their guns. Einhorn gets back to her feet.
EINHORN
 He kidnapped Snowflake. He killed
Roger Podacter, and he was about
to kill Dan Marino and me!
ACE
 Ho, ho! Fiction can be fun! But
I find the reference section much
more enlightening.
(doing his best Clarence Darrow)
 For instance, if you were to look
up 'professional football's all
time bonehead plays', you might
read about a Miami Dolphin kicker
named Ray Finkle, who missed a
twenty-six yard field goal in the
closing seconds of Super Bowl
Seventeen.
(in one breath)
 What you wouldn't read about is
how Ray Finkle lost his mind, and
was committed to a mental
institute, only to escape and join
the police force under the assumed
identity of a missing hker,
seducing her way to the top, in a
diabolical plan to get even with
Dan Marino whom he blamed for the
entire thing!!!
Ace gasps for air. Everyone is totally confused.
AGUADO
 What the hell are you trying to
say?
ACE
 She's not Lois Einhorn! She's Ray
Finkle! She's a man!
EINHORN
 He's lying! Shoot him!
Ace walks over to her.
ACE
 Let's just see who's lying. Would
a real woman have to wear one of
these?
Ace dramatically pulls at Einhorn's hair, thinking it's a wig. Einhorn's head flies back. The hair is 
real. Ace keeps tugging it.
The SWAT team ready themselves.
ACE (CONT'D)
 Boy, that's really on there! But
tell me this: Would a real woman
be missing these?!
Ace rips open Einhorn's blouse, and reveals two beautiful feminine breasts.
The sharp shooters are tensing. Ace is laughing nervously now.
ACE
 Ha, ha, ha! That kind of surgery
can be done over the weekend! But
I doubt if she could find the time
during her busy schedule to get
rid of Mr. Knish!!
Ace rips off Einhorn's skirt. Einhorn now stands there fully nude. She appears to be the perfect 
figure of a woman.
ACE
 Oooh boy.
Ace looks at Melissa and Emilio and shrugs his shoulders. Then, just when it seems all is lost, Dan 
Marino who is back behind Einhorn, motions for Ace to come over.
MARINO
 Psst Ace. Come here.
ACE
(to everyone)
 Could you excuse me just a second.
Ace goes to Dan. Melissa still holds Emilio hostage.
EINHORN
 Shoot him. Shoot him, now!!
MELISSA
(to cops)
 Don't anybody make a move!
Marino whispers something in his ear. Ace looks confident again. He once more addresses the 
crowd.
ACE
 Ladies and gentlemen, my esteemed
colleague Mr. Marino, has just
brought some new evidence to my
attention. Now, history has
certainly shown that even the most
intuitive criminal minds can be
wrong, from time to time. But, if
I have been mistaken if the
lieutenant is indeed a woman
then my friends, she is suffering
from the worst case of hemorrhoids
I have ever seen!!!
Ace spins Einhorn around now, exposing to the world, the healthy set of male genetalia that Finkle 
has learned to keep tucked between his legs. (And if we have any balls, we'll actually show it.)
Everyone gasps. CLOSE UP ON EINHORN/FINKLE. He finally drops the facade.
FINKLE
(deepest voice possible)
 It was Marino's fault. The laces
were in.
(breaking down now)
 They were IN!!!
Quick cuts of all the cops spitting with disgust. Then Emilio spits.
Then CLOSE ON Marino spitting. They all have kissed her/him/it. Even Snowflake blows his 
spout.
Ace confidently cracks a sunflower seed.
ACE
 Somebody read it its rights.
Suddenly, Finkle picks up a shard of broken glass and lunges at Ace.
FINKLE
 DIE ANIMAL BOYYYYY!!!
Thinking fast Ace sidesteps Finkle and sends him head first into Snowflake's makeshift tank. After 
a few seconds Finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes around, helplessly.
FINKLE
(gasping for air)
 Help I can't swim!!!
Finkle goes under again. We see him under water sinking down.
Snowflake swims to him now, allowing him to grab onto his fin and pulls Finkle gently to the side 
of the pool. Finkle lies there exhausted.
Ace reaches down into frame, removing the '82 AFC Championship ring from Finkle's finger. We 
see that it's the ring with the missing stone. Ace replaces it with the stone in his pocket. It's a 
perfect fit.
ACE
 LLLOOOSER! LLOO HOO SERR HERR
HERR!!!
Melissa is still holding the gun on Emilio.
EMILIO
 Melissa you can give me back my
gun now.
Melissa has forgotten she even had the gun. She hands it to Emilio and faints in his arms.
Now Aguado appears beside Ace.
AGUADO
 I don't know how you did it,
Ventura but that was damn good
police work. Alright guys, let's
wrap this up!
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
Twenty or more police cars in single file provide more than ample escort for
Ace and Marino in Ace's Chevy Bel-Aire with the cracked windshield. Both of them have their 
heads sticking out so that they can see. Marino has a wad of gum in his mouth.
HIGH ANGLE
The long line of flashing lights and cop cars drives at top speed up Route One. Ace's Bel-Aire 
right in the middle.
MARINO (O.S.)
 hey Ace?
ACE (O.S.)
 Yeah, Dan?
MARINO (O.S.)
 Got any more gum?
CUT TO:
INT. STADIUM - DAY
The Super Bowl Halftime Show is in progress. Marino is in uniform warming up. Emilio is 
drooling at the cheerleaders. Ace and Melissa are standing near the fifty yard line taking in the 
awesome spectacle.
Some fireworks go off around the tank. A  marching band plays a triumphant tune. We see a 
helicopter come up over the side of the stadium carrying Snowflake.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
 Ladies and gentlemen, the Miami
Dolphins are proud to welcome back
to BOBBY RIDDLE Stadium, our
beloved mascot and star of the
halftime show
ANGLE ON
The helicopter lowering Snowflake into his tank.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
 Snowflake!!
As the crowd roars, Melissa turns to Ace, and with Snowflake in the background performing 
spectacular flips, they kiss.
ANOTHER ANGLE
As Melissa and Ace kiss, the prized 'White Pigeon' lands on a Gatorade dispenser in the 
foreground. Ace spots it and starts to make a move.
Just as he closes in for the grab, the Philadelphia Eagles mascot eagle walks up to get a drink and 
shoos the pigeon away. Ace is furious.
ACE
 You idiot! Do you know what
you've done?!
The giant eagle head looks up at Ace.
MASCOT
 Huh?
Ace grabs him.
ACE
 You just cost me ten thousand
bucks, Polly!
MASCOT
 Yeah Blow me.
ACE
 REE HEE HEE HEELYYY?!!!
PULL BACK to find Eagle's mascot and Ace arguing. We can't hear what's said, but there's a lot 
of finger pointing.
Emilio stops his leering to check out what's going on.
The ANNOUNCER up in the booth reads a release.
ANNOUNCER
 The National Football League would
now like to offer a special thank
you to the man who rescued Dan
Marino and our beloved
Snowflake
On the field the mascot shoves Ace. Ace shoves back.
ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
 A great humanitarian, and lover of
all animals Mr. Ace Ventura!
Ace is straddling the eagle, pounding the shit out of giant head.
The image is flashed on the big stadium screen. We freeze frame on this huge picture of Ace, as he 
looks into camera with his fist raised.
MUSIC UP: THRASH METAL
ROLL CREDITS
THE END
(LOKI NOTE: My copy of this script has the bloody end of Vinnie and Roc physically crossed out 
by three black marker lines, presumably by the authors. Fortunately, they were crossed out 
diagonally, so I could still type the scene out for all to enjoy.)
