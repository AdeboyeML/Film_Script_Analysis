                    end of Daisy's dock.
                         
          Nick looks to the end of the dock, where he first saw Gatsby
          that warm summer night...
                         
                              NICK (V.O.)
                    He had come such a long way...
                         
          And suddenly, shimmering ghostly through the rain, Gatsby's
          silhouette can be seen once more, gazing out across the bay.
                         
                              NICK (V.O.)
                    And his dream must have seemed so
                    close that he could hardly fail to
                    grasp it.
                         
          Gatsby turns back towards Nick, and smiles...
                                                                     132.
                         
                         
                                NICK (V.O.)
                      He did not know that it was already
                      behind him...
                         
          Nick smiles back.

                      Gatsby believed in the green light,
                      the orgastic future that year by
                      year, recedes before us...
                         
          PUSH PAST GATSBY: Out over the water, toward the green light
          eternally pulsing at the end of Daisy's dock...

                      It eluded us then, but that's no
                      matter - tomorrow we will run
                      faster...
                         
          Gatsby reaches out--

                      Stretch out our arms farther... And
                      one fine morning...
                         
          As we PUSH PAST Gatbsy's outstretched hand, THE OPENING IMAGE
          RETURNS: The green light pulsing in the abstract dark...
                         
          Nick's final words appear as TYPE ON THE SCREEN.
                         
                                NICK (V.O.)
                      So we beat on, boats against the
                      current, borne back ceaselessly,
                      into the past.

          INT. SANTITARIUM - NICK'S ROOM - SUMMER - DAY
                         
          Nick pulls a final page from his typewriter, sets the page on
          top of his completed manuscript and we clearly see the title:
                         
          "GATSBY."
                         
          Nick considers this and then handwrites:
                         
          "THE GREAT..."
                         
          DISSOLVE THROUGH THE FINAL TITLE - "THE GREAT GATSBY" - TO:
          The green light. It pulses one last time... Then, fades to
          BLACK.
                         
          THE END.
