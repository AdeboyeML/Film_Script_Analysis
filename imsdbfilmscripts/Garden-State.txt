          The RADIO NOISE is drowned out by the A CAPELLA, SOPRANO

          THE WORST NIGHTMARE IMAGINABLE:
          SLOW MOTION: The plane is going down fasts Everyone panics
          and screams in SLOW MOTION as the oxygen masks away like

          ANDREW LARGEMAN (LARGE), 25, is the only passenger who
          remains unfazed. Even as the flames from the wing echo fiery
          reflections on his cheeks, even as the young mother seated
          next to him clutches her newborn and wails towards God, even
          as bags fall from the overhead compartment at half-speed and
          the beverage cart slides down the aisle, Andrew Largeman sits
          peacefully; unaffected.

          He calmly reaches up and turns his air vent so it blows
          directly on him. He looks up to

          THE FASTEN SEAT BELT SIGN

          it BINGS as the light flashes on and off. The BINGING

          Whiteness. Morning sun streams through a palatial picture
          window. THE PHONE continues to RING. A ceiling fan spins
          above stacks of scripts, a cell phone charging, bare walls
          and a small human figure dwarfed by the enormous white bed in
          which he sleeps.

          HIS BYES bounce back and forth under their lids as he dreams
          like they're chasing each other in a game of tag.
          THE PHONE is finally answered by the machine. Large's eyes

          BEEP. The machine cuts the voice off.

          They elide slowly left, then back right as if scanning in

          closed. He falls back to sleep.

          INT. BATHROOM -- MORNING

          Large appears to stare directly at us. He's dazed. His body
          is there, but his mind seems absent. He reaches to the middle
          of the frame, almost at us, and pulls open both doors of the
          mirror he's been staring into.

          His face and chest are immediately replaced with the two
          dozen orange prescription drug canisters that immaculately
          line the shelves of his medicine cabinet.

          He closes the mirror doors and stares at himself.

          Large rushes through throngs of people on their lunch break.
          He manages to avoid eye contact with all of them as he tries
          to find an address while checking a piece of paper.
          He boards an outdoor escalator and starts climbing thL-

          Large registers something: he isn't going anywhere.

          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal he's been walking up on the
          down side. He stands still and lets it bring him all the way
          down, where he moves to the "Up" one and rises towards the
          next level. His expression never changes.

          INT. CASTING OFFICE -- DAY

          A casting assistant sits behind stacks of headshots and
          manilla envelopes while the PHONE RINGS constantly. Large
          sits next to another actor that looks exactly like him;
          they're even dressed alike.

          A slow 360 degree pan around the room reveals ten other

          Hazy and claustrophobic in stopped traffic on the 405

          Large pulls his car into a parking spot, throws "The Club" on
          his steering wheel and heads towards the back door of the
          restaurant. But something catches his eye on the side of his
          car.
          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL: a gasoline pump nozzle
          sitting in his gas tank with a foot of tattered hose ripped
          off at the end. He stares at it, trying to remember the last
          time he bought gas. He looks both ways and covertly pulls the
          nozzle from his tank.
          He walks towards the back door of the restaurant and throws
          the nozzle in an open dumpater.

          of the stress. He rounds a corner to a time card machine and
          swipes his card. The machine BEEPS and displays the word,
          "LATE" in red. He crosses to a locker and quickly changes
          into a black tunic and pants.
          He moves through the kitchen which is whirling with over
          thirty people in white: chopping, frying, sauteing, YELLING.
          The Vietnamese chef wears a headset and BARKS ORDERS down the
          line. Large is met by a FRENCH WOMAN MANAGER. She walks with
          him as he weaves his way through the kitchen.

          his eyes to appear Asian. (As do all the white, good-looking,

          He takes a small radio transceiver device from the pocket of

          through the back of his jacket, out the neck and into his

          head to the right and stares at his body.
          He pulls the shirt on and buttons up the front. As he does
          his entire chest and person disappear into the design of the
          room. He looks at himself in the mirror; it looks like his
          head and forearms are floating in mid-air.

          a seven year old Cynthia. They both wear enormous "chicken-
          foot" slippers and smile from ear to ear.
          Large's POV: zooms into the face of the only person in the
          photo not smiling. This is Sarah Largeman. She stands; not
          yet requiring a wheelchair.

          Everything in the room is golf. it is one man's wood paneled
          shrine to the sport of golf: golf carpet, posters,

          drinking beer,. passing joints. Smoky, dark.
          Large notices JESSE, a wiry 25 year old in thick glasses.

          I'm not really motivated to do much
          at all. It's kind of funny, I guess
          I had kind of planned on my whole
          life being about struggling to get
          money. But now that I've got more
          than I ever dreamed, I'm really not
          sure what to do with myself. I

          This guy has one idea and he's a
          trillionaire. I got a thousand
          ideas, but I gotta sit around and
          wait for all my relatives to die.
          They join the group. Mark blows coke off a large golf book.
          Dave has a young girl on his lap. Large begins to notice that
          the girls in the room, although quite attractive, are pretty
          young; 17-19.
          As he pans the room, he lock eyes with a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
          GIRL. They play chicken briefly to see who will break the
          stare first. Large does and looks to his right where someone
          has just passed him a joint- He hits it and passes it on.

          his eyes he's feeling more fucked up every instant. She
          stands above him at the couch, then straddles him with her
          knees on either side of his legs; sitting on his lap.

          BLACKNESS.
          A BLARING LIGHT comes out of the darkness. Morning sun
          streams through a window revealing Large's face, full frame,
          eyes still closed. Across his forehead in thick black marker
          the word "BALLS" is written.
          His eyes open wide. He has no idea where he is. His eyeballs
          swing left, then right. As Large site up

          Large site on the sofa covered in an afghan. White morning
          sunlight pries past the beach towels covering the windows to
          highlight the duet in the air.
          A NOISE in the kitchen pops Large' s eyes open. He has no idea
          where he is.
          Large's POV into the kitchen reveals limited glimpses of a
          person walking around; like a hunter's amateur video of his
          Bigfoot sighting.
          He can only make out pieces: a sword, boots, then a cereal
          box.
          Then quickly the figure turns into perfect view: a medieval
          Knight in full regalia. They make eye contact for a second
          and Large slams his eyes shut. When he opens them again the
          knight is gone.

          Large and mark stare at Tim as he SLURPS down his cereal.

          addresses the fact that it says "Balls" in black marker On

          it makes me happy. And I let him

          won't worry that it's anything

          the headaches are something else.
          Our bodies do very funny things
          when they're consumed with stress

          First of all, I do think you need
          to find a psychiatrist that isn't
          your father. That just's something
          that should have been remedied
          years ago. He knows better.
          Secondly, I'm not in a position to
          comment on whether or not you
          should stay on the meds or not; I
          don't know your story. But my
          opinion, since you're paying for
          it, is that those drugs may help as
          a means to an end. But if you're
          not In any sort of therapy, sooner
          or later what's ever going on in
          your mind will find a way to peek
          it's little head out of the water.

          Well kind of. My mom adopted him
          years ago from Sally Strothers. one
          of those: For the cost of a cup of
          coffee a day" kind of things.
          where she's like, "How can you sit
          there and not help the children?"
          And we just couldn't. We couldn't
          sit there and not help those
          children. So we sent him letters
          and pictures for years and then I
          got really into ice skating and we
          kind of forgot about'em. Then one
          day the phone rang and it was
          Titembay and he was at the dry
          cleaners around the corner and he
          said that he was going to school at
          Rutgers and living in the dorms,
          but since he was used to living
          with his tribe he'd much rather

          ignored everyone but our

          environment for me to be growing up

          remnants of a "Jungle-Gym", dirty broken toys.
          Further along down the path amidst the junk they see a THIRTY
          FOOT DILAPIDATED SOUSE BOAT perched on cement blocks that
          sits right on the edge of the cliff. It's windows glow warm
          and welcoming.
          Mark stands in front of the boat. This isn't what he
          expected. Rain begins to fall.

                         MARK
          I guess this is it.

          being an asshole.
          They stand in the pouring rain staring at the boat. Mark
          steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull.

          After a moment, ALBERT, a very gentle looking man in his mid-
          thirties with a newborn baby asleep on his shoulder appears
          on the deck. He smiles warmly-

          Yes. Come on in out of the rain.
          Sam and Large look at each other, then follow Mark up an A-
          frame ladder that sits next to the hull.

          INT. ALBERT'S BOAT -- CONTINUOUS

          They step inside and the door closes behind them. It's very
          cozy and warm. GREAT MUSIC PLAYS. A wood burning stove heats
          the room and throws warm amber light onto a small LIVING ROOM
          with deep cushy couches.

                         ALBERT
          You guys must be freezing. Make
          yourselves warm by the fire. I'm
          just gonna go put her down. I'll be
          right out.
          The three of them huddle by the fire. They speak in quiet
          whispers.

                         SAM
          I must say, I've been continually
          impressed today with how each new
          place you bring us manages to be
          weirder and weirder.

          looking woman in her early thirties.

          Well in a bad storm I like to
          pretend this old boat's my own
          private "ark". Unfortunately, if
          this is the apocalypse, I'm not

          Good question. We're calling it
          Kiernan's Fault. And no one's
          really quite sure what it is
          because they haven't been able to
          explore it. They're locked in a
          legal battle over who has the

          No matter what it was, as long as I
          could put my name on it. Like it

          that. That's mine. I got this plate
          on my travels." But you know what?
          That's all ego; none of that stuff
          really matters. If at the end of
          the day I get to be with her, if I
          get to be with this person right

          for one reason or another and she
          was kind of holding me and rocking
          me back and forth. And I could see
          the little balls in this thing just
          rolling back and forth. And there
          was just snot dripping down my
          nose.

          And she just handed me her sleeve

          into it. And I remember thinking,
          even as a very little kid, "Wow.
          This is love."
