                 Research shows people like fat

                 the one in the green with less
                 sideburns and the one in the brown

                 I'm sorry to do this to you, Abby,
                 but I don't think I can work with
                 her anymore. It's bad enough I
                 have to take her criticism at home.
                 I can't do it on air, too. A man

    this before.

               Never. Men are incapable of growth,
               change or progress. For men, self-
               improvement ends at toilet-
               training. Rule number two. Laugh at

                  Of all primates, Bonobos are the

                  especially when it comes to sex.
                  For the Bonobo, sex is a way to
                  ease stress and diffuse tensions.

                  So summing up Bonobo-land, the
                  chicks look great, get freaky in
                  bed and in turn, they get to sit on
                  their asses and boss their men

                  I'm sorry you didn't get to meet
                  little Colin this weekend. And by
                  little, I don't mean undersized,

                  you want to talk about right now? I
                  was thinking maybe we should talk
                  about what you're gonna say on the
                  show.

                            MIKE
                  Well, Jay, I had a sales job where
                  I drove around a lot, listening to
                  talk radio. I started calling in
                  and lo and behold, people liked
                  what I had to say. Then I decided
                  what the hell, I need my own show.
                  I have a message people need to
                  hear.

                             JACK MAGNUM
                   Most of you are watching this show
                   so you can learn how to get chicks.
                   Let me assure you, you're in good
                   hands. You're looking at a guy
                   who's personally had sex with over
                   137 women. Most of them conscious.

                   He's ad-libbing. Why is he ad-
                   libbing? There's no ad-libbing.

      ON TV -- Jack Magnum just makes it worse.

                             JACK MAGNUM (ON T.V.)
                   We're here at the Balloon Fiesta,
                   and I'm supposed to be telling you
                   men are full of hot air, but I
                   think we all know, it's the ladies
                   that are full of crap. Just because
                   she says no, doesn't mean she means
                   no.

      At this Jack Magnum is tackled and pushed out of the balloon
      basket. After a moment --

      A frazzled ABBY pops up in his place.

                             ABBY (ON T.V.)

                   Hi! I'm sorry, but Jack Magnum will
                   no longer be able to do "The Ugly
                   Truth" segment. Which should really
                   come as no surprise. Because men
                   are completely unreliable.

                   What is she doing?

      The PHONE RINGS. Stuart picks up, then blanches.

      Abby stands in the basket, still nervous, but flying on
      adrenaline. Joy gives her a "keep going" hand gesture.

                             ABBY
                   Take Mike Alexander, for instance.
                   He up and quit the show without so
                   much as a word. You think you know
                   what men are going to do, you think
                   you know what they want to do...but
                   when it comes down to the moment
                   where they actually have to nut up,
                   they turn around and do something
                   completely different.
                                                                107.

      Mike stares at Abby on TV for a second, then grabs his keys.

                          MIKE
                Oh, I'm all over this.

      He races out, as Jonah calls after him.

      Joy and the camera guy watch as Abby gains steam, ranting to
      the camera. B-CAMERA, strapped to the basket, also records.

                          ABBY
                The big, strong, romantic men we've
                been reading about in novels and
                watching in movies since we were
                nine? They're fallacies. "Blue
                Lagoon" is a total freakin' lie.
                Men are not strong. Men are not
                brave. Men are afraid.

112   INT. KPHX - "SACRAMENTO AM" SET - DAY                            112 *

      From the news desk, Georgia and Larry watch the monitor,
      confused.

                    (offended)
                I love "Blue Lagoon".

      Georgia squeezes his hand.

      Mike's truck careens into the parking lot. He gets out,
      racing towards the field.

                          ABBY
                ...They're afraid to say what they
                feel. Afraid to grow up. Afraid to
                tell the truth.

                It's like she's in his brain!

      Abby continues her impassioned tirade.

                          ABBY
                Even if they have a moment in a
                hotel elevator that's totally
                romantic and filled with potential,
                men are completely incapable of
                copping to it. Because men are
                weak.

                          MIKE (O.S.)
                Let me tell you something about
                women.

      She turns to see --

      MIKE standing there. He pushes past Joy and climbs into the
      balloon. Grabbing the mic from Abby's hand.

                            ABBY
                Hey --

                          MIKE
                    (ignoring her; to camera)
                Women would have us believe that
                they are the victims. They aren't.
                They want us to think that we break
                their hearts for sport. That's
                crap. They say they want romance.
                They say they want true love, but
                all they want is a checklist. Is he
                perfect? Is he handsome? Is he a
                doctor?

118   INT. KPHX - CONTROL ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS                      118

      A confused Cliff looks at Stuart, who's still on the phone.

                   That is not true.

      BY THE CAMERAMAN, Joy shrugs.

                   Well, kinda true.

      Mike continues his rant.

                             MIKE
                   You men that fit the criteria --
                   don't kid yourselves. They're not
                   sleeping with you. They're sleeping
                   with a carefully calculated set of
                   venal choices. Money over
                   substance. Looks over soul. Polish
                   over principles. No gesture, no
                   matter how real or romantic, will
                   ever compensate for a really
                   impressive list of credentials.

                             ABBY
                   Says the man who's never made a
                   gesture except for this one --

      She makes the universally known "jack-off" hand gesture.

                             MIKE
                   So, the elevator wasn't a gesture?

                             ABBY
                   The elevator was a moment of
                   passion, followed by a moment of
                   panic on your part, apparently.

                          ABBY
                And then you ran away.

                          MIKE
                Well, that wasn't panic,
                sweetheart. It was an unwillingness
                to compete with the walking
                checklist that was in your bed. You
                should be thanking me.

      NEARBY, Joy taps her watch.

                          JOY
                We have ten seconds.

      An OVERZEALOUS BALLOON PILOT walks up.

                Are we ready to soar up, up and
                away?
