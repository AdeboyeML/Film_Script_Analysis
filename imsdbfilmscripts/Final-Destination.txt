FINAL DESTINATION




"FINAL DESTINATION"   

Originally Called "FLIGHT 180"

By James Wong and Glen Morgan



January 15, 1999



Awaiting......each of us; a cold...dark...lonely place.
Deny its finality. Deride its totality. Dread the inescapable
inevitability......it will arrive.

The BLACK SILENT SCREEN senses this moment before a distant blues harp introduces a contemporary band's cover of Blood, Sweat, and Tears' campy, yet haunting, gospel, "And When I Die."

As the Introduction closes, RESONATES... A FLASH OF LIGHTING!
A CRACK OF THUNDER!

                                                CUT TO:

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE - BED

An airline ticket is tossed INTO FRAME beside a suitcase; "EURO-AIR. FLIGHT #180. New York City (JFK) - Paris, Charles de Gaulle (CDG.) Departure: Thursday 13May. 16H25 - Arrival: Friday 14May. 05H40."

"And When I Die" Continues throughout the MAIN TITLES:

AN OLD TABLE FAN

swivels beside and open window. Outside, a humid spring THUNDER STORM drops warm, ominous rain. The figure of a seventeen year old boy, ALEX BROWNING, packing for a trip, passing the fan...

THE BED

A Paris guidebook is tossed atop the plane ticket. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE BOOK as the fan's breezes flip through the pages.

THE TABLE FAN

turns, head swiveling away from the bed.

TIGHTER - THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

stop flipping, REVEALING A GULLOTINE from the Reign of Terror.
As an American passport is dropped beside the guidebook...

THE TABLE FAN

swivels, returning towards the guidebook on the bed.

THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

FLIP. FLIP. FLIP. Alex's faint shadow continues moving about the room. The fan head swivels away, allowing the pages to settle... upon a Louvre masterpiece, Francisco de Zurbarans Lying-in-the State of St. Bonaventura.

CAMERA CREEPS IN, teasingly on the dark faced corpse. The pages begin to turn once again.

TIGHTER, OMINOUS ANGLE - THE DESK FAN

There is more of a hint of conincidence as the blades whirl and head swivels. The boy's figure passes, blocking the breeze.

THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

stop dead on... Jim Morrison's decorated tomb in the Cemetiere du Pere Lachaise. A pilgrim has spray painted "This is the End." Which in fact, it is... of the MAIN TITLE.

                        BARBARA
            Alex...

CAMERA ADJUSTS, to fully reveal Alex Browning as he turns toward the bedroom door. Alex is an average kid; handsome. A high school "everyman."

One the wall amongst Yankee and Knicks posters, hangs a pennant;
"Mt. Abraham High School, New York. The Fighting Colonials!"
Alex's mother, BARBARA, 45, walks in, excited and a bit anxious.

                        BARABRA (Cont'd)
            Tod and George's dad just called,
            he's picking you up at 10 in the 
		morning. Bus leaves the high school 
		for JFK at noon.

Barbara moves towards the suitcase to help him pack. Alex's father, KEN BROWNING, 48 appears, leaning against the door threshold, smiling enviously at his son.


                        KEN
            My suitcase workin' out for ya?

Alex nods and buckles it. Barbara reaches in to tear off an airline baggage I.D. ticket attached from the previous flight.

                       ALEX
            Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave
            that on. It's like... the tag
            made the last flight without
            crashin' or anything, right?
            So, it should stay on, or with,
            the bag for good luck.

                        BARBARA
            Where would you get a nutball
            idea like that?


EXTREMELY CLOSE - THE AIRLINE BAGGAGE MARKER

is torn away from the suitcase handle.

RETURN

As Barbara picks up the suitcase to place it on the floor... a dozen old baggage I.D. tickets spill from the outer compartment. She looks at Ken, as if "you?" The guilty party shrugs.

                        KEN
            I'm still here.

Barbara shakes her head as Alex smiles at his dad.

                        KEN (Cont'd)
            Seventeen and on the loose. Ten 
		days in Paris. In the springtime! 
		Live it up, Alex...

CAMERA INCHES INTO KEN as he winks at his son...

                        KEN (Cont'd)
            Got your whole life ahead of you.

ALEX

CAMERA CREEPS IN as, oddly, the words strike him portentously...

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - LATER

The storm has ceased. The room is QUIET.

As if itself a presence, CAMERA CREEPS across the dark and motionless room TOWARD Alex, sleeping soundly. CAMERA CRANES DOWN to the level of the bed until Alex is in the f.g. and the room is visible behind him.

On the rear wall, the Fighting Colonials pennant begins to flutter slightly, as if affected by the moving breeze. The path of which is continued toward the bed, rustling the sheets, subtly blowing Alex's hair and continuing OVER CAMERA.

Even in his sleep, Alex shivers from the passing cold. His eyes open surprised to be suddenly awakened. He considers for a beat, then looks toward...

THE WINDOWS

which... are closed.

ALEX

puzzled, checks...

THE TABLE FAN

which is off.

ALEX

perplexed, rolls over toward his digital clock. It's 1:00 a.m., however... the middle digit bar in the first zero faintly flickers so this time appears to read... 1:80.

                        AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.)
                 (overlapping)
            Attention airline travelers...


                                                 CUT TO:

INT. JOHN F. KENNEDY AIRPORT - MORNING - TELEVISION MONITOR

FLIGHT 180 departs 4:25. Gate 39.

                        AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.)
            This airport does not support 
		solicitors...

CAMERA ADJUSTS FROM the "Arrival-Departure Schedule" to REVEAL forty high school KIDS, four TEACHERS and several PARENTS are gathered inside the International terminal at J.F.K. Several of the students wear Fighting Colonial leterman's jackets or hats and shirts displaying "Mt. Abraham High, New York."

                        AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            You are not required to give money 
		to solicitors.

Alex gathers his bags, as does his best friend TOD WAGGNER and his older brother GEORGE WAGGNER, standing before their father, JERRY WAGGNER. For Alex, any psychic tension from the night before seems forgotten in the fun and excitement of the trip.

                        MR. WAGGNER
            Alright, you guys got everything?

                        TOD
            Yeah, we're all set Dad.

MR. MURNAU, the French teacher (any further description necessary?) and leader of the class trip waves his arm.

                        MR. MURNAU
            Les estudients, allons en France!

                        MR. WAGGNER
            Does that mean "go?"

Tod shrugs, "I guess" as he moves to his father and gives him a warm hug goodbye. Mr. Waggner then gives his older son a hug.

                        AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.
             Atencion senores pasajeros. No
             es necesario contribuir...

                        MR. WAGGNER
             I'll miss you guys.

Tod and George gives a wave, as does Alex, who is slapped on the back by Mr. Waggner.

                        MR. WAGGNER
             Take care of those two, Alex.

                        ALEX
             I will. Don't worry.

The group begins down the airport toward the check-in counter. In the f.g., before the boys, strides a girl, CLEAR RIVERS, 17, reading the TROPIC OF CANCER. The loner in the group, Clear wears dark colors against the insecerity of her sex appeal. She appears aloof and more wordly then the other students.

Readying his ticket and documents, Tod flips open his passport, checking out his photo.

                        TOD
           I didn't think anything could
           worse than my yearbook picture.

                        GEORGE
           Now you know how I feel havin' to 
	     look at you all the time.

                        AIRPORT P.A.  (V.O.)
           Avis aux passagers...

Mr. Murnau stops the group. Excited, he cups an ear with one hand while raising a finger toward the public address system.

                        MR. MURNAU
            Entendez classe, qu'est ce que
            c'est l'announce?

Everyone begrudgingly stops to listen.

                        AIRPORT P.A. (O.S. CONT'D)
            Vous n'etes pas dans l'obligation
            de contribuer aux demandes des 
		quemandeurs.

CARTER HORTON

is the class dickhead who mix and matches his role models in the most superficial manner. His hand is tucked into his girlfriend, TERRY CHANEY'S, waistband...

                        CARTER
                 (re: MURNAU)
            What the fuck's he want?

Terry, hot now, but with no idea what time will do to her in just five years, smiles obsequiously and mouths "shh."

                        P.A. SYSTEM (O.S., CONT'D)
            cher aeroport n'est responsable
            pour leurs activities.

Mr. Murnau scans the group, his expression looking for an answer. Clear Rivers keeps her head in her book as...

                        CLEAR
            The airport doesn't endorse 
		solicitors.

                        MR. MURNAU
            Tres bien, Clear! Tout droit!

She doesn't react. Her expression remains cool as Murnau leads the 
procession forward. The boys continue. Alex sighs...

                        ALEX
            Fuh-ck, do we have to put up with 
		that shit the whole time?

A hand reaches out to gently detain Alex. He looks up to find a HARE KRISHANA, dressed in everyday clothes, but head shaved and a mark on his nose.

                        HARE KRISHANA
            Death is not the end.

CAMARA PUSHES IN ON ALEX... unsettled by the soft spoken, yet ominous, "Solicitation." The Krishana offers a small book, REALITY BEYOND THE MATTER: VAISHNAVA PHILOSOPHY.

As he hands the book to Alex, a female form ENTERS FRAME between them. The women is MISS VALERIE LEWTON, 30, a feisty English teacher whose figure inspires all the boys' fantasies.

                        MS. LEWTON
            It will be for you if you harass
            my students.

She places a hand on Alex's shoulder, herding him to the group.

                        HARE KRISHANA
                 (pissy)
            Hare Rama.

Ms. Lewton turns and, while walking backward, flashes a smile...

                        MS. LEWTON
                 (mouths)
            Fuck off.

As she turns her back and continues down the terminal...

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. CHECK IN DESK - AIRPORT - DAY

Alex's passport and ticket are set INTO FRAME and picked up by a female TICKET CLERK. Alex waits as she busily types into the computer and checks his passport...

                        TICKET CLERK
            I have a few questions to ask you 
		this afternoon.

O.S., LOUD, EXAGGERATED plastic tiles rapidly CLICK and CLACK.

                        TICKET CLERK (CONT'D)
            Did you pack these bags yourself?

The CLACKING CONTINUES, demading Alex's attention. His eyes turn forward.

ALEX'S POV - THE FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD

Plastic tabs CLACK rapidly, settling on the word... "CANCELLED."

ALEX

CAMARA CREEPS IN on his dawning paranoia...

                        TICKET CLERK (CONT'D, O.S.)
            Have your belongings remained in your
            possession the entire time?

Alex absently nods. Again, O.S., CLACK CLACK CLACK. His eyes move to...

ALEX'S POV - (TIGHTER) - FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD

The plastic tabs FLIP and CLACK rapidly, stopping on... "DEPARTED."

TICKET DESK

Alex is still considering the "messages..."

                         TICKET CLERK
            Have you recieved any packages
            from persons unknown to you?

Alex quickly runs the day through his head and flashes her the REALITY BEYOND MATTER book. She smiles, then leans over toward the baggage scales. Alex's eyes turn toward...

CLOSE - (MOTION SLOWED)- ALEX'S LUGGAGE

a new airline I.D. marker is attached to his bag.

RETURN

Alex eyes the new tag hoping it's "good luck." As the clerk returns his ticket and passport... CLACK, CLACK, CLACK.

                        TICKET CLERK
            Same as your birthday.

Alex is puzzeled by the comment. He shakes his head if, "pardon me?" CAMERA INCHES INTO the ticket clerk gesturing pleasantly to the passport and ticket...

                         TICKET CLERK (CONT'D)
            April 25th. Four-twenty-five...
            your birthday is the same as your
            departure time.

CLACK. CLACK. CLACK. Alex's eyes flash toward...

ALEX'S POV - (FULL FRAME) - FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD

the title settles upon... "TERMINAL."

                                                 CUT TO:

INT.  SECURITY AREA - AIRPORT - MONITOR

The ghastly green and reds of the X-ray monitors flash as carry on bags flash through the machine. CAMERA MOVES COUNTER to the direction of the conveyor belt. The pace and excitement of the collective group escalates as departure approaches.

Carter Horton and his girlfriend, Terry, take cuts in line with smug, bullying expressions. Unseen by the chaperones, no student, has the nerve to protest Carter's action. Alex, Tod, George and BILLY HITCHCOCK, heavyset with a New York Rangers jersey watches Carter and Terry with disgust.

                        BILLY
            I can't believe they let that 
		dickhead on this trip.

                        GEORGE
            His parents bought a ton of those 
		trip certificates we had to sell, 
		just to get him out of their hair 
		for ten days.

Excited, Tod speaks in a convert tone over Alex's shoulder.

                        TOD
            Dude, I so worked the ticket clerk
            so you're sittin' next to Christa 
		and I'm next to Blake.

Alex looks up ahead of the metal detectors...

ALEX'S POV - TWO GIRLS

Attractive and they know it, CHRISTA MARSH and BLAKE DREYER appear clearly out of Alex and Tod's league.

                        TOD (CONT'D)
            That's seven hours and most of it is 
		in the dark.

ALEX AND TOD

The boys dump their change in a plastic bowl.

                        TOD
            Dude, if we don't get someone
            going on this flight, we should
            just call Dr. Kervorkian and put
            ourselves out of our fuckn' misery.

As Alex and Tod pass through the metal detector, their eyes performing reconnaissance on Christa and Blake, the opening drum BLASTS of Boingo's "No One Lives Forever" OVERLAPS...

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. AIRLINE GATE - AIRPORT - AFTERNOON - CLOSE - GATE 39

CAMERA ADJUSTS from the sign indicating GATE 39. The class is squirrely and  excited. Mr. Murnau, Ms. Lewton, and the parent chaperones are allowing kids to burn off steam at the gate, hoping for a calm flight.

CAMERA MOVES ALONG the awaiting passengers... Carter and Terry are making out, a step away from heavy petting...

Blake and Christa are flipping through Parisian fashion magizines... Billy Hitchcock lays into a Burrito Supreme...

CAMERA MOVES to an empty seat. Clear Rivers ENTERS FRAME and sits, 
struggling with her Walkman, coffee, books, and a cassette box handmarked "Boingo" (a cheat that We hear the song)

As she places her stuff on the unoccupied seat beside her, a Paris guidebook falls on the floor, opened but face down. A passing, unidentified, student reaches down and hands her the book, still open and face down.

                        CLEAR
            Thanks.

The student continues down toward the observation deck. Clear looks at the opened guidebook.

CLEAR'S POV - GUIDEBOOK

Princess Di's Mercedes is totaled in a Paris tunnel. Besides the photo are two portraits of Diana and Dodi Al Fayed.

CLEAR

CAMERA INCHES IN as she shakes off a shiver down her spine. She looks up from the book toward the student who handed it to her, the identity of which is fully REVEALED to be Alex Browning.

He stands at the gate window, looking out at the plane.

ALEX'S POV - 747

It is raining. In the distance, MUFFLED THUNDER RUMBLES.

CAMERA CREEPS AWAY from the plane... huge, seemingly incapable of flight and yet we unquestioningly trust our lives in this machine. Emotionless. Cold. Lifeless, and yet soon full of life.

ALEX

CAMERA inches in on him.

                        TOD (O.S.)
            Dude, let's take a dump.

Tod MOVES INTO FRAME beside Alex...

                        ALEX
           	Man, that is one George Michael
           	notch from being gay.

                         TOD
           	Dude, get wisdom. We're about to 
		board a seven hour flight. The 
		toilets in coach are barely 
		ventilated closets. What if your 
		body wants that airplane food out of 
		your system and you have to go torgue
            a wicked cable and then right after 
		you walks in Christa or Blake? You 
		want them to associate with you with 
		that reflexive gag and the watery 
		sting in their eyes?

Alex takes a beat to consider...

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. MEN'S ROOM - AIRPORT - OVERHEAD

CAMERA LOOKS DOWN on two stalls. Alex sits in one, Tod sits in the other. O.S., OVER the airports P.A. SYSTEM John Denver's "Rocky Mountain High" begins...

                        ALEX
            John Denver...

Upon the mention, CAMERA CRANES DOWN, TURNING, TWISTING UNTIL FINDING ALEX in a straight on CLOSE-UP. He listens, tense...

                        JOHN DENVER (O.S.)
            He was born in the summer of his 
		twenty-seventh year...

                        ALEX
            He died in a plane crash.

A P.A. ANNOUNCMENT breaks into the song...

                         P.A. SYSTEM
            Ladies and Gentlemen, thank-you for
            your patience, at this time we would
            like to begin pre-boarding of Euro-Air
            Flight 180 to Paris through gate 39.

Really for the first time, Alex appears a bit tentative and pale. It is intensified by the return of the song...

                        JOHN DENVER (O.S.)
            It's the Colorado Rocky Mountian High/
            I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky...

ALEX

looks down the paasenger ramp.

ALEX'S POV - RAMP TUNNEL

CAMERA CREEPS toward it... lit to cheat a feeling of no return.
O.S., distant THUNDER RUMBLES...

WIDER

There is something more emotionally tense about the moment of boarding than take-off. CAMERA PICKS UP Ms. Lewton searching...

                        MS. LEWTON
            Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock?
            How'd we lose him?

Tod nudges Alex toward the tunnel, the three boys start down the ramp, passing Mr. Murnau who checks his list, counting heads...

                        MR. MURNAU
             Vingt huit, vingt neuf...

PASSENGER RAMP

Alex, Tod, and George catch up to Christa and Blake, excited. As always, everyone becomes bottlenecked just at the point of entering the plane. Alex looks out the ramp's side porthole window toward the back of the plane.

ALEX'S POV - THROUGH PORTHOLE

The enormous engine. The expansive wings. Behind the tail, distant, a bolt of lightning FLASHES!

ALEX

looks away. Just ahead, in the plane, FLIGHT ATTENDANTS greet the 
passengers. He is next to enter the plane.

CLOSE - FLOOR

a slice of opening from where the ramp meets the plane provides a sense of how high up one actually stands.

ALEX

CAMERA PUSHES INTO HIM as he takes his first step into the plane.

CLOSE - AIRLINE CABIN FLOOR

Alex's Nikes land on the carpet.

INT. 747 - FIRST CLASS CABIN - AFTERNOON - CLOSE - BABY

SCREAMS! Its parents desperately comfort the child.

CAMERA ADJUSTS, LEADING George, Alex and Tod through the aisles. Alex and Tod wince at the screaming child. George, however feels comforted.

                        GEORGE
            Good sign. Younger the better.
            It would be a fucked-up God to
            take down this plane.

INT. ECONOMY CLASS CABIN - 747 - AFTERNOON

In the first row slumps a young man with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. A cannula is set in his nostrils leading to an oxygon tank beside him.

The kids sneak sympathetic yet anxious glances at the man while continuing in their seats. George whispers over his shoulder...

                        GEORGE
            A REALLY fucked-up God.

Alex's tension increases as he continues up the aisle.

ALEX'S POV - OVERHEAD COMPARTMENTS

CAMERA INCHES IN ON "Row 25. Seats H, I, and J."

ALEX

climbs into the row, carrying his backpack. He takes his window seat and reaches up to the air flow valve.

CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM as he takes in deep breaths of the stale air. He presses his face to the window.

ALEX'S POV - THE LEFT WING

Rain falls. GEARS WHIR as the ailerons are tested.

CLOSE - ALEX

CAMERA CREEPS TOWARD HIM, face to the glass; eyes scanning the plane and outside area.

                        CHRISTA (O.S.)
            Alex?

He turns toward the aisle.

ALEX'S POV - CHRISTA AND BLAKE

Man, they look great and they're workin' the sex appeal.

                        CHRISTA
            Could you trade seats with Blake
            so she and I can sit together? I
            asked Tod, but he says he's got some
            medical thing?

ALEX

sneaks a quick check with Tod.

ALEX'S POV - TOD

shakes his head. "NO! NO! DON'T DO IT."

ALEX AND THE GIRLS

He looks to them and knows he is just plain overmatched. Alex shrugs, "Sure." In front of him Tod throws up his arms, disgusted. Alex climbs out of his seats. The girls are touchy-feely thankful, but only know guys dig that.

                        CHRISTA AND BLAKE
            You're so sweet. Thanks, Alex.

Alex crames up into the aisles, making his way to Tod, sitting two rows up in 22 H.

Alex climbs over Tod to take the window seat. Clear Rivers sits in the seat directly behind Alex.

                        TOD
                  (mouths)
            Fag.

                        ALEX
            C'mon, man, like you really thought
		you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over
		Greenland, or something?

                        TOD
            Because of you, I gotta sit here and
		watch fuckin' "Stepmom."

As Alex sits, the tray table falls from its upright position.

He lifts the tray back up, but as he turns the latch, it BREAKS OFF in his hand. He briefly tries to jimmie the tray into postition, then gives up.

CAMERA FOLLOWS ALEX'S HAND as it rises. CAMERA SWEEPS IN EXTREAMLY CLOSE to the ATTENDANT CALL BUTTON. As Alex's finger engages the button, it lights up orange.

ALEX

The jet lurches. He looks...

OUT OF THE WINDOW - ALEX'S POV

The 747 begins rolling out of the gate.

ALEX

As he looks back, searching for the nearst flight attendant...

ALEX'S POV - THROUGH THE SEATS - CLEAR RIVERS

reads her book. Another leans to look out the window.

ALEX

lifts a bit out of his seat, searching for any flight attendant O.S., A PING.

                        CAPTAIN (V.O)
            Flight Attendants prepare for
            departure.

Looking fore in the cabin...

ALEX'S POV - NEAR THE FLIGHT DECK

The flight attendants strap themselves in for take-off.

ALEX

O.S., the ENGINE VOLUME INCREASES in PITCH and INTENSITY as the jet begins to taxi. Alex sits back as the tray over his lap. He looks out the window.

ALEX'S POV - THE RIGHT WING

appears motionless in the f.g. as the tarmac and runway signs roll past the window. THE ENGINE PITCH RISES...

ALEX

The ENGINES WHIR as the jet gathers SPEED. He checks the window.

ALEX'S POV- THE RUNWAY

is a blur. The airport terminals in the b.g. streak past. The wings lift, angled as the jet leaves the ground.

ALEX

O.S., his classmates CHEER and "raise the roof." The trip has begun.

CAMERA PULLS AWAY FROM ALEX, as if reflecting his easing of annoyance with the tray situation. He finally appears to notice the raucous reaction and settles back in his seat, slightly pushed by mild-g force. The upwarding angle increasing...

The cabin buffets, as if passing mild turbulance. Then...

The cabin sharply JOLTS! Everyone tenses, GASPS. CAMERA SWEEPS BACK TO ALEX. And just as he clenches his backpack... the cabin BANGS, ROCKS. THE ENGINES SPOOL TO A STALL. METAL TWISTS under extreme PRESSURE. The cabin dips, angles, sharply to the right.

ALEX'S POV - THE CABIN

Passengers SCREAM! Unrestrained personal belongings fly across the aircraft INTO CAMERA, which BUFFETS and SHAKES...

OXYGEN MASKS

deploy from the overhead compartments. A prerecorded message, like that recorded by the black box of the crash of JAL# 123 August 12, 1985, BLARES over the P.A., with erie calm...

                        MESSAGE (V.O.)
            Fasten seat belts...put on oxygen 
		masks...

ALEX

his hand trembles as he reaches for the oxygen mask and places it over his face. The ENGINES resuscitate. SCREAMING. WHINING. Alex checks out his window.

ALEX'S POV - OUT OF WINDOW

The plane is on its side, losing altitude. A slow, sick spin.

ALEX

breaths deep into his oxygen cup.

The JET ENGINES GRIND AND WHIR, as if the craft were in the midst of a last-ditch effort to regain stability; the sounds DEAFENING over the PASSENGERS' cruelly hopeless SCREAMS.

Then...

KA-BOOM

A DEVASTATING EXPLOSION ERUPTS across the cabin, blasting a five foot hole in the fuseluge. Human limbs and blood spray, craft and passengers torn to shreds.

Dead students sit lifeless in their seats.

Every unrestrained object on board flies to the hole and through the fire; paper, books, luggage, pillows. A PARENT and a STUDENT clutch their seat in terror, SCREAMING before they are pulled into the sky.

Wind. Screams. Dying engines, a deafening blare.

ALEX AND TOD

SCREAM, pale, knowing there is no hope, no escape as the ENGINES DIE. The cabin begins to tilt downwards... then straight down. Debris tumbles toward the flight deck as if falling from a cliff.

OUTSIDE... the sick familiar SOUND of an aircraft going down.

ALEX is strapped to his seat, upper body facing downward toward the water. FIRE, WIND, AND BLOOD WHIP across him. A BUILDING WHINE CRESCENDOES before a second EXPLOSION RIPS ACROSS FRAME...

                                              CUT TO:

CLOSE - ALEX'S TERRIFIED EYES

dilating rapidly, as the shock of what appears to be happening before him washes over his very psyche.

                        CHRISTA (O.S.)
            Alex?

ALEX

Drenched with sweat, trembling in his seat, his eyes dart toward Christa and Blake. They look great and they're workin' the sex appeal.

                        CHRISTA
            Could you trade seats with Blake so
		she and I can sit together? I asked 
		Tod, but he's got some medical thing.

Alex turns sickeningly disoriented. His eyes dart about, searching for evidnece of the catastrophe. There are none to be found. Alex blots from his seat, startling the two girls. He scrambles toward Tod, who looks at his friend, concerned.

                        TOD
            Dude, what up?

Frenzied, Alex climbs over his friend, on top of the seat. Alex's panic has alerted the other students and a MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT who makes his way to the row.

ALEX

grabs the tray table latch before the vacent seat. IT BREAKS OFF, JUST AS BEFORE. CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, terrified. He begins to hyperventilate.

                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT
            Is there a a problem, sir?

Alex's wild eyes and expression convey "no fucking kidding there's a problem." The flight attendant realizes this passenger is experiencing a serious episode.

Directly across the aisle, Carter Horton and Terry look at him with severe expressions.

                        CARTER
            What's your fuckin' problem?

Mr. Murnau and Ms. Lewton unfasten their seat belts and rush toward Alex.

                        MR. MURNAU
            Alex? Qu'est-ce se?

                        ALEX
            Qu'est-ce se?! THE PLANE'S GONNA
            EXPLODE!

Obviously, no one ever wants to ever hear that. The students tense.

THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT

immediately turns to other attendants, signaling for assistance with a quick definite gesture. In the b.g., attendants hustle toward the economy class cabin.

CARTER AND TERRY

               CARTER                TERRY
        Shut up, Browning!       You're not funny.

ALEX

frenzied, begins moving toward the aisle.

                        ALEX
            We have to get out!

This frightens everyone. Not the "prophecy," but his panicky, irrational behavior.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            We have to get off this plane!

CLEAR RIVERS

CAMERA PUSHES INTO HER, hearing Alex's declaration.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            Now! NOW!!

RETURN

Alex is desperately climbing over Tod, who is trying to calmly restrain his friend. Across the aisle, Carter Horton stands ready to quiet Alex, with force.

                  	CARTER
	      Sit! DOWN! Browning!

               TOD                             FLIGHT ATTENDANT
    Alex. Alex! Easy, man. Take it        Sir, if this is a joke,
    easy.                                 we don't tolerate such 
							humor.

The flight attendant restrains Carter with an extended forearm.

                             ALEX
                I'm not joking! I'm not joking!

Ms. Lewton and Mr. Murnau move to the seats. Flight attendants try 
restraining Alex from reaching the aisle.

           MS. LEWTON               	       MR. MURNAU
  Alex, Knock it off. It's alright.       Settle down, Alex.

                        ALEX
		Listen to me! This plane will 
		explode on take-off!

                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT
            Sir, we will remove you from the
            aircraft if this continues.

                        CARTER
            I'll remove him.

                         ALEX
            Fuck you! I'll remove myself!

Carter reaches for Alex, who pushes back, trying to get out. Carter responds aggressivly and now the flight attendant, Tod, and the two teachers are in the midst of the melee.

The Co-Pilot arrives to secure the situation. He grabs Alex and begins forcibly ushering him up the aisle.

A male flight attendant choke holds Carter from the back. Carter struggles but the attendant's postioning has the advantage. He begins removing Carter from the plane as well.

                        TERRY
            He didn't do nothin'!

She follows the attendant, hitting him to help her boyfriend.

Just arriving in the cabin, Billy Hitchcock tries to fight past a 
STEWARDESS to get to his seat. He is blocked by the mass of combatants as they are escorted out.

                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                  (he's had it)
            Anybody in the aisle is off the 
		plane!

                        BILLY
            No, wait, I was late... that's my 
		seat right there!

Under protest, Billy gets pushed back off the plane. Mr. Murnau and Ms. Lewton follow the pack of students and airline personnel as they move toward the exit, calling out to seated teachers and parents while hustling up the aisles.

          MS. LEWTON                       MR. MURNAU
   Everybody just stay where you    Mr. Carpenter, keep an eye on
   are. Just sit tight.             things for a moment.

Tod watches, amazed and concerned for his friend. He looks across the cabin to...

TOD'S POV - GEORGE

his brother gestures, mouths... "you should go with him."

TOD

starts off down the aisles. CAMERA COUNTERS... ADJUSTING TO CLEAR RIVERS. Amongst the chaos, she considers for a beat, then grabs her backpack, stands and moves into the aisle to exit the plane.

                                               CUT TO:

INT. BOARDING AREA/TUNNEL - GATE 39 - DAY

Alex, the co-pilot, Carter, the attendant, Mr. Murnau, Ms, Lewton, Terry, Tod and Billy proceed down the tunnel. Billy is confused by the chaos.

                        BILLY
            I didn't do anything! I have my 
		ticket right here!

Arriving SECURITY OFFICERS quickly have control of the situation. Alex is taken to a seat at the gate and dropped there by the co-pilot, who, winded, eyes the officers.

                        CO-PILOT
            You got this?

The officers nod. One moves toward Carter as he dropped in a seat away from Alex. Terry sits behind Carter.

The co-pilot and attendants start back toward the plane. Ms. Lewton hustles over to them and an airline representitive.

                        CO-PILOT
            No one gets back on board. That's my 
		call.

                        MS. LEWTON
            PLEASE... I've got forty students 
		going to Paris...

During these negotiations... CAMERA MOVES PAST Ms. Lewton and the Co-Pilot to the boarding ramp door...

Clear Rivers exits and takes a seat away from the others, aware she is unnoticed in the confusion. CAMERA INCHES IN as she looks up toward...

ALEX

CAMERA MATCHES THE MOVE TO HIM AS TOD and Mr. Murnau attempt to calm him down.

                        TOD
            It's alright. It's alright. You're 
		off the plane. You're off the 
		plane...

Rattled, Alex attempts to compose himself. Ms. Lewton appears, hurriedly pulling aside Mr. Murnau.

                        MS. LEWTON
             Airline's not taking this very well.
             They'll let one of us back on and
             the rest can grab a six-ten flight.
             Gets in two hours later at DeGaulle.
             It's alright. It's not that big of a
             deal.

                        MR. MURNAU
            I'll stay.

	                  MS. LEWTON
            No, you know the whole French thing. 
		Get on the plane.

Murnau understands this point and takes off toward the boarding ramp door. Pleading his case, Billy follows Murnau.

                        BILLY
            I was in the bathroom. The lock was 
		stuck. I didn't fight with anyone!

Hustling toward the door. Mr. Murnau gestures toward Ms. Lewton as if "talk to her." He disappears down the ramp. CAMERA PUSHES IN as airline personnel CLOSE THE DOOR...with an ominous THUD.

EXT. GATE 39 - AFTERNOON - CARTER, TERRY & BILLY'S POV

Flight 180 pulls out of the gate, taxiing toward the runway.

INT. GATE 39 - OBSERVATION WINDOW - AFTERNOON

Carter turns over his shoulder, looking back angrily towards Alex. Terry wraps a calming/restraining arm around Carter's shoulder, but he starts towards Alex, seated with Ms. Lewton.

MENS ROOM ACROSS FROM GATE 39

Tod races out of the bathroom with a dampened paper towel. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he hands it to Ms. Lewton seated next to Alex. The teacher places it on Alex's forehead.

                        TOD
            I called your mom and dad and 
		they're on their way.

                        MS. LEWTON
            Alex, talk to me. What happened?

Alex looks at Tod, who nods. His friend's expression is soothing and open. With lowered tense tone, meant for only the two people beside him...

                        ALEX
            I... I saw it... like, I don't
            know... the plane took off. I saw
            it leave the runway... I looked down
            and saw the ground...

Ms. Lewton and Tod exchange concered glances.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            And then the cabin banged and the
            left side exploded. The the whole
            plane... blew up. It was so real.
            Exactly how everything goes.

                         TOD
            Been on many planes that blew up, 
		have you?

Good point. Alex looks away.

                         MS. LEWTON
            You must have fallen asleep.

                         CARTER
            We get thrown off the plane and blow 
		a half day in Paris because Browning 
		has a bad dream?
                 (mocking Alex)
            It's going to explode! It's going to 
		explode!

                        TOD
            Fuck off, Horton.

                        MS. LEWTON
            Tod...

A raw nerve, Alex stands.

                        ALEX
            Only trip you're gonna take is to 
		the fuckin' hospital.

Carter scoffs while moving aggressively toward Alex.

Carter makes a quick move and grabs Alex. The two security guards rush in to break it up. Chaos erupts agian as the two boys wrestle in the terminal.

OBSERVATION DECK

CAMERA PUSHES INTO Billy Hitchcock, depressed as he watches the plane take off...

                        BILLY
            There they go and here we stay.

AIRPORT TERMINAL

One guard restrains Alex; another Carter. In the b.g. out of the observation deck window... Flight 180 lifts off the runway.

                        CARTER
             You're payin' for my trip, Browning!

                        ALEX
             I wish you were on the plane!

In the b.g. the 747 head and taillights suddenly, violently, ERUPT into a gigantic fireball of flame.

It takes a few seconds for the CONCUSSION to hit the terminal, but when it does... BOOM! A window SHATTERS! Chairs rock! People are knocked off their feet.

CAMERA SWEEPS INTO ALEX... stunned as he turns to the window...

ALEX'S POV - FLIGHT 180

The unceremonious speed of obliteration of hundreds of lives is cruel as flaming debris plummets from the early evening sky.

CLEAR RIVERS

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HER, rattled, afraid, but aware of Alex as she is first to turn her eyes toward him.

GATE 39

Billy Hitchcock walks backward from the window, shocked by shocked step. Ms. Lewton drops to her chair as her legs give out.

O.S., ALARMS BEGIN. The two security guards tear off toward more urgent duties. O.S., OUTSIDE, SIRENS WAIL as emergency vehicles race to the tragedy.

CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE toward ALEX... as Tod's head turns toward him, then Terry's... then Carter's. In the chair, beginning to cry, Ms. Lewton eyes Alex, as if afraid of him.

CAMERA CONTINUES. SIRENS PIERCING. The emergency vehicles' strobing red lights reflect in Alex's eyes, now in TIGHT as he looks out, frozen with shock... upon the doomed FLIGHT 180.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - PRESS ROOM #10 - NIGHT

SILENCE

A pair of Airline REPRESENTATIVES sit with the seven survivors, each numb with shock. Everyone is too raw with residual fear to show any emotion. They sit on folding metal chairs in an empty room, too bright from the fluorescent lights. Beneath their obvious trauma resulting from the catastrophe... each feels uneasy by Alex's presance.

The others sit away from Alex and Tod. Alex appears wrought with guilt. He checks the others out of the corner of his eye.

ALEX'S POV - THE ROOM

Ms. Lewton, Carter and Billy glare at Alex. Terry averts her eyes from Alex to bury her face in Carter's shoulder.

ALEX

frightened as anyone over what has happened, tenses, defensive and scared. With softspoken strength...

                        ALEX
            You're lookin' at me as if I caused 
		it. I did not cause this.

LEWTON, CARTER, TERRY, AND BILLY

maintain their uncertain expressions. With strained apprehansion, as if not wanting to "dabble in the occult," but needing an immediate answer.

                        MS. LEWTON
            Is everyone dead? Are there any
            survivors?

WIDER

Alex is taken aback by the question, yet even his best friend looks at him for an answer.

                        ALEX
            How would I know? You think I'm
            some sort of...

                        CLEAR
            He's not a witch.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Alex, relieved and thankful, as he turns to her...

CLEAR RIVERS - ALEX'S POV

CAMERA MATCHES the move INTO HER as she looks up at Alex, not with fear or repulsion... but with knowledge of an unwanted but irrefutable connection.

WIDER

Causing a startle, the DOOR OPENS. Everyone's head whips reflexively toward the entrance. The strange event of the flickering lights is quickly forgotten.

A half dozen MEN and WOMEN enter the room, displaying official badges and passes. All but two are dressed in casual clothing, having been called in from home; the pair being F.B.I. Special Agents WEINE and SCHRECK. HOWARD SEIGEL and DON HAWKS are representatives of the National Transportation Safety Board. EILEEN WHALE and JACK ARNOLD are members of the Euro-Air "Trauma Team."

The officials are sympathetic and calm, exuding the confidence and security trauma victims look for at this time.

                        SEIGEL
            Hello. I'm Howard Seigel, National
            Transportation Safety Board vice
            chairmen. We've notified your families
            and they are on their way. Does anyone
            feel they need medical attention or
            spiritual counseling at this time?

Although the words are comforting, being in the position of having to hear them macabre. Ms. Lewton reacts, snapping...

                        MS. LEWTON
            Have they found any survivors?
            What's going on?

Seigel is calm, yet honest... carefully honest.

                        SEIGEL
            The cause of the explosion is 
		undetermined. Nassau county
		authorities are on the scene. Naval
	      search and rescue are en route.

He gestures... "and that's all we know." The group slips deeper into despair.

                        WEINE
            We understand how you must be
            feeling at this hour... and although
            we know it may be difficult, we must
            ask you some questions... regarding
            today's events, while it's still
            fresh in your minds.

The survivors dread the thought of recounting the horrible experience, yet collectively are ready to co-operate.

                        WEINE
            It may be valuable to our rescue
            attempts, or any potential...
            criminal investigation.

The agents, F.B.I. badges displayed in their pockets, turn their eyes, suspicioulsy, toward Alex.

ALEX

reacts, puzzled, as he realizes the Agents are focused on him...

            You said...
                  (checks notes)

                  (to Alex)
            How did you know that?

ALEX

CAMERA PUSHES IN as he looks up, nervous... not about suspicion toward him, but trying to explain what even he doesn't understand.

                        ALEX
            I got this... feeling... a weird
            feeling... I can't explain it...

                        WEINE
            Did you take any seditives before

            No. I saw it. I saw it!

Tears well as he grows frustrated trying to convey the unique experience. Being trained, veteran officers, Schreck and Weine obsereve; allow him to talk.

                        ALEX
            Not like a dream... more than that.
		I experienced the plane exploding... 
		it was so horrible... I know what 
		they all went through tonight...

The officers remain quiet, gauging his explanation.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            I'm not a pyschic... I've never had
            this happen before...

The officers study him, unsure yet carefully...

                        SCHRECK
            Did this "weird feeling" have
            anything to do with you saying
            you wished Carter Horton was on the
            plane... just before it exploded?

Alex looks up, stunned. He didn't even recall this until now.

                        ALEX
            No!

                        SCHRECK
            Why'd you say it?

He considers, owing them an explanation. The he realizes...

                        ALEX
            Because... I... never thought it 
		would really happen.

Weine leans foward...

                        WEINE
            If that's the case, Alex... why did 
		you really get off the plane?

CAMERA INCHES IN as Alex considers, confused, emotional...

CAMERA CONTINUES THE MOVE on Tod... as if just realizing...

                        TOD
            My brother... told me to keep an eye 
		on Alex. He stayed... and I went to 
		make sure Alex was okay.
                  (a whisper)
            He told me to get off the plane.

                        MS. LEWTON
            Larry Murnau told me to get back

                  (pause, guiltily)
            I sent him back on the plane.

INT. A ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - WEINE

                        WEINE
            No one forced you to get off the
            plane. You told us you aren't friends
            with any that did... so, why did you
            leave the airplane?

CLEAR RIVERS

CAMERA INCHES IN as she looks up. With total resolve...

                        CLEAR
            Because I saw and I heard Alex.
            And... I believed him.

INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL BUILDING - PRESS ROOM #10 - NIGHT

The surviviors have all returned to the room. They may be a group, but they are alone with their thoughts. The door is opened by Ms. Whale.

Alex's Mother and Father lead by a group of parents into the room. Each moves with grief, yet relief, to their child.

Barbara Browning grabs hold of Alex and holds him tight. The mother begins to cry. Ken Browning, eyes welling with tears, grabs his son's hand and squeezes. Alex does not cry. While holding his mother, he watches the others.

ALEX'S POV - CARTER AND TERRY

Their parents are concerned, but do not demonstratively show affection. Carter appears as if he wants to hug his MOTHER, but he can't bring himself to betray his self-image.

ALEX

his eyes moves toward...

CLEAR RIVERS

alone, hurt that no one has come to take her home.

ALEX

his eyes find...

TOD AND HIS FATHER

JERRY WAGGNER holds his son, both of them releasing anguished tears. Through his grief, however, Jerry stares at Alex with an expression of anger and accusation.

ALEX

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he holds his mother tightly. OVERLAPPING... A CRACK OF THUNDER!

INT. KEN BROWNING'S CAR - NIGHT

Alex sits in the back against the door, looking out the window at the storm. Clear Rivers is pressed against the other door. Everyone is slient. Outside, the STORM angrily rages.

Alex is unaware that Clear is watching him, searching for some answer that she will not now find. She looks up.

                        CLEAR
            Here's good.

The car pulls over.

                        CLEAR
            Thank you for the ride.
				
She opens the door and flashes one more look at Alex, but he appears unaware. She exits the car and as the door SHUTS...

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is empty, but the CAMERA is SLOWLY MOVING, as if ITSELF a PRESENCE. O.S., FOOTSTEPS move up the stairs. Alex appears, his parents behind him. He clicks on the light, sending a soft, safe, orange glow across the room.

ALEX

stands in the threshold of the doorway. His mother places a comforting hand on his shoulder.

ALEX'S POV - PENNANT

Mt. Abraham High School Fighting Colonials.

ALEX

and now, the tears arrive. He begins crying, SOBBING, as his mother and father hold him. O.S., OUTSIDE... lighting FLASHES... THUNDER RUMBLES...

INT. LIVING ROOM - BROWNING HOUSE - NIGHT - TV

CNN broadcasts video footage of the disaster. Seat cushions and personal belongings float in the harsh floodlights.

LIVING ROOM

It is late and dark. Only the pale light of the TV spills across the living room. Ken and Barbara have fellen asleep, but their son remains awake.

Alex's red eyes are locked on the screen, mortified. O.S., a VICIOUS CRACK of LIGHTNING and immediate THUNDER... as if calling Alex to the window. He remains fixed on the TV.

ALEX'S POV - TV

An image of Hell as jet fuel burns on the ocean. O.S., as if furious at the slight, THUNDER BANGS...

ALEX

He turns, stands... and moves to the picture window, pulling the curtains aside as CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM...

ALEX'S POV - THE STORM

It is as if Nature is angry. Lightning BOLTS spiderweb across the sky. THUNDER BOOMS.

A shard of lightning breaks across the front yard. Oddly, it does not make contact. In the split-second strobe of lightning flash, the bolt abstractly appears as if it were a hand pointing directly at Alex.

ALEX

horrified, lurches away from the window, considering what he has seen. Just felt on the ROAR OF THUNDER...

                                             CUT TO BLACK:

                        MINISTER (V.O.)
            Thirty-nine days have passed since
            we've lost our thirty-nine loved ones,
            friends, and teachers.

FADE IN:

EXT. MT. ABRAHAM HIGH SCHOOL - DAY - CLOSE - ALEX

wearing a dark suit and tie, sits beside his parents on white folded chairs. His head is bowed, guilty and sad...

                        MINISTER (CONT'D)
            As each day passes without a
            determining cause for the accident,
            we ask ourselves, "Why?"

Alex raises his eyes and looks across the ceremony...

ALEX'S POV - TOD

sits with his mother, LINDA WAGGNER and his father, Jerry. Destraught, Jerry stares off blankly at the minister.

                        MINISTER (CONT'D)
            Ecclesiastes tell us, "Man no more 
		knows his time than fish taken in 
		the fatal net...

ALEX

guiltily averts his eyes. Ken notes this and wraps a comforting arm around his son.

                        MINISTER (CONT'D)
            ...or birds trapped in the snare...

Alex checks over his shoulder.

ALEX'S POV - OVER HIS SHOULDER - LAST ROW OF SEATS

Special agents Schreck and Weine subtly survey the area, taking notes. Although their eyes are beyond sunglasses, the tilt of their head indicates they are watching Alex.

                        MINISTER (CONT'D)
            ...like these the children of men...

ALEX

turns away, tense. He looks at the minister.

                         MINISTER (CONT'D)
            ...caught when the Time falls
            suddenly upon them."

CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, feeling eyes upon them. He looks up...

ALEX'S POV - CLEAR RIVERS

is actually sexy and a bit scandalous in her black dress. Still, she is off by herself, eyes burning at Alex as if challenging him to challenge the words being spoken.

ALEX

self-consciously turns away, unable to face her, let alone the words being spoken.

                        MINISTER (CONT'D O.S.)
            And so before we can heal, before we 
		can escape the presence of Death
		Time, we must mourn and celebrate
            theirs with this memorial.

WIDER

A student with a guitar and harmonica stands at the microphone. Without introduction, he begins Neil Young's "Long May You Run."

Two other students remove a cloth, unveiling a memorial sculpture etched with the names of the departed. The gathered stand and begin paying their respects to the memorial.

MEMORIAL LINE

Carter and Terry appear IN FRAME. Terry holds a rose. As they move slowly up toward the memorial, Alex gets in line behind them. Carter knows Alex is there, but will not look at him.

                        CARTER
            Hope you don't think, Browning, that 
		because my name ain't on this wall... 
		that I owe you anything.

                        ALEX
            I don't.

                        CARTER
                  (re: victims)
            All I owe is these people.
                  (turns to Alex)
            To live my life to the fullest.

Alex winces from Carter's breath...

                        ALEX
            Then maybe you should lay off the 
		J.D.

Carter has an angry reflexive reaction, grabbing Alex threateningly by the forearm. Terry immediately tries to get Carter to release his hold.

                        CARTER
            Don't ever fucking again tell me 
		what to do. I control me. Not you.

Carter and Alex lock eyes, Alex refraining from showing any pain caused by Carter's grip. Terry finally gets him to release.

                        CARTER
            I'm never gonna die.

He moves off. Terry, however, holds a beat, eyes Alex and gently rubs the area of his arm, as if this is the only manner she can extend her gratitiude in Carter's presence. As Alex pats her arm, Terry quickly moves off.

Shaken, Alex considers whether to move foward to the memorial. He steps aside to let the others go ahead as Billy Hitchcock, who has finished paying his respects, spots Alex and heads back up the line.

                        BILLY
            I took my driver's test this week at
		the DMV...

Alex turns to him, increudlously..

                        BILLY
            Got a 70. Lowest score, but I 
		passed. When I was done with the 
		test, the guy who drives with you
		during the test, he goes, "Young 
		man, you're going to die at a 
		very young age."
                 (beat)
            That true?
		
                        ALEX
            Not here, not now.
                 (beat)
            Not EVER!

Billy sighs, and moves OUT OF FRAME, only to quickly RE-ENTER...

                        BILLY
            If I ask out Cynthia Paster, will 
		she say "no?"

Alex flashes Billy an angry glare. He gets the message and moves off, for good. Alex returns in line, moving toward the memorial.

Valerie Lewton places a rose at the base of the memorial then studies the engraved names as the students move past behind her. Alex approaches, watching her as she reaches out with a trembling finger, touching the etched names...

CLOSE - MEMORIAL

Linda Krauss... Thomas Lewis... John McConnell.

RETURN

Alex stands near her, sympathetically, understanding her pain....

                        ALEX
            Ms. Lewton...

Her eyes fill with tears and fear. Alex places a comforting hand on her shoulder, but she reacts quickly, pulling away from him, her eyes piercing at him.

                        MS. LEWTON
            Don't talk to me. You scare the hell
            out of me.

Alex is shattered as the teacher moves away. Tod ENTERS and faces the memorial.

                        TOD
                 (a greeting)
            Hey.

Alex notices Tod is in line behind him. Alex looks around for Tod's father. He is not in line...

                        ALEX
            I don't want to sound gay, or
            nothin, but... I miss you.

Tod subtly nods, reaching out to the memorial.

CLOSE - MEMORIAL

Tod's hand moves across his brother's name... GEORGE WAGGNER.

RETURN

As Tod longs for his brother, then looks at his friend.

                        TOD
            Me, too.
                  (beat)
            But my dad doesn't understand. When 
		he's better; you and me, road trip 
		to the City. Catch the Yanks.

                        ALEX
            That's a plan.

Tod nods. The two friends stand uncomfortably foar a beat before Tod gestures to the podium.

                        TOD
            I gotta go. This thing Ms. Lewton
            showed me in her class, they're 
		gonna let me read it. It says what 
		I'm feeling.

Tod holds his friend's arm for strength as he passes. Clear Rivers appears in line, holding a rose. She looks at the memorial, before her startling eyes turn to Alex. Even away from these circumstances, Alex would have trouble handling her intense maturity. As he begins to step away, she thrusts the rose to him. He looks up, puzzled.

                        CLEAR
            Because of you... I'm still alive. 
		Thank you.

Alex takes the rose and she walks away. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he eyes... feels... the red flower.

                        TOD (V.O.)
            We say that the hour of death
            cannot be forecast...

Tod nervously stands before the assembly, reading aloud with a sad, yet optimistic resolve. CAMERA PUSHES IN, at an ominous ANGLE and rhythm, to the podium.

                        TOD (CONT'D)
            But when we say this, we imagine 
		that the hour is placed in an 
		obscure and distant future.

As he speaks, the sunlight suddenly turns to shadow.

ALEX

looks up at the sky...

Within the deep blue, a single black cloud blocks the sun.

ALEX

CAMERA INCHES IN as, troubled, he looks back to Tod...

            This afternoon... which is so

INT. LIVING ROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT

A lone light glows. Jerry Waggner has fallen asleep, perhaps passed out, reclined in "dad's chair." Tod's mother is asleep on the sofa, balls of tissue on the floor. Tod enters the room and stares sadly at his parents...

Tod picks up a glass and swigs the remainder of his father's scotch before moving off and climbing the stairs.

ALEX

sits at his desk, dark circles beneath his eyes. Swamping the desk are printouts of Internet Web pages and newspaper articles concerning the crash of Flight 180, forensic engineering textbooks, NTSB reports on past airline disasters and... REALITY BEYOND MATTER: Vaishnava Philosophy.

Alex studies his mountain of research, increasingly obsessed.

An O.S. paper FLUTTER draws his attention to the newspaper being blown by the fan. He reaches out and grabs it. Headlines and photos report on the memorial service.

CAMERA PUSHES IN as he sighs, troubled...

ALEX'S POV - NEWSPHOTO

Clear Rivers sits in her seat, legs crossed, alluring and sexy and 
mysterious.

ALEX

closes the paper, puzzled by his reaction. He shakes it off and throws the paper on the desk. Alex considers for a beat, then pulls open a lower drawer. Digging through the mess inside, he finds his stash... the April 1997 issue of Penthouse.

Alight CLICKS on REVEALING an old, '20's built bathroom. The toilet is beside the bathtub/shower, with just enough knee space to the counter cabinets when one lifts the toilet seat.

Tod puts the lid down and UNSNAPS his jeans. As he turns, pulls his pants down and sits, CAMERA MOVES to the CURTAINS... still... until a cold soft breeze causes them to billow. CAMERA FOLLOWS the wind as it CONTINUES into the room, rippling across shower curtains.

As the breeze passes Tod, he pauses... as if sensing, but not 
understanding... this is more than a wayward autumn breeze. He moves to close the window, however, CAMERA CONTINUES as the air makes ITS way to the door.

The door is softly pushed closed by the breeze.

BACK OF THE TOILET TANK

Tod sits, back to CAMERA, which CRANES DOWN the tank, STOPPING behind the locking nut and water line pipe.

As the toilet FLUSHES O.S., CAMERA NOW MOVES INTO the locking nut, which begins to slightly rattle. Drips of water stream from the tank onto the floor.

Odd how one can appear so erotic at a funeral.

ALEX

studies the photograph, then notices the rose she gave him. Succumbing to guilt, feeling like the freak all teenagers believe they are, Alex sets the paper back on the desk. He grabs the Penthouse and turns, opening the desk drawer in order to return the magazine, however...

A LOUD BANG turns Alex's head to the window!

ALEX'S POV - WINDOW

An OWL has apparently smashed into the window, awkwardly flapping its large wings, then turns its head toward Alex, large yellow eyes shining like an alien creature.

WIDER

Startled, Alex reflexively throws the Penthouse across the room, pages tearing as it hits the sill. The giant bird flies off.

THE TABLE FAN

swivels, a page catching in the whirling blades.

A PIECE OF PAPER

torn form the magazine flits across the room.

ALEX

CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM as the piece of paper ENTERS FRAME, floating and flitting until landing on his knee. He picks it up and turns it over...

TOD'S FACE

FALLS INTO FRAME, suspended by the cord, propped against the back wall of the shower stall, his bluish purple tongue grotesquely juts from his mouth.

TOD'S POV - DEATH

all four edges of FRAME appear to collapse as if by weight of the darkness until forming a myopic center. Then, from within the center... appears Tod's face. Although the expression is serene the pallor is grayish, until... suddnely, shockingly... Tod's face decays, as if ten years of rot in the grave is compressed into 72 FRAMES.

TOD

The moment of realization...

HIS FEET

kick upon the slippery basin. After a beat... they stop.

TOD

As his body settles... dies... CAMERA PULLS AWAY fully revealing his lifeless form. Once behind the toilet tank, CAMERA CRANES DOWN to the floor. The water eerily retreats from the floor, slipping back toward the base of the toilet and like a murderer, slips out of the night.

whirl and flash INTO CAMERA. CAMERA CRANES DOWN, ADJUSTING to REVEAL a Paramedics vehicle, a Sullivan County, N.Y. Sheriff's patrol car and unmarked sedan.

CAMERA CONTINUES MOVING UNTIL REVEALING Alex Browning racing down the sidewalk. He runs into a CLOSE-UP, sweating, out of breath, expression horrified as he takes in the scene before him.

SPECIAL AGENTS SCHRECK AND WEINE

stand in the front yard. Schreck subtly redirects Weine's attention toward...

ALEX - SPECIAL AGENT'S POV

The boy franically moves to a paramedic.

                        ALEX
            What happened? Is Tod alright?

SCHRECK AND WEINE

hearing this, they turn to one another, with an expression suggesting a deepening suspicion.

ALEX

sees the officers. Assuming they are sympathetic to his concern, he starts toward them, until...

                        CLEAR (O.S.)
            Alex!

Alex stops, looks around. Behind the tree and in the shadows of the adjacent house, stands Clear Rivers.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
                 (a warning)
            Get outta here!

CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, stunned, but before he can ask any further questions, a METALLIC CLACKING draws his attention back toward the house.

ALEX'S POV - A COVERED GURNEY

is rolled out of the front door by paramedics and an official with a jacket marked "CORONER," Behind the body follows Tod's father. He pauses in the doorway as he spots Alex in the front yard.

ALEX

is pale, nauseous. His eyes follow his friend's dead body as it is rolled toward the paramedics vehicle. Tod's father approaches Alex, the agents stand nearby.

                        ALEX
            What... what happened?

Mr. Waggner glares at Alex, accusingly.

                        MR. WAGGNER
            Didn't you... "see" it?

Alex is stung, guilty. He averts his eyes. Schreck and Weine note this reaction.

                        MR. WAGGNER (CONT'D)
            Couldn't you "predict" it?
            Couldn't you read his mind?
		
Alex remains silent, hurt.

                        ALEX
            Mr. Waggner...

                        MR. WAGGNER
            You caused Tod so much guilt over 
		George staying on the plane that...
                 (breaking down)
            He took his own life.

Alex is stunned, defensive.

                              ALEX
                  He wouldn't do it!

Mr. Waggner turns toward the paramedics van, as if "there's the proof."

                        ALEX
            He... he told me we would be friends
            again after you got better. After 
		you got over George. Why would he 
		make plans for the future if he were 
		planning on killing himself?

                        MR. WAGGNER
            All my wife and I will ever know is 
		we wouldn't have lost our youngest 
		son... if you'd told our oldest to 
		get off the plane.

Alex is rocked as if having taken a punch to the face. Mr. Waggner begins to walk toward the peramedics vehicle. Alex eyes the F.B.I. agents, who, after studying for a beat, turn and move toward their vehicle.

The gathered spectators begin whispering to one another, clearly about Alex, causing him to search for, what appears to be, his only ally, Clear Rivers.

ALEX'S POV - ADJACENT YARD

Clear is gone.

FRONT YARD

everyone has moved away from Alex, leaving him very alone. Alex's eyes remained locked on the peramedics' vehicle. As the ambulance doors CLOSE on the body of his best friend...

                                                    CUT TO:

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - CLOSE - LEAVES ON TREES

A soft summer breeze passes through the leaves on a tree. A yellow leaf drops from the branch and flutters to the ground. CAMERA FOLLOWS until it falls upon an old cracked sidewalk.

A pair of worn Nikes ENTER FRAME just as the leaf drops before them. The feet and CAMERA HOLD until CRANING UP to REVEAL Alex, staring at the leaf with an expression reminiscent of the torn paper's message about  "...Tod."

                        CLEAR  (O.S.)
            Almost Autumn.

Alex looks off toward a small unkept house, nestled at the edge of the woods. In the open garage stands Clear Rivers amongst cluttered artwork, supplies and tools. Her t-shirt's sleeves have been cut off and neck-line cut low. Her jeans have a revealing hole at the spot which once was a back pocket. She wears heavy black work shoes. A dog rests nearby on the floor.

                        ALEX
            It's only the end of June.

                        CLEAR
                  (shrugs)
            Yeah, but everthing's always in
            transition. If you focus, even now, 
		one week into summer... you can feel 
		Autumn coming.
                  (beat)
            Almost like bein' able... to see the 
		future.

Alex reads her intention loud and clear. She returns to her artwork. The dog GROWLS softly as Alex appraches the garage.

INT/EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVERS' HOUSE - DAY

Entering the garage, Alex gets a closer look at her artwork. It's abstract sculpture and canvas work and pretty bad, at that.

                        CLEAR
            Know what this is?

She gestures to him to approach her. He tenses, awkward, but moves closer. Clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas. Beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange; teen angst poorly communicated. Glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal.

                        ALEX
            Like, um... you're mad about
            something?

She sighs, "thanks a lot," then proud, but not enough to make her appear foolish over her bad artwork, indicates the metal.

                        CLEAR
            A piece of debris... from the plane. 
		I went to the shore off the crash 
		site and it washed up on the beach.

                        ALEX
            You went there? I've wanted to go 
		there, but I thought it was off 
		limits.

                        CLEAR
            It is. But that didn't stop me.
            Shouldn't stop you.

Alex gently touches the piece of the plane, almost expecting to feel something more than cold metal. He looks to Clear...

                        ALEX
            Why were you there last night?

While she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine...

                        CLEAR
            Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know
            the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen
            suicides. But they were there last 
		night, that means: one, they still 
		don't have a clue what caused the 
		crash. Two, they haven't ruled out 
		anything. And the fact that seven
            people got off the plane is probably 
		weird enough, not to mention, that 
		one of those people had a vision, or 
		whatever, of it exploding minutes 
		before it did explode, is highly
            suspicious. And it doesn't help that 
		the visionaries' friend just 
		committed suicide.

Alex eyes her for a long beat. She turns away from him, returning the can of turpentine to a shelf.

                        ALEX
            Why were you there last night?

Clear turns to Alex. The two couldn't appear more different. She moves to a sculpture, an ugly black and green globular sculpture with a white dot in the center.

                         CLEAR
            Know what this is?

Alex, cocks his eyebrow probably thinking, "a mess?" but tactfully shakes his head "no."

                         CLEAR
            It's you.

Remaining dry and stoned faced, Alex tenses, uncomfortable.

                         CLEAR
            Not a likeness. It's how you make 
		me feel, Alex.

                         ALEX
            I'm... really sorry.

                         CLEAR
            Like you, the sculpture doesn't even
            know what, or why, it is. Reluctant
            to take form. And, yet, creating an
            absolute but incomprehansible 
		attraction.

Uncertain, and yet moved, Alex listens.

                         CLEAR (CONT'D)
            Before that day, you were just 
		another suburban nothing that would 
		never have anything to do with my 
		life. And I'm sure you thought I was 
		some Marilyn Manson body-pierced 
		freak, or whatever.
                       (beat)
            But at that moment... on the plane... 
		I felt what you felt. I didn't know 
		where all those emotions were coming 
		from until you started freaking out.

Alex sighs, embarrassed.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            I didn't see what you saw, but I
		felt it. Okay, I'm not into all that 
		X-Files bullshit... but it was a 
		psychic connection. Why to me? Why 
		to you?

Jarred, he eyes her, frightened.

                        CLEAR
            And you can still feel it, can't 
		you? Something from that day is 
		still with you. I know, because I 
		can still feel you.

Alex is increasingly uncomfortable with the subject, but eased by Clear's apparent, somewhat, understanding. Lowering his tone...

                        CLEAR
            That's why I was there last night.

                        ALEX
            I've never dealt with death before.
            I wasn't alive when my grandparents
            died. I wish I could know. I mean, 
		all this... could just be in our 
		heads. Now it feels like it's 
		everywhere.

                        CLEAR
            "It?"
				
                        ALEX
            What if Tod... is just the first...
            of us?

The idea sends a shot of apprehension through Clear.
				
                        CLEAR
            Is that something you're "feeling?"

                        ALEX
            I don't know. I wish I could just see
            him... one more time, then, maybe... 
		I would know.

                        CLEAR
            Then, let's go see him!

Alex reacts, shocked and yet her impulsiveness is exciting...

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. FUNERAL HOME - FOYER - NIGHT

CAMERA is LOW, moving across the paisley carpet. Dim light, spilling through the stained glass windows, falls upon the creepy decor, appearing as if designed by a morose Laura Ashley, floor model coffins and urns. CAMERA CONTINUES, TILTING UP to the CEILING, REVEALING a stained glass skylight. Outside, on the roof, two silhouettes appear...

The skylight hinges CRACK open. Clear leads the way. lifting the frame, then dropping it throught the skylight window.

Alex is not as smooth as his socius criminus. Using his knee to slow his descent, he hangs from the sill for a moment before dropping to the carpet.

CAMERA MOVES WITH Alex and Clear through the unsettling reception area; plastic flowers, gold candelabra, plaster cherubs and angels. A bronze plaque identifies: "MT. ABRAHAM FUNERAL HOME. THE JOURNEY'S END. WILLIAM BLUDWORTH - INTERMEDIARY."

                        CLEAR
                  (whispering)
            Gives me a rush...

                        ALEX
            This place?!

                        CLEAR
            Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.

With a hot, mischievous smile, Clear proceeds toward the hallway. Alex anxiously sighs... then follows.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

An elevator with collapsible metal door lowers INTO FRAME. Pushing the door aside, Alex and Clear proceed into the hallway, lined with morgue green tile. Stainless steel gurneys and porcelain equipment holding yellow surgical tubing and thick foot-long needles sit in the corridor.

A faint light spills from beneath a doorway. Clear reaches out to the knob but Alex quickly grabs her hand. From a cart behind them, he pulls a latex glove out of a box and snaps it on.

                        CLEAR
            Good call. Very "Quincy."

Alex tries the doorknob. Locked. He looks at her, defeated. Clear quickly points to some mortician's tools on the cart.

From it, Alex produces a thin six inch needle. He inserted the tool in the lock and jimmies the doorknob. CLACK!

INT. MORGUE - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

A lone desk lamp shines. Across the room, laying on a porcelain table, fluid draining tubes attached, lies Tod. A sheet is pulled up to his shoulders. He carries the macabre appearence of a corspe having been made up by a mortician. Hair combed and sprayed, skin tone too orange, blush too rouge and lips too red.

As Alex and Clear approach...

                        ALEX
            That... him?

                        CLEAR
            I think. But why'd they make him
            up like... Michael Jackson?

                        ALEX
            That's him, but... he's not here. 
		That... whatever... that whatever 
		made him Tod is gone.

Suddenly, Tod jerks; his hand lifting four inches...

            ALEX                         CLEAR
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking		 Ohmygod! OHMYGOD! OHMYGOD!
asshole. You think this        He's not dead? 
is funny, you fucking 
dick? Tod, if you're 
not dead I'm gonna
fucking kill you!

                        MR. BLUDWORTH (O.S.)
            Please don't yell...
		
Both are jolted again with shock, turning toward the voice...

MR. BLUDWORTH

CAMERA PUSHES, LOW ANGLE, INTO WILLAIM BLUDWORTH, an African-American man, early 50's, dressed in dark suit and tie.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            You'll wake the dead.

He flashes a dry mortician's smile, pleased by his wan pun. Alex and Clear haven't recovered from the corspe's actions to calmly address Bludworth..

                        ALEX
            Why..?

Alex completes his question by raising his hand, ala Tod's dead body. Bludworth nods, understanding...

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            Chemicals in the vascular flush
            create cadaveric spasm.

As the startle of the situation settles, it dawns on Alex that they have been busted. He nervously offers an explanation.

                        ALEX
            I'm... a friend of his. His best
            friend. See, his father...

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
                  (ominous)
            I know who you are.
The mortician eyes Alex, understanding. Alex senses this and eases. Clear moves toward Tod's body, examining the neck area.

                        CLEAR
            They said he hung himself, but 
		there's no marks.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            I crafted a reconstruction of the 
		Laryngeal prominence region with 
		Velvetone Surgical Wax and 
		Permaseal.

Clear moves in for a closer look, then calls Alex over to the body. After a beat of reluctance, Alex looks at Tod's neck.

                        ALEX
            What are all those tiny marks?

ALEX'S POV - CLOSE - TOD'S NECK

The wounds have been filled with wax and covered by greasepaint. At this proximity, however, it is apparent tiny cuts line the area above and below the large cut made by the wire.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH (V.O.)
            Cuticle lacerations.
				
WIDER

                        ALEX
            Why would he pull at the wire if he 
		were committing suicide?
				
                         CLEAR
            Why would they say it was a
            suicide... if it weren't?

Because of the supernatural "message" he recieved, Alex is reluctant to answer. He eyes Mr. Bludworth, who, with a wry half smile, eyes Alex as if aware of the reason behind his hesitation.

                        ALEX
            His father's pretty fucked up with 
		denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with 
		the thought of an other accident... 
		taking another son.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            In Death...

CAMERA INCHES TOWARD the mortician. In this environment, lit with Fritz Lang shadows, Bludworth's tone, appearance... he could easily be mistaken for personification of the subject.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            ... there are no accidents. No
            coincidencess. No mishaps.
                  (smiles)
            And no... escapes.

                        ALEX
            You saying Tod did kill himself?

Bludworth moves to Tod on the draining table, disconnecting the tubes connecting the body to the embalming chemicals.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            Suicide. Murder. Plane crash. What 
		does it matter? He was going to end 
		someday. From the minute you're cut 
		loose from the womb... it's a one 
		way ticket on a trip to the tomb.

Vile liquid oozes out of the body onto the porcelain table.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            You may not realize it, but we're
            all just a mouse that a cat has by
            its tail. Every single move we 
		make, from the mundane to the 
		monumental... the red light we stop 
		at, or run; the people we have sex 
		with, or won't with us; the airplane 
		we ride, or walk out of... is all a 
		part of Death's sadistic design
            leading to the grave.

                        ALEX
            Design?

The mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from the table. He shrugs then continues his work...

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            If Life is like a box of 
		chocolates... Death... Death is like 
		a big Milton Bradley game of "Mouse
		Trap." The day you're born is just 
		the boot, hanging from the 
		streetlamp, kicking the marble to 
		get things rolling. Growing up is 
		only the marble rolling down the 
		curving chute. You feel immortal 
		having survived school, sex, drugs 
		'n' rock 'n' roll, but you've really
            only upset the big hand holding the 
		steel ball that falls into the 
		bathtub. Marriage and kids and 
		career seem to make it all worthwhile 
		until the ball hits the see-saw and 
		flips the diving man into the big 
		barrel. In the old folks home or the
            hospital you just see the big cage 
		rattling down until it captures... 
		the mouse.
                 (beat)
            Game over.

Alex considers as Clear eyes him, conveying "this guys's whacked!" Alex moves toward Bludworth...

                        ALEX
            Maybe there's no way to win... 
		but... if you figured out the 
		game... you knew where the "steel 
		ball was rolling" couldn't you 
		avoid the trap and extend the 
		playing time? Couldn't you... cheat 
		Death at Its own game?

Mr. Bludworth looks directly at Alex. CAMERA MOVES IN ON EACH, 
INDIVIDUALLY... this between the two of them.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            You already did that by walking off
            the plane. Now you gotta out when 
		and how it'll come back at you.
                  (beat)
            Play your hunch, Alex. If you think
            you can get away from it.
                  (beat)
            But beware the risk of cheating the 
		plan, disrespecting the design... 
		could iniciate a horrifying fury that 
		would terrorize even the Grim Reaper.
                  (beat)
            And you don't even want to fuck with 
		that Mack Daddie.

Alex's eyes are locked on Bludworth's chilling, pleasant smile. The mortician yanks on a tube, REVEALING a foot long needle removed from Tod's spinal column. The horrific nature of death is vividly demonstrated to Alex.

                        ALEX
            I'm sorry we broke in.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            No harm. No foul.

Alex grabs her arm, starting toward the door.

                        CLEAR
            We didn't find what we were looking
            for.

Alex looks at Bludworth...

                        ALEX
            Yeah, we did.

MR. BLUDWORTH

CAMERA PUSHES INTO the mortician, pleased the message has been recieved.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            I'll see you soon.

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

BRAKING LOUDLY, startlingly, a public bus PULLS INTO CAMERA and stops. The doors HISS open.

                        CLEAR (O.S.)
            The mortician was whacked.

CAMERA ADJUSTS as Alex and Clear step off the bus and onto the street.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            He was trippin' on formaldehyde.

Clear starts up the street, but Alex grabs her arm and steps back, assuring the bus moves off... safely. He nods, "it's safe to go." Throughout the following, his eyes are searching for anything potentially deadly.

                        ALEX
            He said Death has a design. Even
            before he said that I had been
            seeing patterns.

                        CLEAR
                  (sarcastic)
            As in flannels and plaids?

Up ahead, scaffolds rise before a building being restored. O.S., HAMMERING and CONSTRUCTION WORK POUND from above. In the f.g., tools and metal spikes. After a "thumbs up" gesture, the rope is pulled UP AND OUT OF FRAME.

                        ALEX
            How many died on Flight 180?
            From our group?

                        CLEAR
            Thirty-nine.

                        ALEX
            Remember the gate number?

As Clear takes a moment to consider, Alex steers them well around the scaffolds, eyes skyward during the move...

                        CLEAR
            No.

                        ALEX
            Thirty-nine.

This is a creepy fact. Even though past the construction, Alex checks over his shoulder to assure they are out of harm's way.

                        ALEX
            Remember the departure time?

                        CLEAR
            Like... 4:25.

Reaching an intersection, Alex pushes the pedestrian traffic light button, then steps well away from the curb.

PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL

the halting red hand is lit.

                        ALEX (V.O.)
            Do you know when I was born?

INTERSECTION

Clear sighs, growing impatient with Alex.

                         CLEAR
            4:25.

                         ALEX
            Right. April 25th.

                         CLEAR
            Wait. I thought you meant the time
            of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as
            in, month and day... that's a reach.

PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL

the halting red hand turns to the little white walking man.

INTERSECTION

Clear takes a step off the sidewalk and onto the street. Alex tugs her back, looking both ways while outraged by her challenge.

                        ALEX
            My birthday is the same as of the 
		time I was meant to die! That's a 
		reach!?

VROOM! A car indeed makes a right, TEARING through the intersection. Once past, Alex takes Clear by the arm and hustles them across the street.

                        CLEAR
            You're sounding like those people
            who, you know... "Oswald shot 
		Kennedy from a warehouse and hid in 
		a theatre and Booth shot Lincoln in 
		a theatre and hid in a warehouse."

CAMERA HOLDS REVEALING an unmarked sedan parked across and down from a Starbucks with outdoor seating. Schreck and Weine sit in the car, eyes coolly locked on Alex and Clear.

DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST

Billy Hitchcock rides toward the Starbucks on his bicycle.

EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

sitting outside, Alex hunches over the table, increasingly anxious. Clear listens; expression skeptical.

                        ALEX
            I'm not just layin' down a bunch
            of math here, with this. I'm talking
            about indications... omens... that
            day, that we were meant to die. That,
            if, we have been aware of... would 
		have saved everyone on the plane.

                        CLEAR
            That's total bullshit. You can find
            death omens anywhere you want to.

She picks up her paper coffee cup.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            Hey, look! "Coffee" starts with a 
		"C" and ends with an "E." So does 
		the word "choke!" We're going to 
		choke to death! Oh no! Starbuck was 
		a whaler. We're going to be 
		harpooned!

Alex angrily glares at Clear. Clear drops her tone.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            You'll go nuts if you start with
            that shit.

Ms. Lewton appears from around the corner. She starts toward the entrance, but pauses, tensing when she sees Alex.

He cautiously flashes a greeting smile. The teacher, however, averts her eyes and continues into the coffee shop. Alex sighs, guiltily. Clear sympathizes with both of them.

                        CLEAR
            She's leaving the school. Moving 
		away.

Alex studies, appealing to her...

                        ALEX
            Clear, how do we know that by
            just sitting here, breathing this
            air or sipping the coffee, having
            crossed the street... we haven't 
		started in motion the events that 
		will lead to our death? Fifty years 
		from now. Ten years. Tomorrow.
                 (beat)
            You don't unless... you're able to 
		open yourself to the signs I'm 
		willing to show you.

He leans foward, removing a peice of paper from his pocket.

CLOSE - ALEX'S HAND

slides across the table. Opening his hand REVEALS the piece of paper reading, "... Tod..." Clear's hand ENTER'S FRAME to take the paper. CAMERA FOLLOWS AS SHE raises it, her expression obviously puzzled. As she eyes Alex for an explanation, CAMERA CRANES DOWN QUICKLY to the empty paper cups on the table...

... a slight approaching BREEZE knocks them over.

DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST

A somewhat cherry 70's muscle car speeds in the direction of the Starbucks. Carter Horton is driving. Terry Chaney rides shotgun. Carter looks out the window.

CARTER'S POV - MOVING - ALEX AND CLEAR

She holds the paper as Alex, apparently, explains the story.

CARTER'S CAR

CARTER scowls, his anger rising as he slows, staring at the perceived reasons for his problems.

ALEX AND CLEAR

Her eyes turn from the paper to Alex, concerned about him...

                        CLEAR
            I don't understand... did you see 
		Tod die? Did it happen again, like 		on the plane?

                        ALEX
            No, but it might as well be the
            same thing. This was a message...
            from someone, or something...
            hinting... at the design.

                        CLEAR
            Alex, on the plane... you must have 
		experienced... some kind of hyper 
		awareness. But here... you're
            suggesting Tod's death... and maybe
            our own... will happen because of...
            an active Presence.

Alex nods, feeling she's understanding.

                        ALEX
            The mortician said Death has a 
		design. Now... if you, me, Tod, 
		Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton 
		messed up that design, because, for 
		whatever reason, I was able to see 
		Death's plan... then we cheated it.
                  (beat)
            But what if it was our time, what if 
		we were not meant to get off that 
		plane? What if it is still is our 
		time? If... It... is still not 
		finished with us? We will all still 
		die; now, not later.

Troubled and deeply concerned, Clear studies Alex.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            Unless... we find the pattern. And 
		cheat it again.

Clear sets the paper down, looking sadly at Alex.

                        CLEAR
            After hearing you, just now... I do 
		believe...
				
Alex leans back and sighs, relieved...

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            ...that Tod killed himself.

Alex is taken aback, hurt and angry.

                        ALEX
            Then there's no one left who can help 
		me.

CARTER'S CAR

His eyes having never left Alex, Carter suddenly cranks the wheel hard to the left to make a tight U-Turn.

BILLY HITCHCOCK

rides his bike. He reacts, startled by...

BILLY HITCHCOCK'S POV - CARTER'S CAR

barreling down towards him. The car cuts in front of the bicycle to complete the U-Turn.

WIDER

Billy SWERVES to the left, directly in front of an oncoming car. The car SWERVES right, as does Billy, avoiding a certain fatal collision for the cyclist. The oncoming car HONKS!

Carter's car pulls up to the curb. Oblivious to the accident he almost caused, Carter gets out, strutting toward the tables outside the coffee shop. Inside the car, Terry sighs...

                        TERRY
            Baby, come on... not now.

But her boyfriend continues. She gets out and hustles after him.

ALEX AND CLEAR

Their attention drawn by the commotion, Clear and Alex watch Carter Horton approach them, followed by Terry, who stops, irked, near the curb at the crosswalk.

                        TERRY
            Carter...

At that moment, Ms. Lewton exits with an ezpresso drink. Sensing trouble, she has no energy or desire to involve herself.

                        CARTER
            Kind of have a reunion, here.

                        TERRY
            Let it go!

Carter steps before Ms. Lewton, blocking her exit...

                        CARTER
            When are you moving?

                        MS. LEWTON
            A couple of weeks.

She can't wait to leave. While trying to walk around Carter...

                        CARTER
            We're losing our favorite teacher.

                        ALEX
            Look, there's something you should
            all know.

                        CLEAR
            Alex...

Carter eyes Alex, continuing the taunt. He raises the volume of his words to drown out Alex's words and incite conflict.

            CARTER (CONT'D)              ALEX (CONT'D)
Lived here her whole life.        This'll be hard to believe.

Ms. Lewton's eyes flash to Alex, afraid of him.

            CARTER (CONT'D)               ALEX (CONT'D)
And now she has to move.          Listen to me, we may all
All because of Browning.          be in danger...

                        TERRY
            Shut up! The both of you!

The two boys stop their heated exchange.

                        TERRY (CONT'D)
            They died! We lived!
                   (beat)
            Get over it! I won't let that plane
            crash be the most important thing in 
		my life. I'm moving on, Carter, and 
		if you're gonna waste your life 
		beating the shit out of Alex 
		everytime you see him, then you can 
		just drop fucking dead!

Head and shoulders remaining angrily in Carter's direction, Terry takes a blind step off the curb and into the crosswalk, WITHOUT A CUT... a bus suddenly speeds INTO FRAME and, THUD! plows directly right into her...

ALEX, CLEAR, CARTER AND MS. LEWTON

are SPLATTERED with BLOOD before they can even recoil.

ALEX

has crashed, watching CNN. It's a tense recline. Red circles rim the lids of his eyes. He sips from the glass to settle his stomach. Ken appears from the kitchen, hand over the reciever.

                        KEN
            It's that girl... Clear.

No response from Alex. Ken sighs, then into the phone...

                        KEN
            He's in the shower, Clear. Can I 
		have him get back at ya? Sure...

Ken returns to the living room, concerned about his son. Alex averts his eyes, stressed and ashamed. Ken sits nearby.

                        KEN (CONT'D)
            She's concerned about you.
                  (beat)
            I'm concerned about you.

Alex turns his eyes to the glass.

                        KEN (CONT'D)
            Why don't you want to talk to her...
            or me?

                        ALEX
            Dad... you and mom have helped me
            out, so much. But there's... some
            things I need to understand before
            I can talk... to anyone about it.

The father respects this young man's wishes. Ken nods "fair enough." In the silent moment, O.S., from the television...

                        CNN ANCHOR (O.S.)
            The National Transportation Safety
            Board has a new theory tonight on the
            possible cause of Euro-Air Flight 180...

Alex quickly grabs the remote and turns up the VOLUME...

Alex remains riveted to the screen.

            ... may have ignited the fuel line. And
            proceeded to the fuel pump.

TELEVISION

The high-tech computer image traces the path of the explosion through the plane. A red line representing the fuel line zigs through the body of the plane, making a sharp turn forward to the fuel pump, which explodes. Jagged lines show the direction of the explosion moving backwards toward the rear of the plane.

drawn in Alex's hand, and hundreds of steps down from CNN computer image, yet accurate as Alex's finger traces the path, away from the seats marked "ME" and "CLEAR." The path starts over "TOD," then moves to "TERRY." The line moves forward away from "CARTER" toward the fuel pump.

The corresponding jagged picture of the explosion back is reminiscent of the "hand of Death," seen earlier in the lightning. It is a graphic demonsration of the arbitrary nature of Death.

ALEX

is amped, intensely more frightened as he believes...

                        ALEX
            The path of the explosion...

Alex's finger quickly moves along the fuel line. After "TERRY," the seat intersecting the path of the fule line, over the fuel pump, is marked "MS. LEWTON."

Moving boxes are stacked in the living room; organized disarray of 
relocating. The house is old, been in the family forever. Dust marks the walls where framed photos and artwork were once displayed.

                        MS. LEWTON (CONT'D)
            Everything here reminds me... of

Alex has moved closer to her house, remaining in the shadows. He checks for any passers-by. Being sure there are none, he creeps toward Ms. Lewton's car. He visually inspects the exterior. As he kicks the tires... an unmarked sedan SCREECHES up. Doors open...

Startled, Alex turns to find...

Special agents Schreck and Weine standing in the street, backlit in the strong headlights of their car.

                        SCHRECK

Then...

The curtains billow as if blown by a breeze. Ms. Lewton appears puzzled as she moves the curtains aside to find the windows closed. As CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HER, tensing and uneasy...

Ms. Lewton moves to a closet door, opens it and CLICKS on an overhead light.

                        MS. LEWTON
            Oh... mom's favorite.

She slides a vinyl record album out of the sleeve and moves to the turntable on a shelf, thick with dust.

Valerie places the record on the stereo and sets the needle on the album. CAMERA SWEEPS IN CLOSE TO THE TURNTABLE, although spinning around and around... the bold letters of the center label can be read... JOHN DENVER... the opening acoustic guitar of "Rocky Mountain High" has never sounded so eerie...

            I didn't ask for what happened to me
            on the plane. You can make fun of me.

held in a wooden block, sits atop the kitchen counter.

In the b.g., Valerie removes the chrome teapot from the stove and moves it to the sink. JOHN DENVER CONTINUES in the next room. Ms. Lewton turns on the faucet, pours water into the kettle. Some water spills on the side of the kettle. As she wipes the pot with a blue checked hand towel, a dark shadow appears to cross behind her.

Lewton turns. CAMERA FOLLOWS, CIRCLING as she looks about the room only to find she is alone. Unsetteled, she absently tosses the towel on the counter the edge which, catches a knife blade held in the cutery block.

STOVE

Ms. Lewton turns on the gas, adjusts it, however... the flames blow out. She pauses, nerves on edge. Her eyes cautiously move about the room and find nothing. She grabs a pack of nearby matches and strikes one.

            Alex, you got our attention, at
            first, because you were under
            suspicion in the plane explosion.

Alex tenses, but Weine shakes his head.

                        WEINE (CONT'D)
            I know you didn't blow up that plane.

Alex sighs, eases.

                        WEINE (CONT'D)
            I don't believe you have magical 
		powers. No one has any... control 
		over life and death... unless...

		causing death.

Weine leans forward toward Alex...

                        WEINE (CONT'D)
            Alex... can you promise me that 
      	no one else will die?

                        ALEX
            No... I can't. As long as I'm in 
		here, it's outta my control.

The agents are taken aback by his answer; unnerved by his sincerity. Weine sighs and looks to his partner, who sighs, frustrated and turns away.

                        WEINE
            Alright, go on. Get outta here.

Alex stands and, with no urgency, moves off. He exits the room.

                        SCHRECK
            Kid gives me the creeps.

On a reflex, she spins toward the sink and throws the hot contents into the drain. She sits the mug down...

A COFFEE MUG

ENTERS FRAME... displaying the logo of the Mt. Abraham Fighting Colonials.

MS. LEWTON

Trembling. She takes a deep breath, getting a hold of herself.

Opening the refrigerator frezzer, she grabs some ice and a bottle of pure Polish Vodka then deliberately turns back toward the same mug...

COFFEE MUG

the ice cubes PLUNK. The cold alchohol pours into the hot mug. CAMERA PUSHES INTO THE MUG as... it slightly CRACKS, Vodka dripping out of the base.

Lewton's hand picks up the mug, oblivious to the crack. She moves off toward the living room, leaving a trail of alcohol.

her back is to the desk, while pouring styrofoam peanuts into the box. In the b.g., FLAMES, nearly supernaturally, leap up the walland toward the computer monitor.

the interior catches fire, causing an electrical POP!

MS. LEWTON

MS. LEWTON

a large jagged shard from the monitor flies into her throat. Blood squirts from her neck onto the bubble wrap. Her stunned expression is sickeningly numb from shock.

INT. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - MS. LEWTON

DROPS INTO FRAME ON HER KITCHEN FLOOR, hair and sweatshirt aflame. She desperately rolls on the floor and manages to extinguish the flames.

LEWTON'S POV - (LOOKING UP) - THE HAND TOWEL

the lower third of the towel dangles over the edge of the counter top. Her hand grabs it, and pulls.

Her hand trembling, her expression horrified, Lewton grabs the handle of the largest blade, trying to pull it out. Alex quickly kneels next to her. She looks at him, in shock, her eyes pleading. Alex gathers his courage, places his hand on the handle of the largest blade. As he's about to remove it...

the block lands directly on the butcher knife handle, driving the blade further into Ms. Lewton's body.

            Ms. Lewton!

Flames leap from the stove to the curtains, which catch fire.

Alex grabs the knife and pulls it out. He quickly removes another and another... yet there is no reaction from the woman.

Knowing she is dead, Alex pauses with guilt. He looks at the knife in his hand, then realizes how incriminating this could appear. In that moment, another small EXPLOSION from the stove brings Alex quickly to his feet. He drops the knife to the floor and races from the house. CAMERA TILTS DOWN to the shoe prints left in the pool of blood.

She studies the men before averting her eyes.

                        CLEAR
            Because I didn't believe him.

The agents study her. Weine accepts the explanation. Schreck's eyes take a walk around the artwork in the garage, pausing on a piece of twisted metal from the crash. Clear tenses, however...

The waves are small bur rhythmic, an enternal metronome. Numb, Alex Browning sits in the sand searching for an answer somewhere in the darkness of the evening sea.

Behind him, O.S., approaching in the sand, SOFT FOOTSTEPS. He listens, notes them. Yet rather than turn around... he looks up into the sky.

ALEX'S POV - THE SKY

The shoreline lights cast an orange haze on the stars, breaking through, infinitely above.

                        ALEX (O.S.)
            Are they up there?

Clear Rivers approaches, barefoot in the sand. He neddn't turn to know who is behind him.

            Somehow... is 180 still in flight?
            Somewhere... are they still safe?

Clear hasn't met eyes with Alex, but she sits nearby, looking into the sky.
                        CLEAR
            When I was a kid, like, six or 
		seven... I used to worry so much

                  (beat)
            Every night... it seemed.

She looks out at the stars. He doesn't eye her, either...

                        ALEX
            Most kids do, I guess.

                        CLEAR
            Most kids never have it happen.

Alex hangs his head...

                        CLEAR
            When I was ten... my dad went into a
            7-11 for cigerettes. I guess he heard
            somebody say "Don't turn around." So 
		on reflex, or thinkin' a friend was 
		jokin'... he did. And the guy blew 
		his head off.

She has lived this so many times, she is long beyond crying...

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            And, let me tell ya, I had every 
		reason to worry before... because 
		life became shit. I don't blame her, 
		I guess, but my mom couldn't deal 
		with it at all. She married this 
		asshole, who my mom with my real 
		dad would cross the street to avoid 
		this guy. He really didn't want a 
		kid. And so my mom didn't either 
		anymore, I guess.
                  (beat)
            If that was the design for my 
		father... and my family... then fuck 
		Death, FUCK IT!

The waves continue to shore. Clear looks up at the sky.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            And so, anyway... I've thought of 
		that "somewhere," Alex. It exists, 
		that place.

He looks at her.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            Where my dad is still safe. Where he 
		had a full pack of cigerettes and 
		kept driving. A place where me and 
		my dad and my mom... are still 
		together....and have no idea about
            this second life, here.
                  (beat)
            A place where our friends are still
		in the sky... where everyone gets a 
		second chance.

She looks at him...

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            But that place might only exist in 
		my heart. And maybe, now... yours. I 
		haven't experienced too many second 
		chances in my life. I haven't seen 
		any. But because of all of this, I 
		believe... because of you... I will 
		get a second chance. Because of me, 
		you will. With you in my life... that 
		place, right now existing in our 
		hearts, will spring out... and become 
		a real part of this life.

Alex looks within her, as a soft ocean breeze blows through Clear's hair.

                        CLEAR
            And that is the only way we can beat 
		Death... by making something special 
		out of Life.

His eyes well with tears. Only as she looks at Alex does Clear become emotional... they move closer, and kiss, the desire for each other, to defy the events around them; darkness; the isolation...

They dive into a deep feverish kiss. Embracing, as if the tighter, the safer. She pulls him back down to the beach and lifts his shirt over his head.

                        ALEX
            This won't be safe.

Clear looks down the beach, checking for any sight of Billy and Carter.

                        CLEAR
      	Those guys are probably fifteen 
		minutes away.

                        ALEX
            No.. I mean, I don't have anything 
		on me. This won't be safe.

                        CLEAR
                  (sadly)
            Nothing is... anymore.

Alex looks to Clear, then kisses her with passion that reflects the defiance of death. He pulls open her shirt and falls into her arms. CAMERA CRANES UP as the young man and woman make love in the sand... consciously and defiantly oblivious, to anything around them... including the stars, possibly Flight 180, up above.

Carter drives. Billy rides shotgun. Alex and Clear are in the back. Everyone anxious, looking for cops.

                        ALEX
            I can't go home. After Lewton's,
            they'll be after me.

                        CLEAR
            We're takin' you to a cabin in the
            woods, it's only a couple miles from
            my house.
                  (to Carter)
             Keep off the highways, they'll be 
		lookin' for us.

Carter, however, continually glances into the rearview mirror, checking Alex. Finally, hotheaded and unable to withhold it any further...

                        CARTER
            Alright, Browning, you fuckin' 
		warlock... did you know about Ms. 
		Lewton, or what?

                        ALEX
            Why do you think I was hiding?

                        CLEAR
            Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you 
		runnin' away from her house.

                        ALEX
            They blame me for everything. Her, 
		Tod, the plane crash...

                        BILLY
            Your shoe prints were in the blood. 
		Your fingerprints on the knives...

                        ALEX
            I already told you...

                        CARTER
                  (interrupting)
            I'm not talkin' about if you did it.
            Or if you knew she was dead...
                  (beat)
            Did you know she was going to be 
		next... before she was?

Alex looks at Clear, her expression asking the same question...

                        ALEX
                  (quietly)
            Yeah.
                  (almost to himself)
            When she died... at that moment, I
            could tell she saw something... horrible.

The three others turn quiet, considering what it must be...

                        CARTER
            Out of us... who's next to see it?

Alex eyes them... hesitant to respond.

                        BILLY
            Please tell me I'm gonna get to see
            the Jets win the Super Bowl.

                        CARTER
            Me, right? That's why you're not 
		saying.

Billy looks out the window, despondent.

                         BILLY
            Shoulda felt up Tammy in the pool,
            that time...

                         CARTER
                  (to Billy)
            Whatta you whinin' about? He said I'm
            next.

                        CLEAR
            He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.

                        CARTER
            You have a responsibility to tell me.

                        ALEX
            Is knowing going to make it easier? 
		It makes it harder.

                        CARTER
            You get off havin' control over me.
            Let me choose how to deal with it.

                        ALEX
            It doesn't matter who's next...
            we're all on the same list.

The three are silent.

                        CARTER
            Aww, fuck... really?

Carter's expression becomes frightened, but he cannot have this. He counters with an irrational bravado.

                        CARTER
            Then why bother? What's the fuckin'
            point? Terry and me will be back
            together on the other side, so why
            wait any longer?

Carter bares down on the wheel, hits the GAS...

EXT. AN INTERSECTION - NIGHT

The muscle car ROARS past a stop sign.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

The interior bounces as the car clears a dip past the intersection. Alex, Clear, and Billy tenses...

                        CLEAR
            Knock it off!

                        CARTER
            May as well go out under my own
            free will, right?

                        CLEAR
            Not with us in the fuckin' car!

EXT. ANOTHER INTERSECTION - NIGHT

The car GUNS IT through another stop sign.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Every passenger hangs on as the car BOUNCES from the next dip.

              CLEAR                    BILLY
          Stop it!                Hey, c'mon, man...

                        CARTER
            What's your fuckin' worry? If it's 
		not your time...? I could get nailed
		runnin' this red light and you all
            wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?

              ALEX                           CLEAR
         No!                           Knock it off!

EXT. TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Red light. A car approaches with the greenlighted right of way. Carter's car TEARS INTO FRAME, just missing being T-boned in the intersection as the other car HITS THE BRAKES, fishtailing.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

                        BILLY
            And I fuckin' HATED FRENCH CLASS!

             ALEX                            CLEAR
       Carter, stop it, you          Get control of yourself!
       fuckin' maniac!!

                        CARTER
            That's what I'm doin'!

                        CLEAR
            I know what you're doing! It's 
		alright to be scared, Carter. You 
		don't have to prove to us how big 
		your balls are. Not now.

                        CARTER
            I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S 
		TIME! I control my life! I control 
		my death!

                        BILLY
            Watch it! Watch it!

EXT. A SECOND TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Carter barrels through the intersection as a car makes a left turn at the intersection.

TURNING CAR DRIVER'S POV - CARTER'S CAR

flying down the road, appears to be heading straight towards him.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Carter takes his hands off the wheel and raises them in the air, like a terrorized child on a roller coaster...

EXT. A SECOND TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION - NIGHT

The turning car HONKS, ROARING through the intersection as Carter's car nearly clips the rear end of the turning car.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Cater hooks his elbow on the window and his right arm around the front seat, driving; no hands.

                  CLEAR                   ALEX
            Stop the car!              Let us out!

                        BILLY
            I am... so close to puking, you
            don't wanna know.

                        CLEAR
            We're afraid, too, Carter, but we're 
		not going to quit. Maybe you are. You
		act like you're not, but you are!

Carter eyes Clear in the rearview mirror.

                        CLEAR
            So, stop what you're doing and STOP
            THIS CAR! Right fucking now!

EXT. BACKSTREET - NIGHT

In the backseat, Alex and Clear ease... just as a railroad crossing arm drops INTO FRAME in the REAR WINDOW. O.S., the CLANG CLANG CLANG of a RAILROAD CROSSING ALARM.

OUT OF THE FRONT WINDOW

The front crossing arm drops INTO FRAME before the car. Carter turns and flashes a "that's why I stopped" smile.

INSIDE THE CAR

                        CLEAR
            Move it!

Carter turns off the engine, then sits back into his seat and folds his arms, indicating he has no intention of moving.

                        ALEX
            Billy, get out!

Scared to death, Billy fumbles with the car door handle. From the front passenger seat, he looks up and to his left...

OUT OF THE DRIVER'S WINDOW - BILLY'S POV

A locomotive headlight arcs across the trees... approaching.

RETURN

                 CLEAR                          ALEX
        Can't you open the door?!      Easy, Billy, just open it.

Billy collects himself...

CLOSE - BILLY'S DOOR HANDLE

POPS open!

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

The train appears around the blind bend...

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Billy opens the door and pours out. Clear and Alex are quickly behind him. Carter remains in the drivers seat.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

The train WARNING WHISTLE BLOWS as Alex, Clear and Billy hustle away from the car, on the same side of the tracks. They quickly turn around, desperate to convince...

                        CLEAR
                  Carter, get out!

           ALEX                         BILLY
    Don't do it! Don't do it!      It's coming! It's coming!

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Arms crossed, Carter remains in the front seat. As the interior fills with light from the headlight of the oncoming train, Carter turns and looks at them with a smart ass smile, pleased that he's shown how brave he truly is. With a beam of cocky definace...

                        CARTER
            It ain't my time.

He cooly turns back to the ignition, grabs the key and turns it over... only to be met with the DULL CLACK of a dead engine.

CAMERA SWEEPS INTO HIM AS his EYES FLARE with tension...

CLOSE - IGNITION

he turns it, again and again... nothing.

CARTER

looks up...

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT - CARTER'S POV - THE TRAIN

is moments away.

ALEX, CLEAR AND BILLY

assess the situation...

                     ALEX                         CLEAR
     Get out! Get out of the car!        Get out! Get out of the
     Get out of the fuckin' car!         car!

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

As he turns away from them, Carter sees something in the rearview mirror...

CARTER'S POV - REAR VIEW MIRROR

the passing shadow is darker than any surrounding darkness.

CARTER

as if the image has effected him, he looks to his lap belt and CLACKS the button. He tugs at the restraint, but it will not move. He's strapped in.

He tries to open the door... it won't open. He pulls at the door handle... tugs at the seatbelt... panicked. Horrified, he whips towards the others.

                        CARTER
            I can't get out!

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

Alex, Billy and Clear look at one another, equally frightened...

                        BILLY
            Man, he really is next.

Alex takes off toward...

CARTER'S CAR

Alex hustles around the drivers' side. CAMERA SWEEPS INTO THEM as Alex desperately tries freeing the seatbelt.

THE TRAIN

the WHISTLES SCREAMS!

CLEAR AND BILLY

tense, as the train nears...

ALEX AND CARTER

Alex grabs Carter by the shoulders and strains with all his might to pull the much more muscular kid out of the driver's window.

CLOSE - CARTER'S SEAT BELT

the shadowy presence is reflected by the chrome buckle, however, after it passes... the seat belt begins to TEAR.

ALEX AND CARTER

As CAMERA SWEEPS IN to ALEX and he releases a deep GROAN...

ACROSS THE TRACKS

The train TEARS THROUGH the front end of the muscular car! GLASS and METAL ERUPT as the locomotive THUNDERS THROUGH FRAME.

CLEAR AND BILLY

must turn away from the shower of metal and broken glass.

ALEX AND CARTER

Alex holds Carter by the shirt at the shoulders, dragging him away from the wreckage. The two boys collapse on the road as the trian continues to ROAR PAST...

TRAIN TRACKS

as the heavy train wheels THUNDER and CLACK, a broken two foot long shard of the car's debris BOUNCES upon the tracks, kicked about by the train wheels.

CLEAR AND BILLY

run to the two survivors.

CLEAR

runs and falls into Alex's arms, holding him tight.

ALEX, CLEAR, CARTER AND BILLY

Carter lies on the road, urine stains around his crotch, hyperventilating and near tears.

                        CLEAR
            Scared now?

Carter looks at the piece of seatbelt.

                        CARTER
            It broke!
		
                        BILLY
            No one's that strong.

                        CLEAR
                  (to Carter)
            Bullshit. He saved your life...again!

CLOSE - TRAIN WHEELS

continue to kick around the chunk of twisted metal...

RETURN

The THUNDERING TRAIN intensifies the situation...

                        BILLY
            THAT'S RIGHT! HE'S RIGHT! YOU ARE 
		NEXT! I'M GETTING THE FUCK AWAY FROM 
		YOU!

Billy begins backing away from the others.

                        CARTER
            SHUT UP, BILLY!

                        CLEAR
            WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!

Billy continues backing away, horrified.

                        BILLY
            I DON'T NEED IT EVER! GET AWAY FROM 
		HIM! HE'S NEXT!

CLOSE - TRAIN TRACKS

the debris rattles beneath the wheels...

CARTER AND ALEX

still on the ground...

                        CARTER
            FUCK YOU, BILLY! I'M NOT DEAD!

BILLY

backing away...

                        BILLY
            YOU WILL BE! YOU'RE DEAD! YOU'RE 
		DEAD!

TRAIN TRACKS

the debris bounces directly on the track. With great power and force, a train wheel runs over the debris, cutting it in half. It catches in the wheel and is spun around until shot out with the force of a missile...

BILLY

                        BILLY (CONT'D)
            AND YOU AIN'T TAKIN' ME WITH YOU!

FWOOP! The metal tears ACROSS FRAME, ripping Billy's head from his 
shoulders.

ALEX, CLEAR AND CARTER

The ROAR of the TRAIN seems exaggerated as they are frozen in horrified shock.

EXTREMELY WIDE - ACROSS THE TRACKS

The train CLEARS FRAME and is gone... REVEALING, across the tracks, Alex, Clear and Carter can do nothing but watch Billy's decapitated body macabrely wobbling on its two front feet before falling to the ground.

                        CARTER
            Jesus fucking Christ!

For a beat, there is SILENCE... until, in the distance, SIRENS can be heard, approaching. As Alex stands and Carter manages to rise on wobbly legs... none of them can remove their eyes from Billy's body.

                        ALEX
                  (to Carter)
            You should have been next. After
            Lewton, you should've been next. 
		That's the only pattern. You should 
		be dead.

                        CARTER
            You're the fuckin' devil.

                        ALEX
                  (to Clear)
            But I saved him. I intervened. Just 
		like the plane. That's the design.

                        CLEAR
            Police are coming.

                        ALEX
            That's why It skipped Carter and
            went to the next one in the path
            of the explosion; Billy.

Alex looks at Clear as if expiriencing an intense epiphany.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            My intervention in the death of 180
            surviviors will cheat the design.

                         CARTER
            "Intervention?" What are you, God
             now?!

                          ALEX
            Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to
            die! Gods don't die! We do!

                          CLEAR
            You're losin' it. The police will be
            here. We have to go to the cabin.
            You can hide there. Get your head 
		together.

Alex considers, mind racing... then realizes...

                        ALEX
            After Billy... it's me. And then you.

Clear grabs Clear and touches her face.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
                  (to Clear)
            Hey, I won't let it happen, okay.

Carter turns to them; it's as far as he will go to admit he believes... or will help...

                        CARTER
            Then, get out of here.

As she moves to Alex, Clear nods her acknowledgement and appreciation to Carter. She takes Alex by the hand and the pair begin running away, off into the woods.

In the DISTANCE, a TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS, eerie, as if Death was punctuating the moment.

                                                    CUT TO:

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

The windows are boarded. The front steps are worn and dilapidated. In the early evening moonlight, the dwelling appears eerie and ghostly. CAMERA CREEPS TOWARD the house, a pre-storm breeze swaying branches and blowing leaves. In the distance... LIGHTNING...

INT. CABIN - DAY - A SMALL TABLE

A final piece of duct tape is applied to the corner of the table, dulling any sharp edges. Even though it is sunny outside, all the shades are pulled. The room sits in dark shadows broken by occasional bright shafts of light.

CAMERA FOLLOWS a hand as it carefully picks up a Coleman lantern and sets it atop an empty can placed in the center and above the water line of a large metal tub; a fire protection moat.

ALEX

finds his way to a chair in the center of the room, away from everything except a nearby table holding a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit, both at less than arm's reach.

Unshaven, a week and a half's growth, and unkept, Alex looks horrible. An anxious zombie, especially in the dim glow of the lantern. Dark circles, from lack of sleep. Thin, from lack of food. Pale, from lack of sunlight.

He places workman's gloves on his hands before picking up a can of Underwood chicken spread. With some degree of difficulty, he works the gloves beneath the tab and pulls. Careful not to cut himself, he reaches out and drops the lid into a small trash can.

Alex removes the gloves and, with a plastic spoon, begins to eat. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he begins to chew methodically, chewing and chewing and chewing with concentration until... after steadying himself... prepares to swallow... then, carefully does.

Pause... he's alright. He takes the spoon. Scoops some more. And the process begins again.

                                                      CUT TO:

A pink circle fills THE ENTIRE FRAME.

EXTREMELY CLOSE - CLEAR'S EYES

look downward, anxious and full of thought.

A HOME PREGNANCY TEST

the results are positive, two pink dots, confirming.

WIDER

Clear sighs, frightened as she tosses the test upon a half dozen other discarded tests. You can never be too sure. Outside, WIND of an approaching storm blows. CAMERA tensely INCHES IN ON Clear...

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. CABIN - NIGHT - CRACK BENEATH DOOR

The resulting THUNDER RUMBLES. A breeze blows beneath the door, carrying some Autumn leaves. CAMERA FOLLOWS the breeze across the floor to Alex's pant legs which slightly flutter.

CAMERA RISES TO ALEX, sitting in his safe chair. Paranoid and obsessively cautious, his eyes move towards the door, anticipating the consequential events. Following the path of the breeze, Alex turns around...

ALEX'S POV - TRASH BAG

the brown shopping bag tips over. Amongst the trash spread on the floor, a can rolls out and across the floor.

ALEX

tenses. He doesn't look to where the can has been, but where it is going.

ALEX'S POV - CAN

rolls across the floor and gently hits the end of a fishing pole, propped in the corner. The pole teeters and falls over.

FISHING HOOK

falls, hooking a closet door. The door begins to swing open.

ALEX

is quickly out of his safe chair, hustling towards...

THE DOOR

Alex slams the door shut before it can open. Behind the door, a CRASH as something falls. Alex cracks a wicked half smile, cocky he has caught Death before this attempt has brought to fruition.

Alex removes the hook from the door and places the pole on the floor. He cautiously opens the door, REVEALING an old fish scaling knife embedded on the back side of the door, unaware. Removing the knife and securing it, his eyes turn towards the floor.

CLOSET FLOOR

a tackle box has spilled thick, rusted old treble and aberdeen fishing hooks upon the floor. Alex bends down and examines them.

                        ALEX
                  (as if to Death)
            Rusted. Tetanus. Nice touch.
                  (defiant)
            I overlooked it. You tried to
            capitalize. But I caught you,
            you fuck. I can beat you. Not
            forever, but I got this cabin
            rigged to beat you NOW!

O.S., a sound. Like a THUMP near the cabin steps. He freezes, like an animal sensing danger. THUNDER RUMBLES. The light around him begins to flicker and sway.

COLEMAN LANTERN

a draft creeps beneath the glass enclosure. The flame, dancing.

INT. BEDROOM - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - DAY

Distant... APPROACHING THUNDER RUMBLES as she steps away. The weight of the world on her shoulders, Clear paces, considering her options. She looks to a bookshelf...

CLOSE - AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH

A man, early thirties, holds a six year old girl in his arms, waving at the camera. Both appear happy and alive. They are standing before the cabin surrounded by the thick woods.

The photograph is turned over. On the back is marked in a young girl's handwriting, "me and dad at the cabin. 1986."

CLEAR

As CAMERA PUSHES INTO HER... considering life. Then, now and what is to come.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

Weine sits in the passenger seat looking through the pair of binoculars. Schreck is behind the wheel.

                        WEINE
            She was up there a minute ago...

A figure steps into the drivers side window, from the rear. The two agents are startled as Clear Rivers leans into FRAME. She pauses, gauging their trustworthiness, then...

                        CLEAR
            I'm not turning him in. There's
            another life that needs him now.

The two agents remain respectful...

                        CLEAR
            I go with you.

                        WEINE
            You can't.

She considers... and understands.

                        CLEAR
            Don't hurt him.

                        WEINE
            Tell us where he is. Wait at home, 
		and I promise... we'll bring him 
		back safe, in protective custody.

As she senses the agents' sincerity...

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

Distant THUNDER ECHOES. Alex kindles a fire in the fireplace, balling up old newspapers. He begins to crumble the local news... then pauses.

A headline catches his attention. CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM, tense, while THUNDER RUMBLES. As he unrolls the paper, his expression is rocked... anxious... he cocks his head to consider... recalling... as CAMERA PUSHES ALL THE WAY INTO...

HEADLINE - CRUMPLED NEWSPAPER

"PARENTS TO ESTABLISH MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIPS." Besides the headline are two yearbook photos; Christa Marsh and Blake Dreyer.

ALEX

his expression reflects a terrifying revelation...

                        ALEX
            I... never moved. Christa asked
            me to move, but I didn't change
            seats. I would've moved up...
            next to Tod... How could I not
            remember... that... I never
            moved. Clear's seat was in front
            of mine...

CAMERA PUSHES into a TIGHT CLOSE UP...

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear paces in her living room. She moves to the curtains and checks out the window. Although it is not raining, LIGHTNING CRACKS across the sky!

EXT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - POWER LINE

The lightning STRIKES the top of the pole, SNAPPING two power lines, which whip in the wind.

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The power goes out. The room turns dark. Outside, brilliant bluish white arc lights CRACKLE. Clear moves to the window.

EXT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLEAR'S POV - POWER LINES

ARC violently striking the ground and each other. Each line whips 
unpredictably like an uncontrolled garden hose with the water turned on full. And yet, there's a mean, angry and taunting personality to the two power lines. As if Death were within them.

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

She assesses the situation and moves to a pair of candles on the mantle, lightning them with a Bic. O.S., from the backyard, a DOG BARKS. Clear brings the candle through the small house.

INT. KITCHEN - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear moves quickly to the kitchen, holding the candle. Outside, BLUE ARC LIGHT CRACKLES. She looks out the backyard.

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLEAR'S POV

An old circular clothesline turns like a pinwheel in the wind. In the center of the yard is an oblong, tarped above ground pool. In the furthest corner of the yard, her dog is chained to a tree, BARKING AND FREAKED OUT. An old tire swing rocks in the storm. From the manner in which the house is situated and the length of the snapped power lines, one is capable of reaching the backyard.

The power line STRIKES the ground, "closing in on" the dog.

INT. KITCHEN - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear considers the danger of venturing out to get the dog.

Although no window is open, and the power outage has shut off any air conditioning... the candle flame whips, then extinguishes. The blue smoke swirls ominously into the room.

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOTHESLINE

Sharp metal edges spin. Glinting blue arc light...

Alex charges out the front door, leaping over the steps. O.S., SEVERAL CARS APPROACH, headlights pan across the trees. Alex stops dead in his tracks and runs off into the woods, just as the F.B.I umarked sedan and three Sheriff 4x4s THUNDER up to the cabin, siren lights swirling.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

Weine is driving, leading the other vehicles. Schreck points out the passenger window.

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - WEINE'S POV - THROUGH CAR WINDOW

Full sprint, Alex disappears into the dark forest.

WIDER

the cars BRAKE to a stop, SKIDDING in the dirt. Sheriffs leap out of their vehicles. High powered flashlights shoot beams in Alex's direction. The officers take after the suspect.

The backdoor opens. Clear charges out into the backyard.

THE DOG

Helpless, chain wrapped around the tree. THUNDER RUMBLES.

CLEAR

continues to run...

THE CIRCULAR CLOTHESLINE

is whipped by a power line. SPARKS FLY as the base pole snaps in two.

CLEAR

the metal poles punge into the ground just before and behind her, inches from impaling her. She stumbles, but quickly steps aside and continues toward the tree.

THE CIRCULAR CLOTHES-LINE FRAME

is rolled by the winds, across the yard toward...

ABOVE GROUND POOL

the clothesline frame punctures the pool. Water streams from the rupture.

CLEAR

reaches the tree and begins unfastening the dog's collar from the chain.

CAMERA MOVES WITH Alex, blindly running through the forest, sheriffs' flashlight beams crossing behind him... in pursuit.

Looing back to check the postition of the agents, Alex blindly runs over the lip of a downward slope...

GULLY

He rolls and tumbles uncontrollably down the hillside. As he nears the base...

ALEX

stops with a CRUNCHING THUD... his face an inch from being impaled by a sharp, thick protruding branch. No time to catch his breath, he's up and running.

water floods, pooling the backyard, cascading over Clear's feet. She looks down, in the reflection of the puddle, the dark shadow passes. Clear whips up, checking the position of...

coils, like a cobra, ready to STRIKE!

TREE

Clear drops the chain and hits the dog on its backside.

                        CLEAR
            Run!

The dog starts to tear off toward the house. Clear runs toward the hanging tire. Leaps...

THE POWER LINE

whips, the frayed wires hitting the puddle of water...

CLEAR

in mid-air, desperately grabs the tire, hanging on, literally for her life. O.S., the dog YELPS. Clear turns back...

CLEAR'S POV - THE DOG

convulses in the small pool of water, burning from the overwhelming amounts of electricity.

Distant flashlights reflect in a small stream, barely two inches deep. Alex's foot splashes in the water. THUNDER RUMBLES.

ALEX

races along the path of the stream.

SHERIFFS

continue their pursuit through the dark trees.

ABOVE

Lightning CRACKS a tree branch.  SPARKS FLY! The tree tumbles down the branches.

ALEX

The thick branch falls from above, landing on top of him. He's knocked to the ground and pinned... face down in the creek.

CAMERA MOVES IN... his nose and mouth, just below the water line, but he cannot move. His eyes flash with panic, as he struggles... battles to move and avoid drowning in two inches of water.

As he struggles in the f.g., Weine and a pair of Sheriffs appear ten yards beyond him. They pause, confused, panning their flashlights across the forest.

WIENE'S POV - FOREST

the lights actually expose the area where Alex lies. From their postition, however, he is covered by the branch and out of sight.

ALEX

struggles to raise his head above the water, chest bursting...

WEINE AND SHERIFFS

believing Alex is not in the area, move ahead into the woods.

dart open. Taking a tenth of a second to gather all of his strength, all his courage, he arches his back, pushing with his hands, anything to lift his face out of the stream.

With a DEEP GASP, he does so. Drinking up the air. It appears to infuse him with another blast of adrenaline as he manages to push with his arms and free himself from the pinning tree branch.

He pauses only for a couple gulps of air... and is off.

Clear leaps from the end of the branch to her window, grabbing the sill awkwardly, she dangles outside the house. With a breath, she pulls herself inside, just as the power line bites, ARCING, at her feet.

ALEX

lurches back...

THE STREAM OF TURPINTINE

is ignited by a single spark fom the power line. It flows toward the car.

ALEX

backs away, eyes locked with Clear's, assuring she's remaining in the car.

CLEAR

keeps her eyes locked on Alex, watching him. Suddenly, a BURST OF FIRE FLASHES FROM BELOW FRAME...

ALEX

reacts, shocked. He realizes...

WIDER

the underbelly of the Corolla has ignited from the stream of combustible fluid.

SCHRECK AND WEINE

step forward...

THE POWER LINE

IN THE COROLLA

Clear can see the flames, her instinct is to grab the handle to get out.

CLEAR'S POV - GARAGE WALL

The fire roars angrily in the f.g., on the garage wall, however, the shadows do not match that of the flames, rather, the approaching form of Death appears.

ALEX

steps closer...

At that moment, Clear doesn't understand. She looks to him, scared...

                        ALEX
            You know what to do. I'll always be 
		with you.

He reaches out and grabs the power line, falling back to pull it away from the hood of the car. The cable ARCS furiously.

COROLLA

Clear opens the driver's side door and runs out, knocked to her feet as behind her the car EXPLODES.

ALEX

SCHRECK AND WEINE

CAMERA EASES IN on the agents, exchanging rattled expressions that convey their unease in the proof that Alex was right.

            We beat it, Alex.

Cleaned and wrapped in a swaddling blanket, the baby is placed in the mothers arms. The long retrospective harmonica of Neil Young's "Long May You Run" reprises as Clear looks at the I.D. braclet...

WRIST BRACLET

"Alexander Chance Browning II."

DELIVERY ROOM

CAMERA PULLS BACK. The birthing room is quiet; the people introspective. The doctors. The family. The mother and child. A room of new life, in which, each recalls a life lost.
