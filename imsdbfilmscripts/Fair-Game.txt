                    So I take it you're not a nuclear
                    expert. These tubes are an EXACT
                    match for those developed by German
                    scientist Gernot Zippe in the 50s.

                    You're right. I'm no nuclear
                    expert. But Dr. Houston Wood, at
                    Virginia U atomic facility is. He
                    also knows Dr Zippe, who's 89 and
                    lives in Austria, and he told him
                    that the wall thickness of the
                    Iraqi tubes was three or four times
                    the thickness of his design.
          
                              PAUL
                    And the tubes are twice as long as
                    Zippe's design. In fact the only
                    similarity between his tubes and
                    the alumumium tubes is that they're
                    made of aluminium.

                    Does Saddam pose an imminent threat
                    to National Security?
          
                              JOE
                    I haven't seen the intelligence.
                    I'm not qualified to comment. We
                    have intelligence services working
                    hard to assess just this. But I
                    have met Saddam. I've looked him in
                    the eye, so I can tell you what I
                    saw. During a particularly vicious
                    period of bloodletting in the late
                    eighties, Saddam was asked by his
                    foreign minister why he had
                    executed a certain official who had
                    been a loyal supporter. He said he
                    would rather kill a friend in error
                    than allow an enemy to live. For
                    me, that is the mark of a monster.

                                MR. FLEISCHER:
                      Look. There's zero, nada, nothing,
                      new here. The President's statement
                      in the State of the Union was much
                      broader than the Niger question.

                      Is the President's statement
                      correct?
          
                                FLEISCHER:
                      Yes, I see nothing that goes
                      broader that would indicate that
                      there was no basis to the
                      President's broader statement. But
                      specifically on the yellow cake,
                      the yellow cake for Niger, we've
                      acknowledged that that information
                      did turn out to be a forgery.

                    Today Special Prosecutor Patrick
                    Fitzgerald, in charge of the
                    enquiry into the leaking of the
                    identity of a covert agent
                    announced that he is convening a
                    Grand Jury to investigate the
                    affair. Among the blizzard of
                    subpoenas issued are ones for the
                    Vice President's chief of Staff
                    Scooter Libby, and special advisor
                    to the President Karl Rove. Both
                    men are under suspicion of having
                    leaked the agent's name to
                    reporters in order to damage former
                    Ambassador Joseph Wilson, a vocal
                    and combative critic of the
                    administration. It is believed that
                    the President himself has been
                    questioned under oath by the FBI.

          INT. HOUSE. NIGHT.
          
          Valerie is alone. In bed. Watching TV. FOX NEWS. Rogers.
          
                              GUEST
                    The question still remains, who is
                    Valerie Plame? Was she really
                    simply a glorified typist?
          
                              ROGERS
                    Well, I think it's really all about
                    the money. We're talking about a
                    third-rate CIA agent who had a
                    government salary, and she had sent
                    her husband to Niger, and he had
                    come back and didn't give the
                    report to the CIA, but he turned it
                    over in an op-ed to The New York
                    Times. So she was already in the
                    hot seat with the CIA, and so now
                    she's all about the money. Plus
                    it's come out that she was
                    considered kind of a mediocre agent
                    at best.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

          INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.
          
          Joe comes into the bedroom to get his pillow. Valerie is
          lying in the bed, turned away. He pauses in the doorway.

                    training to be field officers, they
                    picked four or five of us and told

                    separate cells. They beat us.

                    to do was give up the name of one

                    that too. Those exact same words.
                    July 1972. Your mother and I were
                    fighting all the time. I guess she
                    was just plain tired of moving
                    home. Wasn't `til I retired after
                    42 years in the Air Force, I
                    realised we never had a home.

                    cold airbase outside Anchorage
                    Alaska. You must have been to
                    twenty schools. Twenty different
                    chances to introduce yourself. Be
                    someone new. But you turned out OK.
                    Responsible. A little too serious.
                    Always looking down the road.
                    Worrying where life was going to
                    drag you next. But it made you
                    tough. Real tough. Maybe tougher
