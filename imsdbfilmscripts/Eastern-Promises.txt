1   EXT. A STREET NEAR BRICK LANE - EVENING                       1

    It's 5.30pm in late December and rain is pouring. The
    scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain.
    A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish
    newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional
    barber's shop called Ozim's.

2   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - EVENING                             2

    The shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk)
    is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA).
    Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit
    beneath the barber's gown.

    During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and
    star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands.

    Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters.   Soyka speaks
    with a Russian accent.

              We're Islam!

                          SOYKA
              Oi, how much are you taking off?

              alisverise cimac. The kid's
              sixteen...

    Ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and
    Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet
    near to the door. Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'.

    as well as cold.

                 This is him.     The kid I'm talking
                 about.

    Ekrem approaches, stiffened by terror.       Soyka nods at Ekrem
    in the mirror.

                 He looks OK to me... how you doin'

    as if it were enchanted...

    Ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic
    bottles and hands it to Ekrem, who now looks mortally
    terrified.

    Soyka rises up from the seat, casting off his barber's
    gown. Ozim yells `kabuka! And Ekrem snarls, flicks open
    the razor and drags it across Soyka's throat. Soyka's scream
    bubbles in the blood.

    We dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off
    in the rain, high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road. We
    pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are
    hurrying through the rain. We see a young girl (TATIANA)
    hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown
    with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it. Her hair
    is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop.
    She is barefoot.

    The customer looks at Tatiana's feet and reacts. We see
    blood trickling down her legs. Tatiana looks down, then
    faints onto the floor.

6   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING THEATER - NIGHT                6

    A tiny brown handbag is being shaken empty by a nurse.
    Tatiana is being prepared for an emergency Caesarean. The
    theater is full of people in scrubs, including an
    anesthetist. Monitors and drips are being attached at double
    speed.

    We notice that her arms are already dotted with festering
    needle marks.

    A nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and
    we can hear frantic activity from the operating table....

                             NURSE 1
                 Her stats are very poor, very poor.
                 Baby's very distressed.

    Anna approaches the nurse, who is rummaging through the
    contents of the bag. We see a business card from a
    restaurant called `The Trans-Siberian', a St. Christopher
    necklace and a tiny battered diary. Anna grabs the diary.

    speaks softly.

    All hell is let loose. As the Caesarean process begins at
    frantic speed, we slowly zoom in on Tatiana's unconscious
    face and hear her voice in V.O... a young girl's voice
    speaking with an Russian accent. The crosstalk between
    nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic.

                 My name is Tatiana. My father

                 That is why I left to find a better
                 life.

     The living room table is laid for dinner. Uncle Stepan is
     early seventies, Russian. He is reading the tiny diary
     that Anna found in Tatiana's bag. Anna breezes in.

     Driving music as we see Anna riding her motorbike through
     deserted morning streets again. We should begin to sense
     that this is a kind of release for her. We hear Tatiana

     Anna arrives outside the `Trans-Siberian' restaurant. It
     has a Russian-themed frontage in blue and gold, expensively
     and recently finished.

     As Anna pulls up we hear a dog begin to bark.

13   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY               13

     The side door opens to reveal a hard-looking, handsome
     Russian man (NIKOLAI), who stops to groom his hair back
     from his face and put on a pair of sunglasses as he emerges
     into daylight. He steps into a small courtyard, where a
     fierce Doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of
     a chain.

     Nikolai is followed by KIRILL, who is a little younger,
     slim and pretty but hard-looking too. Kirill is dressed in
     a crumpled T-shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy
     night. Nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but Kirill
     yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few Russian
     curses. Nikolai unbolts the gate to the street.

                              KIRILL
                  So you pick up Ozim and his bitch
                  of a wife and you bring them back
                  here.

     He glances back at the restaurant and speaks softly.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Then I'll think of an excuse and

     Kirill grins and Nikolai flicks the fob of his car keys.
     The lights on an expensive black Mercedes glow in response.
     Kirill notices Anna locking up her bike at the front of
     the restaurant.

     fades. We sense jealousy.

                  Hey, you've got work to do.   Go...

     Kirill grabs Nikolai's face to distract him, gives him a
     playful slap, but there is somehow more to it than
     playfulness. Nikolai gets into his car.

     Kirill glares at Anna as she approaches the front of the
     restaurant.

     As Nikolai drives away, Anna rings the doorbell beside the
     front door. There is no reply. She is about to ring again
     when the door opens. We see SEMYON, a Russian man in his
     late sixties. He is wiping his hands on a tea towel,
     dressed in a spotlessly white apron. He has the sparkling
     piercing eyes of a falcon.

     Inside the kitchen there is an inferno of activity, steam,

     others in chefs' uniforms, are standing over steaming pots,
     laughing, arguing. Children play and yell. You can almost
     smell Christmas. Anna enters, dazzled by it all,

     Nikolai's black Mercedes pulls up outside the restaurant
     and parks a few inches from Anna's motorbike. The rear

     door of the car for an elegantly dressed Turkish lady in
     her fifties. Nikolai goes to the other rear door. The

                  they will be closed until New Year.

     As Anna takes the address, Kirill puts his head around
     the door and yells through the noise.

     Semyon takes a pot from the heat, suddenly flustered.

                  That's OK. I'll probably find out
                  more when I get her diary

     A pause. Semyon disappears into a billow of steam to put
     a pan onto the heat then re-emerges.

     Kirill and Ozim are talking confidentially in a mix of
     Russian and Turkish whispers at a table. Ozim's wife is
     at a table alone, well out of their earshot, smoking a
     cigarette and peeling glazed figs. As Anna walks by, Ozim
     and Kirill stop talking. The scene has a much darker mood
     to the bustling scene in the kitchen, but for now Anna
     feels no unease. As she passes, Kirill surveys her with a
     deadly smile and a professional eye.

     Anna emerges into the daylight. As she does she sees that
     four expensive-looking cars have already parked and various
     ostentatiously dressed Russian and Turkish couples with
     their children are emerging from their cars. The women are
     all wearing furs, even the little girls. The men wear
     leather or dark suits. They greet each other exuberantly
     as they emerge from their cars. Anna suddenly feels
     slightly uneasy. As she approaches her motorbike she sees
     Nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car, smoking,
     still wearing shades. His bumper is almost touching Anna's
     bike.

22A   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -22A
      NIGHT

      In a private room in the Special Care Baby Unit, Anna
      approaches Tatiana's baby's plastic crib. The baby is
      tightly bundled up, sound asleep. Through the windows of
      the room, we see the darkened, quiet ward outside - another
      world.

      Anna stands over the baby, her face full of emotion. There
      we see pain, loss, shame, emptiness, isolation. Tears begin
      to roll from her eyes, and then she is sobbing soundlessly.

23    INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                        23

      The Trans-Siberian restaurant is smoky with cigarettes and
      cigars. The party is in full swing with two dozen guests
      and family. One of the golden-haired children is playing
      violin badly. The language is Russian, English and Turkish
      mixed. Kirill is bringing a huge baked carp to the table.
      His mobile phone rings and he wipes his hands on a towel
      to answer it.

      When he hears the voice, Kirill glances at his father and
      moves quickly out of earshot. Semyon notices but hides
      his concern. As Kirill walks, a child tugs his leg and
      holds up a soft toy, asking a question in Russian.

     The rooms above Ozim's shop have been converted into a
     drinking club. Ozim leads Nikolai and Kirill through the
     debris of the night before. As they walk through, Ekrem
     suddenly leaps out of the darkness with a yell. Kirill
     and Nikolai both react with instinctive aggression.

     from meat hooks. There are knives and skewers around the

     in the bin liner and we see the frost-dusted face of Soyka.

     Nikolai has the body of Soyka laid out on a surface, his
     head still bound up in a bin bag, his lower portions bound
     up similarly. Nikolai is de-frosting Soyka's left hand
     with the hair dryer, concentrating on his ring finger which
     has a gold ring on it. The parts of Soyka's shirt and
     jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood.
     Nikolai is wearing rubber gloves.

     As he dries, Nikolai takes a sip of coffee. Ozim is
     watching this scene with horror. Kirill has his arms
     folded, mightily impressed.

     Finally the hand is thawed enough for Nikolai to remove
     the gold ring. He studies an inscription and then offers
     it to Ozim. Ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a
     contagion. Nikolai shrugs and pockets it. He then turns
     the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the
     crisply bloody chest of Soyka. He tugs at the frozen lapel
     of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket. Within
     a few moments he is able to remove Soyka's glistening,
     thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood. He opens
     it (we glimpse a photo of a wife and children) and blows
     hot air onto the money inside.

     He tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet, all
     stuck together by drops of frozen blood. He offers this
     money to Ozim as well but Ozim shakes his head vigorously.
     Kirill hoots with laughter. Ozim is now staring at Nikolai
     as if he were a devil from hell.

     Nikolai grabs a plastic bag and puts the money inside it,
     then pockets the frozen wad. He tosses the rest of the
     frozen wallet to Ozim, who instinctively catches it.

     Nikolai manages to lift him to his feet again. As they
     head towards the restaurant, Anna emerges. Nikolai looks
     up, curious, as Semyon kisses her on both cheeks in the
     doorway. As she turns Kirill stumbles forwards and collapses
     in front of her. Nikolai looks up at Anna, his face
     splashed with rain.

     Nikolai heaves Kirill into a chair. Semyon is back at his
     novel and watches as Kirill attempts to get to his feet
     and then stumbles to the floor. He slumps down, now
     totally unconscious, breathing deeply. Nikolai smiles.

     Semyon steps up to where Kirill is lying and stands over
     him for a moment. Then he kicks him hard in the guts with
     all his might. Nikolai is shocked, and grabs Semyon's
     arm. A hand laid upon him is like deadly poison. Kirill
     grunts and moans.

      Somewhere within sight of the Thames barrier.

      A dozen policemen and forensic investigators are milling
      round on a shale beach, the icy waters of the Thames lapping
      at their feet.

40A   INT. FORENSIC TENT - MORNING                                  40A

      A large tent has been erected over the body of Soyka. Inside
      the tent two senior police officers await the arrival of a
      third man, a specialist from the Russian desk (YURI), who
      is not dressed for the weather. He has obviously been
      dragged out of bed. He is led to the side of the body.
      One of the officers pulls up the dead man's hand and shows
      him the eagle tattoo.

                            OFFICER
                We think he might be Russian Mafia.

      Yuri studies the tattoo, then borrows a torch. He crouches
      to push up the wet trouser leg on the corpse's right leg.
      When the knee is exposed in torch light we see a small
      star tattooed on the knee cap.

                            YURI
                He is actually a Chechen. He is
                also a member of the vory v zakone.
                The stars on the knees mean he
                would never kneel before anyone.

      Yuri opens the dead man's shirt and we see a tattoo of an
      eight-pointed star on his chest.

     A large portable stereo is playing rock music.

     The curtains are drawn against daylight. The living room
     is decorated in seventies suburban style, but with the
     wall paper peeling and the paint work fading. Kitsch
     paintings still decorate the walls.

     Six young East-European girls are sitting on a broken-down
     sofa and on hard-backed chairs, wearing short skirts. Their
     eyes are sunken and their faces vacant of expression, but
     they are painted with so much make-up they almost look
     like tiny, sad clowns.

     They sit in silence as the music blares out. After a few
     moments a young Albanian man enters and claps his hands.

     Nikolai is fucking the girl, who is now silent.   She is on
     all fours, registering no emotion.

     Kirill is leaning against the wall, drinking wine from the
     bottle, watching Nikolai with burning eyes, his lust and
     drunken jealousy mixing together. Nikolai grits his teeth
     and comes inside the girl. Kirill whoops and whistles and
     begins to applaud.

     The girl is still silent, expressionless.

     Kirill grins and offers the girl an elaborate bow before
     leaving. Finally alone, Nikolai gently helps the girl to
     lie down. She is numb. He covers her up with a blanket
     then begins to pull on his clothes. The girl is staring up
     at the ceiling.

     After a few moments she begins to sing a Russian folk song
     softly under her breath. Nikolai speaks to her softly in

46   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -46
     NIGHT

     In the half-lit private room, Anna is dancing with Christine
     in her arms. She is singing a lullaby softly to her. The
     door is open to the rest of the ward and all the other
     babies are silent.

     Finally she lays a sleeping Christine back in her crib.
     She sits down on the bed where the mother should be. She
     curses herself silently and gets to her feet, determined
     to pull herself together.

     As she starts to leave the private room to enter the ward,
     she is suddenly confronted by Semyon.

     He is standing in the shadows, a Bavarian trilby in his
     hands. Anna gasps with shock. Semyon speaks softly...

     tries to remain detached. Helen also tries hard to

     Silence.   Everyone catches their breath.

                done.

     Stepan heads for the kitchen cupboard and produces a bottle
     of vodka. Rather than admonish him, Anna and Helen both
     nod agreement. Stepan pours three large vodkas. Stepan
     knocks his down. Anna and Helen take sips.

                            HELEN
                And then he would have been

                No! This isn't our world.     We're
                just... ordinary people.

                And that's all he wants?

     Stepan is utterly astounded.

                            STEPAN
                You cannot do deals with these
                people!

                            HELEN
                This isn't a deal.      It's an exchange
                of information.

                            STEPAN

                Stepan, I think he was threatening
                to harm Christine.

                Then it's settled.

     Stepan stares at them both for a long time.   Finally he
     gets to his feet and points to the diary.

     Nikolai pulls up in his car. He checks his look in the
     rear view mirror and puts on his sunglasses. As he gets
     out of the car he notices that Anna's motorbike is still
     there. He approaches it, strokes the bodywork. Suddenly,
     someone grabs him from behind. It's Kirill.

                           KIRILL
               Hey, come on, Nikolai, I've got a
               Christmas present for you.

49   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. BACK DELIVERY AREA - DAY        49

     A white van is parked with its rear doors open, ready for
     unloading. Kirill shows Nikolai that the van is loaded
     with unmarked white boxes.

                              KIRILL
               Open one.

     Nikolai opens one of the boxes and produces a bottle of
     vintage champagne.

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               From France. Old as fuck. Old is
               good with wine. Sixty quid a bottle
               anywhere. Except I got them for
               ten quid a case.

               `From where?' From where you don't

     Kirill snatches the bottle and begins to uncork it.

                  telling you about the serious stuff.
                  Import, export. This booze is just
                  for gifts to Papa's friends. The
                  real import stuff is from Kabul,
                  you understand?

     He pops the cork and swigs the frothing champagne.

     Nikolai hands the bottle back. As he does, one of the van
     doors is kicked closed revealing Semyon, suddenly upon
     them.

     Semyon grabs the bottle of champagne and smashes it on the
     floor. Kirill recoils in terror. Nikolai straightens,

     Semyon is so furious he still can't speak. He grabs Kirill
     and slams him against the wall. Finally he hisses in his
     face.

     There is a tension that builds until Nikolai's Mercedes
     suddenly looms into view, filling the street window of the
     burger bar. Nikolai gets out of his car, all shades and
     sharp suit.

     Stepan removes his hand, empty, his bravado crushed.

     Nikolai enters the restaurant and spots Anna. He comes
     and sits at the table beside Stepan, opposite Anna. It's
     a tight squeeze. Anna and Helen are stiff with terror.
     Nikolai smiles.

     strange connection between them.

     Then Stepan steps forward and spits in Nikolai's face,
     delivering a Russian curse as he does so. Nikolai almost
     reacts out of instinct but stops himself.

     Crowds of football supporters are streaming away from the
     football stadium, where the floodlights are still casting
     their glow. There are Arsenal and Chelsea supporters on
     opposite sides of the street and there is some mildly
     vicious yelling between the two groups. Police are visibly
     keeping order.

     Among the crowd we see Ekrem. He seems slightly drunk on
     top of his normal craziness. He has an Arsenal scarf around
     his neck and is looking for trouble, jeering at the Chelsea
     supporters across the street.

     A policeman steps up to Ekrem and gives him a shove and he
     stumbles a little. As he gets to his feet we notice TWO
     CHECHEN MEN who are trailing Ekrem, ducking their heads
     away from the line of policemen.

     Ekrem is now isolated from the crowds, swigging from a can
     of lager. He is chanting `Arsenal, Arsenal' to himself as
     he walks. He stops to take a piss on someone's grave.

     In the background the two Chechens are coming closer. As
     Ekrem zips his flies, the Chechens are upon him. One of
     them grabs his Arsenal scarf and begins to strangle him.

     Ekrem chokes for a while and the Chechen loosens the knot.
     The second Chechen pulls out an open razor. Ekrem struggles
     to escape...

     The place has two dozen customers and there is a Russian
     band playing `Dark Eyes'. At a particular table an old
     Russian lady is having her birthday celebrated by an adoring

     is straining at the leash, snarling and barking. An already
     anxious Ozim is cowering in the shadows, held at bay by
     the dog.

     The moment Semyon steps out the dog stops barking. Ozim
     relaxes a little and steps forward. Semyon pets the dog.

     Semyon's feet.

     A large public housing estate is being swept by rain.
     Christmas lights glow in the windows of the dilapidated
     tower blocks. Stepan is walking against the wind, carrying
     a bag of shopping. He holds onto his Russian hat to stop
     it blowing away. Kids splash in the puddles.

     Stepan arrives at the front garden of his small, ground-
     floor council flat. As he fumbles for his keys in the cold
     we see that Nikolai is watching him from the driver's seat

     him away.

               him...

     He goes for Anna again, and this time Nikolai shoves Kirill
     to the wet ground. He looks up at Nikolai and slowly gets
     to his feet. He wipes his hands then stares into Nikolai's
     eyes.

     but cracking with fear.

     grabbing Kirill and pulling him away towards the restaurant.

     The place is winding up. Chefs and waiters are cleaning
     surfaces and dishes. The only still point is Semyon, who
     is cutting and wrapping the birthday cake in small parcels
     of golden paper. He works intensely and delicately at the
     back of the kitchen. Nikolai and Kirill enter. Kirill
     swigs a half-drunk glass of wine.

                           KIRILL
               That girl you fucked in front of

               Ukrainian bitch?

               So they kick down the door. These
               are ordinary fucking police. They
               ask for her by name and they take
               her away. Some fucking punter must
               have given them her name. What
               gives the police the right to take
               our women, huh?

     Semyon shoots Kirill a hard look: he's talking too much
     and too loudly. Kirill ignores the look.

     A confused pause.     Kirill looks from Nikolai to his father.

     Kirill hesitates. He is angry as hell but too scared of
     his father's gaze to say anything. Finally he turns fast
     and departs, slamming his open hand against the door as he
     goes.

     The cellar is half lit, the arched walls lined with crates
     of wine. Flour, grease and potatoes are stored here. As
     Nikolai walks down the steps into the gloom, he hears Kirill
     singing a Russian folk song to himself as he drags a case
     of brandy across the cellar floor.

     Kirill has already opened a bottle of brandy and takes a
     long swig as Nikolai joins him. He grins as he gestures
     at the brandy...

     wall. Kirill joins him and swigs some more.

     Sweet Russian choral music covers the next four scenes.

     The street outside the restaurant is now flooding with

     (VALERY) is ushered from the car by bodyguards in suits
     and shades.

     decorated with elaborate tattoos (details to follow).

     He carefully places his shirt over the chair then sits
     down. The panel of the vory study his body, the Gypsy
     pushing a candle across the table to better illuminate the

     the tattoos does the interview begin.

               above your heart. Where the stars
               will go. And why there is an empty

               I am dead already. I died when I
               was fifteen. Now I live in the
               zone all the time.

               Georgians. I steal from them within
               the law.

     The questions and answers are delivered with great
     solemnity, making the ceremony feel almost religious.
     Candles burn, the men all sip water.

     Semyon is silent throughout but listens attentively.
     Towards the end of the interview there is the ghost of a
     smile on the Gypsy's face and this pleases Semyon.

     Nikolai is sitting in a banquette at the back, wearing
     only his underpants. We circle Nikolai as the tattooist
     begins to work on his knees, preparing Nikolai's knee caps
     for the tattoos.

     The needle bites at Nikolai's skin as the old tattooist
     wipes away the blood.

     Then we see the needle working on the empty spaces above
     Nikolai's heart, tattooing the star symbol.

     Nikolai now has a star tattoo on each knee and two eight-
     pointed stars on his chest. He is now a member of the vory

     More rain. Ozim is waiting nervously, blowing into his
     hands against the cold. The Turkish bath building is a
     Victorian red-brick edifice.

     Nikolai pulls up in his Mercedes.

     Ozim and Nikolai are undressing. The place is deserted
     apart from an OLD TURKISH BATH-HOUSE ATTENDANT who is
     distributing towels. Ozim is unbuttoning his shirt.

                  Semyon recommends these places for
                  business meetings because you can
                  see what tattoos a man has.

     Nikolai is pulling off his shirt and Ozim reacts to the
     sight of the fresh eight-pointed star tattoos. Ozim
     chuckles.

     leans back against the cold wall, his tattoo almost the

     Nikolai is sweating hard, staring at the ceiling. The
     steam room door opens but the steam is now so thick he
     can't see who has entered.

                  Ozim?

     He sees a shape... a clothed body. He realizes immediately.
     Suddenly one of the brothers is upon him and has him in a
     head lock. He strokes the tattoo on Nikolai's chest as if
     this were confirmation of who this is. He grunts an
     instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with
     an open razor.

     Nikolai is naked, alone.

     Suddenly he kicks the razor guy in the balls and uses a
     martial arts chop to free himself from the other brother.
     In the steam there are boots and bare feet and knees and
     fingers flying. Nikolai manages to gouge the eye of one
     brother and throw another against the wall. He obviously
     has serious combat training but the brothers are strong
     and angry.

     Suddenly Nikolai is slashed across the arm by the razor
     and blood oozes into the steam and hot water. All the men
     are slipping and falling on the blood and hot water.
     Another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open. All the
     men are now covered in blood and Nikolai, with a final
     surge of strength, manages to cripple one brother with a
     blow to the throat, and the other with an elbow to the
     temple.

     As the Chechens slump to the floor, Nikolai fumbles in the
     bloody water for the razor, finds it, kneels, and slashes
     their throats. He lurches to his feet, drops the razor,
     and staggers out of the steam room.

     Anna is walking in the opposite direction. Then, as

                He said they throw a great party

     wearing Yuri's overcoat loosely over his hospital gown.
     Yuri lights his own cigarette and they smoke in silence

     up another one. Maria, Semyon's little granddaughter, runs

               You bastards!! Where will he take
               her?! Tell me!!

     People back away as Nikolai grabs Anna's arms and holds
     her still.

                           NIKOLAI
               What are you talking about?!

     Anna studies Nikolai's face and sees his genuine confusion.
     She calms down a little.

               Kirill. Kirill has taken Christine.
               I saw him here! I thought he was
               coming to see you, but he wasn't,
               was he?

     Nikolai curses under his breath and thinks fast.

100    EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - NIGHT                        100

       The same dockside where Nikolai dumped Soyka and recommended
       this as the best place to dispose of a body. Kirill pulls
       up slowly in Nikolai's Mercedes. The car is parked for a
       long time before finally the headlights are switched off.

       Anna and Nikolai leap aboard the bike and it starts first
       time. With Nikolai riding pillion, they roar away.

102    EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - NIGHT                        102

       On the edge of the dockside, Kirill is kneeling with the
       zip-up bag before him. Suddenly fireworks begin to burst
       over the Thames. It is the stroke of midnight.

       Kirill unzips the bag. When he looks inside Christine
       stops crying. He peers at her, wiping away tears.

                             KIRILL
                 She's a little girl, Papa, a little
                 sweet fucking girl...

       Kirill sobs then Christine cries...

                             KIRILL (CONT'D)
                 Shush, shush...

       Kirill lifts her out of the bag and holds her close to
       him, fireworks still illuminating the London skyline. He
       looks down at the freezing cold water, utterly confused.
       He whispers...

                             KIRILL (CONT'D)

      For a moment we believe he is going to throw her into the
      water. Instead he begins to sing a lullaby to her and her
      crying stops.

      Then we see a single light behind him. In a firework flash
      we see Nikolai and Anna climbing off the bike. They
      approach cautiously. Kirill stares at the man he loves.
      A pause. Christine begins to cry.

                             ANNA
                 Kirill, let me take the baby.

                             KIRILL
                 You stay where you are.

                             ANNA
                 She's cold, Kirill.

      Kirill suddenly screams as another barrage of fireworks
      explodes. Nikolai doesn't move. Kirill is dangerously
      close to the edge of the dock. Maybe he'll throw himself
      in too.

                             NIKOLAI
                 Kirill, a vor doesn't kill little
                 babies.

      Kirill is motionless.

                             NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                 Something like this would be bad
                 for all of us. Your dad has gone
                 too far, Kirill.

      A pause.

                     (in Russian)
                 It's our turn now.

      Nikolai steps forward slowly.    As he gets closer Kirill
      hugs the baby.

      Finally Nikolai reaches Kirill and hugs him. As he does
      he edges him away from the dockside. The three of them are
      locked in a long embrace.

      Nikolai emerges from the embrace with Christine in his
      arms. He quickly hands her to Anna who hugs her close.
      Kirill turns to Nikolai.

                             KIRILL
                 I swear I didn't know my dad was
                 setting you up.

                   the family business will be yours.

      A pause.

      Kirill smiles through his tears and nods.

                   Get into the car. I'll drive you
                   home.

      A pause. Kirill dries his eyes and heads for the car.
      Nikolai looks at Anna, who is hugging the baby. He waits
      a long time before realizing he must leave her.

                               NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

      Nikolai can't answer truthfully, though he longs to do so.
      There is a long pause before he manages to finds a suitable
      lie.

                             NIKOLAI
                 How can I become King if the King
                 is still in place?

      A pause.   He laughs.

      Anna studies him, unsure. More New Year fireworks explode
      over the river. Kirill yells from the car...

                             KIRILL
                 You come on, Nikolai! We're missing

                 come and fetch us.

      Nikolai nods, not liking the information but hiding it.
      Nikolai comes close and gently uncovers Christine's face.
      He smiles. Kirill is hooting the car horn.

      After a moment Nikolai and Anna kiss each other gently
      before Nikolai heads for the car.

      A summer's day. Anna, Helen and Uncle Stepan are preparing
      to eat Sunday lunch. Stepan is carving. The conversation
      is jovial as Anna and Helen bring dishes of food to the
      table.

      Then we hear a baby crying. Anna goes to a small crib and
      lifts a six-month-old Christine out. She hands her to
      Helen who hugs her. Over this happy scene we hear Tatiana
      in V.O., a repeat of the first words we heard her say.

                died...

      Anna takes Christine back and takes her to the window to
      peer outside, staring across the park.

      Nikolai is sitting at a window table, alone, sipping vodka,
      staring back across the park. He peers out at ordinary
      life going on in the streets outside. Tatiana's V.O.
      continues...

                            TATIANA (V.O.)
                We were all buried there. Beneath
