          CU on two concerned eyes. The same eyes as the paintings. We
          REVEAL they belong to a real girl: JANE, 8. She sits in her
          small house -- a typical young family's, spare and
          underfurnished.

          Suddenly -- Jane's mother MARGARET ULBRICH, 28, rushes through
          frame. Margaret is blonde, yearning, fragile. Terribly
          upset, she is hurriedly packing.
          Margaret throws her clothes in a suitcase.
          She shoves Jane's clothes and toys into another.
          Margaret barrels through the breakfast nook, which is a mini
          art studio -- easel, canvases, paints. She scoops up her
          supplies.

          Margaret runs to the door -- then turns. The hallway is lined
          with her PAINTINGS. Oils and inks of wide-eyed Jane, who
          grows from baby to toddler to child. Hastily, Margaret takes
          them down, each frame leaving an empty mark on the flowered
          wallpaper. Finally she reaches the last spot -- a WEDDING
          PHOTO: Margaret and her HUSBAND, smiling, happy.
          Margaret peers -- then leaves it hanging. The door SLAMS.

          Margaret grips the wheel, uncertain. Jane stares. The car is
          all loaded up. REFLECTIONS of passing BILLBOARDS drift across
          the windshield. Images of perky, happy-fake Americans.
          Margaret bites her lip. Has she made the right decision...?

          skirt. Jane smiles.

          A beaten industrial office. Margaret sits anxiously, watching
          the BOSS, a tired guy in a cheap suit. He glowers unsurely at
          her JOB APPLICATION. Scratching his face. Hmmmm...

                          BOSS
           We don't get many ladies in here. So

          A deadly silence. He squirms uncomfortably.
          She presses on.

           Sir, I realize I have no employment
           experience... but I sure need this
           job. I have a daughter to support.

           horn... but I love to paint, and if I
           could just show you my portfolio...
          He is baffled. Margaret pulls out a large ARTIST'S PORTFOLIO.
          She opens it, riffling through the pictures...

                          MARGARET

          NORTH BEACH! An exotica of Beatniks, palm readers,
          interracial couples and coffeehouses. Ground zero for the
          Avant Garde. Margaret waits on a busy corner, a bit dazed,
          peering at the parade of fun-loving Hipsters. Primly, she
          fixes herself.
          Margaret turns -- and suddenly grins. Running up is DEE-ANN,
          30, a Beat girl in a black leotard and sandals. Dee-Ann
          excitedly grabs her, and they laugh and hug girlishly.

          A Sunday ART SHOW. It's picturesque, amateur ARTISTS

          The modern stalls are crowded with trendy BOHEMIANS. Abstract
          lines, speckles of color. We drift away... and find Margaret,
          alone in her stall with Jane. Margaret sits patiently,
          surrounded by Big Eye paintings and charcoal portraits. In
          contrast with the neighbors, her work seems... quaint.

           I'll give you one.
          Beat -- then she nods, agreeing. She gestures.
          The little BOY sits. Margaret clips a fresh sheet of paper,
          sharpens her charcoal... and... goes motionless. Studying the
          boy's face. He gazes back.
          Then -- inspired, she begins sketching his EYES. Large and
          exaggerated. Then she fills in the shape of his head. His
          ears. His jaw.
          In a rush, his likeness appears. The parents come over to
          peek -- then gasp. Margaret is good. She sketches faster.
          Focused. Until a LOUD, PLUMMY VOICE drifts in...

           Monet? "Monet"?! Whew -- that's a
           hell of a compliment. Though, if I
           may respectfully disagree, I'm more in
           the tradition of Pissarro.
          Margaret looks up, distracted. She resumes her work.

           C'mon, get closer. Closer! Look at
           that sunlight coming through the
           mottled leaves. That's a bold yellow!
          Curious, Margaret casually peers over...

                         HER POV
          Holding court in another booth is WALTER KEANE, 40. Walter is
          astonishing: Hugely confident. Charming. Waggishly
          handsome. And dressed like an "Artist" -- striped turtleneck,
          with hands full of brushes.
          Walter's stall is filled with oils of Paris street scenes. He
          casually flirts with TWO YOUNG COEDS. They admire a painting.

                          WALTER
           You wanna touch it? Do it! I lay it
           on thick -- you're not gonna break it!

          Walter glances over -- and notices Margaret watching him.
          Shy, she quickly turns away, back to her portrait.
          Walter smiles rakishly. He's found a new interest.

                          WALTER
           Excuse me, Ladies.

                         WIDE
          Walter strides up to Margaret. She peers nervously... trying
          to ignore him. She sketches faster. Shading...
          Walter watches. Admiring... and discreetly smelling her hair.
          Margaret pays no attention. Done, she blows into a can of Fix-
          It. Poosh! A fine mist sprays, setting the portrait.
          Without fanfare, she humbly turns the picture.

                          MARGARET
           All finished.
          Her customers gape, impressed. She smiles. The guy counts
          out four quarters, then happily leaves.

          MARGARET AND WALTER
          are left together. An unspoken frisson, until --

                          WALTER
           You're better than spare change. You
           shouldn't sell yourself so cheap.

                          MARGARET
           I'm just glad they liked it.

                          WALTER
           Ahhh! You're past that point! Your
           heart is in your work...
          He leans in, too close. Margaret shivers. Breathing faster.

                          WALTER
           What's your name?

                          MARGARET

          Mmm. He grins, checking her out... her loose sexy blouse and
          tight black capris. She flushes.

          it hits him. He grimaces, embarrassed.

           I thought there was a void in my life.
           Well... Walter's filled it.

                          DEE-ANN
           Walter's filled a lot of things. He's
           diddled every skirt on the art circuit.

                          MARGARET
           You're talking about my husband!

                          DEE-ANN
           I know! That's why I brought it up.
          Margaret frowns, insulted.

           17.

           I'm not naive.
           (beat; she laughs)
           Well, I am naive. But I know the man
           I'm marrying. Walter can act rash...
           but he's a good provider. And he's
           wonderful with Jane.

                          (CLEAR-EYED)
           Look -- we're both looking for a fresh
           start. I'm a divorcee with a child.
           Walter is a blessing.
          Dee-Ann bites her tongue. The WAITER brings over the check.
          Sitting on it are TWO FORTUNE COOKIES.
          Hm. Margaret stares, utterly serious. She reaches for one...
          then impulsively grabs the other. She cracks the cookie. Dee-
          Ann waits, curious. Margaret reads... then slowly smiles.

                          MARGARET

           success."

          INT. ART GALLERY - DAY

          A Modish, happening gallery. The white walls are hung with
          ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: Slashing angles of color, painted over
          rags and glued bolts. On the floor is SCULPTURE made from
          wood and wire.
          In charge is RUBEN, a fussy man in a goatee. He's schmoozing
          a FANCY LADY. They look at a spattered, distorted painting.

                          RUBEN
           What's brilliant about the composition
           is its spontaneity. The image has no
           visual center of attention.

                          FANCY LADY
           It's quite gestural.

                          RUBEN
           Oh definitely! Strongly influenced by
           the tachistes.

                          FANCY LADY
           I heard Tab Hunter was in here,
           looking at one.

                          RUBEN
           Well... I'm not allowed to say...
          He NODS HIS HEAD up-and-down: Yes, you're right.

                         OUTSIDE
          A car backfires. Ruben turns -- and winces.

           18.

                         
          Through the windows is Walter, climbing out of his massive
          white Cadillac. He's all done up, in beret and scarf. He
          opens the giant trunk and removes a pile of paintings.
          Ruben cringes knowingly. He whispers:

                          RUBEN
           Oh Christ, don't come in here. Please
           don't come in here...
          The door SLAMS. Walter loudly barges in.

                          WALTER
           Ruben, good day! Do you got a minute?

                          RUBEN
           Walter. In polite society, the word
           is "appointment."

                          FANCY LADY
           (glancing back and forth)
           Uh, I could come back later...
          She anxiously hurries for the door. Ruben fumes.
          Walter ignores it all and starts laying out his wares. First,
          the Parisian street scenes, one after another...

                          WALTER
           You're gonna love my stuff today.

                          RUBEN
           Haven't I seen that one before?

                          WALTER
           Nah! That was painted in the Fifth
           Arrondissement. This is the Sixth
           Arrondissement!

                          RUBEN

                          (SKEPTICAL)
           I don't understand. You lived in
           Paris for a week. How can you still
           be cranking out paintings?
          Walter laughs. He points to his head.

                          WALTER
           It's all up here.
           (beat; a sentimental

                          FLOURISH)
           And here.
          He points to his heart. Ruben frowns and points to the wall.

           19.

                         

                          RUBEN

           Walter, you know we don't go for that
           representational jazz! You're too
           literal.

           Yes it IS!

                          (CUTTING)
           People want Kandinsky, or Rothko!
           They don't want goopy street scenes.

          CLOSEUP - WALTER
          Ouch! This stings terribly.
          Walter glares at the man, then softly slides aside his works.
          Quietly, he pulls out Margaret's Big Eye paintings.

                          WALTER
           Would they want... this?

                          RUBEN

                          (HE SHUDDERS)
           Good God! You've entered a new
           period.

                          WALTER
           No... they're my wife's.
          Fascinated, Ruben glances through Margaret's oils. Canvas
          after canvas of sad kiddies against gray, bleak backgrounds.

                          RUBEN
           Why are their eyes so big?! They're
           like big stale jellybeans.

                          (SNIDE)
           It's Expressionism. Surely you
           recognize it.

                          RUBEN

                          (LONG BEAT)
           Well -- I'm just glad you two found
           each other.

                          WALTER
           So... what do you say?
          Ruben looks up, amazed. Walter seems oblivious.

           20.

                         

                          RUBEN
           I say, NO! It's not art.

           Not -- "art"??

                          RUBEN
           It's like the back of a magazine!
           "Draw the turtle! Send in a nickel
           and win the Big Contest!"

                          WALTER
           How dare you! Lots of people would
           like this.

                          RUBEN
           Well, nobody who's walking through the
           door of this gallery!

                          (BEAT)
           Now please! Clear out this clutter,
           before the taste police arrives.

          A swinging mob of BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE -- suits, gowns and pearls.
          CAL TJADER'S BAND is crazed: Vibes and bongo-driven JAZZ.
          Margaret and Walter are squeezed at a table. She nurses a
          Grasshopper. Walter's in a foul mood, CHUGGING cocktails.

                          WALTER
           We'll never break in...! Because
           there's a CABAL. A secret society of
           gallery owners and critics, who get
           together for Sunday brunch in
           Sausalito, deciding what's "cool."

           banish to nowheresville!"
          Heartfelt, Margaret disagrees.

           I think people buy art because it

           Heh! You're livin' in fairy land!
           People don't get to discover a thing.
           They buy art, because it's in the
           right place at the right time.
          O.s., MUSIC BUILDS. Muddled, Walter turns. He looks -- and
          then -- his eyes light up. He is getting an idea...

                         ONSTAGE
          The band speeds to a climax, the percussion throbbing. Then,
          a final, crazed note. BAM!!
          The crowd APPLAUDS. The club's owner, ENRICO BANDUCCI, bounds
          on stage. Banducci is a theatrical, natty Italian guy with a
          skinny moustache and loud personality. He grabs a mike.

           was HUMMIN'! Al-aright, be sure to
           stick around for the one a.m. show!
          The house lights come up. Banducci hops down, greeting
          guests, making his way out -- when Walter glides up.

                          WALTER
           Hey, Banducci. I love the music
           tonight. It's a gas.

          A PHOTOGRAPHER runs around, tweaking equipment.
          Walter's at an easel, putting the final touches on a PAINTING
          of a French street scene. He gabs on the PHONE.

           public viewing daily, from 7 to 3!

          and SIGNS the painting: "W. KEANE"

          Walter, forlorn at a card table. Brochures are stacked, and
          he wears a sailor coat with a dandyish ascot.
          The image is grim. Walter listens to the raucous mob. Until,

          stunned. The guy toddles away.
          Beat. The Ladies Room opens, and TWO GOSSIPY WOMEN rush out,
          oblivious to Walter. He glowers. ANOTHER MAN bounds in,
          right up to one of Walter's paintings! He stops at it.
          Walter gathers a moment of hope. Does he like it?
          Then the man leans down and opens a CLOSET. He removes a tray
          of bar glasses, kicks the door shut, and scoots away.

          The moment of truth. Margaret opens her mouth... and no sound
          comes out. She clenches up. Stomach tight. Mute.
          Walter gives her a second -- tick tock tick tock. Then -- he
          leaps into Opportunity. He SMACKS his hands.

                          WALTER
           I am!
          Walter swoops over and grabs Olivetti in a hearty clasp.

                          WALTER
           It's a delight to meet you, Signore!
           Buon giorno! Have you been an art
           lover for long..?
          We move in tight on MARGARET, as the SOUND DIALS DOWN.

                          WALTER'S VOICE
           I call that piece "The Waif." Isn't
           it striking? With its juxtaposition
           of girl, cat, and stairs... and its
           almost Flemish use of underpigment...
          The SOUND dims... then goes SILENT.
          Margaret stares in shock, unmoving.
          Time seems to stop. She is frozen in grief. Until --

          Margaret blinks, lost.
          In the b.g., Olivetti holds the painting, now wrapped-up in
          newspaper and twine. A pleased customer.
          Margaret's face darkens.

           into those big orbs. Sometimes I'd
           get out my Brownie and snap a photo...
           but... that's not subjective. You
           know? It doesn't capture your

           CANADAY (ON TV)
           Keane's work is completely without
           distinction. He is not a member of

           noteworthy for his appearances in a

          It's a factory. Big Eyes are everywhere. Margaret frenziedly
          works, surrounded by half-done canvases, solvents, easels.
          She's in a bathrobe -- a cigarette hanging from her lips.
          Startled, she looks up to see Walter.
          He gazes at all the art. At the bulbous faces, eyes watery
          and submissive, trapped in muddy yellows and dire browns. And
          then... Walter grins broadly.

           WALTER (ON TV)
           My psyche was scarred in my art
           student days. Nothing in my life has
           ever made such an impact as the sight

           innocents, without homes, without

           The insane, inhuman cruelty inflicted
           upon these children cut deeply into my
           being. From that moment on, I painted
           the lost children with the eyes.

          An urbane RICH MAN glides by... and is taken with one of
          Margaret's nubile blondes. He gazes at the lounging figure.
          Margaret sits up. Alert, pleased with his interest.
          She tingles. Then, happily excited, unable to hold it in:

           Luckily, my maiden name is Margaret
           Doris Hawkins! "M" is the 13th letter
           of the alphabet, "D" is 4, "H" 8! If
           you add up 1 and 3 in 13, that gives
           you 4, making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals
           16, then 1 plus 6 equals seven!
          The man's head is spinning. He's lost all interest.
          Across the room, Walter sees this debacle. He marches over.

                          WALTER
           Psst! Maggie! Can I have a second?
           (he PULLS HER ASIDE)
           Good grief! What the hell are you
           babbling about?! Long division??
           Could you please help the world and

          The Margaret sweatshop is going full-blast. Canvases are
          everywhere: Melancholy MDH ladies. Woeful Keane kids. Even a
          portrait of Natalie Wood, copied from a photo. Margaret dips
          a tiny brush, quickly detailing the tear on a child's cheek...
          when the doorbell CHIMES.
          Hm? Margaret puts down her brush, wipes her hands, then
          hurries out. She opens the door... REVEALING THAT WE'RE IN A

          Margaret runs across the marble floors, past the swooping,
          Modern lines of a California ranch... all-white furniture... a

          Dee-Ann stops, puzzled. She glances at Margaret -- who has
          turned white as a ghost.
          Immensely curious, Dee-Ann slowly enters. She peers around at
          the two styles of paintings...
          A strained silence. Finally, Margaret whispers.

          Hmm.
          Dee-Ann walks about, examining the canvases. Then, her gaze
          settles on the Big Eye that Margaret was working on.
          Below the easel is the wet brush on the open jar of paint.
          Margaret sucks in her breath. Dee-Ann sees this.

          Walter rushes to the Waif, then for show grabs up the wet
          brush and quickly starts to "finish" the painting.
          Suddenly -- an odd expression crosses his face. He eyeballs
          the canvas, realizing he doesn't know what to do.
          A furtive glance. Then, unbowed, he hastily dips the brush
          and slaps a little black onto the shaded background.

           No you don't! It's nice to have
           company, but that sofa is new.
           (she pushes him off)
           Let's find you some carpet to lay on.

           65.

                         
          Margaret goes over to a CLOSET. Rembrandt follows, curious.

          IN THE CLOSET
          Margaret turns on the bare bulb inside. It's filled with old
          easels... cans... junk...

                          MARGARET
           I think there's a scrap back here...
          She rummages, sliding the junk aside. In back is a TATTERED

          WOODEN CRATE.
          Hm?

                          MARGARET
           Well what's this?
          Margaret swings the bulb closer. The crate is covered with
          SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS and international markings.
          Margaret's interest is piqued. She tugs at the lid, pulling
          it off. Revealing inside a STACK OF STREET SCENE PAINTINGS.
          Ten or fifteen of Walter's canvases.
          Or so it seems.

          TIGHT - MARGARET
          She peers closer.

          TIGHT - THE PAINTINGS
          The top painting is a typical Parisian street scene: Cobble
          stones, a man carrying baguettes, an old lady selling roses...
          But down in the bottom corner is the signature: "S. CENIC"

          TIGHT - MARGARET
          She sucks in her breath, shocked. She examines the painting.
          Then, she hurriedly grabs the next canvas. It's another
          sunlit scene: A quaint Parisian cafe, a man playing accordian,
          and in the bottom right corner... the signature: "S. CENIC"
          WHAT?! Margaret grabs the next canvas. "S. CENIC"
          The next canvas.
          The next canvas!
          They all are signed "S. CENIC"
          Margaret starts hyperventilating.

           66.

                         
          She thinks, then suddenly bolts from the closet.

          INT. PAINTING ROOM

          Margaret races, rushing up to Walter's painted street scene,
          hung on the wall. We PUSH IN TIGHT, as she shoves her face up
          to the canvas, so close we can see the brushstrokes --
          As we MOVE IN TO THE SIGNATURE. Simply, "W. KEANE"
          Margaret's face is flushed. She gazes at the name... then
          rushes back to her work area. She manically hunts: Brushes,
          tubes, rags -- and an EXACTO KNIFE.
          Ah! She runs back to Walter's painting. Heart pounding, she
          grazes the knife up against the signature, then DIGS.
          And -- the "W. KEANE" flecks off. Revealing... underneath...
          the name "S. CENIC"

          INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - THAT EVENING

          A grandfather clock says 10:15. Margaret sits gloomily,
          staring at the clock. Clutching a drink.

                         LATER
          2:30 a.m. Margaret still stares at the clock. She's stewing.
          Suddenly, keys in the door. Walter swings in, tanked and full
          of life. He skids across the marble, humming to himself --
          when -- he's startled by his wife. He jerks.

                          WALTER

           or four clubs.

           Stumbled onto some hot gossip: Madame

           Straight from Taipei! I think we
           should present her with a painting --

                          (HE THINKS)
           Or the heck with Dick. I met a new

                          MARGARET
           Maybe you should give her one of your
           street scenes.

           You think? I dunno -- I thought you
           could whip off a doodle of Chinatown.
           With a cute little kid, sort of a big-
           eyed slanty-eyed thing...
          Margaret's anger is raging. She glares, steely.

                          MARGARET
           No, Walter. She's a dignitary.
           Doesn't she deserve a piece that comes
           straight from you?

           From your experience???

                          WALTER
           Yeah? Maybe you're right. She
           probably doesn't have a Parisian
           street scene hanging in her palace.
          Margaret nods, as if they've settled something. She turns to
          walk away -- then suddenly SPINS.

                          MARGARET
           Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek already
           has a Cenic.

          He freezes up.
          Suddenly sober, smacked to reality.

          Margaret stares, eyes sharp.

                          MARGARET
           Cenic is the name of the artist who
           did all your early paintings.

                          WALTER
           Huhhh?
           (spinning his lie)
           Urgh... oh! CENIC!
           (he laughs crazily)
           Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All
           my art school pals loved my scenic
           views, so they called me "Scenic"!
           But since those Frogs can't pronounce
           a hard "e," I became "Cenic."
          He looks up at her hopefully.
          But she shakes her head.

                          MARGARET
           Then why do you paint over the name?
          Walter gasps, floored.
          Margaret bores in.

                          MARGARET
           A bit of advice: Don't use a water-
           base over an oil. It flecks off.
          Walter cowers.

                          WALTER
           You sound crazy! For God's sake.

          CLOSEUP - WALTER
          All life drains from his face. His eyes go glazed. He speaks
          mechanically. Tiredly...

           I studied art in Paris. I went to
           school at the Beaux-Arts. The Grand
           Chaumiere. I spent hours in the
           Louvre, gazing at the greatness of the

                          MARGARET
           Have you even been to Paris?
          Walter blanches. He shakes, broken up.
          He looks away, then staggers to a chair. He falls into it.
          Trembling. Not able to look her in the eye...

                          WALTER

           artist. But -- it just never turned
           out good.
          Margaret stares, seething.
          Then, without comment, she storms away. She SLAMS the door
          shut. BANG!

          Margaret makes Jane breakfast, scrambling up eggs.
          Jane glances over her shoulder -- and notices Walter in the
          living room, asleep on the couch.
          An awkward pause. Jane says nothing.

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

          Margaret is making the bed. Straightening the pillows.
          In the b.g., Walter silently creeps into view. Shamefully
          standing in the doorway. Not speaking...
          Margaret knows he's there, but doesn't acknowledge his
          presence. Finally, without making eye contact --

          INT. HOUSE - LATER

          Margaret sits, unmoving, trapped in the big house. Outside, a
          JAPANESE GARDENER trims the hedges.
          Margaret stares at the walls, a smothering Walter Hall of
          Fame: Framed magazine articles on Walter, smugly posed with
          the Waifs.
          She swallows, then gently opens a dresser drawer. Inside is
          an ORIGINAL WAIF from long ago. A small oil of Jane, when she
          was a toddler.
          Margaret stares... and then her face slowly crumbles.

          INT. PAINTING ROOM - DAY

          Margaret huddles with a SKETCHPAD. Rembrandt is at her feet.
          She's drawing. She looks up, as Walter anxiously enters.
          He's holding a drink. He clears his throat.

                          MARGARET
           A new MDH. Something for me. It's
           about a woman trapped in an uncaring
           world. I call it, "Escape."
          Walter bites his lip, afraid to talk.

          He trails off, unsure where this is going.
          Trying to rouse her, Walter rushes to an easel and throws up a
          blank canvas. She eyeballs him.

          Walter catches it. Slowly, he crosses over...

          Again, Walter copies, but he's wobbly. Angry, he scratches it
          out.
          Margaret tries to help, guiding his hand. Insulted, he pushes
          her off. He CRUMPLES the page.

           opinion, there's only one way to clear
           up this thicket. You are both going
           to paint.
          Walter gasps, stunned. All color drains from his face.

          The Bailiff directs the deputies, setting up TWO EASELS, back
          to back. On each easel is placed a small square canvas.
          The Judge addresses the room.

                          JUDGE
           Now, I'm not looking for a
           masterpiece. I don't know much about
           these things -- I'm a jurist, not an
           art critic -- but, is one hour enough?
          Margaret nods: Sure.
          Shaking, Walter barely moves his head.

                          JUDGE
           Okay then. You've both been provided
           with identical supplies... so --
           without any further business... Mrs.
           Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours.

                         WIDE
          Margaret glances at Walter. What will he do?
          Walter's face is grimly blank.
          Margaret proceeds. Slowly, she pushes her chair from the
          table and rises.
          Walter doesn't move.
          Margaret walks over to the closest EASEL, then sits. She ties
          on a smock over her checkered dress.

                         THE JURORS
          crane their necks, intently curious.

                         MARGARET
          takes a pencil. She peeks over at Walter -- who's still glued
          to his seat. His face tight, his expression queasy. Staring
          off to some faraway place.
          Margaret looks up at the CLOCK. 3:20.
          Okay then. Totally calm, in a motion she's done so many
          times, she focuses on the canvas and starts outlining a Waif.
          Everybody watches. Effortlessly, she pencils the EYES. They
          are enormous. The largest orbs she has ever done.

                         MARGARET
          finishes penciling. She leans back, satisfied with the
          composition. Then, she reaches for... the PAINT.
          She unscrews a tube and squirts it on the palette. She rests
          it on her lap and starts mixing a flesh tone...

                         THE JUDGE
          gapes at Walter, befuddled.

                         WALTER
          feels all eyes on him. He has to do something.
          Hesitantly, visibly shaking, he rises from the table.
          Margaret notices this.

          Walter contorts his face in AGONY.
          He grabs his shoulder.

          A look between them -- and then she cocks a half-smile and
          turns back to the canvas. She squirts out some white oil
          paint, then begins painting the eyes.

                         WALTER
          sinks down in his chair, beaten. All life gone.
          He stares at the emerging canvas, eyes wide, and we PUSH INTO
          WALTER'S FACE. He is witnessing the end of his empire... the
          destruction of everything that makes him who he is.

          penniless. He never produced another painting."
          "Margaret found personal happiness and remarried. After many
          years in Hawaii, she moved back to San Francisco and opened a
          new gallery. She still paints everyday."
