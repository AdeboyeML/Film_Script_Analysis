          A massive crowd, it could be a sports stadium, a u2 farewell
          show or new year's eve on copacabana beach, but whatever it
          is there are thousands and thousands of us. A mexican wave
          erupts success, celebration, with so many involved it's
          impossible to pick out anyone individually. Critical mass
          cyclists, easter crowds at st. Peter's basilica, nyc
          marathon, 4,000 flash mobbers doing the silent disco at
          london's victoria station, india's kumbh mela, macy's
          thanksgiving day parade, raves, subway parties, the daytona

          At the southwest edge of Green River, Aron Ralston drives
          under the interstate into a landscape of obscurity. He looks
          to his right and left, not a single light perforates the
          absolute blackness of the San Rafael Desert.

          on the desert floor like a takedown in wrestling. He submits,
          landing nose deep in the sand. He sits up, looks around
          quickly to see if anyone saw. Pulls out his camera from his

           There's thousands of holds but you
           can't see them until you're almost
           upside down and then they just keep
           appearing... it's a bit of a act of
           faith so I'll go first... take off

          Tapping a rock in his hand onto the top of the knife as he
          balances it against the wall or with his mouth. Weird close

          handle of the knife, the rock explodes in his hand, showering
          pick dust over everything, and bouncing the knife off the
          rock. Once again, gravity takes over. The knife hits his
          shorts and as he moves to grab it, he misses it and knocks it
          further round the back of his leg. He pivots and turns to try

          On top of some 4 x 4 vehicles are 8-10 ft huge Easter Island-
          like masks, multi-coloured. Multiple bikes are strapped to
          the backs of the vehicles too. More of Aron's friends,
          including Mark V.E. mill around their 4 x 4s. There are
          multiple lights in the distance but it's unclear what it
          might be. The vehicles' own headlights illuminate Rana, a
          stunningly beautiful red-haired woman in her mid-20s,
          effortlessly organising the 15 or so group. As before, we
          remain behind Aron. By the camera's virtually complete
          concentration on Rana it's clear he's a fan.

          They turn off their vehicles' headlights as she draws a long

          As they all hold hands and together step cross the line

          of vehicles and camps that is Burning Man are replaced by an
          astonishing sunrise in the Nevada desert. They hoot and
          holler as Rana smiles beautifully at Aron.

          He looks at ithe sunbeam as though it's his prey and it might
          run away. It makes it's way along the canyon walls towards
          him. He's very still. But it shifts across the floor and
          it's going to miss him. He whips off his left shoe and sock
          and pushes it towards the coming light. Slowly it climbs and
          caresses his ankle and lower calf. He pulls the other sock
          off and alternates the feet. He looks like he's doing yoga.
          As it leaves him passing overhead it suddenly bursts into the
          opening in front of him.

           It's three-oh-five on Sunday. This
           marks my twenty-four-hour mark of
           being stuck in Blue John Canyon
           above the Big Drop. My name is
           Aron Ralston. My parents are Donna
           and Larry Ralston of Englewood,
           Colorado. Whoever finds this,
           please make an attempt to get this
           to them. Be sure of it. I would
           appreciate it.
          He takes long blinks and seems to avoid looking at himself
          though the screen is facing him. He looks alarmed and wide
          eyed, startled, in contrast to his slow slurred delivery.

           So... I was hiking Blue John Canyon
           yesterday... and this happened.
          He pulls the camera round to show where his forearm and wrist
          disappear into the horrifyingly skinny gap between the
          chockstone and the wall. As he does that we

           So the way I see it... there's kind
           of four things happening here... I
           tried to move it with some
           rigging... useless... and I tried
           chipping away at the rock... I
           think part of the problem is, is
           that my hand is actually supporting
           the rock. Which means every time I
           chip away the rock moves a bit and
           settles onto my hand again. I
           can't feel it happening but
           microscopically, it seems to be,
           because the little gap over there
           between the rock and the wall seems
           to be getting smaller. And this
           chockstone is the hardest thing
           here.

           I don't know whether I could do
           that but it's pretty much suicide.
           It's four hours to my vehicle that
           way and with very difficult
           climbing with one hand and the bike
           is like two, two and a half hours,
           that way but the climbing... fourth
           class climbing... which I think
           will be probably impossible with
           one hand... between the blood loss
           and the dehydration I think I would

          A flashing, strobe-ing light - Aron's head-lamp bouncing back

          The whole thing is almost like stop-frame animation. He
          cannibalizes everything he can, using his knife, his teeth,
          he tears holes in a cloth camera bag, he's frantically paced
          to occupy himself, to pass time, to create heat from energy,
          but he has to be careful not to stab himself in the eye. He
          thrusts his left arm into the newly fashioned sleeve, pulling
          it up with his teeth.
          Purple webbing around his right arm, the insulated Camelbak
          protects his upper arm from the chilling canyon wall. Yellow
          webbing wraps a grocery bag (that held the burritos) round
          his upper right bicep.

           God, I am praying to you for
           guidance. I'm trapped in Blue John
           Canyon - you probably know that -
           and I don't know what I am supposed
           to do. I've tried everything I can
           think of. I need some new ideas.
           Please show me a sign.
          PAUSE - Just his breath.
          He switches on the head lamp and the inside of the bag
          explodes with light. There's enough light for any kind of
          heaven but it's just Aron in Blue John Canyon. He looks
          around his bag. He stops. Silence. Only his breathing to
          listen to. Heart rate... fast... too fast.

           listening, I need some help here.

          you sense him in reflective surfaces, his arms, particularly
          his right one and his feet occasionally come into shot. It's

          He pulls his bag off and pulls his water bottle out of the
          ground where he has half-buried it. It won't open. He can't
          unscrew it. He mutters, cursing himself for tightening the
          lid too much. He puts it between his teeth and levers with
          his head, but nothing. Is his strength vanishing so quickly?

                         
          He looks at his puffy left hand... there's a tremble in it.
          He shakes it to get rid of the tremble and jams the bottle
          between his legs. He uses a bit of cloth to give his hand
          better purchase on the top. We're tight on the neck of the
          bottle as it releases, finally and he lifts it, slowly,
          almost ceremonially. Controlling the tilt, a half-mouthful
          of water slides onto his tongue. He tilts the bottle back
          towards upright but not the whole way. He waits. Circulating
          the splash of water around his mouth.

          He still holds the water in his mouth as he rewinds the top
          onto the bottle and reburies it in the sand to stop any
          evaporation. He moves to pop his contact lenses into his

          He watches them devour him and then he clears them away from
          his hand. Suddenly breaks and he's busy now well before
          sunrise. In the grey-white, soft morning he is involved in
          recycling his overnight insulation gear into a crude lift and
          pulley.

           It's Monday - all day - bummer. I
           spent the morning trying to create
           a 6:1 system ration and lift the
           boulder but friction between the
           rope and carabiners is dissipating
           every bit of force I apply.

           millilitres of water left. That's
           four ounces. I can't believe it

           few minutes of each other. How is
           this possible? It's two days since
           I peed, I'm dehydrated and I had to
           go so quickly I forgot to save the
           first. I saved the second in the
           CamelBak. Will I drink it? It
           smells foul, and hot but it'll
           settle. And I can chill it in the
           sand in the night. It's like Polar

           'It's not what you do but who you
           are'.
           I kind of got hung up on that a
           lot, because I always thought who I
           was, was very much wrapped up with
           what I did. That I was happy
           because of the things that I did
           that made me happy. If things you
           do make you happy, then they can
           also make you unhappy. I think
           that's why I found myself being as
           ambitious and energetic -

          He pushes and pulls, trying to gain height but is underwater
          almost immediately. He tries to take a huge suck of air
          before he's submerged but even that is compromised by water.
          We hear him choke and he disappears into the liquid wall of
          mud.

          We're with him underwater. He's trying to switch his light
          on. We can see almost nothing in this washing machine of
          churning slush and debris and malevolent water. The light
          flicks on. He can see his arm and the rock. Suddenly the
          water lifts the chockstone and his arm releases. He pulls it
          towards him, luminous deathly white in the mud, and flat, and
          too big.

          Something he always does - to check the sound of real water.
          To make sure he hasn't drunk it all without knowing. He
          opens, tilts and holds as always and then ritualistically
          removes his contact lenses and washes them in his mouth.
          Suddenly a shiver tears across him like an attack dog. He
          coughs a lens out and as he tries to catch it before it goes
          into the sand he tips the bottle in his lap.
          He hasn't put the top on fully. It goes horizontal on his
          shorts and a leak of the sacred fluid darkens his tan shorts.
          He whips it upright.

          beginning to see there's a ferocious blizzard outside. And
          we appear to be badly exposed to it. Up a mountain, on the
          crest of a high road... Snow, hail, swirls savagely around
          all sides of the truck. We remain inside. It's warm, the
          heater blows.
          They prepare themselves for a mutual signal, press their

           Good morning everyone! It's 6:45
           Tuesday morning in BJ Canyon. The
           weather is great! I figure by now
           that Leona, my housemate - Hi
           Leona! - has missed me hopefully
           since I didn't show up last night.
           Another hour and a half they'll
           miss me for not showing up for
           work. Hi Brion at work! Best case
           scenario is they notify the police
           and after a 24 hour hold they file
           a report, a missing persons report.
           Which means noon tomorrow it's
           official that I'm gone. I do still
           have the tiniest bit of water left.
           Well, actually, I've resorted...I've
           had a couple pretty good gulps of
           urine that I saved in my Camelbak.
           I sorta let it distill...it tastes
           like hell. So it's 70 hours since
           I left on my bike from Horseshoe
           Trailhead during which time I have
           consumed 3 liters of water and a
           couple mouthfuls of piss.

                         
          Pause.
           Did I say the weather is great?
           Well, it is. Though flash floods
           potential is still present. There's
           4-prong major canyons upstream from
           me that all converge in this 3 foot
           wide gap where I am. The rock I
           pulled down on top of me, it was
           put there by flood.

           been awesome. I haven't appreciated
           you in my own heart the way I know

           I really have lived this last year.
           I wish I had learned some lessons
           more astutely, more rapidly, than I
           did. I love you. I'll always be

          He folds open the knife, grasps it in his fist and picking a
          spot just above the rock's grip on his right wrist, he
          hesitates and then violently plunges the blade into his arm
          up to the hilt.

                         
          He lets go leaving the knife embedded. He swoons and stares
          at it. He slowly grasps the tool more firmly and wriggles it
          slightly, the blade connects with something hard. He taps the
          knife down and feels it knocking on the radius of his upper
          forearm bone.
          He puts his ear close and we can hear the little thocking
          sound.

          He can see the epidermis, thick and leathery rough. Yellow
          fatty tissue under the skin in a membrane layer around the
          muscle. He thocks, thocks again and some blood finally seeps
          out and blocks his view. He pulls the knife out and thinks.
          He's sweating and puts the tool on top of the chockstone.

                         
          He immediately pulls up his water bottle and stares into it.
          With a little shake he opens it and drinks it all gulping
          open throated. He shakes any last drop down and runs his
          tongue up into the neck. He screws the lid back on and
          loosens the tourniquet. There's no discernible increase in
          blood loss.
          He picks up the video again.

           I made an attempt - a short career
           in surgery, as it turned out -
           those knives are just not anywhere
           close to the task. I've got about
           an inch-wide gash in my arm that
           goes about a half inch deep. I cut
           down through the skin and the fatty
           tissue, and through some of the
           muscle. I think I cut a tendon, but
           I'm not sure.
           I'll never saw through the bones
           with this knife. I tried, anyways.
           It really just didn't go well. The
           tourniquet is relaxed at this
           point. Which actually is a little
           bothersome, considering I'm not
           bleeding that bad, barely at all.
           It's so weird. You'd expect to
           definitely see more pulsing and
           bleeding, but oh well.

          We tilt down the wall (still reflected on inside of bag) to
          see Aron completing his obit. Scratched on wall of canyon:
          Aron Oct 75 => APR 03 RIP.
          As we reverse back on Aron in the canyon there's a burst of
          light and color beyond him and on the sofa in the canyon a
          little boy sits. He's blond, about 3 and in a red polo shirt.
          He looks like Aron.
          Aron walks towards him, the sunlight hits his face like a
          train and Aron looks up to it but keeps moving towards the
          boy, walking downhill towards the sofa. The boy leaps off the
          sofa and comes running to Aron.

          He scoops the boy up with his left arm and balances him
          around his shoulders with his right handed stump. The boy
          holds Aron's arms in his little hands and they prance around
          the sofa, they giggle and shout playing bulls, giraffes,
          elephants, jousting knights, pretending to walk downhill
          behind the sofa. Like any father in any park. [A PERFECT POP
          SONG, BLONDIE MAYBE, PLAYS IN THE DISTANCE]. Like any father
          in any park.
          Aron watches the image begin to fade. He switches on the
          light but its low and feeble.
          As the images on the inside of the bag fade so too does
          Aron's lamp. He tries to warm it up but it fades to black. He
          holds his breath.

          He looks at his 'good' hand. It's swollen and angry red like
          an inflated prosthetic on top and around of his real hand. He
          takes off his shoe and pulls the sock over his hand to
          cushion his palm and picks up the black rounded hammer rock
          again. Ignoring the pain he starts hammering at the rock
          surface. SMASH. MAD NOW.

          Finally he stops but his fingers are paralyzed, fused rigid
          around the rock. He pulls them off with his teeth and the
          stone drops to his feet.

                         
          There's a thick layer of dust across the top of the stone and
          his right arm. He tries to blow it away. He fails. Tired,
          it's too thick and he's too dehydrated. He picks up his knife
          and using this starts sweeping the grit off his thumb. As he
          cleans up he accidentally rips away a thin piece of decayed
          flesh. It peels back a long way like a skin of boiled milk.

          He pokes the thumb with the stubbed point of the blade. On
          the second prod the blade punctures the epidermis like soft
          butter. There is a clear hiss as gases escape. The stench is
          death. He looks at the gangrene attached to him, poisoning
          him.

          He drops to his haunches but the webbing stops him at his
          waist. He detaches it and drops down again, almost able to
          squat. His trapped arm is the only thing preventing that.
          His face is suddenly open.

                         
          He pushes and pushes with his left hand under the boulder to
          create maximum downward force on his right arm. Hard, harder,
          HARDER. It looks insane, unnatural and painful, but he says
          nothing.

          Like a gunshot in the canyon, the bone breaks. The sound
          ricochets. He rises and sees the bone pushing up violently
          against the skin. He feels it. It's a serrated, but clean,
          successful break.
          Still he says nothing.

          Fuck knows where the sweat is coming from but it's pouring
          out of him.
          Sawing downwards he makes as large a hole as he can without
          tearing any of the noodle like veins. He puts the knife in
          his teeth and pokes his left forefinger and thumb inside his
          right arm.
          Like a mechanic he looks to analyse and then he works by feel
          only.

                         
          His sweat falls on his knife mixing with the blood.
          He pulls muscle nearer the surface allowing his knife to
          slice and pare away at a pinky 'finger-sized' fragment bit by
          bit. It takes a dozen actions, each time the knife goes back

          nothing will stop his addiction to surgery now. He folds in

          frustrating, pressure of life again now he's free from his
          tomb. Deeper and deeper, down and down into the swirling
          scoops of the sandstone. Couple of difficult manoeuvres, lots
          of slipping and bumping, despite his best effort occasionally
          his right shoulder takes the brunt and he stops, winces and
          grunts thru the pain.

                         
          But on he goes, 100 ft of the rope trailing behind him. As
          we follow its progress snaking after him we see specs of
          blood on the lower walls.

                         
          The canyon becomes a chute increasingly steep in which he
          ignores the shrinking daylight above because he has another
          target; the twists and turns of the curricles of sedimented
          sandstone lead to a soft glow, red, translucent, growing and
          growing in intensity. He pushes forward, the tail of rope
          whipping faster and faster along the walls and floor.

          Finally, we burst into the dazzling midday sun on a rock
          shelf halfway up a sheer walled amphitheatre, 200ft high. The
          scale of the slated cliff face opposite is breathtaking, the
          dazzling sunlight poaches the air he sucks in and burns his
          dry eyes.
          He sees, for the first time in his new life, green. The deep
          green of a healthy 50ft tree below him and to his left, and
          he knows. He looks for the bolts drilled into the rock, and
          he knows. Now he can look down. Right to the edge of
          vertiginous drop and there below is a puddle of shallow
          turgid water. Life itself. He wanted it to be there and now
          he's mesmerized by it. A pair of swifts leave the tree and
          zig zag up and around him. He wobbles and has to stop himself
          lunging head first over the precipice. Instead he drops to
          the bolts and kisses them like the pope arriving in a foreign
          land.

          between his teeth and his hand. But he'll die if he can't
          have moisture. He tips the saved urine over himself and
          licking and retching simultaneously he suddenly stops and
          listens. He can hear a shuffling, a zip-zip... The rope is
          uncoiling over the ledge. He put it down to drink. Picking up
          speed the more it falls, there's only a few feet left. He
          lunges across the ledge and catches it just in time. That was
          his future disappearing over the ledge.

          Something's not right. It's a difficult overhang and he's
          awkward and vulnerable with only one useful arm. His bad arm
          catches horribly on the lip of the ledge. Suddenly he starts
          coming fast, faster and then hideously, much too fast,
          accelerating out of control and smashing into the water with
          deadly force.

          shouldered figures painted to enormous scale in all shades of
          tan and maroon. They seem to stare back at him. He salutes
          them in his own way and continues.

                         
          He banks left beneath a colossal alcove high up in the cliff
