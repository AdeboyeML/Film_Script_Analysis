"An American Werewolf in London" -- by John Landis





     FADE IN

1    MAN'S FOOTPRINT

     on the moon.

     EXT. MOON

     Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the
     song "Moon Shadow" by Cat Stevens begins.  Once we are
     high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is
     superimposed.

               An American Werewolf in London

     We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it
     grows farther from us, continuing credits until the
     full moon is the size it appears to us from earth.

2    EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     Tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans
     down and we see a truck approaching.  We are at a
     crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to
     have earned their literary reputation.

     The truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER,
     mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler,
     climbs down.

     "Moon Shadow" ends.


                                                  CUT TO:

     Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams
     down.  Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened
     young American boys.  They look exhausted.  They both
     carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in
     Europe.  They are both in their late twenties.

     It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none
     too happily.  Pushing sheep aside they step out and
     stretch.

     JACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLER

     They've been cramped for hours.

                         TRUCK DRIVER
               Here, lads, East Proctor and
               all about are the moors.  I go
               east here.

                         JACK
               Yes, well thank you very much
               for the ride, sir.  You have
               lovely sheep.

                         TRUCK DRIVER
                    (as he clambers back
                     up on his truck)
               Boys, keep off the moors.
               Stay on the road.  Good luck
               to you.

                         DAVID
               Thanks again!

     He drives off.  LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry
     pulls away.  Surrounding them are the moors.  They put
     on their packs, David points to the signpost pointing
     towards East Proctor.

     EXT. ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     As they walk, their breath visible:

                         JACK
               Are you cold?

                         DAVID
               Yes.

                         JACK
               Good.

     They walk on, finally:

                         DAVID
               Jack.

                         JACK
               David.

                         DAVID
               You're not having a good time
               are you?

                         JACK
               Oh, I don't know.  I mean look
               around.  Isn't this a fun
               place?

     The camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold,
     foreboding.

                         DAVID
               Well, I like it here.

                         JACK
               I'm sorry.  Northern England
               first, Italy later.

                         DAVID
               Right.

     They walk on.
                         JACK
               Do you think she'll meet me in
               Rome?

                         DAVID
               I think Debbie Klein is a
               mediocre person with a good
               body.

                         JACK
               Debbie is not mediocre and she
               has one of the great bodies of
               all time.

                         DAVID
               She's a jerk.

                         JACK
               You're talking about the woman
               I love.

                         DAVID
               I'm talking about a girl you
               want to fuck, so give me a
               break.

                         JACK
               Well, anyway, do you think
               she'll be there?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.

                         JACK
                    (like an announcer)
               Rendezvous in Rome starring
               Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein.
               The love affair that shocked
               Europe!  See torrid lovemaking
               at its most explicit!  See
               Jack and Debbie expose their
               lust in the sacred halls of
               the Vatican!  Never has the
               screen dared....

                         DAVID
               If you don't stop, I'm going
               to kill you.

                         JACK
               I have to make love to her.
               It's very simple.  She has no
               choice really.

                         DAVID
               It just fascinates me that you
               can spend so much energy on
               someone so dull.

                         JACK
               It is impossible for a body
               like that to be dull.

                         DAVID
               We've known Debbie what, since
               the eighth grade?  How many
               years of foreplay is that?

                         JACK
               She says she `likes me too
               much'.

     David just laughs and laughs and laughs.


                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

3    EXT. EAST PROCTOR MAIN STREET - NIGHT

     David and Jack entering East Proctor.  It is brightly
     moonlit.  East Proctor consists of a few shops, all
     closed, a petrol pump and a pub.  East Proctor has a
     very small population and the place looks empty.  David
     and Jack enter the middle of town and look about.  The
     camera sees what they see.  A few shops, dark and
     shuttered.  Light and laughter come from the pub.

4    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     Its traditional shingle shows a ferocious wolf's bloody
     head on a pike, and tells us the pub's name, "The
     Slaughtered Lamb".

                         JACK
               The Slaughtered Lamb?

                         DAVID
               Of course, The Slaughtered
               Lamb.  Why else would they
               have a severed fox head on a
               spear as their symbol?

                         JACK
               That's a wolf's head.

                         DAVID
               Of course, The Slaughtered
               Lamb.  Why else would they
               have a severed wolf's head on
               a spear as their symbol?

                         JACK
               That's not a spear.  It's a
               pike.

                         DAVID
               A severed wolf's head on a
               pike as their symbol.

                         JACK
               David, before we go in there I
               want you to know that - no
               matter what happens to us -
               it's your fault.

                         DAVID
               I assume full responsibility.

                         JACK
               Okay.

                         DAVID
               Shall we?

5    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     The pub was apparently "modernized" sometime in the mid-
     fifties.  Its traditional Englishness combines with
     greasy stainless steel and glass.  It is populated by
     mostly pale young men with longish hair.  Several older
     men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches.
     Four or five are watching a chess game.  Two men are
     playing darts.  The conversation is loud and there is
     often laughter.  But there is something unsavory about
     these people.  A look of leanness and poverty.  They
     seem inbred and somehow sullen.  We establish the types
     and the general level of noise in the room.

     The door opens revealing David and Jack.  There is dead
     silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at
     the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the
     strange attention.  They give each other a "what?"
     look, then turn to the assembled populace.

                         DAVID
               Hello.

                         JACK
               Nice to see you.

     FACES

     Silent and staring.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID AND JACK

                         DAVID
                    (smiles)
               It's very cold outside.  May
               we come in?

     The WOMAN BARKEEP nods.  The boys walk carefully over
     to a table and very self-consciously remove their
     packs, place them on the floor, and sit down at the
     table.  There is a long, awkward wait.  The Woman
     finally comes over to them.

                         JACK
               Do you have any hot soup?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         DAVID
               Well, do you have any coffee?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         JACK
               Hot chocolate?
                         WOMAN
               We've got spirits and beer.
               If it's something hot you
               want, you can have tea.

                         JACK
               Then you have some hot tea?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         JACK
               Oh.

                         WOMAN
               But I can heat some up for you
               if you'd like.

                         DAVID & JACK
               Yes, please.

     As the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes
     what they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess
     and darts, and the boys breathe easier.

                         JACK
               Nice looking group.

                         DAVID
               Listen, at least it's warm in
               here.

                         JACK
               Look at that.

                                                  CUT TO:

     JACK'S P.O.V.

     On the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed
     star) and on either side burns a yellow candle.

                         DAVID
               What about it?

                         JACK
               It's a five-pointed star.

                         DAVID
               Maybe the owners are from
               Texas.

     The Woman brings them their tea.

                         JACK
                    (to Woman)
          Remember the Alamo?

                         WOMAN
               I beg your pardon?

                         DAVID
               He was joking.  Thank you.

                         WOMAN
               Joking?  I remember The Alamo.
               I saw it once in London, in
               Leicester Square.

     Jack and David look startled.  One of the CHESS PLAYERS
     explains:

                         CHESS PLAYER
               She means in the cinema, that
               film with John Wayne.
                    (turns to board)
               Checkmate.

                         DAVID
               Oh, yes, of course.

                         JACK
               Right, with Laurence Harvey
               and everybody died in it.  It
               was very bloody.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Bloody awful if you ask me!

     This sends everyone into gales of laughter.  Jack and
     David smile politely.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Here, Gladys, Tom.  Did you
               hear the one about the
               crashing plane?

                         WOMAN
               No, but we're about to.

     Laughter.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               You be quiet, woman, and let
               me speak.

                         WOMAN
                    (heavy sarcasm)
               Quiet, everyone!  Hush!  Shhh!

     Uproarious laughter.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               All right, laugh then.  I
               shan't tell it.

                         WOMAN
               Oh, come on, tell us.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               No.  You've had your chance.

     The men all coax him to tell the joke.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Ask them what the candles are
               for.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               You ask them.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Listen, that's a pentangle, a
               five-pointed star.  It's used
               in witchcraft.  Lon Chaney,
               Jr. and Universal Studios
               maintain it's the mark of the
               wolf man.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               I see.  You want me to ask
               these people if they're
               burning candles to ward off
               monsters.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Right.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               Wrong.
     The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the
     joke as everyone knew he would.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Oh, all right.  There was this
               airplane over the Atlantic on
               its way to New York.  It was
               full of men from the United
               Nations.

                         WOMAN
               That's very funny, that is.

     Uproarious laughter.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Go on, ask them.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               You ask them.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Here now, let me finish!  So
               halfway over the ocean the
               engines run low on petrol so
               they have to lighten the
               plane.  So they heave out all
               the baggage, but it's still
               too heavy.  So they chuck out
               the seats, but it's still too
               heavy!  Finally this Froggy
               steps up and shouts "Viva la
               France" and leaps out.  Then
               an Englishman....

                         DART PLAYERS
               Hear!  Hear!

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (undaunted)
               ...steps up and shouts `God
               save the Queen!' and leaps
               out.  But the plane is still
               too heavy.  So the Yank
               delegate from Texas steps up,
               shouts, `Remember the Alamo!'
               and chucks out the Mexican.

     This is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of
     East Proctor have ever heard.  The laughter is
     uproarious, choking, knee-slapping, incredible.  As the
     Chess Player goes to take a drink of beer, the Dart
     Player gasps out...
                         DART PLAYER
               Remember the Alamo!

     ...causing the Chess Player to spit out his beer
     causing even harder laughter.  Complete hilarity.

                         JACK
               Excuse me, but what's that
               star on the wall for?

     Dead silence.  A dart lands in the wall.  David and
     Jack are understandably bewildered.  The villagers look
     hard indeed.

                         DART PLAYER
                    (angry)
               You've made me miss.

                         JACK
               I'm sorry.

                         DART PLAYER
               I've never missed the board
               before.

                         DAVID
               Jack, we'd better go.

                         JACK
               What do you mean?  I'm
               starving.

                         DART PLAYER
               There's no food here.

     The villagers look threatening and David's voice is a
     bit urgent.

                         DAVID
               Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!

                         JACK
               Apparently so.

     The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly
     for the door.

                         WOMAN
                    (to men)
               You can't let them go.

                         DAVID
                    (worried)
               How much do we owe you?

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Nothing, lads.  Go, God be
               with you.

                         DAVID
               Uh, thank you.

                         WOMAN
               Wait!  You just can't let them
               go!

                         DART PLAYER
               Go!  And stay on the road.
               Keep clear of the moors.

                         DAVID
               Yes, well, thanks again.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Beware the moon, lads!

     David pushes Jack out.

6    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     It is very cold.

                         JACK
               What the hell was that all
               about?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.  Let's see if
               there's an inn or something up
               the road.

                         JACK
               Beware the moon?

                         DAVID
               Come on, I'm freezing.

     They start up the road into the night.

7    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     It is quiet.

                         WOMAN
               You can't let them go.

                         DART PLAYER
                    (angry)
               Should the world know our
               business?!

                         CHESS PLAYER
               It's murder then.

                         DART PLAYER
               Then murder it is!  It's in
               God's hands now.

     The wax drips from the Pentangle's candles onto the
     floor.

                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

8    EXT. A ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT - DAVID AND JACK

     walking on the road surrounded by darkness.

                         DAVID
               That was weird.  I guess
               leaving was the best idea.

                         JACK
               I don't know.  Now that we're
               out here and it's three
               degrees, I'm not so sure I
               wouldn't rather face a blood-
               thirsty mob.

                         DAVID
               Well, not quite a blood-
               thirsty mob.

     They keep walking.

                         JACK
               What do you think was wrong?

                         DAVID
               I have no idea.

                         JACK
               Maybe that pentangle was for
               something supernatural.

                         DAVID
               I see and they were too
               embarrassed to talk about it,
               because they felt so silly.
     There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly
     illuminating sheet of light over the boys' faces.  The
     clap of thunder follows loud and rumbling.

                         DAVID
               Please don't rain.

     Downpour.  The boys are walking in a deluge.

                         DAVID
               Of course.

     They walk getting soaked.

                         JACK
               Say, David....

                         DAVID
               I'm well aware of how pleasant
               the weather is in Rome at the
               present time thank you.

     Jack spreads his arms and sings.

                         JACK
               Santa Lucia...Santa Lucia.

9    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     The rain is loud on the roof and beating on the
     windows.  The gathered continue to drink, play chess
     and darts, but all are silent and contemplative.

                         WOMAN
               Perhaps they'll be safe in the
               rain.

     The Chess Player slams his hand on the table.  Shouts:

                         CHESS PLAYER
               No one brought them here!  No
               one wanted them here!

                         WOMAN
               You could have told them!

                         DART PLAYER
               Are you daft?  What do you
               think they'd say?  They'd
               think us mad.

                         WOMAN
               Listen!

     The rain is subsiding.  There is a very faint howl.

                         WOMAN
               Did you hear it?  We must go
               to them.

                         DART PLAYER
               I heard nothing.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Nor I.

     The camera lingers as the Chess Player's hard face
     shows the man's struggle.  Another howl.  The Chess
     Player turns suddenly.

10   EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David and Jack are now completely out of sight from
     East Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet.  There is
     a light drizzle.  They are standing, listening.  The
     drizzle stops.

                         JACK
               Did you hear that?

                         DAVID
               I heard that.

                         JACK
               What was it?

     David begins to walk, Jack with him.

                         DAVID
               Could be a lot of things.

                         JACK
               Yeah?

                         DAVID
               A coyote.

                         JACK
               There aren't any coyotes in
               England.

                         DAVID
               The Hound of the Baskervilles.

                         JACK
               Pecos Bill.

                         DAVID
               Heathcliffe.

                         JACK
               Heathcliffe didn't howl.

                         DAVID
               No, but he was on the moors.

                         JACK
               It's a full moon, `beware the
               moon'.

     Another howl, this one long and loud.  It is a very
     inhuman noise, terrifying, and closer this time.

                         JACK
               I vote we go back to The
               Slaughtered Lamb.

                         DAVID
               Yeah.

     They are both visibly worried and walk briskly back
     from where they just came.  Although after a bit of
     fast walking they are getting nowhere.  They stop out
     of breath.

                         DAVID
               We're lost.

     Another bloodcurdling howl.

                         JACK
               Shit!  David, what is that?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.  Come on.

                         JACK
               Come on, where?

                         DAVID
               Anywhere!  I think we should
               just keep moving.

     A growl.  A low guttural growl comes from out of the
     darkness.  We stay on the boys, but we hear something
     out there.  It starts to walk.

                         DAVID
               It's moving.

                         JACK
               It's circling us.

     And indeed it is.  The boys strain to hear its four
     footfalls and they turn slowly, following it.  A snarl.

                         JACK
               Fuck.

     We hear the wolf-monster stop (for that's what it is -
     we know it's there even though we've not seen it).  It
     sits breathing heavily.

                         DAVID
               What's the plan?

                         JACK
                    (nervously)
               Plan?

                         DAVID
                    (not too relaxed
                     himself)
               Let's just keep walking.

     They do and David keeps talking as they walk.

                         DAVID
               That's right, a lovely stroll
               in the moors.  Tra-la-la,
               isn't this fun?

     The thing stalking them seems to speed up.  The boys
     hesitate as they sense it run past them.  It stops.

                         DAVID
               It's in front of us.

                         JACK
               Do you think it's a dog?

     Jack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them.

     BOYS' P.O.V.

     Something is waiting in the darkness.  Its hulking
     shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily
     and its breath is visible.

                         JACK
               Oh shit.  What is that?

                         DAVID
               A sheep dog or something.
               Turn slowly and let's walk
               away.

     The boys keep talking as they move faster and faster.

                         JACK
               Nice doggie.  Good boy.

                         DAVID
               Walk away, Jack.

                         JACK
               Walking away, yes, sir.  Here
               we are walking away.

     They are in a full-out run by now.  After a few minutes
     flight they stop, panting.

                         DAVID
               See anything?

                         JACK
               No.

     A moment of quiet, then a howl.

                         DAVID
               It sounds far away.

                         JACK
               Not far enough.  Come on.

     They walk briskly.

                         DAVID
               Jack?

                         JACK
               Yeah.

                         DAVID
               Where are we going?

                         JACK
               I'll tell you when we get
               there.

                         DAVID
               Well.  I'm glad we...WHOAA!!

     David shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring
     Jack, and us, and himself a great deal.  He lays
     startled on the wet ground for a moment, then he and
     Jack laugh.

                         JACK
               You really scared me, you
               shithead.

                         DAVID
               Are you going to help me up?

     Jack takes David's extended hand to help him up when
     THE WOLF MONSTER SPRINGS!

     EXT. MOORS - NIGHT

     The lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop.
     David falls back on his ass.  Jack is screaming and
     struggling as he is torn to shreds.  David scrambles to
     his feet and runs in complete panic.  Jack's screams
     and the wolf's roars combine.

                         JACK
               Jesus fuck!  David!  Please
               help me!  Please!  David!
               Shit!  Help me!  Oh God!

     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David runs and runs.  Finally he falls, out of breath.

                         DAVID
               Jack?  Oh my God, Jack!

     He gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody
     mess on the ground.  He stares in horror.

                         DAVID
               Jack....

     EXT. NIGHT - VARIOUS FLASH CUTS

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!  The camera adopts David's P.O.V. as
     he fights the dark savage shape on top of him.  Fangs
     clamp down on his shoulder when shots ring out and the
     hulking form rolls off of him.

     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David, dazed and bloody, looks and sees the men from
     The Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches
     running towards him.  Looking over at his attacker,
     instead of a wolf he sees a very old, naked man laying
     in the mud riddled with bullet holes.  As the villagers
     crowd around, David falls back and faints.

                                                  FADE OUT


     FADE IN

11   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David is in a small, clean and very white hospital
     room.  He lays on his back in bed, his shoulder
     bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma.
     There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and
     face, but he really doesn't look too bad.  He opens his
     eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look
     around, but is unable to because of the pain.  He calls
     out....

                         DAVID
               Jack?!

     ...and passes out.  However his shout has fetched a
     nurse.  She is ALEX PRICE, very English, very
     beautiful.  She goes to the bed.

                         ALEX
               Mr. Kessler?

     She looks into his eyes, lifting the lids with her
     thumb, and then checks his chart at the end of the bed.

                         ALEX
               Mr. Kessler?

     David remains unconscious.  Another young nurse, MISS
     GALLAGHER, comes in.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               He all right?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I should think.  He
               called out just now.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               He's an American, you know.
               Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch
               round one of those Embassy
               fellows to see him.

                         ALEX
               Chart says he's from New York.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               I think he's a Jew.

                         ALEX
               Why on earth do you say that?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               I looked.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               Really, Susan, I don't think
               that was very proper, and
               besides, it's common practice
               now.

     A voice startles the girls.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss
               Price is quite right.

     DR. HIRSCH enters.  He is an older man wearing the
     customary lab coat.  A very commanding and reassuring
     presence.  The girls are embarrassed.

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried
               out a minute ago.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Miss Gallagher, surely you
               must perform some function
               here at the hospital.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Then get on with it.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, Doctor.

     She exits.  Dr. Hirsch begins to examine David.  Alex
     watches.  Dr. Hirsch turns to Alex.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Can I be of service, Miss
               Price?

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Go about your duties.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor.

     She starts to exit.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh, Miss Price?

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What exactly did he call out?

                         ALEX
               He said `Jack'.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               That would be Jack Goodman,
               the boy who was killed.

                         ALEX
               What happened to them?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The police report said an
               escaped lunatic attacked them.
               He must have been a very
               powerful man.  Although I
               really don't see that it is
               any of your concern, Miss
               Price.

                         ALEX
               No, sir.  Of course, sir.
               Good day, Doctor.

     She exits as Dr. Hirsch continues his examination,
     looking into David's eyes.

12   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     The camera is handheld, running furiously through the
     almost dense greenery.  On the soundtrack are the
     footfalls and heavy breathing of the runner.  The
     camera abruptly stops and turns, sharply looking about,
     the panting continuing.  The breathing gets louder and
     harder, then too loud when we:

                                                  CUT TO:

13   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David opens his eyes quickly, the silence and whiteness
     contrast sharply with the preceding fantasy.  Standing
     beside the bed are Dr. Hirsch and MR. COLLINS.  Mr.
     Collins wears a bow tie and is holding a briefcase.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Hello, David.  I am Dr. Hirsch
               and this is a countryman of
               yours, Mr. Collins.

                         DAVID
               Where am I?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You're in a hospital in
               London.

                         DAVID
               London?  Where's Jack?  I had
               a strange dream.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I should think so after your
               recent traumatic experiences.

                         DAVID
               The guy I was with.  Is he all
               right?  How did I get to
               London?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (quietly)
               Now, David, I want you to
               prepare yourself; your friend
               is dead.
     David jolts up in bed and shouts.

                         DAVID
               What?

     The sudden exertion and strain hurt.

                         DAVID
               Ow, shit!

     He sinks back down.

                         DAVID
               Jack's dead?

                         MR. COLLINS
               Mr. Kessler, I am Mr. Collins
               of the American Embassy here
               in Grosvenor Square.  Both Mr.
               Goodman's parents and your
               parents have been notified of
               your injuries and everything's
               in order.

                         DAVID
               Everything's in order?  What
               are you talking about?

                         MR. COLLINS
               Mr. Goodman's body has been
               air-freighted back to New York
               for burial and your parents
               have wired funds for your stay
               in the hospital until you are
               well enough to fly home.

                         DAVID
                    (controlled tears)
               You don't crate and ship Jack
               like some side of beef.
                    (approaching hysteria)
               Who the hell are you people?
               What's going on here?  Where
               is Jack?  I demand to see him!

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (holds David down,
                     calls out)
               Miss Price!  Miss Price,
               please!

                         DAVID
                    (shouting)
               Get your fucking hands off me!
               What the hell is going on
               here?

     Alex enters amidst David's shouting and confusion.

                         MR. COLLINS
                    (distraught, clutching
                     his briefcase)
               I realize how upsetting this
               must be for you, Mr. Kessler,
               but please try to refrain from
               hysterics.

     David continues shouting and struggling.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Prepare a hypodermic, please,
               Miss Price.

     The shot is administered and David is held down by Dr.
     Hirsch and Alex until his breathing becomes more
     normal.

                         MR. COLLINS
               Now, Mr. Kessler, try not to
               excite yourself.  Everything
               has been arranged.  I shall
               come back to check on your
               progress and send a report to
               your parents.  The police have
               requested to interview you and
               I have given them permission
               to do so.

     Dr. Hirsch walks Mr. Collins to the door.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Thank you very much, Mr.
               Collins.  He'll rest now and
               I'm sure everything will be
               fine once he's adjusted.  He's
               had quite a shock.

                         MR. COLLINS
               These dumb-ass kids never
               appreciate anything you do for
               them.

     Mr. Collins exits.  Dr. Hirsch crosses back to the bed.

                         DAVID
               How long have I been here?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've been unconscious since
               you were brought in two weeks
               ago.

                         DAVID
               Two weeks?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've suffered some rather
               severe cuts and bruises, lost
               a bit of blood, but nothing
               too serious; black and blue
               for a while.  You'll have some
               dueling scars to boast of.
               That lunatic must have been a
               very fierce fellow.  They say
               a mad man has the strength of
               ten.

                         DAVID
                    (softly, as the drugs
                     take hold)
               Lunatic?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Now we've just given you a
               pretty strong sedative, so try
               to get some rest now.  Miss
               Price will see to your needs.
               Rest now.

     Dr. Hirsch watches as Alex straightens David's covers.

                         DAVID
                    (softly)
               It wasn't a lunatic.

                         ALEX
                    (puzzled)
               I beg your pardon?

                         DAVID
               It was a wolf.

                         ALEX
                    (bends down close
                     to hear)
               What?

                         DAVID
               A wolf.

     David passes out.  Alex looks to Dr. Hirsch.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Did he say a wolf?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I believe he did.

     Dr. Hirsch regards David thoughtfully.

14   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY

     Dr. Hirsch is on the phone, he is referring to a desk
     calendar.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               But Roger is so terribly
               boring.  Yes, dear, but
               couldn't we...I see.
                    (he makes a note)
               Thursday at eight, dinner with
               boring Roger.  Yes, I'm sure I
               will; if I survived Rommel, I
               suppose I'll survive another
               excruciating evening with
               Roger Mathison.  Be a good
               girl.  Bye.

     He hangs up very disgruntled.  The intercom buzzes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus
               are here to see you, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Send them in.

     He rises to greet the two police officers, one tall,
     the other rather pudgy.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Come in, come in.  Please sit.
               Some tea?

     The cops sit down, Lt. Villiers immediately produces a
     small notebook.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               No, thank you.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               I'd like some tea, please.

     Lt. Villiers shoots the sergeant a withering look.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Maybe not.  No thanks.  Maybe
               later.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               It's no problem.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               No, thank you, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Well, then, what can I do for
               Scotland Yard?

                         SGT. McMANUS
               We understand the Kessler boy
               has regained consciousness.

     Lt. Villiers glares at McManus.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Sorry.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Has Mr. Kessler said anything
               regarding the attack on the
               moors?

     The intercom buzzes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Excuse me.  Yes?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               Roger Mathison, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What here?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               He's on the telephone.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Tell him I'm out.  No, tell
               him I've passed away.  An old
               war wound or something.  Tell
               him I'm dead.  And no more
               calls!

     He turns from the intercom back to the cops.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You were saying?

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Has David Kessler anything to
               say concerning the attack on
               the moors?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Why don't we ask him?

15   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David sits up in bed.  Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus
     stand by his side.  Dr. Hirsch sits observing.

                         DAVID
               I'm sorry if I conflict with
               your report, but Jack and I
               were not attacked by a man.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               So you've said.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               He may have a point,
               Lieutenant.  Two strong boys
               would be able to defend
               themselves against one man.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Sgt. McManus, are you
               suggesting that David and Jack
               were, in fact, attacked by
               some animal and that the
               officialdom of East Proctor
               has conspired to keep it a
               secret?  We have an autopsy
               report on the murderer who was
               shot in the act by the local
               police.  We have two witnesses
               to the crime.  You'll forgive
               me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider
               your testimony as coming from
               someone who has gone through a
               terrible shock.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Lieutenant, the boy seems
               pretty lucid to me and....

                         LT. VILLIERS
               And what, Sergeant?

                         SGT. McMANUS
                    (defeated)
               I don't rightly know, sir.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               That is precisely my point.
               David, as far as we are
               concerned, the matter is
               closed.  We won't trouble you
               any further.  Good day.

     The lieutenant goes for the door.  The sergeant smiles
     at David and follows.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Doctor.

     The cops exit.  Dr. Hirsch crosses to David's bed.

                         DAVID
               There were witnesses?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               So they said.

                         DAVID
               How could there have been
               witnesses?  It was so dark.
               We were running and I fell and
               Jack went to help me up and
               this thing came from
               nowhere...I don't understand
               what they're talking about.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               In time I'm sure it will all
               come back to you.

                         DAVID
               Doctor, my memory is fine.
               It's my sanity I'm beginning
               to worry about.

                                                  CUT TO:

16   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     Again the handheld camera is running furiously through
     the woods.  Heavy breathing and the sounds of the
     runner crashing through the foliage.  The camera runs
     for a while then suddenly stops short near a tree.
     David abruptly enters frame, animal-like, the tenseness
     of a startled cat.  His head makes sudden movements,
     looking about.

     CLOSEUP

     of his flared nostrils and perked up ears accenting his
     animalness.

     DAVID

     takes off and now we run with him.  He runs fast and
     gracefully, taking long strides and leaps.  We run with
     him faster and faster sharing in his exhilaration.  We
     see him completely as the animal, study his movement
     and grace as if watching a gazelle.  Suddenly he stops
     again, alert, listening.  He moves with stealth, slowly
     he pushes some leaves aside.

     CLOSEUP

     of his eyes.

     DAVID'S P.O.V.

     Several deer in the forest; they sense something and
     freeze, the camera noting a fawn next to a doe.  The
     buck turns his head, feeling the danger.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID

     Shots showing the muscles in his legs and shoulders
     tensing.

     CLOSEUP

     of David's eyes.

     CLOSEUP

     of the frightened deer.

                                                  CUT BACK
                                                  TO:

     CLOSEUP

     of David's eyes.

                                                  CUT BACK
                                                  TO:

     THE FAWN

     as it is leapt upon, its terrified face leaving frame
     as David forces it down.  David's head reenters frame,
     his mouth full of flesh, his face and hands covered
     with blood.  He howls in triumph.

17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     The lights are subdued and David's asleep.  The door
     opens, a shaft of light penetrates the room.  Miss
     Gallagher enters with a small tray.  She crosses to
     David, turns on the bed light and touches him.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Mr. Kessler?  Wake up, please.

                         DAVID
                    (awakened)
               I was having a nightmare.

     Miss Gallagher is very efficient in administering the
     pills and pouring a glass of water.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, well these should help
               that.  That's right, drink up.

     David takes the pills.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Now go back to sleep so you'll
               be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the
               morning.

                         DAVID
               What time is it?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               It's nearly eight.  I'm off
               duty shortly, then I'm off to
               the films with Alex.

                         DAVID
               Alex?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Miss Price, the other nurse
               that attended you.

                         DAVID
               What are you going to see?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               An American film about the
               Mafia called `See You Next
               Wednesday', and I want to see
               it badly, so you give me no
               problems and go to sleep.

                         DAVID
                    (dropping off)
               Do you have bad dreams, too?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Some, everyone does.

                         DAVID
               Yes, but does everyone kill
               Bambi?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Bambi?

     David has fallen asleep.  Miss Gallagher turns off the
     light, picks up her tray and pauses in the doorway.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Kill Bambi?

     She exits, closing the door plunging the room into
     darkness.

18   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - DAY

     The corridor is busy with orderlies pushing gurneys
     about, doctors, visitors, and patients all performing
     appropriate background actions.  Behind the Nurses'
     Counter, Alex is typing some forms and an older,
     obviously senior nurse is filling some paper cups with
     different sizes and colors of pills she is taking from
     the drug cabinet.  She is MRS. HOBBS, the chief nurse.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Miss Price.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Take these round now, will you
               please?  The American boy in
               twenty-one is only to have
               these after he's eaten.  Will
               you be sure of that?

                         ALEX
               Has he been refusing food?

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Nothing quite as dramatic as
               that, Miss Price.  He just
               doesn't eat enough of what is
               put before him.  He suffers
               from nightmares.  I'd think he
               just needs a hand to hold.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

     Alex takes the cups handed to her and makes her way
     down the hallway, pausing a moment to straighten her
     appearance.  She enters.

19   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - DAY

     A ward with seven or eight beds in it, all occupied.
     She goes to a little Pakistani boy named BENJAMIN.

                         ALEX
               Hello, Benjamin.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               No what?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               Well, all right then, be that
               way.  Here, swallow this.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.
     Alex pours a glass of water, gives the pill to Benjamin
     who promptly takes it and then drinks the water,
     handing Alex back the glass.

                         ALEX
               Feeling better?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               The doctor will be round
               later.  Would you like a
               picture book to look at?  We
               have some lovely funny Beanos.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               Right.

     She exits, pausing in the hall to speak to a black
     Jamaican ORDERLY pushing a cart of lunch trays into
     Benjamin's ward.

20   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

                         ALEX
               Has the patient in twenty-one
               gotten his tray yet?

                         ORDERLY
               The American?  Yes, duck.

                         ALEX
               How did he look?

                         ORDERLY
               What do you mean, `how did he
               look'?

                         ALEX
               You know, did he seem
               depressed?  Do you think he'll
               eat the food?

                         ORDERLY
                    (annoyed)
               I'm an orderly, not a bleeding
               psychiatrist!  I push things
               about, but I've little say
               what happens to them.

                         ALEX
               Thank you.

     Alex holds up her head and proceeds to David's room.
     She hesitates, then peeks in.

21   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     The curtains are drawn and David's lunch waits
     patiently on its tray alongside of the bed.  David is
     apparently asleep.  Alex enters softly.

                         ALEX
                    (softly)
               Mr. Kessler?

                         DAVID
                    (lifeless)
               Yes?

                         ALEX
               You haven't eaten your lunch.

                         DAVID
               I'm not very hungry, thank
               you.

                         ALEX
               I'm afraid you have to eat
               something.

                         DAVID
               Please, really.  I'm not
               hungry.

                         ALEX
               You put me in an awkward
               position, Mr. Kessler.

                         DAVID
               How is that?

                         ALEX
                    (she shakes the paper cup)
               Well, you're to take these
               after you've eaten.  Now what
               kind of nurse would I be if I
               failed in so simple a task as
               giving out some pills?

                         DAVID
               Leave the pills.  I'll take
               them later.

                         ALEX
               Sorry.

     She opens the curtains, daylight fills the room.

                         DAVID
               Aw come on, Miss Price!

                         ALEX
               Call me Alex.

                         DAVID
               Aw come on, Alex!

                         ALEX
               Shall I be forced to feed you,
               Mr. Kessler?

     David is getting interested.

                         DAVID
               Call me David.

                         ALEX
               Shall I be forced to feed you,
               David?

                         DAVID
               This is absurd.  I'm not
               hungry.  I don't want any
               food.

                         ALEX
               Right.

     Alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and
     sits on the edge of the bed.  Taking knife and fork in
     hand, she neatly cuts David's food into pieces.  David
     watches all this amused.  She places a napkin under
     David's chin and holds up his first bite on his fork.
     David folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth.

                         ALEX
               Let's try a little harder,
               shall we?

                         DAVID
               Will you give me a break?

     Alex grabs David's nose forcing his mouth open quickly,
     shoving the fork in it.  David is startled, but amused
     and chews his food slowly and swallows it.  Alex holds
     up another bite.

                         ALEX
               Will I have to take such
               drastic action again, David?

     David opens his mouth obediently.  Alex almost smiles.
     She feeds him for a while; they are both sizing each
     other up.  Finally:

                         DAVID
               May I have a glass of milk?

     Alex smiles.

FADE OUT

     FADE IN

22   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     Again we are running fast and faster.  David again
     running naked, flying through the green forest.  He
     stops suddenly, ears perked, he looks about and then we
     hear Jack's o.s. screams.  The voice of Jack screams:

                         JACK (O.S.)
               David!  David!  Please help
               me!  Oh God!  David!  Oh my
               God!

     David turns in blind panic, he runs (and we run with
     him) desperately trying to find the source of Jack's
     screams.

     He comes to a clearing in the woods, light streaming
     through the tall trees.  Jack's screams halt in mid-
     word.  David looks in disbelief at the clearing.  There
     is a hospital bed with someone in it.  It is the same
     as David's.

     David walks toward it slowly.  The figure in the bed
     lays still.  It grows dark, very dark, and David looks
     up at the full moon.  There is a howl identical to the
     one heard earlier back on the moors.  David approaches
     the bed slowly, fearfully.  We hear ocean noises on the
     soundtrack, the sound of crashing surf.  David reaches
     out to pull back the covers, lightning and thunder
     cause him to hesitate for a second.  Silence.  The
     camera remains on David as he pulls off the covers.
     His face registers total disbelief and increasing
     horror.

     We cut to the bed to find - DAVID.  He lies there, pale
     white with purple lips and death pallor.

     The camera begins to move in on the corpse of David.

     Cut back to the standing David's terrified face; then
     continue until David's death mask fills the screen.
     The face remains still for several beats, then suddenly
     opens its bright yellow eyes and red mouth revealing
     fangs in a bloodcurdling wail which carries over in
     the....

                                                  CUT TO:

23   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

     Mrs. Hobbs hears David's screams and efficiently calls
     out....

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Orderly!  Miss Gallagher!

     Miss Gallagher and an ORDERLY appear at once.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Orderly, go at once to twenty-
               one and restrain the patient.

     The orderly exits.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Miss Gallagher, remain here at
               the desk.  I'll be in twenty-
               one.

     She exits.

24   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     It is bright, daylight, and Dr. Hirsch gazes
     thoughtfully out the window.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've never had bad dreams
               before?

                         DAVID
                    (upset)
               Sure, as a kid.  But never so
               real.  Never so bizarre.

     Dr. Hirsch crosses over and sits on a chair by the bed.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Did you get a good look at the
               man who attacked you?

                         DAVID
               I've told you, it wasn't a
               man.  It was an animal.  A big
               wolf or something.  A rabid
               dog.

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (chewing on his glasses)
               Yes.

                         DAVID
               Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've
               been traumatized, but Jack was
               torn apart.  I saw him.  A man
               can't do that to someone with
               his bare hands.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You'd be surprised what
               horrors a man is capable of.

                         DAVID
               Did you see Jack?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               No.  In fact, your wounds were
               cleaned and dressed before you
               arrived here.

                         DAVID
               Did you talk to the police in
               East Proctor?  Did the cops go
               to The Slaughtered Lamb?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I really don't know.

                         DAVID
               Then why the hell are you so
               quick to disbelieve me?  You
               yourself said it must have
               taken incredible strength to
               tear apart a person like that.
                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (rubs his forehead)
               David, please.  The police are
               satisfied.  I'm certain that
               if a monster were out roaming
               northern England we'd have
               seen it on the telly.

                         DAVID
               You really think I'm crazy,
               don't you?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Believe me.  The Hound of the
               Baskervilles was an invention
               of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's.
               And if you'd read the bloody
               book, you'd find that Holmes
               discovered your house of hell
               a fraud, a fake.

     There is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr.
     Hirsch is embarrassed at raising his voice.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Now really, David.  You're far
               too intelligent to go on this
               way.  When you return to
               America I want you to seek out
               a competent psychiatrist or
               psychologist or something and
               stop this nonsense.  You'll be
               leaving this hospital in three
               or four days, please remain
               sane.  At least until you are
               no longer our responsibility.

     Dr. Hirsch goes to the door.

                         DAVID
               Dr. Hirsch?
                    (pause)
               I'd rather not be by myself.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Of course not, David.  I'll
               fetch in young Miss Price.

                                                  DISSOLVE

25   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     Alex sits next to David's bed.  Her shoes are off and
     she has her feet tucked up under her legs on the chair.
     The room is dark except for the lamp by which she
     reads.  She is reading A Connecticut Yankee in King
     Arthur's Court by Mark Twain.  David is asleep.  Alex
     reads for a bit, then puts down the book and yawns.
     She gets up and stretches, a big spreading arms and
     feet, fingers and toes stretch.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               You're a very beautiful girl.

                         ALEX
                    (embarrassed)
               I thought you were asleep.

                         DAVID
               I was.  What are you reading?

                         ALEX
               `A Connecticut Yankee in King
               Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.

                         DAVID
               Do you like it?

                         ALEX
               I've just started it.  My
               friend gave it to me.

     They look at each other.

                         ALEX
               What do you dream about?

                         DAVID
               I dream of death mostly.

                         ALEX
               I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have
               asked you.

                         DAVID
               It's okay.  I want to talk to
               you.

     They sit and look at each other for a while longer.

                         DAVID
               How old are you?

                         ALEX
               That's not really a very
               proper question.

                         DAVID
               How old are you?

                         ALEX
               Twenty-eight.

                         DAVID
               I'm twenty-seven.

                         ALEX
               I know.

                         DAVID
               Now what do you want to talk
               about?

                         ALEX
               Was Jack Goodman your good
               friend?

                         DAVID
                    (seriously)
               My best friend.  My very best
               friend.

                         ALEX
                    (embarrassed)
               Shall I read to you?

                         DAVID
               What?  Oh, yes, please.

                         ALEX
                    (opens book)
               A Connecticut Yankee in King
               Arthur's Court by Samuel L.
               Clemens.  This is after the
               preface but before chapter
               one: A Word of Explanation.
               You all right?

                         DAVID
                    (settles back)
               Yes, go on.

                         ALEX
                    (clears her throat)
               Ahem, A Word of Explanation.
               It was in Warwick Castle that
               I came across the curious
               stranger whom I am going to
               talk about.  He attracted me
               by three things: his candid
               simplicity, his marvelous
               familiarity with ancient
               armor, and the restfulness of
               his company - for he did all
               the talking.  We fell together
               as modest people will in the
               tail of the herd....

26   INT. KESSLER HOME - NEW YORK - NIGHT

     We are at David's parents' house in New York.  His
     FATHER sits reading the paper in the living room as his
     younger BROTHER and SISTER watch "The Muppet Show" on
     television.  We can see past the small dining nook
     where David sits doing homework and into the kitchen
     where his MOTHER is washing the dishes.  A peaceful
     lower, middle class setting.  All is tranquil and
     secure.  There is a loud pounding on the front door.

                         FATHER
               I'll get it.

     The pounding continues.

                         FATHER
               All right, all right!  Hold
               your horses.

     (The following happens with shocking speed.)  When he
     opens the door, four beings open fire with machine
     guns, blowing him away.  The sudden burst of violence
     is terrifying and unrelenting.  The four rush into the
     room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise
     for these men are not human at all, but loathsome,
     bestial demons dressed as Storm Troopers.  One kicks in
     the television and fires into the kitchen, blasting
     David's mother.  David rises but is forced back into
     his chair by one of the things and held there.

                         DAVID
               Stop!

     He watches in horror as his little brother and sister
     scream in terror before they are brutally murdered.
     The monstrous Storm Troopers then set fire to the
     rooms.  The one holding David pulls a knife and quickly
     slits David's throat.

                                                  CUT TO:

27   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     David bolts upright in bed and looks around, trying
     desperately to gain his bearings.  He sees that Alex is
     asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee
     folded on her lap.  He makes a deliberate effort to
     calm himself.  He considers waking her, then decides
     against it.  He turns on the lamp by his bed and
     reaches over to take the book from Alex's lap.  David
     takes the book as gently as possible, but Alex wakes up
     anyway.

                         ALEX
                    (yawns, smiles)
               Hello.  You all right?

                         DAVID
               I'm sorry I woke you up.

                         ALEX
               Don't be silly.  Can I get you
               something?

                         DAVID
               No, thank you.  Just keep me
               company for a while.

                         ALEX
               That's easy enough.

                         DAVID
               I keep having these really
               terrible dreams.  They are
               getting worse and I can't seem
               to stop them.

                         ALEX
               David, your dreams will stop.
               You'll leave England and your
               bad memories; and then this
               will all fade away.

                         DAVID
               Will you come with me?

                         ALEX
                    (taken aback)
               What?

                         DAVID
                    (smiling)
               I'm serious.  You don't know
               me and I know nothing about
               you.  We have a perfect
               relationship.

                         ALEX
               Now, David, I said I would
               keep you company, but I meant
               right here and now.

                         DAVID
               Will you think about it?

                         ALEX
               How did we get from your bad
               dreams to my taking a holiday
               with a patient?

                         DAVID
                    (big grin)
               Not just a patient -- me.

                         ALEX
               You're being awfully forward,
               aren't you?

                         DAVID
               Forgive me, I'm trying to
               cheer myself up and an affair
               with a beautiful nurse seemed
               like just the thing to do it.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               All I am to you is a sex
               fantasy then?

                         DAVID
               Now I'm embarrassed.

                         ALEX
               Good.  I thought for a moment
               I was the only embarrassed one
               in the room.

     There is an awkward pause.

                         DAVID
               Where were we in the book?

     Alex is relieved for something to break the tension.

                         ALEX
                    (looking through
                     the book)
               Let me see here.

                                                  FADE OUT


     FADE IN

28   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

     The black Orderly hustles in with David's breakfast
     tray, busily setting up the tray on the table over the
     bed.  He awakens the sleeping David with his activity.

                         ORDERLY
               Ah you're up.  Good morning
               and a good day to you.  We've
               quite a meal for you here this
               morning.  Bacon, oatmeal,
               orange juice, and toast with
               jam.  Good stuff there.  Now
               eat it up and I'll be back for
               the dishes when you've
               finished.

     The Orderly exits.  The drowsy David, who has been
     trying to fully wake up during the Orderly's speech,
     notices his exit.

                         DAVID
               Good morning.

     He looks at his food none too happily.  He sticks a
     spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly.

                         DAVID
                    (in mock English accent)
               Please, sir, I want some more.

     He settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his
     toast and drink his juice.  While he eats, we hear
     Jack's o.s. voice.

                         JACK (O.S.)
               Can I have a piece of toast?

     David looks over to the o.s. Jack.  Jack, behaving
     relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by
     Alex.  However, Jack's appearance makes his casual
     manner all the more surreal.  He is as we left him
     butchered on the moors.  He is covered with dried mud
     and open wounds.  Huge glistening gashes abound on his
     body.  His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn,
     and his hair is matted with blood.  In several spots he
     has already begun to rot.  He is a remarkably gruesome
     sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him
     at all.

                         JACK
                    (pleasantly)
               Nice to see you.

                         DAVID
                    (unbelieving)
               Get the fuck out of here,
               Jack.

                         JACK
               Thanks a lot.

                         DAVID
                    (horrified)
               This is too much.  I can't
               handle this.

                         JACK
               I'm aware that I don't look so
               great, but I thought you'd be
               glad to see me.

     Jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David's
     tray as David watches amazed.  Jack returns to his seat
     and takes a bite out of his toast.  David stares at
     Jack horrified.

                         JACK
               David!  You're hurting my
               feelings.

                         DAVID
                    (astounded)
               Hurting your feelings?  Has it
               occurred to you that it may be
               unsettling to have you rise
               from your grave to visit me?
               Listen to me, I'm talking to a
               hamburger!

                         JACK
               I'm sorry to be upsetting you,
               David, but I had to come.

                         DAVID
                    (aghast)
               Aren't you supposed to be
               buried in New York someplace?

                         JACK
               Yeah.  Your parents came to my
               funeral.  I was surprised at
               how many people came.

                         DAVID
                    (resigned)
               Why should you be surprised?
               You were a very well-liked
               person.

                         JACK
               Debbie Klein cried a lot.

                         DAVID
               I can't stand it.

                         JACK
               So you know what she does?
               She's so grief stricken she
               runs to find solace in Rudy
               Levine's bed.

                         DAVID
               Rudy Levine the shmuck?

                         JACK
               Life mocks me even in death.

     Jack takes another bite of toast.

                         DAVID
                    (to himself)
               I'm going completely crazy.

                         JACK
                    (loud)
               David!

                         DAVID
                    (louder)
               What?!

                         JACK
               David, now I know this may be
               hard for you, but I have to
               warn you.

                         DAVID
                    (shouting)
               Warn me?  Will you get out of
               here, you meat loaf?

                         JACK
               I'm a grisly sight, it's true;
               but I love you and that's why
               I'm here.  You've got to know.

                         DAVID
               If you love me so much, Jack,
               you'll realize how
               disconcerting it is to share
               one's breakfast with the
               living dead!

                         JACK
               We were attacked by a
               werewolf.

                         DAVID
                    (covers his ears)
               I'm not listening!

                         JACK
               On the moors, we were attacked
               by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.

                         DAVID
               Shut up, you zombie!

                         JACK
               I was murdered, an unnatural
               death, and now I walk the
               earth in limbo until the
               werewolf's curse is lifted.

                         DAVID
                    (incredulous, furious)
               What's wrong with you?  Shut
               up!

                         JACK
               The wolf's bloodline must be
               severed.  The last remaining
               werewolf must be destroyed.

                         DAVID
               Will you be quiet?!

     Jack rises and comes closer to David.

                         JACK
               It's you, David.

                         DAVID
               What?!

                         JACK
               You survived and now you shall
               continue the curse.

                         DAVID
               What are you talking about?  I
               won't accept this!  Get out!
               God damit!

                         JACK
               Remember what that guy at The
               Slaughtered Lamb said?
               `Beware the moon.'

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               Stop it, Jack.

                         JACK
               Beware the moon.  The full
               moon, David.  You've got two
               days.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               Jack, please go away.  Please
               go away.

                         JACK
               You'll stalk the streets of
               London a creature of the
               night.

                         DAVID
                    (flares up)
               You're talking like Boris
               Karloff!  It's movie dialogue!

                         JACK
               David, please believe me.  You
               will kill people, David.
               You've got to stop the
               bloodshed before it begins.

                         DAVID
                    (yells)
               Nurse!

                         JACK
               Listen to me!  Take your own
               life, David.  It's our only
               chance.

                         DAVID
               Nurse!

                         JACK
               The supernatural!  The powers
               of darkness!  It's all true.
               Take your own life!  Suicide,
               David.  Join me.

                         DAVID
                    (losing it)
               Nurse!  Oh God!  Alex!

                         JACK
               It's cold, David, and I'm so
               alone.  The undead surround
               me.  Have you ever talked to a
               corpse?  It's boring!  I'm
               lonely!  Kill yourself, David,
               before you kill others.

29   INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES' STATION - DAY

     Alex rushing down the hospital corridor.

30   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David rocking back and forth weeping.

                         JACK
               Don't cry, David.

31   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Alex rushing down hospital corridor.

32   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

                         JACK
               Please don't cry.

33   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Alex rushing to the door.

34   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - CLOSEUP

                         JACK
                    (softly in looming
                     closeup)
               Beware the moon, David.

                                                  CUT TO:

     ALEX

     as she bursts into the room.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID

     laying in bed rocking from side to side, crying softly.
     He is alone.  Alex rushes over, removes the tray, sits
     on the bed and hugs David.

                         ALEX
               David?  David!

     David pulls away sharply, his head jerking about wildly
     until he focuses on Alex's face and begins to breathe
     easier.

                         ALEX
               David, what's wrong?

     David smiles and kisses her, a real kiss.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               I'm a werewolf.

                         ALEX
               A werewolf?

     Alex holds David a moment then realizes where she is
     and backs off a little.  David composes himself.

                         ALEX
               Are you better now?

                         DAVID
               I'll let you know the next
               full moon.

                         ALEX
               You're to be discharged
               tomorrow.  Will you be all
               right?

     David takes Alex's hand.

                         DAVID
               My friend Jack was just here.

                         ALEX
               Your dead friend Jack?

                         DAVID
               Yeah.  He says that I will
               become a monster in two days.
               What do you think?

                         ALEX
               What do I think?  You mean
               about the possibility of your
               becoming a monster in two days
               or about visits from dead
               friends?

                         DAVID
               I was dreaming again?

                         ALEX
               I would think so.

                         DAVID
                    (resigned)
               Yeah, I would think so, too.

     Alex considers for a while, finally....

                         ALEX
               Do you have a place to stay in
               London?


                                                  CUT TO:

35   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

     David and Alex walking down the street.  Alex points
     out her flat and leads David up the front steps.  She
     gives him a conspiratorial look and unlocks the door.

36   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     Alex enters and David follows.  A small, utilitarian
     apartment, she flicks on the kitchen light.  David puts
     his backpack on the floor.
                         ALEX
               The kitchen.

                         DAVID
               Very nice.

     She proceeds to give the tour.

                         ALEX
               Closet.

                         DAVID
               Charming.

                         ALEX
               Bathroom.

                         DAVID
               Lovely.

                         ALEX
               The bedroom.

                         DAVID
               There is only one bed.

                         ALEX
                    (makes a face)
               David, perhaps you'd like to
               watch the telly while I take a
               shower.

     Alex enters the room and David whistles softly, rocking
     on his heels.

37   INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     David and Alex stand facing each other under the stream
     of water in the shower.

                         DAVID
               It's nice to see you.

                         ALEX
               It's nice to see you.

     MONTAGE IN SHOWER - DAY

     A sequence of soap and flesh.  Van Morrison's
     "Moondance" plays.  A montage of soapy hands on
     slippery skin.  Thighs rubbing thighs, arms and
     shoulders.  David and Alex kiss again and again and....

38   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DAY

     David and Alex in a passionate, orgasmic kiss in Alex's
     bed.  David pulls out and they lay holding each other.
     After a moment....

                         DAVID
               Alex?

                         ALEX
               Yes?

                         DAVID
               Will you be here in about
               fifteen minutes?

                         ALEX
               Of course.

                         DAVID
                    (leers)
               Good.

     Alex props herself up on one elbow.

                         ALEX
               David, you don't honestly
               believe that in reality your
               friend Jack rose from the
               grave to breakfast with you?
               Do you really?

                         DAVID
               I was awake and he was in my
               room.

                         ALEX
               But, David.

                         DAVID
                    (firm)
               I wasn't hallucinating.

     Pause.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               Tomorrow is the full moon.

                         DAVID
               That's good, Alex.  Reassure
               me.

     Alex begins kissing David's neck.

                         DAVID
               It's all right, I know I'm
               being insane.

     She kisses his shoulders, then his chest.

                         DAVID
               Okay, okay.  I'm properly
               reassured!

     Alex is now kissing his stomach, her head gradually
     lowers from frame.  David reaches back over his head to
     hold onto the headboard of the bed.

                         DAVID
                    (closing his eyes)
               This is very reassuring.  I'm
               feeling very reassured.

                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

     INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Alex is asleep holding David.  David carefully lifts
     her arm and gets out of bed.  He is naked.  He tiptoes
     out of the room and goes to the bathroom.

39   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     David lifts the toilet seat and pees.  He winces,
     hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex.  When
     he's finished peeing he goes to the sink.  The medicine
     cabinet door over the sink is open.  When David closes
     it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack
     reflected standing behind him.  (Note: This is a big
     scare.)  Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to
     rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him.
     David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes
     tightly and then reopens them.  Jack is still there in
     the mirror.  When David turns around Jack is standing
     in the doorway.

                         DAVID
                    (points a trembling
                     finger)
               You're not real.

                         JACK
               Don't be an asshole, David.
               Come here.

     David, clearly troubled, follows Jack into the living
     room.

40   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM

     Jack sits down and motions for David to sit also.  He
     does.  David's conversation is in whispers, so as not
     to wake up Alex.

                         DAVID
               What are you doing here?

                         JACK
               I wanted to see you.

                         DAVID
               Okay, you've seen me.  Now go
               away.

                         JACK
               David, I'm sorry I upset you
               yesterday, but you must
               understand what is going on.

                         DAVID
               I understand all right.
               You're one of the undead and
               I'm a werewolf.

                         JACK
               Yes.

                         DAVID
               Get out of here, Jack!

                         JACK
               David, tomorrow night is the
               full moon.  You'll change,
               you'll become....

                         DAVID
                    (interrupting)
               A monster.  I know, I know.

                         JACK
               You must take your own life
               now, David, before it's too
               late.

                         DAVID
               Jack, are you really dead?

                         JACK
               What do you think?

                         DAVID
               I think I've lost my mind.  I
               think you're not real.  I
               think I'm asleep and you're a
               part of another bad dream.

                         JACK
               You must believe me.

                         DAVID
               What, Jack?  That tomorrow
               night beneath the full moon
               I'll sprout hair and fangs and
               eat people?  Bullshit!

                         JACK
               The canines will be real.
               You'll taste real blood!  God
               damit, David, please believe
               me!  You'll kill and make
               others like me!  I'm not
               having a nice time, David!
               Don't allow this to happen
               again!  You must take your own
               life!

                         DAVID
                    (shouts)
               I will not accept this!  Now
               go away!

41   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Alex wakes up from the shouting.

                         ALEX
               David?

42   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                         JACK
                    (quietly)
               This is not pretend, David.

                         DAVID
                    (righteous)
               I will not be threatened by a
               walking meat loaf!

     Alex enters the room.

                         ALEX
               David, what's wrong?  I heard
               voices.

     David turns and sees that Jack is gone.

                         DAVID
                    (triumphant)
               It was just me, Alex.  It was
               just me.


43   EXT. EAST PROCTOR - DAY

     Dr. Hirsch is driving down the main street in his red
     M.G.  He parks in front of The Slaughtered Lamb.

44   INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - DAY

     The pub is less crowded than when we were here last.
     The Dart Player is behind the bar cleaning glasses, the
     Chess Player is still at the chessboard.  Dr. Hirsch
     enters and crosses to the bar.  As he removes his
     gloves:

                         DR. HIRSCH
               A drink for a very cold man?

     The Woman comes in from the back.

                         WOMAN
               Hello, there.  What can I get
               you?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Campari and soda would do
               nicely.

                         WOMAN
               Sorry, love.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I suppose Guinness will
               suffice.

     She serves him his beer.  As he lays down his money...

                         DR. HIRSCH
               A thousand thanks.

     After a few sips.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Nasty bit of business with
               those two young American boys.

     The Dart Player stops his wiping.

                         DART PLAYER
               I'm afraid I don't know what
               you mean, sir.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, I'm sure that's right.  A
               few weeks ago, the last full
               moon wasn't it?

     The Chess Player turns in his chair to get a good look
     at Dr. Hirsch.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I mean that escaped lunatic.
               The one that killed the boy.
               Wasn't that near here?

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (concerned)
               And where are you from, sir?

     Dr. Hirsch crosses and joins the Chess Player at his
     table.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               London.  Knight takes pawn.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               What?

     Sees that Dr. Hirsch was talking about his game....

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Oh, yes, yes.

     Dr. Hirsch points to the pentangle on the wall.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What's that?

                         WOMAN
                    (nervously)
               Oh, that's been there for two
               hundred years.  We were going
               to paint it out, but it's
               traditional, so we left it.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I see.  You've heard nothing
               about the incident?

                         DART PLAYER
               Incident?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The murder?

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Are you a police officer?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (smiles)
               No, no, hardly.  I work in the
               hospital where the Kessler boy
               was brought.

     The Dart Player and Chess Player exchange a look.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               He was talking about
               werewolves and monsters and as
               I was near here I thought....

                         DART PLAYER
               You thought what?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I thought I'd look into the
               boy's story.

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (scoffs)
               A story about werewolves - now
               really, sir.

     Dr. Hirsch eyes the Chess Player.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Would you like a game of
               chess?

45   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     We find Alex and David in an embrace by the front door.
     Alex is dressed in her nurse's uniform and David has
     jeans and a T-shirt on.  He is shoeless and obviously
     not going out.  Alex pulls away.

                         ALEX
               Let me go now, you'll make me
               late.

                         DAVID
               Do me an enormous favor?

                         ALEX
               Anything.

                         DAVID
               Tell me that it's silly of me
               to be apprehensive.

                         ALEX
               It's silly of you to be
               apprehensive.

                         DAVID
               Werewolves simply do not
               exist.

                         ALEX
                    (serious)
               David, do you want me to stay
               here tonight?

                         DAVID
               Yeah, I do, but go to work.

     He opens the door and they both go outside.

46   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - ALEX AND
     DAVID

     walk to the sidewalk.  It is rather chilly.

                         ALEX
               Listen, if you get too
               anxious, call me at the
               hospital, okay?

                         DAVID
               Okay.

                         ALEX
               I've left those pills for you.

                         DAVID
               A doper werewolf.

     They kiss again.
                         ALEX
               I'm off.  There's food in the
               fridge.

                         DAVID
               See you later.

     Alex goes off, turning for a last wave.  David stands
     looking after her when a LITTLE GIRL walking a dog
     passes by.  The dog, on seeing David, begins to growl
     and snarl.

                         DAVID
                    (to dog)
               What did I do?

     The dog begins barking ferociously, the little girl
     tugging on his leash.

                         DAVID
               Thanks a lot, dog.

     He realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back
     up the steps to find the door locked.

                         DAVID
               Wonderful.

     Cut to shot of David's bare feet on the cold stone.  He
     mutters to himself, imitating a newscaster.

                         DAVID
               An American werewolf was found
               frozen to death today in the
               heart of London, England.

     He looks around and sees that there is a small window
     ajar on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the
     ground, which can be reached by climbing a brick wall,
     which he does but not without damage to his bare toes.

     At the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on
     seeing David.  The hair stands up on its arched back
     and it glares at David, hissing and spitting.  David is
     disturbed by the cat's hostile behavior.

                         DAVID
               What did I do, cat?

     The cat is really acting fierce.  When David goes to
     pat it cautiously, it screeches and runs away.  David
     is, by this time, not amused.  David manages to pull
     himself into the window.

47   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - DUSK

     David awkwardly enters the bathroom through the tiny
     window.  Finally getting both feet on the ground, he
     steps to the sink and regards himself in the mirror.

                         DAVID
                    (weakly)
               Snarl.  Growl.  Grrrr.

     He examines his mouth, touching his canines carefully.
     After a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen.

48   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK

     David goes straight to the fridge and opens it.  He
     closes the fridge and walks into the bedroom.

49   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DUSK

     He lays down on the bed.  After a few beats of staring
     at the ceiling, he rises and goes back into the
     kitchen.

50   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK

     He reopens the fridge.

                         DAVID
               I'm not hungry.

     He closes the fridge and walks into the living room.

51   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK

     David turns on the television.  On Thames is a soccer
     match.  On BBC 1 is some truly insipid children's
     program, and on BBC 2 is a soccer match.  David
     switches off the television.

     He sits on the chair nervously, drumming his fingers
     and humming.

                         DAVID
                    (singing)
               `Moon River, wider than a mile
               I'm crossing you in style,
               Someday....'

     David gets up, goes to the front door, and flings it
     open.  It is getting dark.  David views this fearfully,
     but still not completely convinced.  He goes back
     inside and we note that the front door is not
     completely closed.  He goes back into the bathroom and
     looks into the mirror.

                         DAVID
               Fee fi fo fum, I smell the
               blood of an Englishman.

     He goes back into the living room and paces round and
     round the room like a caged animal.

52   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - NIGHT

     Alex is back with Benjamin, the little Pakistani.

                         ALEX
               How are we feeling tonight?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               No what?

                         BENJAMIN
               No!

                         ALEX
                    (smiling)
               Benjamin, have you ever been
               severely beaten about the face
               and neck?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               I thought not.

     She tucks him in.

                         ALEX
               You sleep now and have sweet
               dreams.

                         BENJAMIN & ALEX
               No!

     For the first time, Benjamin smiles.  As Alex tucks him
     in, we can clearly see the full moon outside through
     the window.

53   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT

     David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly
     clutches his head in pain.

                         DAVID
               Jesus Christ!

     He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor.

                         DAVID
                    (screams)
               What?  Christ!  What?

     He begins sweating profusely, clinging to the sides of
     his head.  He trembles violently.

                         DAVID
               I'm burning up!  Jesus!

     He rips at his shirt, tearing it off.  His body is
     dripping wet.

                         DAVID
                    (shouts out in
                     pain and fear)
               Jack!?  Where are you now, you
               fucker!?!

     As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in
     anguish.

                         DAVID
               Help me!  Somebody help me,
               please!  Jack!!

     David's hair is wringing wet.  He screams and grabs at
     his legs.

                         DAVID
                    (pleading, whimpering)
               I'm sorry I called you a meat
               loaf, Jack.

     New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body.
     He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are
     burning him.
     Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps
     for air.

     He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands.
     He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his
     torment; but it's no use.  On all fours he gives
     himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins
     to change.

     The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy
     one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves,
     the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see
     David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth
     bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his
     jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before
     our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as
     claws burst forward.

     The camera pans up to show the full moon outside
     through the window.  David's moans change slowly into
     low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the
     WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the
     room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the
     Wolf padding off into the darkness.


54   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

     A taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats.  An
     attractive couple gets out.  The Man pays the driver
     and the cab drives off.

                         WOMAN
               Which one, Harry?

                         MAN
               Number thirty-nine, but let's
               go `round the back.

                         WOMAN
               Why?

                         MAN
               Come on, we'll give Sean a
               scare.

                         WOMAN
               You're crazy, Harry.

                         HARRY
               Come on.

     Harry takes her hand and leads her around the side of
     the flats.  The apartments back up to a park and the
     two walk around to the rear.  The park is dark and
     quiet.

55   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

                         WOMAN
               Did you hear something?

                         HARRY
               Just now?

                         WOMAN
               Yes.

                         HARRY
               No.  Here we are, Sean's is
               the one....

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!  Before the Woman can scream, the
     Wolf whirls around and goes for her throat.  We can't
     see clearly, but we see enough to realize how large the
     Wolf is and that its wolfen features are twisted and
     demonic.  The Wolf savagely devours its two victims.

56   INT. SEAN'S FLAT - NIGHT

     Sean's wife is looking through their French windows out
     onto the park - a middle-aged couple.

                         WIFE
               Sean, those hooligans are in
               the park again.

                         SEAN
               Aren't you ready yet?  They'll
               be here any minute.

                         WIFE
               Something's going on out
               there.

57   INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

     Miss Gallagher is helping Mrs. Hobbs dispense
     medication into paper cups when Dr. Hirsch approaches.
     He is still wearing his overcoat.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Is Miss Price on duty this
               evening?

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Yes, Doctor.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Miss Gallagher, do you know if
               Miss Price has seen the
               Kessler boy since his release?

     Miss Gallagher is not sure how to answer.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Uh, I don't know if....

     Alex has walked up and overheard the last.

                         ALEX
               It's all right, Susan.  Yes,
               Doctor, I have.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Come to my office, Miss Price.

     Alex and Susan exchange glances as she obediently
     follows Dr. Hirsch down the hallway.

58   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

     Sean has exited the back of his flat to investigate his
     wife's complaints.  She hangs by the door.  He walks
     deeper into the park.

                         SEAN
                    (calls out)
               Is anyone there?

59   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dr. Hirsch hangs up his overcoat.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Sit down, Alex.

     Alex sits and Dr. Hirsch leans against his desk.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I was in East Proctor today.

     Alex looks confused.  Dr. Hirsch realizes the cause of
     her concern.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh dear girl, your
               extracurricular activities are
               of no consequence to me.  I
               don't give a damn who you
               sleep with.  I'm concerned
               about David.

                         ALEX
               Yes, sir.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               It's a full moon.  Where is
               he?

                         ALEX
               At my flat.  I'm off at
               midnight and....

     Dr. Hirsch picks up the phone.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The number, Alex.  Your
               number!

60   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

     Sean carefully approaches something near the trees.  He
     steps on something and looks down to see what it is.
     It is an arm.

61   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - THE
     TELEPHONE

     rings loudly.  (This is a scare.)  It continues to ring
     unanswered.

62   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dr. Hirsch waits on the phone, finally hanging up.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               He's not there.

     Alex grows worried.

                         ALEX
               He's not?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex, has David persisted in
               his werewolf fantasies?

                         ALEX
               Well, yes, but he seems to be
               more upset by the death of his
               friend.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Has his friend appeared to him
               again?

                         ALEX
               Yes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What did he say?

                         ALEX
               David says Jack comes to warn
               him.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Warn him?

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong?  Is
               this more serious than I know?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I tried to investigate the
               attack.  There are no records.
               The case was closed and now
               they've `misplaced' the file.
               David's lacerations were
               cleaned and dressed when he
               arrived here and yet
               supposedly no doctor examined
               him before I did.  The Goodman
               boy is already in the ground
               so he's no good to us.  So I
               went to the pub in East
               Proctor where I was convinced
               of two things.

                         ALEX
               Yes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               They were lying.  There were
               no witnesses, no escaped
               lunatic.  The whole community
               is hiding the truth of what
               actually happened up there.

                         ALEX
               And what else?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I think the village of East
               Proctor is hiding some dark
               and terrible secret.  I'm
               convinced that, like David,
               they believe in this werewolf.

     Alex is flabbergasted.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've absolutely no idea
               where David might be?

                         ALEX
               No.  He knows no one in
               London, besides me.  I
               shouldn't have left him alone.

     Suddenly.

                         ALEX
               Surely you're not
               suggesting....

                         DR. HIRSCH
               David has suffered a severe
               trauma.  I myself witnessed
               some form of mass neurosis in
               East Proctor.  If all the
               villagers believe that Jack
               Goodman was killed by a
               werewolf, why shouldn't David?
               And then it follows that if he
               survived an attack by a
               werewolf, wouldn't he himself
               become a werewolf the next
               full moon?

                         ALEX
                    (bewildered)
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh, I don't mean running about
               on all fours and howling at
               the moon.  But in such a
               deranged state he could harm
               himself, or perhaps others.

                         ALEX
               What shall we do?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Let's call the police and see
               if they can help us find our
               wandering boy.


63   EXT. BRICK LANE - NIGHT

     The bombed-out ruins of this unsavory part of London
     are stark and uninviting in the moonlight.  Three old
     DERELICTS are huddled around a trash can fire trying to
     keep warm.  A skinny dog is tied up beside them.  Its
     ears perk up and he growls in warning.

                         DERELICT #1
               Old Winston smells something.

                         DERELICT #2
                    (calls out)
               Who's there?

     The dog begins to whine.

                         DERELICT #2
               Let `im go.

     Derelict #1 unties Winston who takes off running in
     terror.

                         DERELICT #3
               Brave dog that.

                         DERELICT #1
                    (worried)
               Here - who's there?

     An unearthly howl shatters the night.  We've heard this
     sound on the moors.

                         DERELICT #2
               That's not Winston.

                         DERELICT #3
               Look there.

     He points out into the night.  They strain their eyes -
     something is approaching them.  They can just make out
     its size.

                         DERELICT #1
               Mother Mary of God.

64   INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

     A train SCREECHES to a halt.  (A scare.)  We are in the
     tubes of London.  Only one passenger disembarks and the
     train goes off, leaving him alone in the cavernous
     hallways.  The PASSENGER is a young man, rather well-
     dressed.  He looks about the platform, then at his
     watch.  He walks up to a vending machine to buy a
     Cadbury Chocolate Bar.

                                                  CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY STATION - LONG SHOT

     as the Passenger puts his coin in the vending machine.
     The camera is on ground level and as we watch the
     Passenger, the Wolf's legs flash by us.

                                                  CUT TO:

     CLOSEUP

     of the Passenger eating his chocolate bar.  He turns
     thoughtfully, wondering if he had heard something.
     Satisfied that he is alone, he begins his walk down one
     of the long serpentine tunnels that make up London's
     tubes.  He feels he's being followed and turns slowly
     to look.  There is no one and he continues, concerned
     about his imagination.

     watching in the darkness.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Our Passenger approaches the first escalator, pauses,
     then gets on going swiftly and silently up the moving
     stairway.

                                                  CUT TO:

     CLOSEUP - WOLF'S SNOUT

     In profile we can see its ragged, razor-sharp fangs and
     black tongue.  It waits, panting, drool falls from its
     mouth.

     BACK TO SCENE

     The Passenger reaches the landing and walks briskly
     down the long tunnel marked "Escalator to Street
     Level".  He is being followed.  He hears it and we hear
     it.  He stops, frightened.

                         PASSENGER
               Hello?

                                                  CUT TO:

     TUNNEL

     Long and empty.

     THE PASSENGER

                         PASSENGER
               Is there someone there?

     We hear the Wolf's heavy breathing.  The Passenger is
     beginning to panic.

                         PASSENGER
               I can assure you that this is
               not in the least bit amusing!

     He looks around wildly.

                         PASSENGER
               I shall report this!

     PASSENGER'S P.O.V.

     We see the Wolf at a great distance trotting down the
     tunnel towards us.

                         PASSENGER
               Good Lord.

     THE PASSENGER

     turns to flee, his jog becoming a run.  He is
     terrified.

     WOLF - CLOSEUP

     of the Wolf's running steps.

     THE PASSENGER

     frantically running, falls to the ground hard bloodying
     his nose.  He scrambles to his feet crying out in fear.
     Reaching the escalator, he begins to run up the moving
     stairs, falling several times.  He sits, panting and
     defeated, the blood trickling from his nose.

     slowly in on the increasingly horrified Passenger until
     we are in an extreme closeup of his eyes, when we:

65   CLOSEUP - A TIGER ROARING

     (A scare.)  The tiger paces in its cage and roars
     again.  We are at:

     EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY

     It is early morning and all the animals are aroused.
     We cut around to roaring cats, screeching monkeys, and
     panicky birds, etc., until we come to the Wolves' cage
     where we find David, naked and curled up on the ground
     by the cage, asleep.  David wakes up slowly.  He is
     completely naked, his body dirty, with several
     scratches on his torso and legs.  He yawns and
     stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks
     something distasteful from his teeth.  He also notices
     something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean
     them, he suddenly does a complete Stan Laurel
     discovering where he is.  He puts his hands over his
     eyes.

                         DAVID
               Wake me up, Alex.

     He slowly peaks through his fingers; he's still there.
     He stands up and looks around.

     The zoo opens and women with prams and children hustle
     about.  David sees them coming towards him, notes his
     lack of clothes, and decides it would be better for all
     concerned if they did not meet.  He looks around for a
     suitable hiding place and dashes behind some bushes.
     He crouches down so that he can't be seen, scratching
     himself on a thorn.

                         DAVID
               Ouch!

66   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     Alex sits holding David's torn T-shirt.  She is trying
     to read her book, but is just too distracted.  The
     phone rings and she runs for it.

                         ALEX
                    (excited, then
                     disappointed)
               Hello?  No, Dr. Hirsch, he
               hasn't come back yet.  Yes, I
               will, doctor, but I just feel
               so helpless sitting here doing
               nothing.  Thank you, yes,
               goodbye.

     She hangs up and looks around the empty flat.  She is
     now more worried than ever.

67   EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY

     David is still behind the bushes.  He looks to see if
     the coast is clear, then stands up and parts the
     bushes.  He steps out to confront a DOWAGER LADY.

                         DAVID
               Hello.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DOWAGER'S FACE

     Dumbfounded.

                         DAVID
               Excuse me, won't you?

     He returns to the bushes.

                                                  CUT TO:

     CLOSEUP - A GORILLA EATING

     A LITTLE BOY with four helium balloons on a string is
     staring intently at the gorilla.  The Little Boy leaves
     the monkey house and we travel with him as he looks at
     several other animals.  Eventually he comes to the Wolf
     cage.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Pssst!

     The Little Boy looks around.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Hey, kid!  Pssst.  Little boy
               with the balloons.

     The Little Boy pantomimes, "who me?"
                                                  CUT TO:

     THE BUSHES

     David cannot be seen.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Come over here.

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush replies:

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               If you come over here, I'll
               give you a pound.

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush pleads.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Two pounds?

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush reasons:

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Listen, two pounds is a lot of
               money.  It's almost five
               dollars.

                         LITTLE BOY
                    (very English)
               I don't know who you are.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               I'm the famous balloon thief.

                         LITTLE BOY
               Why would a thief want to give
               me two pounds?

                         DAVID (O.S.)
                    (losing patience)
               Come here and I'll show you.

     The Little Boy starts cautiously towards the shrubbery,
     but stops a few feet away.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
                    (pleading)
               Come on!

     The Little Boy edges forward.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               A little closer.

     When the Little Boy gets within reach, David grabs his
     balloons and uses them to cover his crotch.

                         DAVID
               Thank you.

     David runs off through the zoo, naked but for his
     balloons, startling several animal lovers.

68   EXT. PARK - DAY

     An ELDERLY COUPLE sits feeding birds, their coats
     folded nearly over the park bench.  A naked blur darts
     by, grabbing the top coat as it passes, scaring off the
     birds.

69   EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY

     The Little Boy tugs at his MOTHER'S coat.

                         MOTHER
               Yes, love?

                         LITTLE BOY
               A naked, American man stole my
               balloons.

                         MOTHER
               What?

                         LITTLE BOY
               A naked, American man -- the
               famous balloon thief.

70   EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

     The signs they always have on London newsstands
     proclaim "Man or Monster?"  Dr. Hirsch picks up a
     newspaper with its headline, "London Murder Victims
     Found Partially Devoured".

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I'll have one of those, too.

     He pays for the papers.  The second one's headline,
     "Death Toll Up To Six - New Jack The Ripper?"

71   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY - BUS STOP

     in another part of town.  The camera is on the crowd of
     fifteen or twenty people waiting for the bus.  When the
     bus pulls up, they all crowd in.  The camera goes to
     floor level and slowly examines the footwear of the
     crowded bus.  Passengers are standing in the aisle and
     the camera slowly pans on their galoshes, boots, high
     heels, rubbers, etc., until it comes to rest on a
     conspicuous pair of bare feet.  We pan up to find David
     clad only in a woman's rain coat with a fur collar
     trying to look as nonchalant as possible.  A man looks
     at him oddly.

                         DAVID
                    (cheerfully)
               A lot of weather we've been
               having lately.

     The man studies David carefully.

72   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     Alex sits in the kitchen drinking tea and reading.
     There is loud knocking on the door.  Alex rushes to
     open it and David enters quickly, closing the door
     behind him.  He is still wearing the woman's coat.

                         ALEX
               David!  Where on earth have
               you been!?!

                         DAVID
               I'm freezing.

     He goes into the bedroom and takes off the coat and
     gets dressed as Alex watches in amazement.  David is
     excited, even euphoric.

                         DAVID
               Alex, I've lost my mind.  I
               woke up at the zoo!  But you
               know what?  I feel terrific!

                         ALEX
               The zoo?

                         DAVID
               Waking up at the zoo, that's
               not so insane.  Having no
               clothes on?  That's insane.
               What did I do last night,
               Alex?

                         ALEX
               Don't you remember?

                         DAVID
               I said goodbye to you.  I was
               locked out of the flat.  I
               climbed the wall and came in
               through the bathroom window.
               I started to read and then I
               was naked at the zoo!
                    (big smile)
               I guess I am out of my fucking
               mind.

     Alex sits next to him and puts her arm around his
     shoulders.

                         ALEX
               I worried about you.  We
               didn't know where you were.

     David kisses her, a desperate kiss, and she kisses back
     with equal passion.

                         ALEX
               Where did you get that coat?

     David laughs.

73   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE

     Dr. Hirsch is dialing the phone.

74   INT. ALEX'S FLAT

     The phone rings.

                         ALEX
               I'll get it.

     Alex goes to the phone.

                         ALEX
               Hello?

     The telephone conversation is intercut between Alex and
     Dr. Hirsch.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex, have you heard anything?

     Alex speaks softly so that David won't hear her.
                         ALEX
               He's here.

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (excited)
               Is he all right?  Why didn't
               you call me?  Where was he?

                         ALEX
               He doesn't remember.  He woke
               up at the zoo.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The zoo?  Is he rational?

                         ALEX
               Yes, he is.  He's very excited
               and confused, but he's not
               crazy, if that's what you
               mean.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Have you read the papers
               today?  Have you listened to
               the radio or television?

                         ALEX
               No, why?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Is David acting strangely?

                         ALEX
               No, not really.

     Dr. Hirsch considers.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Could you get here without any
               trouble?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I should think so.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Right.  Now listen carefully.
               I want you to bring David
               here.  I want him in my care.
               I'll notify the police that
               we've found him.  It is
               imperative that you bring him
               straight to the hospital.  Do
               you understand?

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You're certain he's lucid?
               You won't need any help?

                         ALEX
               He's fine.  We'll come right
               over.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Shall I send a car?

                         ALEX
               No, a cab will be faster.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I expect you shortly.

     Dr. Hirsch hangs up, checks a piece of paper, and then
     dials again.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, Scotland Yard?


75   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

     Alex and David are walking.

                         ALEX
               The next corner we can get a
               cab.

                         DAVID
                    (grins)
               I should be committed.

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch will know what to
               do.

                         DAVID
                    (stretches)
               I don't know why I feel so
               good.  I haven't felt this
               good in a long time.

     Alex is signaling for a taxi.

                         DAVID
               My body feels alive, alert.  I
               feel like an athlete.

     A taxi pulls up; Alex opens the door.

                         ALEX
               Get in.

76   INT. TAXI - DAY

                         ALEX
               Saint Martin's Hospital.

                         DRIVER
               Right.

     As they drive.

                         DRIVER
               It's like the days of the Mad
               Barber of Fleet Street, isn't
               it?

                         ALEX
               I beg your pardon?

                         DRIVER
               The murders.

                         DAVID
                    (concerned)
               What murders?

                         DRIVER
               Last night.  Haven't you
               heard?  Six people in
               different parts of the city
               mutilated.  A real maniac this
               one.

                         DAVID
               Pull over.

                         ALEX
               But....

                         DAVID
                    (adamant)
               Pull over.

77   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

     The cab pulls to the sidewalk.

                         DAVID
               Pay the man.

     David gets out of the cab.

                         ALEX
               David, wait!

     She hurriedly hands the Driver some money and takes off
     after David.

                         ALEX
               David, what are you doing?

                         DAVID
               Six people mutilated?  It had
               to be me, Alex.

                         ALEX
               David, stop!

     He turns and faces her.

                         DAVID
               I am going to the cops.
               There's a full moon tonight.
               Jack was right.  I....

                         ALEX
                    (angry)
               Jack is dead!

                         DAVID
               Jack is dead.  Look, six
               people have been killed.  I'm
               going to the police.

     David takes off walking briskly down the street.  Alex
     has to jog to keep up with him.

                         ALEX
               David, please be rational.
               Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.

                         DAVID
               Rational!?!  I'm a fucking
               werewolf, for Christ's sake!

     He strides up to a Bobbie on the corner.

                         DAVID
               Officer, I killed those people
               last night.

                         BOBBIE
                    (interested)
               You did, did you?

     Alex runs up.

                         ALEX
               He's playing a stupid joke,
               sir.

                         DAVID
                    (dumbfounded)
               What?

                         ALEX
               We had an argument.  He's
               being silly.

                         DAVID
                    (desperate)
               I swear, I don't know this
               girl.

                         BOBBIE
               All right, you two, move
               along.

                         DAVID
               Hey, you asshole!  I want you
               to arrest me!

                         BOBBIE
               There's no call for that kind
               of language.

                         DAVID
                    (shouts)
               Queen Elizabeth is a man!
               Prince Charles is a faggot!
               Winston Churchill was full of
               shit!

                         BOBBIE
                    (losing patience)
               Now see here young man.

                         DAVID
               Shakespeare was French!  The
               Queen Mother sucks cocks in
               hell!  Shit!  Fuck!  Piss!

     The Bobbie takes David's arm roughly as pedestrians
     start to gather.

                         BOBBIE
               That's quite enough!

                         ALEX
                    (pleading)
               David, please!

                         DAVID
               Who is this girl?

                         BOBBIE
               You're going to have to stop
               this disturbance or I shall
               arrest you.

                         DAVID
                    (frustrated, yelling)
               That's what I want you to do,
               you moron!

                         ALEX
                    (to Bobbie)
               Sir, he's very upset.  His
               friend was killed and....

                         DAVID
               Will you shut up!?!!

                         BOBBIE
                    (losing his temper)
               That's enough!  Now go about
               your business.

                         ALEX
               Yes, David, let's go.

                         DAVID
                    (disbelief)
               You're not going to arrest me?

     David approaches one of the ONLOOKERS.

                         DAVID
               Don't you think he should
               arrest me?
                         ONLOOKER
               Well, I'm not sure.  How does
               he know this isn't a prank?

                         DAVID
                    (despair)
               A prank?

                         ALEX
                    (urgently)
               David....

     The Bobbie has lost all patience.

                         BOBBIE
               I've no time for this
               foolishness.
                    (to onlookers)
               Nothing to look at.  Move
               along.

     The Bobbie walks away.  David is beside himself.

                         DAVID
               Hopeless.  It's hopeless.

                         ALEX
                    (softly)
               David, let's go now.

     David turns in a rage.

                         DAVID
               Leave me alone, dammit!  You
               people are crazy!  I've got to
               get away from here!  I've got
               to do something!

                         ALEX
                    (worried)
               David, don't lose control.

                         DAVID
                    (approaching, hysteria)
               Control!?!  What control!?!
               Get away from me!

     He begins to cry.

                         DAVID
               Leave me alone!

     He runs out into the street.  Cars slam on their
     brakes, just missing him.

                         ALEX
               David, wait!

     It's too late.  He's lost in traffic.  Alex stands for
     a moment not knowing which way to turn.

78   EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     David is running in panic.  He finally comes to rest in
     an alley.  He sits down and sobs uncontrollably.

79   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY

     Alex sits distraught in the chair opposite the desk.
     Dr. Hirsch is talking to Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               The forensic lads seem to feel
               that some sort of animal was
               involved, that's true, but I
               hardly think....

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (interrupts)
               Regardless of what you think,
               Lieutenant, the fact remains
               that David is missing and that
               we must find him.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Before nightfall.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Precisely.

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (harried)
               Gentlemen, please.  We shall
               find Mr. Kessler as quickly as
               we're able.

                         ALEX
               He tried to have himself
               arrested.  He....

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (interrupts)
               Getting arrested isn't all
               that difficult, Miss Price.

                         ALEX
               He wants help.  He....

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (interrupts)
               What can we do to assist you?

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (rising)
               Stay here.  If we need you,
               we'll know where to reach you.

     He and Sgt. McManus pause by the door.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               I cannot accept a connection
               between David Kessler and last
               night's murders.  We will find
               him, however.  I can assure
               you of that.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               We'll find him, not to worry.

     The two policemen exit.  Dr. Hirsch looks at Alex.

                         ALEX
                    (distraught)
               What shall we do?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (comforting)
               Tea would be nice.

80   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - DAY

     David is in a telephone booth.

                         DAVID
               Yes, operator.  I'd like to
               call the United States and
               reverse the charges.  David
               Kessler for anyone.  Yes, I'll
               wait.  Hello?  Yes, area code
               315/472-3402.  Thank you.
                    (pause)
               Hello?  Rachel?  Just say yes,
               you'll accept the charges.
               Just say yes, Rachel.  Is Mom
               or Dad home?  Where are they?
               Where's Max?  You're all
               alone?  Mom and Dad wouldn't
               leave me alone when I was ten.
               No, not ten and a half either.
               I'm still in London.  I'm all
               better.  Look, would you tell
               Mom and Dad that I love them?
               I don't care, Rachel, just do
               it for me.  Okay?  Good.  And,
               Rachel, don't fight with Max.
               Well, try.  Look, kid, please
               don't forget to tell Mom and
               Dad I love them.  I love Max
               and you, too.  Well, I do.
               No, I'm not being weird, you
               little creep.  You promise?
               Okay.  Be a good girl.  I love
               you.  Bye.

     He hangs up in profound depression.  Leaving the booth
     he sees an outdoor clock.  It is 4:15.  He sighs, then
     catches sight of something.

81   EXT. CINEMA - DAY - DAVID'S P.O.V.

     There stands Jack, now truly rotted and ghastly.  He's
     pretty much dried out, a third of his face gone
     revealing the grinning skull.  He waves to David.  Jack
     points inside the theater and goes in.  David smiles,
     walks across the intersection, and up to the box
     office.

                         TICKET LADY
               Two and a half quid, please.

     David reaches in his pocket.  All he has are traveler's
     checks.

                         DAVID
               Will you take a traveler's
               check?

                         TICKET LADY
               No, sorry.

     David signs a $100 check and hands it to her.

                         DAVID
               Keep the change.

                         TICKET LADY
               Well, thank you, sir!

     She gives him a ticket.  David goes in.

82   INT. CINEMA - DAY

     A film (to be determined) plays on screen.  The small
     theater is mostly empty.  A few snoring BUMS and wide-
     eyed CHILDREN are scattered about.  Jack sits in the
     last row in the shadows.  He waves to David.  David
     goes and sits next to him.

                         DAVID
               Hi, Jack.

                         JACK
               Hi, David.

     They sit for a while watching the screen.

                         DAVID
               What can I say, Jack?

                         JACK
               You don't have to say
               anything.

                         DAVID
               Aren't you going to say, `I
               told you so'?

                         JACK
               If I was still alive, I
               probably would.

                         DAVID
               You look awful.

                         JACK
               Thank you.

                         DAVID
                    (apologizes quickly)
               I didn't mean it.  I don't
               know what I'm saying.  I'm not
               even sure it was me who killed
               those people.  I don't
               remember doing it.

                         JACK
               What about the zoo?

                         DAVID
               Well, even if I'm not the
               wolfman, I am crazy enough to
               do something like that.  I
               mean, here I sit in Leicester
               Square talking to a corpse.
               I'm glad to see you, Jack.

                         JACK
               I want you to meet some
               people.

     Sitting down the row from Jack is a man, GERALD
     BRINGSLY, completely in the shadow.

                         JACK
               David Kessler, this is Gerald
               Bringsly.

                         DAVID
               Hello.

                         JACK
               Gerald is the man you murdered
               in the subway.  We thought it
               best you didn't see him as
               he's a fresh kill and still
               pretty messy.

                         BRINGSLY
                    (in shadow; very English)
               Yes, I do look most
               unpleasant.

     The camera pans down to show the blood dripping from
     the seat to a puddle on the floor.

                         DAVID
                    (horrified)
               Why are you doing this to me,
               Jack?

                         BRINGSLY
               This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea.
               He is your good friend,
               whereas I am a victim of your
               carnivorous lunar activities.

                         DAVID
                    (appalled)
               Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry.  I
               have absolutely no idea what
               to say to you.

                         BRINGSLY
               You've left my wife a widow
               and my children fatherless.
               And I understand that I am to
               walk the earth one of the
               living dead until the wolf's
               bloodline is severed and the
               curse lifted.

     Bringlsy leans forward almost into the light, he
     glistens.

                         BRINGSLY
               You must die, David Kessler.

                         JACK
               David, this is Harry Berman
               and his fiancee Judith Browns.

     The two victims lean forward from their seats next to
     Mr. Bringsly.  We can just make out that Harry has one
     arm missing.

                         JACK
               And these gentlemen are Alf,
               Ted, and Joseph.

     The Three Derelicts sit next to Harry and Judith.  All
     are slick in the darkness, the light from the screen
     illuminating their gore.

                         DERELICT #2
               Can't say we're pleased to
               meet you, Mr. Kessler.

                         DAVID
                    (defeated)
               What shall I do?

                         JACK
               Suicide.

                         HARRY
                    (adamantly)
               You must take your own life!

                         DAVID
               That's easy for you to say -
               you're already dead.

                         BRINGSLY
               No, David.  Harry and I and
               everyone you murder are not
               dead.  The undead.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               Why are you doing this to me?

                         JACK
               Because this must be stopped.

                         DAVID
               How shall I do it?

                         JUDITH
               Sleeping pills?

                         DERELICT #1
               Not sure enough.

                         DAVID
               I could hang myself.

                         JACK
               If you did it wrong, it would
               be painful.  You'd choke to
               death.

                         DERELICT #3
               So what?  Let `im choke.

                         JACK
               Do you mind?  The man's a
               friend of mine.

                         DERELICT #3
               Well he ain't no friend of
               mine.

                         BRINGSLY
               Gentlemen, please.

                         HARRY
               A gun.

                         DERELICT #1
               I know where he can get a gun.

                         DAVID
               Don't I need a silver bullet
               or something?

                         JACK
               Be serious, would you?

     David puts his head in his hands.

                         DAVID
               Madness.  I've gone totally
               mad.

                         HARRY
               A gun is good.

                         JUDITH
               You just put the gun to your
               forehead and pull the trigger.

                         BRINGSLY
               If you put it in your mouth,
               then you'd be sure not to
               miss.

                         DAVID
               Thank you, you're all so
               thoughtful.

     As the conversation continues, the camera pulls back
     from the grisly tableau.  David grabs his head
     suddenly.


                                                  CUT TO:

83   EXT. BIG BEN - NIGHT

     The clock strikes eleven.  The full moon is up.

84   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     David is dripping wet and shaking violently.  Three
     small children, the oldest nine, stand in the aisle
     staring at him.

                         DAVID
                    (gasps out in anguish)
               Go away!  Please!  Go away!

     The children watch, fascinated as David's seizures grow
     more severe.

                         DAVID
                    (his face contorting)
               Run!  Please...run.

     His hands clutch the arms of his chair.  Coarse thick
     hair splits his skin.  The children's eyes widen in
     fascination.

85   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     Roars and screams come from inside the theater.  The
     TICKET TAKER at the door says to the Ticket Lady:
                         TICKET TAKER
               I'll check on the house.

     He goes inside the theater.

86   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The Ticket Taker enters the theater.  The movie
     continues on screen, but all else is quiet.  He
     cautiously continues down the aisle.  He sees something
     and makes his way towards it.  He looks down in horror.

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!

                                                  CUT TO:

87   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT

     From way up high we look down on the sidewalks and
     single out TWO BOBBIES running furiously to the cinema
     through the busy traffic.

88   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The two cops run up, the Ticket Lady is hysterical.

                         TICKET LADY
               It's horrible, horrible!
               There's a beast!  A mad dog!
               It's killing people in there!

     One cop stays with the lady, the other rushes inside.

89   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The cop enters a side door to find several bloodied
     corpses.  He hears something, looks over to see the
     Wolf hunched over a victim.  The Wolf turns, eyes
     blazing, mouth dripping with blood.  We see it clearly
     for the first time.  It is truly a hound from hell, its
     wolfen features a hideous sight.  Its eyes fierce,
     burning green.  The Wolf roars and starts for the cop.
     The cop rushes out and slams the door behind him.

90   EXT. CINEMA

     As the cop bolts the door shut.

                         COP #1
               For God's sake, Tom, there's a
               monster in there!
     The doors shudder as the Wolf begins to batter them
     down.  The cops strain to keep them shut.

                         COP #1
               Call for assistance and tell
               them to bring guns.

     Pedestrians start milling around.  The door is bulging.
     The Wolf's roars continue.

                         COP #2
               Keep moving!  Will you people
               get out of the way!

91   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Alex is asleep.  Dr. Hirsch wakes her.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Nurse Hobbs said there's a
               disturbance in Leicester
               Square involving some sort of
               mad dog.

                         ALEX
               David?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I doubt it.  But it's
               something to do.

92   INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     An officer unlocks a rack of rifles which are
     distributed to uniformed men.

93   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     Police cars arrive, sirens blaring.  Officers are
     pushing the crowd back as other men help hold the door
     closed against the Wolf's battering.

     Another police car pulls up and out steps Lt. Villiers
     and Sgt. McManus.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               What the hell is going on
               here?

                         COP
               It's some kind of animal, sir.
               We....
     Suddenly the doors splinter apart and there stands the
     Wolf, eyes blazing.  It leaps on Lt. Villiers, savaging
     him.  The crowd falls back in panic.

     The Wolf runs into traffic, a cab swerves to avoid
     hitting it and plows into fleeing pedestrians hurling
     one through a shop window.  Mass confusion as orders
     are shouted and the police pursue the Wolf.

     It runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac.  It stops
     in the darkness, blocked by a brick wall.  The Wolf
     whirls around, defiant, roaring.  The cops quickly
     barricade the entrance to the alley.

94   INT. TAXI - NIGHT

     The taxi is halted by the traffic jam in Leicester
     Square.  Police vehicles roar past.

                         ALEX
               David!  It's David!

     She jumps from the car before Dr. Hirsch can stop her.


95   EXT. CUL DE SAC - NIGHT

     The police arrive with weapons and efficiently ring the
     alley.  Alex runs to them.

                         ALEX
               Let me through!

                         COP
               Stand clear, miss!

                         ALEX
               I must get through!

     Alex dodges the cop and runs into the alley.  The
     officers shout after her.  Dr. Hirsch reaches the
     police line.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex!

     Alex walks towards the dark end of the alley.

                         ALEX
               David?  Is it you?  Is it
               true, David?

     She's almost to the end.  The Wolf lays in wait in the
     shadows.  The police raise their weapons.

                         ALEX
               David?

     THE WOLF REARS UP.  In that brief instant, Alex
     realizes it will kill her.

                         OFFICER
               Fire!

     The guns blaze.  The Wolf falls dead.  Alex leans on
     the wall, numb.  The cops, Dr. Hirsch, and Sgt. McManus
     run to the dead Wolf only to find David, naked and
     riddled with bullets.  Alex begins to weep.
