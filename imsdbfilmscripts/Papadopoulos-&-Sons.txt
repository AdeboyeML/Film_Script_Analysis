    A very English scene - a beautiful English garden belonging to a
    mansion house. A smartly turned out gardener in green overalls
    is raking leaves. It's an impressive picture of Britishness and
    order. Another gardener, DAVE is trimming the edge of the lawn.
    We see shots of the garden; plants, trees, a gazebo, sundial,
    water fountain etc. We follow one of the gardeners pushing a
    wheelbarrow across the width of the lawn and we see the rear of
    this impressive property.

    children are smartly turned out. The chauffeur gets out and

              all things Greek. From taramasalata to
              olive oil and frozen mousakas - which,
              I must admit, my wife and I are
              partial to occasionally. Not one to
              settle, Harry's made the move into
              commercial property where he's about
              to embark on one of the most audacious
              developments yet - Papadopoulos Plaza.

               no, no. I want to help you. All of
               you. So I prayed for guidance. I
               asked the Universe. Please help me.
               Please help me help these people.
               And I must've fallen asleep not
               long after. A crazy sleep. And then
               this dream. Banayia mou. There was
               this, this music. The most
               incredible music. And you and me

               yield of the Plaza. Papadopoulos
               Plaza. Fully developed with a thousand
               year lease. I would have kept the
               freehold. I'm telling you Spiro. It
               was good. I'd have been worth a
               fortune. Worth, I don't know. One

     We are in front of the shop. SPIROS addresses a small gathering
     of people who have turned up to help in the renovation. He holds
     a bottle of champagne. Alongside him, HARRY carries the box of
     cleaning products. We see JAMES, KATIE, THEO and MRS PARRINGTON.
     We see FAT LAKI, PHIL THE TILL, FATHER JIMMY, a Greek Orthodox
     priest and an assortment of Greek faces of various ages.

               We were children when we came to
               the UK with nothing. We start
               again. Fat Laki. The weight you
               lost is an inspiration. Phil The
               Till. You've helped many Greeks
               with your tax friendly till
               machines. Eh, only two things are
               certain in life - death and taxes.
               Unless you're Greek. Then it's only
               death! (The crowd cheer). Nikos,
               Kyriaco, Androniki, Loula, Uncle

     journey - all the way through the shop to outside, where we
     see HARRY sitting alone in the van. He's not part of the
     activity. We see scrubbing, cleaning, fixing. Boards are
     taken down. Inside we see people painting and the fish fryer
     cleaned. We see product displays go up. We see SPIROS with
     manic and crazy enthusiasm. JAMES and KATIE messing around.
     Finally, we see FATHER JIMMY splashing holy water, saying a
     prayer and making the sign of the cross over the fish frying
     range while others stand and watch the ceremony with respect.

     HARRY is back at the old house. There is an 'Auction' sign at
     the entrance. We see a skip. We see him peering in through a
     window. He walks over to the skip and looks in. He climbs in.
     Inside the skip among old cardboard boxes, a broken chair etc he
     finds a selection of plants - some of them in pots. He picks one
     up, the one with the distinctive Union Jack pot, and brushes the
     leaves. We then see him walk off with a box of plants.

               back to the shop and let me cook you
               something to eat. Go on. We're doing
               great business. I'm actually thinking
               of expanding.

               That's, that's very good. I'm happy
               for you. If this is success.

               What is success Rob? What is it?
               We've both had it. What is it? Is
               it the share price? Is it the
               profit earnings ratio? Is it a
               beautiful car.

               all.

                         HARRY
               Yeah, I have. And I can tell you.
               Success is... the joy you feel.
               That's it. That's all it is.
               Success is the joy you feel!

               Okay. I'm sorry I shouted at you.

     HARRY starts to clap to the music. The others start to clap and
     form a circle around him. Everyone enjoys the audacity of what
     HARRY is doing as he starts to dance by himself. People passing
     by stop to witness the spectacle. HARRY is in the middle,
     dancing by himself. The camera pulls back as the party of people
     clapping come together in a circular farandole which takes over
     the street.
