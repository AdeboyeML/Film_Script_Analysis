          INT. COLLEGE DORM ROOM - DAY

          Sunlight pours through the window of an empty, silent dorm
          room. The room seems alive, somehow. As if it's waiting
          patiently for this year's kids.
          A long beat. The room darkens for an instant. Just the sun,
          right, dipping behind a cloud? Maybe.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

          OVER CREDITS, we PAN DOWN a hallway full of COLLEGE KIDS.
          They carry boxes, stereo speakers, stand around chatting.

          EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

          SARA MATTHEWS, 18, gets out of a taxi in front of a dorm.
          She's pretty, with optimistic eyes and brown hair cut just
          above her shoulders. She's dressed casually, but still chic.
          No parents.
          She carries a backpack on one shoulder, a duffle bag on the
          other, and a huge suitcase in her hand. And she's staring
          through the building's window at...
          Newly-minted COLLEGE STUDENTS milling about inside. Their
          parents in tow, pride and sadness mingled in their faces.

          INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY

          Sara walks to the registration table. A RESIDENT ASSISTANT
          smiles up at her.

                         SARA
          Hi. Sara Matthews.
          She looks her up in the computer. She plays with a simple
          silver chain around her neck.

          R.A.
          Des Moines, Iowa. Wow. Flyover
          country.
          She says it nicely, but it still stings. Sara smiles gamely.

          R.A.
          You're in room three-sixteen.
          Welcome.
          She hands Sara a room key. She fingers it, smiling.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

          ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN ON Sara as she...
          Pushes an ancient, flat-bed cart out of the elevator and down
          the hall, struggling to control its wobbly wheels. She bumps
          into other carts, but everyone just laughs it off.
          Sara stops in front of Room 316.

          INT. DORM DOORWAY - DAY

          She opens the door and looks in on:
          A run-of-the-mill freshman dorm room. Tiny; bathroom down the
          hall; twin beds. Heaven.
          Sara steps in. She looks at the two empty beds. Big choice
          here. She drops her stuff on the bed by the window.
          She sits down on it. A beat. I'm really here.
          First things first -- Sara takes a framed picture out of her
          duffle bag and sets it on the dresser. It's a picture of a
          YOUNG GIRL, maybe ten. She looks a little like Sara.
          Sara hauls a white, Styrofoam DESIGN MANNEQUIN off the cart.
          It's full of pin and chalk marks. She sets it by her bed.

                         SARA
          Told you we'd make it.
          She steps back to the doorway. As she hauls her suitcase off
          the cart... BOOM! Another cart slams into hers. A box tumbles
          off the other cart.

                         GIRL
          Sorry! Bad driver.
          Sara kneels to help the other girl -- cute, frizzy hair --
          clean up the mess. A slew of clothes lie on the carpet. And
          peeking out from under them... a bottle of vodka. The girl
          smiles sheepishly.

                         GIRL

          EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY

          A gorgeous fall day. Sara strolls across the quad, taking it
          all in. Kids tossing frisbees... hacky-sacking... sunning on
          the grass. Music pours out of speakers mounted in dorm
          windows.

          EXT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY

          Sara's cell phone buzzes. She answers it.

                         SARA
          Hey. Yeah, it's amazing here. I met
          this really cool biker? He's taking
          me to Mexico this weekend.

          Sara stops in front of the campus coffee shop. She eyes a
          work/study ad on the wall.

                         SARA
          Everything's great.

          She tears a tab off the flyer.

          INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Sara's half-settled in now. The wall beside her bed is
          peppered with fashion pages ripped out of Vogue and In Style.
          She sits in a lounge chair, paging through a Vanity Fair
          photo shoot. She spots a cool outfit and tears out the page.
          A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Sara walks over. She opens it
          expectantly to see...

          I don't know... I might just hang
          and wait for my roommate.
          Groans all around. "Come on"... "Lame-O"... Sara bites her
          lip, considering. She smiles.

                         SARA
          Alright. Just let me change.
          The girls cheer.

          EXT. PSI U. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Establishing shot of a proud frat house. Students piled on a
           giant porch and there's a long line going up the steps to the
          front door. Music blasts out of the windows.

          INT. PSI U. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

          Sara, Tracy, Kim and the others from the floor are at the
          head of the line, stepping into the house. They're met by a

          FRAT BOUNCER.

                         TRACY
          For a frat party?! Seriously?
          He holds up a handful of ugly lime-green wristbands. Kim
          steps around him.

                         KIM
          I don't drink anyway.

          beer over there...
          He points to a table with a giant bowl and cups. No one is
          around it.
          Tracy tries to flirt with the bouncer.

                         TRACY
          Come on, just us. We won't tell.
          The bouncer is tempted but not budging.

                         BOUNCER
          Honestly, I'm just a pledge.
          They'll kick me out.
          She stomps by him.

                         TRACY
          Wuss.
          Defeated, Tracy walks over to the table. Turns back to Sara.

                         TRACY
          You want something to drink?

                         SARA
          What's the point?
          Tracy huffs as Sara walks into A SEA OF KIDS. We're talking
          extreme fire hazard... extreme moral hazard.
          Sara moves through the crowd. Her clothes are low-wattage,
          but stylish. She's drawn to the music coming from a large
          room.
          A HIGH-ENERGY COLLEGE BAND on stage. They're not very good,
          but they don't care. Sara finds a spot along the wall and
          watches them. In particular --
          THE DRUMMER. A cute goof, spastically whaling away. He's
          mouthing the lyrics, eyes closed. Really into it. Sara
          chuckles at the sight, not taking her eyes off him. He
          definitely stands out.
          Suddenly, a hand grabs her shoulder. Tracy pulls herself in
          with Kim close behind and they start dancing to the band.
          Juice spilling over the brim of her cup. Sara stays by the
          wall, afraid of getting any spilled on her.

          To this?

                         TRACY
          They're not that bad.
          Tracy pulls Sara deeper in the crowd. Now all three start
          jumping up and down to the music. Sara's getting into it as
          Tracy chugs her drink.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE - DANCE FLOOR - LATER

          A DJ rules the room now. Sara and Kim are dancing with
          others from the floor. Sara notices a speck of punch on her
          shirt. She stops dancing. Wets her fingers and tries to rub
          it out.

                         SARA
          Crap.
          Kim still dances as Sara starts to look around.

          Where's Tracy?

                         KIM
          She was getting more punch.
          Sara then spots Tracy, with a full cup, precariously climbing
          onto the stage next to the DJ's table with a bunch of other
          girls already dancing. She starts dancing suggestively,
          egging on the crowd.

                         SARA
          Uh oh.
          Guys yell out. "Show em." Several hands armed with camera
          phones stretch out above the crowd.

          stage. Tracy is dancing, getting into it. She grabs the
          bottom of her shirt. Teases the crowd.

          inadvertently dumps his whole beer down her shirt. Sara
          gasps.

                         STEPHEN
          Damn!
          Sara's drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd.
          Camera phones clicking all at once. Sara looks up.

          To spill beer on you so I can start

          She looks at him. Pretty good looking. Goofy smile. It's
          hard to be mad at him. She then grabs a beer out of a
          dancing partier's hand and dumps it on Stephen.

                         SARA
          I'll get over it.

          the punch.

          It's pretty good.
          She drinks some more.

                         SARA
          It doesn't taste that strong.

                         STEPHEN
          Exactly.
          He takes a drink of his beer as Sara takes a long chug of
          hers.

          Stephen and Sara are dancing. She's holding her cup.

          grabs her hand, pulling her back towards him and TWIRLS her,
          bringing her close. She notices, for the first time, that
          he's not wearing a wristband and grabs his wrist with her

          Holding up a cup of punch.

          They spot Tracy propped up against the railing at the bottom
          of the stairs. Sara rushes over to her. A couple frat boys
          stand over her. Not sure what to do with her.

          ANOTHER GIRL step forward and grab Tracy.

          him... and now it's her turn to take a deep breath which
          suddenly makes her a little more queasy.

          Sara heads for her room, holding onto the wall as she goes.

          little moonlight through the window. Sara knocks into her
          lounge chair.

                         SARA
          Ow!
          She reaches her bed and plops down on her back. Breathing
          hard. Clenching her eyes shut. The room is spinning. She may
          puke at any second.
          She struggles to sit up. She fumbles for the lamp next to her
          bed, almost knocking it over. She hits the switch, revealing:
          The other bed.
          Sara screams.

          Rebecca, up and about, arranging her side of the room. In the
          light of day, we see that she's a knockout.
          Mellow music plays through top-of-the line speakers that
          flank an awesome stereo system.

          Borrow anything you want. Really. I
          haven't worn half of them.
          Sara reverently fingers through them. Chloe. De La Renta.
          Alexander McQueen. Jimmy Choo shoes. A Miu Miu handbag. Some
          still carry their price tags.

          She watches PROFESSOR ROBERTS -- long-haired, dashing --
          lecture his students.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          So... here we are. Design 101. And
          each one of you is asking yourself
          the same question...

          Who is this guy? Why should I turn

          Mild laughter from the class.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          I'll tell you why -- because I hold
          the keys to the kingdom. Think of
          your favorite designers. Marc
          Jacobs. Vera Wang. Rick Owens.
          Magicians, right? I've got news for
          you: All of their magic stems from

          Tracy.
          Tracy loves it. They dance together as Sara watches, smiling.
          Tracy and the handsome guy drift further away from Sara.
          Sara is now dancing by herself. A GUY moves in on her, but
          she politely dances away. She scans the dance floor for
          Tracy. Where'd she go?

          EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

          A bummed Sara walks out of the club alone. She rubs her arms
          against the chill. She nervously tugs on her silver chain as
          she scans the STRAGGLERS loitering outside.

                         SARA

                         (LOUD)
          Tracy.
          She takes one last peek into the club doorway, hoping against
          hope that Tracy will magically appear. No luck.
          She starts walking down the street, away from the club.
          Weary and unnerved.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca lies in bed, wide awake in the dark. Her cell phone
          rings. She stares at it. Two more rings. She picks it up.

                         REBECCA

          Yes.
          She smiles.

          EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

          An old school gas station on a barren corner of the city. No
          cars in either direction. A lone white 328i BMW with a black
          soft top sits next to an ancient pump.
          Rebecca, half asleep, climbs out and grabs the nozzle,
          sticking it in the fuel tank. Starts pumping.

          MAN (0.S.)
          Can I help you out?
          She turns to see a 20-year-old, good-looking gas station
          attendant. His name tag: "Rick".
          Rebecca sizes him up.

          I'm fine. Just in a hurry.
          She keeps pumping. Speeding it up. Rick ambles up to her,
          treading beyond appropriate personal space. He points to the
          "Full Service" sign.

                         RICK
          Just doing my job.
          She stands her ground as he places his hand over hers on the
          gas pump and squeezes. She looks down at his hand on top of
          hers. Then lets go of the pump, nudging his hand away.

                         REBECCA
          All done.
          She pulls the nozzle out of the tank and tries to place it
          back at the pump. He stops her. Motions to her face.

                         RICK
          You have a little something.
          No, she doesn't.
          He, ever so gently, rubs his index finger and thumb on her
          cheek to remove the imaginary smudge until he lurches back.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          The hell?
          His crotch is wet as gasoline drips from the nozzle.

                         REBECCA
          Sorry.
          But she does it again, holding the lever down, dousing him
          head to toe. He scrambles backward out of range.

                         REBECCA (CONT'D)
          Sorry again. Rick.
          The nozzle's still in her hand, pouring gas in every
          direction. She opens her car door, grabbing a lighter.
          Rick's pissed. Charges towards her.

                         RICK
          You spoiled c---
          He spots the lighter in her hand. Dead stop. She
          absentmindedly flicks it. It sparks but doesn't light.

          The gas is now pouring towards him. The meter on the pump is
          still ticking up.
          He scrambles again as she casually flips the lighter at him
          and drops the still pouring nozzle.
          A hint of a grin and a pitying shake of her head as she pulls
          out a loose hundred dollar bill. Places it on top of the
          pump.

                         REBECCA
          Pussy.
          She gets into her car and drives off. Leaving Rick soaked in
          gasoline.

          INT./EXT. DINER - NIGHT

          Sara sits by herself in a booth by the window. Hugging a cup
          of hot, sobering coffee.
          Rebecca's car pulls up into a parking spot. The headlights
          shine right in Sara's eyes... and now turn off.
          Sara's tired eyes light up as she sees Rebecca get out of the
          car. She waves. Rebecca doesn't wave back as she heads for
          the door.

          Rebecca walks up to Sara's booth.

          No idea, I couldn't find her.
          Rebecca sits down, dropping her purse and keys on the table.

          Rebecca leads Sara through the sculpture room.

                         REBECCA
          These are the modern pieces. A
          little wilder than the old stuff.
          She's a savvy tour guide, confident, at ease. She doesn't
          just walk past pieces -- she studies them. Sara's impressed.
          Sara's cell phone buzzes. She checks the display: "Jason".
          She tilts it so that Rebecca can see and rolls her eyes. She
          buries her cell phone in her purse.
          Sara spots a bizarre metal structure and walks over to it.

          Okay, I have no idea what this is

          INT. MOCA - LATER

          Rebecca shows Sara into a room full of paintings. In the
          background is a banner announcing an upcoming Richard Prince
          exhibition.

          They stop in front of Richard Prince's "Nurse of
          Greenmeadow." It's a portrait of a woman in a nurse's mask.
          Her eyes peer directly at the viewer. Blood is smeared on her
          smock.

                         REBECCA
          This is my favorite.
          Sara steps closer to examine it. Rebecca stays behind her.

                         REBECCA
          I love how he captures her
          personality through her eyes. It's
          like she really wants to help you.
          Rebecca's hands tug anxiously at her shirt. She really wants
          Sara to like this painting.
          Sara moves even closer. She squints, trying to see what
          Rebecca sees. The woman's expression in the painting is
          actually pretty sinister.
          Sara's a little freaked out... but she turns to see Rebecca's
          hopeful expression. Sara brightens.

                         SARA
          Amazing. I love it.

          EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

          Sara and Rebecca window shop along a block of thrift stores.
          Sara spots a graffiti-laden wall next to a tattoo parlor.
          Some first-rate tagging here -- bright colors, funky shapes.

                         SARA
          That is so cool.

          loves Rick." Nothing like this.
          Rebecca pulls out her camera.

                         REBECCA
          Hey, smile.
          Sara poses... but now grabs Rebecca and pulls her in.

          They both hold the camera, extended at arm's length. Rebecca
          clicks. She looks at the picture. She can see the tattoo
          parlor in the background.

                         REBECCA
          Now that's one "art form" I don't
          get. Needles into skin? No thanks.

                         SARA
          I have a tattoo.
          Rebecca smiles. Yeah, right. But she can see in Sara's eyes
          that she's serious.

                         REBECCA
          Really?
          Sara pulls down her shirt and sweater a bit to reveal, over
          her heart, a simple tattoo: "Emily".

                         SARA
          My older sister. She died when I
          was nine.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca takes down a few of her drawings. In their place, she
          puts up a big "Coyote Ugly" poster. She straightens it out.
          Satisfied.
          She checks her watch and walks to the window. She looks out,
          anxious for Sara to come home.
          She looks over at Sara's side of the room. Curious, she
          starts perusing her things. Books... CDs...
          She walks to Sara's dresser and picks up the picture of
          Emily. She tenderly brushes Emily's face with her thumb.
          She spots Sara's silver chain. She picks it up and places it
          around her neck. She fingers it carefully and looks at
          herself in the mirror. She smiles.

          Sara finishes off her run strong, striding out the last ten
          yards to the dorm. She catches her breath and hears a kitten.
          Sara looks in-between the columns outside the dorm and finds
          a STRAY KITTEN. She's cute as they come, a black-and-white
          furball.

          protectively.

                         SARA
          This was my sister's.

                         REBECCA
          Oh.
          Sara looks at it a moment longer. She looks at Rebecca.

                         SARA
          You can borrow anything of mine.
          Except for this. Okay? It's the
          only thing I kept of hers.
          Rebecca nods. Sara sits down on the bed next to her.

                         REBECCA
          I'm really sorry.

                         SARA
          It's okay. You didn't know.

                         REBECCA
          Were you two close?

                         SARA
          Yeah. You're the first roommate
          I've had since she died. So, it
          feels a little odd.

          A good way.

          EXT. CAMPUS QUADS - MORNING

          Establishing of life at the quads.

          INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY

          A cool college hangout lined with old wooden tables and comfy
          couches. More like a living room than a coffee shop. Lots of
          laid-back STUDENTS and...
          One stressed-out Sara, dropping drinks off at a table and now
          rushing back to the register for the next order. Her CO-
          WORKER, clearly stoned, moves in slow motion. Not a care in
          his world.

                         SARA

                         (TO CUSTOMER)
          You wanted a mocha smoothie, right?
          O.K. Do you know what's in that?
          The kid shrugs. Sara hops to the blender and guesses some
          ingredients. She starts it up. She takes her hand off the
          lid, and...
          THE BLENDER EXPLODES, splashing mocha smoothie all over her
          apron. She's frozen in shock. The co-worker casually hands
          her a towel. She snatches it. She turns to find...
          STEPHEN, standing at the front of the line.

                         STEPHEN
          This seems like a pattern.
          Sara smiles. She's psyched to see him, in spite of the havoc.
          She leans in and speaks quietly.

                         SARA
          Just because I kissed you doesn't
          mean I'll let you cut in line.

                         STEPHEN

          Hey, the gentlemen of Psi Upsilon
          are reviving a sacred tradition
          tonight.
          Sara stares at him blankly. He smiles.

                         STEPHEN
          We're having another keg party.

                         SARA
          I.. dunno. I'm still having
          flashbacks from the last one.
          Sara laughs.

                         STEPHEN
          You know what? How about if I use
          you as my excuse not to go.
          Sara smiles, bits of smoothie dripping from her apron.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

          Sara walks off the elevator, still sky-high. She walks
          through the lounge, where Tracy sits on the couch. A
          television plays in the background.

                         TRACY
          Hey.
          Sara thinks about ignoring her but stops. Her tone is cold.

                         SARA
          Hey.

                         TRACY
          Psi U. tonight?

          So you can ditch me again?

                         TRACY
          Sara... the guy had a Porsche. And
          a hot tub.

                         SARA
          That's your apology?
          Tracy jumps up and walks over.

          What I meant to say is -- I'm sorry
          -- I totally screwed up.
          Down the hall, we see Rebecca open her door and peek out. She
          watches Tracy and Sara.
          Tracy gives Sara sad, puppy dog eyes. Sara laughs.

                         SARA
          I forgive you.
          Tracy gives her a big, exaggerated hug. Over Sara's shoulder,
          she spots Rebecca looking at them. Tracy flashes a big smile.
          Relief at making up with Sara. But that's not how Rebecca
          takes it.

                         SARA
          But you're on your own at Psi U.
          Because...

                         (DRAMA BUILDING)
          Someone has a date.
          Rebecca hears this. She slips back into the room and closes
          the door. Sara turns and walks down the hallway.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          Sara walks in to find Rebecca slipping into a black dress.

                         SARA
          You look... nice.

          silence in the room. Sara watches her. A beat.

          I want to. On one condition...
          Sara pulls a cute jacket from her closet and puts it on
          Rebecca. They both look at Rebecca in the mirror. Wow.
          Rebecca smiles.

                         REBECCA
          I love it, who's the designer?

                         SARA
          What are you, a label whore?! Who
          cares ...I got it at a flea market
          and it looks great with the dress.
          Rebecca nods in agreement.

                         SARA
          It just needs one last touch...
          She grabs a pair of small, gold hoop earrings from her
          dresser. She places them in Rebecca's hand.

                         SARA
          I'm gonna jump in the shower, then
          we'll head out.
          She grabs her stuff and hurries out the door.
          Rebecca eyes the earrings in her palm. She turns towards the
          full-length mirror behind the door. As she leans into the
          mirror, we see that her ears aren't pierced.
          She takes one of the earrings and touches the pin against the
          skin of her right lobe. After a moment of hesitation...
          SHE PUSHES THE PIN IN HARD. A small pop. She flinches. Blood
          trickles down her ear onto her neck. She wipes it off with
          her thumb and touches the other hoop to her left ear.

          INT. ART GALLERY - DUSK

          Sara and Rebecca at the Richard Prince showing. The paintings
          are all similar to the one we saw in the museum. A series of
          women, peering at the viewer.

          Rebecca wears her hair up, showing off her earrings. Every
          guy in the room is checking out these two babes. But
          Rebecca's into the art, and Sara is texting Stephen.
          ON CELL PHONE: "sorry. next time : ("
          Rebecca notices and frowns. Sara puts the phone away and
          starts studying the paintings.

          We track slowly down the empty hallway, towards the door to
          the...

          INT. DORM ROOM - LATER

          Sara sleeps peacefully. Cuddles lies on top of her, awake.
          Her eyes glowing in the dark. Creepy. But not as creepy as...
          Rebecca in the other bed. She's staring back at the kitten.
          Envy in her eyes. Of Cuddles... or of Sara?
          Rebecca removes the covers and quietly gets out of bed. She
          walks over to Sara's bed... but not to pet Cuddles. She
          stands directly above Sara. Looking down at her. If Sara
          would simply open her eyes, she'd see her.

          INT. DORM ROOM - BARELY SUNRISE

          Tracy is passed out in her bed. She stirs as she wakes. She
          reaches around her, slapping her end table.

          Water. I need water.
          She stumbles to the mini-fridge and looks in: Empty. She
          groans. She grabs an empty cup... opens her door...
          And lets out a sharp little scream.

          INT. DORM - HALLWAY - SAME

          Rebecca sits right across from Tracy's door, her back against
          the wall. Staring at Tracy.

          Rebecca cocks her head at Tracy, as if she's trying to
          comprehend her. A beat. She stands... and walks to her.
          Tracy takes a step back, shaken by Rebecca's calm, morose
          demeanor. Rebecca stares right into her eyes.
          She makes a slight move towards Tracy, who flinches. Rebecca
          turns and walks down to her room. At her door, she turns and
          smiles. She disappears into her room.
          Tracy stands there, spooked.

          EXT. QUADS - DAY

          AERIAL VIEW of Sara and Rebecca walking to class. Tracy walks
          ten yards behind them, waiting until...
          Rebecca and Sara wave "goodbye" to each other and head down
          different paths. Tracy hurries after Sara and catches up.

                         SARA
          Hey. How was the party? Are you
          still the beer bong queen?
          But Tracy's in no mood to joke. She pulls Sara to a stop.

          there, staring. Like some psycho.

          Why don't you ask her? I've gotta
          go...I'll see ya later.
          Tracy stops and watches Sara as she continues on. Tracy
          turns to go the other way, but before she leaves her eyes
          catch Rebecca standing in front of a nearby building.
          Rebecca stares at Tracy much like she did in the hallway.
          Tracy leaves in a hurry.

          INT. CLASSROOM / STUDIO

          Sara sits in her Design class. Professor Roberts stands at
          the podium. Three white design mannequins behind him, each
          sporting a different fashion style.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Contrary to popular opinion, beauty
          is not in the eye of the beholder.
          It's in the hands of the designer.
          Sara listens intently, soaking it all in. Her cell buzzes
          with a text message. She discreetly takes a look.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Who can tell me the difference
          between fashion and style?
          FROM IRENE: "4th & ford. be there now." Sara smiles at the
          message.
          Professor Roberts notices Sara looking at her cell phone and
          calls on her.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Miss Matthews?
          Without missing a beat, Sara replies.

                         SARA

          but style you either have or you
          don't.

          world can't buy you style.

                         SARA
          But it can buy you a good stylist.
          The class chuckles. Professor Roberts smiles.

          EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          Sara comes out of the building, texting on her cell as she
          walks. Rebecca is waiting, holding two cups of coffee.

          Hey. How'd you know when my class
          got out?
          Rebecca shrugs, playing it off.

          It's more like she scared me. She
          was racing to the bathroom like she
          was gonna hurl. She almost knocked
          me over.
          A beat as Sara ponders it all. She smiles.

                         SARA
          The girl does like to party.
          Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it.
          Rebecca takes a victory sip as Sara gets another text from
          Irene: "where r u?!?!?!"

                         SARA
          I gotta go meet Irene.
          (raises her cup)
          Thanks for the coffee.
          Rebecca watches her walk off. She takes another sip.

          EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

          Sara gets out of a cab. She looks up at a big building.

          INT. STUDIO - HALLWAY

          Sara walks through a design studio. Models and make-up
          artists are rushing around, dragging thousands of dollars
          worth of dresses. Sara loves the place's chaotic energy.
          She knocks on an open door and sees a YOUNG MODEL being
          worked on by a designer who isn't much older. IRENE, 28.

                         IRENE

          Finally.

          INT. STUDIO - BACKSTAGE - LATER

          Irene is putting a dress together on a MODEL. Sara watches in
          awe. An OLDER DESIGNER walks by... checks on Irene's work...
          nods his approval... and leaves.

                         SARA

                         IRENE
          You know, your dad left me four
          messages last week. Making sure I'm
          looking out for his baby.

          night.

                         IRENE
          I told him I haven't seen you. And
          that for all I know you're a crack
          ho by now.
          Even the model laughs.

          INT. LIBRARY - DUSK

          Sara walks along, looking for a table. She spots Stephen
          sitting by himself. Drumming on his leg with a pencil.
          Ignoring the open textbook in front of him.
          She sits down across from him. They both smile.

                         STEPHEN
          I haven't seen you around too much
          since you blew me off for dinner.

          Kim exits the bathroom and passes Tracy coming the other way.

                         KIM
          How's it goin?

                         TRACY
          Hey.
          Tracy, wearing just a towel, and brushing her teeth as she
          walks, steps into the bathroom.

          INT. DORM BATHROOM - NIGHT

          She hums to herself as she spits out the toothpaste.
          She removes the towel and steps into the shower, pulling the
          curtain closed. As she shampoos her hair...
          The lights go out.

                         TRACY
          You have to be kidding me. Hey!
          The only light is some distorted moonlight through the
          window. Tracy steps out of the shower, grabbing her towel.
          Just as she starts to feel her way along the wall...
          The lights come back on. She sighs happily... sheds her
          towel... and steps back under the steaming water. A beat.
          The lights go off again.

                         TRACY
          Goddammit !
          She turns off the shower. A beat of silence, but now... one
          of the other showers turns on. What the hell?

                         TRACY

          Who's out there?
          Tracy, back in her towel, nervous now, feels her way along
          the wall again. She turns on the lights.
          The curtains are drawn in front of both running showers.
          Tracy stares at them. A beat.

                         TRACY
          I know it's you.
          She walks over to the shower. A beat. She rips away one
          curtain. Nothing behind it but the running shower. She turns
          it off. She stares at the other curtain.

                         TRACY
          Sara thinks you're weird. She told
          me.
          She pulls back the other curtain... nothing. She turns off
          that shower, too. But she can still hear running water.
          She looks back. The curtain from her own shower is closed
          again. The sound of running water behind it.
          She walks over.

                         TRACY
          Not funny, Rebecca.
          (under her breath)
          Bitch.
          She grips the curtain. She steels herself. She yanks the
          curtain open to see...
          Just running water. Tracy shakes her head. She looks around --
          no one. She slips her towel off and slips back under the
          water. Screw Rebecca -- she's going to finish this shower.

                         TRACY
          Freak.
          Just as the warm water starts to relax her...
          THE SHOWER CURTAIN CRASHES OVER HER, pile-driven by Rebecca.
          The curtain comes right off the rings.
          Tracy is slammed against the shower wall. She hits the floor
          hard, with Rebecca on top of her. Water pelting them both.

          Rebecca clamps a hand over Tracy's mouth and pins her against
          the wall. The shower curtain covers her from the neck down.
          Tracy -- wide-eyed and terrified -- stares at Rebecca.

                         REBECCA
          So Sara thinks I'm weird? Let me
          tell you what I think. I think
          you're a little whore, and a bad
          influence on her. And I think that
          if you tell anyone about... what
          I'm about to do... you'll regret
          it.
          Rebecca, one hand still on Tracy's mouth, slides her other
          hand beneath the shower curtain. Tracy's eyes widen further.
          Rebecca finds what she's looking for... gets the grip she
          needs... and violently jerks her hand out of the curtain.
          A muffled scream from Tracy. Tears stream down her face.
          Rebecca stands. As Tracy sobs quietly on the shower floor,
          Rebecca looks down at...
          The bloody ring in her hand.

                         REBECCA
          Nice belly ring.
          She tosses it to Tracy... and walks away.

          bathroom. She hears steps and voices in the hallway. She
          smiles -- must be Sara.
          She quickly turns off the light and pretends to sleep. But
          the steps pass her door and keep going. Not Sara.
          She turns on the light. Worry in her eyes. She picks up her
          cell phone and dials.

          He smiles -- no big deal. He kisses her and steps into the
          elevator. They look at each other, waiting for the ancient
          doors to close. Stephen steps forward and sneaks in one more
          kiss. The doors close.
          Sara smiles; what a night. She glances down toward her door
          and sighs.

          Sara and Rebecca walk in silence, sipping their coffees.

          Sara clicks onto Rebecca's Facebook page. She's listed only

          front of the graffiti wall. And some of her drawings. And a
          picture of a pretty brunette teenager, captioned "Maria."
          Sara looks at Rebecca's interests. Favorite Artist: Richard
          Prince. Favorite Passion: Drawing. Favorite movie: Coyote
          Ugly. Sara smiles. Best Friend: SARA. Her smile fades.

          Stephen, alone, searches for a book among the remote stacks.
          The stacks are massive and endless -- row after row of them.
          Stephen thumbs through books, not finding the one he needs.
          He drops a book and bends down to pick it up. Over his
          shoulder, we see...
          REBECCA'S EYES in the space between the shelves. She's in the
          next aisle over.
          Stephen replaces the book. He walks down the aisle, looking
          at the numbers of the books.
          Rebecca mimics his pacing as she follows him down her aisle.
          Her hands gently brush against the books, her eyes on
          Stephen. He turns in her direction and stops in his tracks.
          So does Rebecca. She's completely still.
          Stephen walks over. He puts his hand on the book that covers
          Rebecca. He's about to pull it out and reveal her. But it's
          not the right one. He keeps walking.
          He reaches the end of his aisle... and Rebecca the end of
          hers. She's right around the corner from him. He reads the
          markers at the end of the aisle, trying to figure out which
          direction to go.
          Rebecca's hands are sweaty. She's nervous. Does she want to

          down the next aisle.
          Rebecca softly exhales. And now whispers to herself.

          Stephen.
          Stephen stops dead. Did he hear something? Guess not. He
          keeps going, scanning the book numbers again.

                         STEPHEN
          Shit, wrong aisle.
          He doubles back, and turns into Rebecca's aisle. But it's...
          EMPTY. We hear a door close in the distance.

          Stephen and Sara walk on a tree-lined path. Holding hands. He
          checks his watch.

                         STEPHEN
          Should we head back home?
          They walk by a small playground comprised of the slide,
          jungle gym, etc.

          my twin bed and roommate.

          Sara and Stephen are each hanging from the jungle gym. This
          has been going on for a few minutes. Both straining.
          Stephen's worse off.

                         STEPHEN
          This is kind of a stupid bet.

          He tries to swing his legs and kick her. She avoids him. He
          catches a peek at her bare midriff. Finally, this makes him
          fall. She then lets go, victorious.

          I was a gymnast until I hit a
          growth spurt my freshman year.
          Stephen brushes himself off. Dejected that he was "this
          close". She walks up to him. Cocky. Gives him a playful
          shove.

                         SARA (CONT'D)

          He gives her a playful shove back.

          So.
          She seductively walks back towards him. Takes his hand.

          Rebecca sketches in her bed. She looks at the clock: 1:00
          a.m. And no Sara. History is repeating itself.. .and Rebecca's
          pissed. She rips out her sketch page and throws it away.
          She starts pacing the floor. She angrily moves Sara's chair
          back to her side. She whips out her phone and eyes the dial
          button. She starts to dial... but kills the call.
          She picks up her sketchpad again. Suddenly:
          A BUZZING SOUND from Sara's desk. Rebecca pulls out the desk
          drawer and finds Sara's cell phone. On the call screen:

          A long beat. She pushes the talk button... but just listens.

           Rebecca's eyes clear. She's in control again. She sits down
           on Sara's bed, tossing Cuddles roughly to the floor. And now
          she lies down.

          Sara and Stephen slam along the walls, in a fever. Kissing
          madly, missing each other's mouths. At his door... he cracks
          it open and peeks inside.
          His room is a disaster. Definitely a new world record for
          empty beer cans, pizza boxes, and strewn clothes.

          closet. There's nothing here I've
          worn in the past six months.
          Irene walks toward the couch where there's a pile of clothes.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

          Sara stuffs her new clothes into her tiny closet. The bags
          spill out into the room, taking up floor space.
          Rebecca sits on her bed, her laptop open. She's staring at
          Irene's Facebook Profile. There are some racy pictures of
          Irene and some girlfriends.

          bright spin on things.

                         SARA
          Look, I'd still technically be
          living here. So you wouldn't have
          to get a new roommate. Her place is
          huge and it's not like you couldn't
          use the extra closet space. I'd
          just move some of my stuff over,
          and spend a few nights a week
          there. We'd both have a lot more
          space.

          Nothing's set in stone. It's just
          something to think about. Plus we'd
          be able to keep Cuddles.
          As Sara hangs more new clothes in her closet, Rebecca stares
          across the room at...
          Cuddles.

          dryer moving for a sec. Cuddles stumbles, falls over, and
          gets back up.
          Rebecca pushes the button again, a little longer this time.

          last quarter. She gently places it in the slot.

          But it doesn't have to be.
          Sara's pulse is racing.

                         SARA
          I'm not sure I understand. Are you
          saying what I think you're saying?

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          I'm saying you have a shot. You'd
          have to earn it, Sara.

                         SARA
          Of course. I'll do... anything.
          Roberts stands and walks to the window. He looks out at the
          quad... and now turns back to Sara.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          I'd like to see more danger in your
          work. Your designs are always
          crisp; they're always clear. But
          they're a little... safe.
          That stung. Sara can't keep the red from rising in her face.
          Roberts walks over to her.

          into her eyes.

          The best designers push the

          He kisses her. Sara pushes him away, jumping out of her
          chair. She stands in front of him, shaking.

                         SARA
          I can't believe you just did that.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          I took a chance, that's all. With a
          student that I trust.

                         SARA
          I better go.
          Sara grabs her books. As she heads for the door...

          She hurries out of the office.

          INT. LIBRARY - DAY

          Rebecca sits alone at a study table. Sara walks up and drops
          down her books. THUD. Students look over from other tables.
          Sara doesn't care. She sits down and stares blankly into
          space, trying to forget what just happened. Rebecca leans
          over, concerned.

          What's wrong?

                         SARA
          My design professor just kissed me.
          Rebecca turns very serious. She gets up and sits down next
          to Sara.

          Are you alright?
          Sara nods.

          INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

          Professor Roberts at his desk, set to call it a day. He
          tosses some design sheets into his briefcase.
          He opens a desk drawer... grabs his wedding ring... and slips
          it onto his finger.
          He hears FOOTSTEPS in the hallway. The sexy, unmistakable
          clicking of a woman's heels. They come closer... and now stop
          at his door.
          Roberts watches the door, waiting for a knock. Nothing. He
          walks to it. He can see the silhouette of two feet at the
          bottom of the door. He smiles -- Sara, coming back to him.
          He opens the door, revealing:
          Rebecca. She wears a snug v-neck cardigan, skin-tight black
          jeans, and silver stiletto heels. A small purse on her
          shoulder.
          Roberts swallows his surprise.

                         REBECCA
          Professor Roberts?

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          That's right.

          I'm glad I caught you.

          Actually, I was just...
          But Rebecca steps past him into the office, her heels
          snapping on the worn hardwood floor.

          INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

          Roberts, a little annoyed but also intrigued, follows her
          back inside. They face each other.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          You're not one of my students.

          Because I'm bored. I thought it
          would be all about Freud, and deep
          dark secrets. But it's brain
          chemistry. Synapses. I can't stay
          awake in class.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm not
          sure what I can do to help.

                         REBECCA
          Tomorrow's the last day to drop a
          course without penalty. Unless I
          can add another one in its place,
          I'll fall way behind in credits.

           so calm, so steady. Roberts can't get a handle on her.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Look, I've always made it a policy
          not to accept any students this
          late in the term.

          She smiles... and eases up onto his desk. Facing him. Pretty
          feet dangling, ankles locked. Jesus.
          She eases her purse off her shoulder and onto the desk. She
          sees the framed picture of a WOMAN AND TWO KIDS. She picks it
          up.

           The game is on now. Roberts slowly walks around the desk,
          until he's behind Rebecca.
           In the picture frame's reflection, Rebecca sees him slip off
          his wedding ring. He palms it.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          A few things I'd need to know.

                         REBECCA
          Ask me anything.
          He's circling the desk now. Predator and prey.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          Do you have any design experience?

                         REBECCA
          None.

          What do you know about clothes?

          Only one thing.

          And what's that?

                         REBECCA
          I definitely look better out of
          them than in them.
          What an answer. Roberts stops in front of her. He moves in
           close, between her parting legs. He looks into her eyes.
          Still steady.

                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
          I think we might be able to work
          something out.

          He kisses her. She opens her lips for a tantalizing second,
          and now gently pushes him away. He holds his ground. He's had
          a taste -- he wants a lot more.
          Suddenly, Rebecca's face hardens.

                         REBECCA
          Ow! You're hurting me! Professor,
          stop!...
          Roberts stares at her in shock. He's not even touching her.
          What's going on? Rebecca smiles again.
          This girl is whacked. But damn, Roberts wants her. And her
          eyes are inviting him back. As he presses in to kiss her
          again...
          She rockets a knee into his groin and he crumples to the
          floor, gasping for air. He drops his wedding ring, which
          rolls away across the floor.
          Rebecca steps to the desk, where her purse sits open. We can
          see the Walkman inside. She takes it out. Smiles at him.

          Birthday gift. You should get one,
          they're great.
          She slips on the earbuds... plays with the Walkman for a few
          seconds... and now hits the play button. We hear their prior
          conversation, played back.

          What? How did?... Who are you?
          He lunges at her ankle. She steps out of his grasp... and
          slams the sharp spike of her heel down on his hand. He yells
          again.

           ring, and rolls it across the floor to him.

                          REBECCA

          A WOMAN, standing at Professor Roberts' podium. She gestures

          INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

          Sara serves up two fresh lattes... and now leans against the
          counter to watch the band. Stephen's band. He catches her
          looking at him. She smiles. Seriously smitten.

          INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - LATER

          Stephen, sweaty, is behind the counter helping Sara clean up.

                         STEPHEN
          I've made a decision. You ready?

          Well, let me think about this. The

          here during Thanksgiving?

                         STEPHEN
          Dinner at the frat, the football
          games. Don't forget the always
          awkward, homoerotic humor.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          A somber Rebecca stares at herself in the full-length mirror
          on the back of the front door. A very strange expression in
          her eyes. She looks herself over, makes a fist, and now...
          Punches herself on the temple. Hard. She staggers, nearly
          knocked out. She straightens. Looks in the mirror. Her skin
          is already bruising. She punches herself again. Same spot.
          And again, with her other fist this time. And now a shot to
          her shoulder. And another. It's painful to watch. But she's
          getting more and more numb to the blows.
          She inspects herself closely... and now reaches down and
          grabs an artist's UTILITY KNIFE. It looks like a large,
          retractable box cutter. She extends the blade all the way
          out. She pulls up her shirt. Turns to the side a bit. Places
          the knife against her skin and...

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          Sara opens the door and finds Rebecca curled up in a fetal
          position in a corner of the room. Sobbing. Sara drops her
          things and runs over to her.

                         SARA
          Oh my God. What happened?
          She cradles Rebecca, who buries her head in between her
          knees. Sara checks the bruises on her head and arms.

                         SARA
          Rebecca. It's okay. You're safe
          now. Talk to me.

                         REBECCA

          I got away.

                         SARA
          You're alright now.
          Sara notices a streak of blood against Rebecca's shirt. She
          pulls it up and sees a slash. Gasps.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          Rebecca, newly showered, hair still wet, sits on her bed in
          her underwear. Sara is tending to her wounds. Ice for the
          bruises. Disinfectant for the cut. Rebecca flinches.

                         SARA
          It's not deep, thank God. But you
          should see a doctor.

          I don't want to. I can't.
          Sara pulls out her cell phone.

                         SARA
          You're calling them, or I am.
          There's a psycho walking around
          this campus.

          Okay, okay. I won't call. Just let
          me help you.
          Rebecca calms down. Let's Sara finish. Watching her intently
          as she works.

          EXT. STREET - DORM - DAY

          Sara's on the sidewalk in front of her dorm with Stephen.
          Inside, the lobby is busy with students getting ready to go
          home for the holiday.

                         SARA
          Sorry about not staying. But,

                         STEPHEN
          I'll miss you.
          Rebecca pulls up in her car. Sara gets in. Rebecca gives
          Stephen an "I win" look as Sara closes the door.

          I haven't heard from Jason in
          weeks. It's weird how he just
          stopped calling.

                         REBECCA
          It's what you wanted, right?
          Sara nods, reassuring herself.

                         SARA
          Yeah. Yeah it is.
          Sara looks out the window. Rebecca shows a hint of a smile.

          EXT. GATED MANSION - DUSK

          Rebecca's car pulls up to the iron gates of a huge mansion
          that could be straight out of Lifestyles of the Rich and
          Famous.

          EXT. SIDEWALK - DUSK

          Rebecca and Sara stand in the driveway, looking up at the

          Rebecca and Sara walk in. Rebecca's on edge, flinching as

          Rebecca's parents rush in from the living room. Her father
          gives her an awkward hug.

          raising her arms.

          They didn't need to know.
          Rebecca plops down on the bed. Sara looks around. It's a
          typical teenage girl's bedroom. Except, no posters. Just
          drawings covering the walls. The drawings are of teenage
          girls -- more precisely, they're different drawings of one
          teenage girl. They're odd, but compelling.

          Family and guest sit around a very nice, but not too large
          dining table. The contents of the house are expensive but
          not pretentious.
          Rebecca plays with her food, clearly not wanting to engage
          her parents, who are undaunted. All smiles and warmth.

          and then she goes off to college
          and she's on her own. I'm just

          Sara cuts discreet looks around the table. Who are these
          people?

          Sara and Rebecca are getting ready to sleep. Sara has made a
          makeshift bed in the middle of the floor.

                         REBECCA
          We can share the bed if you want.
          Sara looks down at her own "bed" and takes a glance at the
          walls. On the floor, she's going to be surrounded by the
          drawings of Rebecca looking at her.

          Sure.
          Sara climbs into bed with Rebecca. They lay back to back.
          Rebecca turns the lamp off next to the bed.

          Sara closes her eyes. It's silent. Rebecca turns over. A
          beat. She opens her eyes -- just inches from Sara. She ever
          so slowly raises her hand and gently strokes Sara's hair.

          Jeff opens the fridge. The soft light barely illuminates
          Rebecca, sitting stoically at the table behind her father.
          Jeff jumps. He recovers, standing by the open fridge.

          Becs. You scared me.
          Rebecca, glass of milk in her hand, gives her father a dirty
          look. We know how much she hates nicknames.

          Sara wakes up alone in bed. She can hear soft voices from

          INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

          Sara stands at the top of the stairs. She walks down them and
          to the kitchen doorway. She peeks inside to see...

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Rebecca and her father sitting at the table. Just the

                         REBECCA
          Fine. My grades are good.

                         JEFF
          That's not what I meant.
          She looks down at the table.

          I'm making friends.
          Jeff, very subtly, cringes. A long beat.

                         JEFF
          Rebecca, look at me for a second.
          Now she looks at him.

                         JEFF
          Your mother and I are very fond of
          you.

                         REBECCA
          I know.
          He doesn't know what else to say.
          Outside Sara sees the framed photos on the wall.
          Each features Rebecca's parents in some exotic locale: On the
          beach... on the ski slopes... on a cruise ship. They smile
          happily at the camera. Rebecca isn't in a single picture.

                         JEFF
          I just wanted to make sure. Good
          night, I'm heading back to bed.
          He rises. Sara turns and walks up the stairs.

          INT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

          Sara waits by the front door. Alison walks in.

                         ALISON
          Hi Sara.

                         SARA
          Hi. Rebecca's going to show me some
          of her high school hangouts.

                         ALISON
          Wonderful.
          Alison peers up the stairs.

                         ALISON
          Rebecca seems to be doing well.

                         SARA

                         SARA
          Medication?
          Alison turns to see... her daughter at the top of the stairs.
          Did she hear them? She walks down.

                         ALISON
          Hey sweetheart.
          She kisses her on the cheek. Rebecca is annoyed.

                         REBECCA

                         (TO SARA)
          Ready?
          Sara nods, but she's still reeling from Alison's words.
          Medication? She looks back, but Alison waves cheerfully.

                         ALISON
          Have a great time, you two.

          EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

          It's an affluent but quaint little town's main street.
          Rebecca and Sara stroll down the sidewalk. Sara cuts
          discreet, sideways glances at Rebecca.

                         REBECCA
          Is everything okay?

                         SARA
          Yeah. It's just...
          She wants to ask her about that medication.

                         SARA

          INT. COFFEE SHOP DAY

          Sara and Rebecca are in line for their drinks. The TEENAGE
          CASHIER takes their money... but keeps staring at Rebecca.
          She doesn't pay any attention to him. Sara takes her coffee.

          Thanks.
          The cashier stares at her, as if trying to figure Sara out.
          What's she doing with Rebecca?
          The girls sit at a table. The cashier and BARISTA keep
          glancing over, whispering to each other. Rebecca shoots them
          a look. Like a warning. They quiet. Start doing busy work.

                         REBECCA

                         (TO SARA)
          I used to come here like every day
          after school.
          The door opens. THREE GIRLS walk in, laughing and chatting.
          One BRUNETTE spots Rebecca and stops dead in her tracks.
          Sara recognizes her. It's MARIA, the girl from Rebecca's
          Facebook, and the subject of all those wall sketches.
          The chatting girls all fall silent.

                         SARA
          You know them?

                         REBECCA
          They went to my high school.

                         SARA
          Friends?
          Rebecca doesn't answer her. She's focused on making eye
          contact with the Brunette.
          The girls linger by the door, whispering among themselves.
          Finally, the Brunette sits down at a table by the entrance.
          As far away from Rebecca's and Sara's table as possible.
          The other two girls walk to the counter. They sneak glances
          at Rebecca as they order their drinks.
          Sara looks back and forth between Rebecca and the girls.
          Rebecca doesn't waver. She keeps staring at the Brunette.
          Suddenly, Rebecca gets up.

                         REBECCA
          Let's leave.
          Rebecca walks towards the door. Sara, confused, gathers her
          things and gets up. Rebecca stops at the Brunette's table.
          The Brunette sits there, like a deer caught in headlights.

                         (WARY)
          Hello.
          The other girls walk over. Rebecca, unfazed, looks them over,
          sending shivers down their spines. They want to back up their
          friend, but they look as scared as she does. Sara watches all
          this from a few feet away.
          Rebecca suddenly turns cheerful.

                         REBECCA
          Oh, I wanted to introduce you to
          Sara. My roommate.
          Sara gives a small wave to Maria, who looks her over. Almost
          as if she feels sorry for her.

                         MARIA
          Hi.
          Rebecca keeps eyeing Maria, a superior grin on her face. An
          awkward beat. Everyone's tense. Sara clears her throat.

                         SARA
          Well, we better go.
          Rebecca snaps out of it. Nods. They start to walk out. But as
          they open the door...

                         MARIA
          Rebecca.
          Everyone turns to Maria. She looks Rebecca in the eye.

                         MARIA
          We were never friends.
          Rebecca stares at her, grinding her teeth. The tension
          building. Maria doesn't back down, though. She needed to say
          this. Sara grabs Rebecca's shoulder, gently.

                         SARA
          Come on, let's go.

          INT. CAR - DAY: DRIVING

          Headed back to school. Sara looks out the window. Lost in
          thought.

          I guess college is a fresh start
          for both of us.
          Rebecca doesn't look at her. Just a hint of acknowledgement
          on her face.
          Sara's phone buzzes. This gets Rebecca's attention. Sara
          looks at the text message she just received from Irene:
          "back in LA. lemme know abt movin in."

                         SARA
          Irene's back in town.
          Sara types and sends a text back. Rebecca watches her.

          EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY

          Sara's running through the quad.

          EXT./INT. DORM - DAY

          Sara, coming in from a run, times it perfectly, sneaking in
          the front door as a student walks out. She bypasses the
          elevator, heading straight to the stairs.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

          She bursts out the door and into the hallway.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          She walks in, still a bit out of breath. Rebecca is packing
          her back-pack.

          I feel inspired.
          She's out the door. Sara notices that Rebecca left her
          sketchpad behind on her bed. She eyes it for a beat. Looks at
          the closed door.
          As she steps toward the sketchpad... Rebecca charges back in.

                         REBECCA
          Forgot my pad.
          She snags it from her bed and leaves. Sara eyes Rebecca's
          dresser. But first... She walks to the door and opens it.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY

          Sara peeks her head out and looks down both sides of the
          empty hallway. She hears the elevator ding.

          INT. DORM ROOM

          Sara heads straight for Rebecca's dresser. A beat. Is she
          really going to do this? Yes. She slides open the top drawer:
          Supplies. The second drawer: sketchpads. She leafs through
          them: Empty.
          She searches the third drawer: Sweaters. She feels around
          beneath them. Wait a minute. She pulls out:
          Two bottles of prescription medicine. "LITHIUM... For APD."
          Both bottles are full of pills. As Sara stares at them...

          A HAND TAPS HER SHOULDER.
          She leaps out of her socks. But it's just Stephen.

                         STEPHEN

          Sara grabs him and gives him a long hug. Stephen holds her
          tight and speaks, muffled by her neck.

          That's what I intend to find out.

          INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT

          Rebecca is standing up, back pack around her shoulder, her
          drawing pad in her other hand. Her arm is wrapped around a
          pole for balance. She stares out the window. No emotion. She
          looks like she's staring at her own reflection. The train
          comes to a halt. Riders shuffle around.
          Rebecca sees a seat open up and sits down. She opens her
          drawing pad and starts on a blank piece of paper. She looks
          up and we see what she's been staring at:
          Irene.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Sara and Stephen stand at Sara's desk, over her computer.
          Sara googles "Lithium and APD", and clicks on an entry.

          INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

          A stylish, hip night club. A sophisticated crowd. Irene and
          three FRIENDS sit in the lounge section, sipping exotic
          martinis and watching the dance floor.
          And on that dance floor one particular woman dances by
          herself, lost in the music, oblivious to everything around
          her. She turns as she dances and we see that it's Rebecca.
          Irene gets up and heads towards the bathroom. As she winds
          her away around the borders of the dance floor, she notices
          Rebecca. She pauses to watch her. THEIR EYES MEET FOR MORE

          THAN AN INSTANT, IRENE SMILES AND WALKS AWAY. REBECCA CLOCKS

          IT, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

          INT. NIGHT CLUB - BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Irene stands at the mirror, fixing her make-up. The door
          opens and closes. She glances over to see Rebecca walking in.
          Rebecca steps to the sink, just a few feet down from Irene.
          She's out of breath, a sexy sheen of sweat on her arms.
          Irene breaks out a tube of lip gloss. Rebecca is watching her
          in the mirror, and Irene knows it. She applies the gloss and
          smiles at the little kick it gives her. Her eyes find
          Rebecca's in the mirror.

                         IRENE
          I'm sorry to stare, but you are so

          Irene hands her the lip gloss... Rebecca takes her hand and
          pulls her close. She kisses Irene full on the lips.

                         REBECCA
          You're right... cinnamon.
          Irene smiles.
          This room's heating up fast. Irene's eyes meet Rebecca's.

                         REBECCA

                         IRENE
          As luck would have it, I'm only two
          blocks away and...no roommate.

          What are we waiting for?

          INT. IRENE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

          An alarm clock buzzes with no effect to Irene who is dead to
          the world. She grunts and finally opens her eyes. She wipes
          the sleep from her eyes, she looks around confused, looks to
          the empty side of her bed where someone had obviously spent
          the night. Irene sits up and turns off the alarm..

                         IRENE
          Shit.
          She looks at an empty glass on her bedside table.

          Irene get's up with the empty glass in her hand. She
          stumbles out into the...

          HALLWAY.
          She staggers to keep her balance on her way to the kitchen.
          We stay in the hallway as Irene enters in the kitchen and
          switches on the light.

          We can see her shadow in the hallway and hear Irene fill her
          glass. It's quiet for a moment. She drinks. She fills the
          glass again.
          Irene comes back into the hallway with glass in hand. She
          switches off the light in the kitchen. But as she starts to
          go back to her room ...WHAM!!
          Rebecca charges out of nowhere and crashes into Irene.

          EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

          Sara is going for a run through the city. She stops at an old
          art deco apartment building.

          INT. LOBBY - MORNING

          Sara spots Irene's name on the buzzer and calls up. No
          answer.

          She walks out the door. Looks around. And takes off running

          She finds Rebecca, sitting on her bed. Drawing. She lights up
          when she sees Sara.

          Oh, I got inspired. I just lost
          track of time.
          Sara pulls off her sweaty top and throws it in the hamper,
          grabbing a towel. She's wearing a sportsbra, revealing her
          tattoo. Sara grabs a robe.
          A beat. She's nervous, but she needs to do this. Time for the
          "big talk." She sits on her bed and faces Rebecca.

          I won't be able to do it without
          you.
          Sara looks into her plaintive eyes. So much want in them.

          Um... sure. Okay.

          INT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY

          The girls walk along the wall, checking out the samples.

                         SARA
          You can't rush this, Rebecca. We
          can always come back.

                         SARA
          Okay. I'm out here if you need me.
          Sara sits down as the TATTOO ARTIST escorts Rebecca upstairs.
          She looks giddy and nervous. Sara waves. When she's gone,
          Sara takes out her phone and texts Irene.

          Sara, bored, leafs through a tattoo magazine for the 100th
          time. Her phone buzzes. A response from Irene:
          "outta town for a gig. will call when back ; )"
          Sara's relieved.

                         STAIRS
          Rebecca walks slowly down the stairs. Wincing in pain. Sara
          puts the phone back in her pocket and stands up.

                         SARA
          Let's see it.
          Rebecca pulls down the collar of her shirt to reveal, just
          under her collarbone:

                         "EMILY"
          Sara, stunned speechless, starts backing away from her.

          If you want... you can call me
          Emily.
          Sara clenches her fists. She's shaking with rage. She moves
          toward Rebecca, whose grin fades.

                         REBECCA
          What's the matter?
          Sara steps up to her, inches away, ready to beat the shit out
          of her. And Rebecca can't believe it. She's that far gone.
          Her eyes search Sara's for an answer.
          Sara abruptly turns and walks out the door. Rebecca watches
          her leave through the front window. Sara never looks back.

          The elevator doors open. Sara, emotionally exhausted, steps
          out, carrying a box of her things. Stephen waits by the door.

                         STEPHEN
          This is all you're taking?

          Irene comes back to town.
          He takes the box. Then notices --

                         STEPHEN
          Where's your necklace?
          She instinctively rubs the base of her neck.

          I can't find it. It's okay.

          She kisses him tenderly, unbelievably appreciative.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Sara walks out to the cab. Pauses. She's tempted to look back
          at her dorm room window... but she doesn't.
          Good thing, too. Rebecca sits on the ledge, looking down.
          Her face is blank. Not hurt, not angry -- completely blank.

          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

          Rebecca still sits at the window. She holds her camera up,
          taking a picture down below. She turns as Stephen enters.
          She puts the camera down.

          Rebecca solemnly shakes her head. He looks around the
          dresser. In the drawers. Flips over Sara's pillow. Rebecca
          watches him.

                         REBECCA
          What did I do?
          He stops searching. Looks at her.

                         STEPHEN
          She just needs to move on.

                         REBECCA
          With you?
          He doesn't answer. He keeps searching... but he can feel
          Rebecca's eyes on him now. Creepy. He gives up.

                         STEPHEN
          If you do find it, can you let me
          know?
          Instead of answering, Rebecca raises her camera and takes his
          picture. Stephen stares at her, unnerved. He finally snaps
          out of it and walks out the door.
          She watches him go.

          his t-shirts.

                         SARA
          Are these dirty or clean?
          Stephen sniffs the shirts.

          She throws the t-shirts at him.

          EXT. CAMPUS QUADS - DAY

          Sara heads to class, walking faster than usual. Bumping into
          people as she looks around, making sure she'll spot Rebecca
          before Rebecca spots her.
          She makes it to the front door of the building. She looks
          back at the quads.

          EXT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

          Sara locks the front door and heads back home.
          She walks down an empty quad. She slows at the sight of...
          Rebecca. Walking directly towards her from the other end of
          the quad.
          No one else is in sight. Sara thinks about veering off to the
          side. No. She can do this. She walks straight ahead. Rebecca
          keeps her pace; hooded sweater up, looking down at the
          pavement, listening to her Walkman.
          Sara takes a deep breath as they get closer to each other,
          preparing herself for the confrontation. Ten feet away now.
          Five...
          But Rebecca passes her without looking. Sara walks a little
          further and turns around.
          Rebecca keeps walking. Did she even see her?

          Sara reaches Psi U. and closes the door behind her. She looks
          around at the messy first floor. At the PACK OF GUYS in the
          living room, yelling at the hoops game on TV.
          Sara smiles. She's safe.

          INT. ART STUDIO - NIGHT

          Rebecca is alone, with just a crack of light coming from the
          open door to the hallway. She's sketching, still wearing her
          Walkman. Hundreds of sheets of paper are scattered around the
          floor, but we can't see what she's drawing.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE ROOM

          Sara is trying to study at a cramped desk but the music from
          outside the room is too loud. Stephen is on the bed,
          reading. He's used to it. She hears a loud commotion from
          the hallway. Frustrated, she gets up.

          It's a couple of guys playing nerf basketball.

          Sara tries to study while the fraternity brothers continue to

          JASON, a handsome all-American Midwestern kid, stands in
          front of Sara's dorm. He's talking into his cell phone.

          Sara. I'm actually... I'm in front

          at the Roosevelt Hotel, room 210.
          Call me, okay?
          He hangs up. Some students leave the dorm and he grabs the
          door before it closes.

          Rebecca kneels down in front of her dresser. Opens the bottom
          drawer. Her sweaters. She fishes underneath them. Pulls out
          her lithium pills. But just looks at them. Anger in her eyes.
          She puts the bottle back.

          the door. No answer. Knocks again.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca sits back into Sara's chair, staring at the door,
          ignoring the knocks. Almost catatonic.
          Her right hand slowly drags a utility knife over the armrest,
          shredding it to pieces.

          INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Jason writes a note. He folds it and slides it under the
          door. He hesitates for a second, hoping this is the right
          thing to do, then walks back down the hallway towards the
          elevator.

                         SARA -
          I know you won't take my calls, but I'm here and I just want
          to see you. I'm at The Roosevelt Hotel, Room 210, until...
          however long it takes. Please.
          Love,

                         JASON
          Rebecca crumples up the paper and throws it in the trash.

          INT. DORM - SHOWER - NIGHT

          Rebecca lets the water soak her. Eyes open. She runs her
          fingers through her now long dark brown hair. Black water
          trickles down her legs and puddles near the drain.

          INT. DORM BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca stands naked in front of the mirror, staring at her
          reflection. She then digs into her bag and pulls out a long
          pair of shears. Her "Emily" tattoo is starting to heal. She
          gently traces the letters with the sharp tips of the shears,
          still looking at it in the mirror.
          She lifts the shears and starts cutting her hair shorter.
          Just above her shoulders.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca walks over to Sara's closet. She opens it and thumbs
          through some of the clothes that Sara left behind. She pulls
          out a dress. Holds it in front of herself as she stands in
          front of the mirror. Nice -- but something's missing.
          Rebecca goes to her drawer and pulls out Sara's silver chain.
          Which she caresses in her hand.

          INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

          Sara's kicked her feet on the table, reading a book.
          Enjoying the silence.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

          A raucous party in full swing. Stephen's band has just
          finished playing and he's walking off the cheap stage. A HOT
          GIRL smiles at him.

                         GIRL
          Help me find the keg?

                         STEPHEN
          Sure, I have to go look for my
          girlfriend anyway.
          She walks away. "Jerk". He grins... and now checks his watch.
          Where's Sara?

          INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          The elevator door opens, revealing Rebecca. Or is it Sara?
          The hair. The dress. The tattoo. Rebecca looks just like her.

          As she steps into the hallway, she gently fingers the
          necklace. She walks along, looking at the room numbers.
          She stops in front of a room. She's about to knock... but she
          sees a housekeeping cart a few doors down, in front of an
          open room.
          She walks to the cart. She peeks inside the room... and now
          plucks the master key card off the cart.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Jason, shirtless, sleeps on his stomach in bed.
          The front door clicks and slowly creaks open just enough for
          a silhouette of a woman to appear. She closes the door. Jason
          barely acknowledges the noise in his sleep.
          Rebecca walks to the bed in the soft moonlight. She stares
          down at Jason. She slips off her dress, which falls to the
          floor. She's in just bra and panties now.
          She climbs onto the bed beside Jason. He starts awake.

          She crawls onto him, not letting him turn over. She starts
          kissing the back of his neck.

          Kissing his back now, moving lower.

          Oh, man, Sara. Oh, that feels good.
          She works her way back up to his ear.

          He does. She reaches beneath the blanket, and does what she
          needs to. She settles onto him. And now starts to move.
          And as she moves we go behind her and see, shining in the low
          light, the utility knife beneath her bra strap. Flat against
          the skin of her back.
          Jason lies still, eyes clenched shut.

                         JASON
          I love you, Sara.
          She lets him have one, two, three seconds of heaven. Her
          hands reach behind her and ease out the utility knife.

                         REBECCA
          But she doesn't love you.
          Jason's eyes fly open. That wasn't Sara's voice. And those
          aren't Sara's eyes boring into his.
          Rebecca leans down, her face to his. Jason's eyes widen in
          shock, horror, and now pain as her unseen hands drive the
          knife deep into his gut. He gasps.

                         REBECCA
          You hurt her.
          She kisses him -- the last thing he'll ever feel. He
          shudders, trembles, and lies still, eyes open.

          INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

          Sara's still reading. A hand touches her shoulder. She jumps,
          but it's just the LIBRARIAN.

                         LIBRARIAN
          We're about to close.
          Sara can't believe it's so late. She puts her things away.
          Grabs her phone to check the time, distracted by the "1 new
          voicemail" message. She's about to press the voicemail
          button...
          But a text comes in from Irene:

          Stephen walks around, beer-less, searching the crowd for
          Sara. He checks his watch. Pats his pocket -- no cell phone.
          He heads up the stairs and into his room.

          INT. FRAT BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Stephen picks his phone off the dresser. Sees he has a new
          voicemail from Sara. He plays the message

          SARA (V.0.)

          Sara rides up the elevator.

          INT. HALLWAY / DOORWAY

          Sara walks to the door of Irene's apartment. It's open but
          there's not a sound. No music, no cocktail chatter.
          She checks the apartment number again. It's the right one.
          She knocks lightly. No answer.

          Irene?
          There's a bedroom dead ahead. Warm light pours out. She
          slowly walks to the open door... looks in... and freezes.
          CLOSE ON SARA'S EYES. Horror-stricken by what she sees.
          The bedroom is dark, except for the single lamp, above...
          Irene. She lies on the bed, each of her wrists cuffed to a
          bedpost. A red Hermes scarf is stuffed in her mouth.
          Sara can't move. She stares at Irene in shock.

          drops her phone on the floor.

          Sara sinks out of the chair onto her knees in astonishment.
          She looks at Irene.
          Sara digs deep... lifts up her face... and looks Rebecca in
          the eye. She puts everything she has into this.

          Stop! I mean it.
          Rebecca raises the gun to Sara's face but Sara keeps coming.
          Rebecca realizes she can't stop Sara. She cracks Sara across
          the temple with the gun-butt, knocking her to the floor.
          She kneels down beside Sara. Worried... clearing the hair
          from Sara's face.

          room.
          Sara stands up first and dives for the bed, but Rebecca grabs
          Sara by the neck and rips her off the bed. She puts her in a
          chokehold.
          Sara backs Rebecca into the wall, trying to loosen the
          chokehold. She slams her back against the wall. And again.
          Sara smashes her elbow into Rebecca's jaw, breaking her grip.
          She heads for the door, but Rebecca trips her. As Sara
          rises...
          Rebecca knees her in her stomach, knocking the wind out of
          her. As Sara gasps for breath...
          Rebecca races out into the living room for the gun.

          INT. BEDROOM

          The door shatters, and the bullet continues straight ahead
          and tears a pillow open, just beside Irene's head. Feathers
          go flying. Irene screams.
          Rebecca kicks the door open and steps in, gun in hand.

                         REBECCA
          I know you're scared, Sara. But I
          promise, everything is gonna be
          okay.
          She stops short at the sight of...Sara on the ledge.
          Rebecca turns and stares at Irene. Fresh panic rising in
          Irene's eyes.

                         REBECCA
          Sorry, Irene. But she's my friend,
          not yours.
          She raises the gun at the helpless Irene...
          But out of nowhere STEPHEN, RUSHING UP FROM BEHIND, knocks
          her arm. The gun fires wildly, one bullet...

          EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - NIGHT

          Exploding through the window, shattering it and startling
          Sara, who loses her balance and slips off the ledge. She
          grabs on by her fingertips, her face hitting the brick wall.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca fires another shot, hitting a giant bedroom mirror,
          shattering it's reflection of Rebecca's struggle with
          Stephen.
          Rebecca slams her head into his lip, knocking him backward.
          He keeps hold of her, and they hit the floor, the gun flying
          out of Rebecca's hand.
          Stephen gets on top. He lifts his arm high and balls his fist
          before he puts it right in her face full throttle, knocking
          her out cold.
          He quickly takes the gun and puts it inside his belt as he
          races for the window.

          SARA (O.S.)

                         (SCREAMING)
          Stephen! Help!

                         IRENE

          He sees Sara dangling outside and reaches for her.

          EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - SAME

          Sara's crying, barely mouthing Stephen's name. He grabs her
          arms. Leaning halfway outside, he starts to pull her up.
          Part of the way up, he holds her against his chest and lets
          her cry. He smiles.

                         STEPHEN
          Okay I've got you. Everything is
          gonna be okay!
          He pulls her halfway in the window...
          But a shadow rises behind him.

                         IRENE

          STEPHEN!!!!
          A loud unpleasant sound. THUD! Irene screams.
          Then Stephen stiffens, his body straightening in shock.
          Something's wrong. And now Sara stares in horror as...
          Blood runs down his face. He looks into Sara's eyes... and
          lets go of her.

          She falls, but manages to hook onto the ledge as Stephen
          disappears from the window frame. Using the brick wall for
          leverage, she arduously lifts herself up into the window in
          time to see...
          Stephen, glassy-eyed, backing away from the window. He slumps
          to the floor, revealing:
          Rebecca. She's a crazed mess, hair and eyes wild.
          Rebecca drops the bloody fireplace poker and rushes to the
          window. She helps Sara in. They tumble onto the floor.
          Sara tosses Rebecca to the side and rushes over to Stephen.

                         SARA
          Stephen.
          Stephen is out. She sees the gun in his belt. She pulls it
          out, spins, and levels it at Rebecca. The gun shakes
          violently in her hand.
          Rebecca stands and walks calmly towards Sara, who is still on
          the floor.

                         REBECCA
          You won't do it. We're fr--
          Sara pulls the trigger. Click. Rebecca stares in shock.
          Click. Click. Click. Click. Sara closes her eyes in
          frustration. She drops the gun.
          Tears stream down Rebecca's face. She can't believe Sara
          pulled that trigger. But as if flipping a switch...
          Rebecca's sadness turns to rage. She balls her fists, her
          knuckles white, and...
          CHARGES at Sara full force, slamming her against the wall.
          She tosses her like a ragdoll across the room, where...
          Sara's head slams the nightstand, knocking the contents of
          Rebecca's purse everywhere.
          Rebecca wipes the tears from her eyes. It hurts her to hurt
          Sara.

                         REBECCA
          Friends help each other. They take
          care of each other.
          Sara, dazed and weak, stares at Rebecca.

                         SARA
          Rebecca. We were never friends.
          That's the last straw. Rebecca comes hard, murder in her
          eyes. She grabs Sara around the throat, pulls her up from
          the floor, and slams her against the wall.
          She starts choking the life out of her. Sara's face turns
          red. Redder...
          But suddenly Rebecca's grip loosens. Her eyes stare in shock.
          Sara pulls Rebecca's hands off her neck with one hand. The
          utility knife is in her other hand... stuck between Rebecca's
          shoulder blades.
          Rebecca falls to the floor, bringing Sara down with her. She
          won't let go of Sara. As she gasps for air, she sees...
          Sara's tattoo, visible beneath her torn shirt. Sara self-
          consciously notices her looking at it. Rebecca reaches out
          and grabs Sara's hand.
          Sara lets go of her hand, and removes the necklace from
          around Rebecca's neck.
          Irene is trembling in the bed. Too shocked to say anything.

          She races over to him. He's barely alive.

                         SARA
          Stephen. Hold on.
          She finds her phone on the floor. She steps back to Stephen
          and cradles his head in her lap as she dials 911.
          He looks into her eyes and smiles.
          She smiles through her tears, love in her eyes.

          EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          It's a warm, spring day. Sara, melancholy but looking in
          much better shape since the last time we saw her, stands in
          front of her dorm, looking to restart her college career.
          She plays with the silver chain once again around her neck.

          She opens the front door and walks in. Students milling about
          look at her. Know who she is. We see Kim and Tracy. They
          don't say anything. Don't know what to say.

          INT. DORM ROOM

          Sara opens the door. The simple room is identical to her
          previous one. She hesitates at first but then walks in.
          There is a box marked "SARA" filled with the things she left
          behind in her old dorm. There's a knock on the open door.

          STEPHEN (O.S.)
          Welcome back.

                         SARA
          Hey. How are you feeling?
          Stephen enters the room.

                         STEPHEN
          Better now. You being here's gonna

          Actually, I need you right here,
          right now.
          Stephen grins. He likes where this is headed.

          dinner. You gonna be ready?

                         SARA
          Absolutely.
          Stephen takes off down the hall. Sara follows him with her
          eyes before she goes back into her room.

          INT. DORM ROOM

          Sara sits down on her bed. She watches the empty space where
          the other bed used to be. She just stares at it. The camera
          slowly tracks sideways until we see the side of the bookshelf
          where unseen by Sara, there's a flyer hung with a picture of
          Richard Prince's Nurse of Greenmeadow announcing an upcoming
          gallery exhibition.

          CUT TO BLACK.
