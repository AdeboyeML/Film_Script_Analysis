          A SHODDILY PRODUCED TV COMMERCIAL
                         
          The ad depicts videotaped scenes from Wisconsin's north
          country-- a farmer and a cow, a woman waterskiing, a guy
          mowing his lawn. A flat, nasally V.O. accompanies the images.

           paradise, accidents can happen.
                         
          The ad wipes to an inappropriately gruesome photo of an
          obviously fatal car wreck. The NARRATOR is chroma-keyed over
          the image. He is ROGER LEMKE, 40, blandly charismatic, with a
          blonde moustache that evokes a low-rent Tom Selleck.

          The ad has been playing on a 13-inch TV in a small, wood-
          paneled office. A handful of EMPLOYEES and FAMILY MEMBERS

          More laughter and backslapping. After a bit, an as yet unseen

           really is-- it's a noble field. I

          A label reads GIFT CLOSET!!! Each shelf is neatly organized:

           Thanks mucho... So Ronald, what's
           your situation? You married, or...?
                         
                          RONALD
           Negative. I'm pretty well married
           to Ronald Wilkes Insurance. I also
           do quite a bit of work with the St.
           Cloud Chamber. I'm Senior Warden at
           my church. So really, no time for a
           Mrs. Ronald Wilkes.

           Don't get me wrong, I have my

           active in community theater. And I
           have to admit I'm a big enthusiast
           of the HBO program, The Wire. But
           shux, I haven't had a proper

          Tim has finished his sherry. The bartender pours a second

          Tim nervously makes his way to the stage.
                         
          Tim confers with the DJ. The DJ nods, cues up the song. Tim
          gives Joan a look of mock anger as he takes the mic.

           first African-American person I've
           ever met. I mean, I've seen guys at

           awesome guys around. Ronald Wilkes!
                         
          Tim gives Ronald a thumbs-up. Ronald returns the gesture as
          the opening bars of Clarence Carter's PATCHES kick in. [NOTE:
          Patches is an EXTREMELY sentimental soul song about a poor
          black kid named Patches.] The first verse is spoken word.

           I was born and raised down in

           folks used to call me Patches. Papa
           used to tease me about it. But deep
           down inside he was hurt, 'cause
           he'd done all he could.

           My papa was a great old man. I can

           See education he never had; He did
           wonders when the times got bad. The
           little money from the crops he raised
           barely paid the bills we made.
                         
          Joan and Dean rush to the dance floor. Ronald remains on his
          bar stool but bops his head politely. Tim tears it up.

          out from behind a corner, whips some ice machine ice at Dean.
          Dean takes off running after Tim. Joan and Ronald follow.
                         
          - The song fades out as the four of them approach the Pool
          Area. The sign on the pool door says, Hours 8 AM - 11 PM.

                          RONALD
           Can I be honest here, Tim?
                         
                          TIM

                          RONALD
           All's I'm saying is you might've
           wanted to hire an actor with some
           professional training...
                         
                          DEAN
           Jesus-- a retarded kid just sitting
           there yelling would've been better
           than you.
                         
                          TIM
           Aw, you're both a couple of a-
           holes...
                         
          Tim whips an empty beer can at Dean. The three friends laugh--
          living life in the moment. As it should be.
