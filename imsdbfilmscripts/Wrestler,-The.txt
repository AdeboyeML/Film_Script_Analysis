          Over OPENING CREDITS, a montage of OLD WRESTLING-MAGAZINE
          PHOTOS. Action shots of RANDY "THE RAM" ROBINSON taking on a
          keffiyeh-wearing heel named THE AYATOLLAH before 20,000
          screaming fans at Madison Square Garden.
          
          The sounds of a SCREAMING, CHEERING CROWD overwhelm us. Over
          the images, RINGSIDE ANNOUNCERS boom commentary:
          
          ----"Oh, my! Ram hit with a devastating piledriver!"
          
          ----"I've never seen a guy get fired into a buckle that hard!"
          
          ----"The Ayatollah taking it to The Ram outside the ring!"
          
          ----"Ram absorbing tremendous punishment! How much more can he
          take?"
          
          ----"Wait a minute... Look at this... The Ram is getting up!"
          
          ----"He's coming back! I don't believe it!"
          
          ----"Suplex!"
          
          ----"Powerbomb!"
          
          ----"Randy The Ram Robinson giving absolutely everything he's
          got! This is the very definition of heart!"
          
          ----"Just listen to this crowd! The entire Garden, 20,000
          people, are on their feet!"
          
          ----"Ram climbing to the top rope... The crowd going wild...
          They know what's coming..."
          
          A PHOTO of Randy standing on the top rope, his bent arms
          pressed against the sides of his head like RAM'S HORNS.
          
          ----"Uh-oh, the horns are out... Here it comes..."
          
          We FREEZE on a final image of Randy FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE
          CANVAS, horns out, poised to crash down on The Ayatollah.
          
          ----"Ram Jam! Lights out!!"
          
          Over this, the sound of the crowd GOING CRAZY.
          
          The Def Leppard song rings out as we...

          INT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Present day. Post-match. Randy, pushing 50, still with the
          same long, dyed-blond mane, sits on a bench in the boys
          locker room of a Wilmington, Delaware high school.
          
          CHYRON: 20 YEARS LATER
          
          He pulls off his purple spandex wrestling tights. Lime-green
          ram's horns run up the sides. They're the same kind of tights
          as in the `80s pics----and may well be the actual same pair.
          
          Naked except for a jockstrap, Randy takes a breath. Achy,
          sweaty, saggy, exhausted. A battered warrior. Scars all over
          his body. Despite the rough shape he's in, it's clear he's
          just given it his all in the ring. He swigs down a few pills
          with a beer.
          
          Promoter SCOTT BRUMBERG, a heavyset man in a Mets jersey with
          BRUMBERG - 44 on the back, approaches.
          
                               SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    Great show, Ram. Ya turned it out.
                        (a little sad)
                    As always.
          
          He hands Randy some cash. Randy counts it. It's not much.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. I was sure the gate'd be
                    bigger.
          
          Randy just shrugs resignedly.
          
          
          EXT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy, changed into his street clothes, limps out of the
          school, each step labored and painful. Waiting near the
          entrance are TWO FANS, both men in their 30s.
          
                              FAN #1
                    Yo, Ram. Think you could...?
          
          Fan #1 holds out a SHARPIE and an old WRESTLING PROGRAM from
          the `80s. On the cover is a shot of Randy wrestling CORPORAL
          PUNISHMENT, a heel in a drill instructor get-up.
          
          Randy takes the program, happy to oblige.
          
                              FAN #1 (CONT'D)
                    I was there.
          
                                                                     3.
          
          
          Randy hands back the program. FAN #2 hands him a MINI-POSTER.
          The faded, mid-'80s poster features Randy, biceps bulging,
          crushing a head of broccoli between his fists. Across the
          top, it says "EAT YOUR VEGETABLES, PUNK!"
          
                              FAN #2
                        (as Randy signs)
                    My first match ever was you versus
                    Davey Diamond at the Spectrum.
                        (NOSTALGIC)
                    1985...
          
          Randy smiles a little. He remembers, too. He hands back the
          poster. Fan #2 looks fondly at Randy, a part of his boyhood.
          
                              FAN #2 (CONT'D)
                        (vaguely sad)
                    You were awesome.
          
          Randy nods, a bit uncomfortably. The two fans, muttering
          thanks, drift off into the Delaware night. Randy is left
          standing alone, still holding Fan #1's pen.
          
          He walks over to a beat-up old CONVERSION VAN and climbs in.
          Turns on the engine. Music starts up on the stereo mid-song.
          
          MUSIC: CINDERELLA - "DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GOT (TIL IT'S GONE)"
          
          
          INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy is driving. On the dashboard is an old ACTION FIGURE OF
          HIMSELF from his WWF days. On the stereo, a different song
          plays, later in the same album.
          
          MUSIC: CINDERELLA   - "FIRE AND ICE"
          
          Randy pulls into the entrance gate of PARADISE OAKS TRAILER
          PARK.
          
          
          EXT. PARADISE OAKS - RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy parks in front of his TRAILER. He gets out and heads
          toward it. A dismayed look comes over his face.
          
          RANDY'S POV: The door is PADLOCKED.
          
          He tugs on the lock. Tugs on the door. No dice.
          
          He violently kicks the padlock in a moment of rage.
          
                                                                      4.
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy resignedly climbs into the BACK OF HIS VAN.
          
          
          INT. BACK OF VAN - LATER
          
          Randy lies on a scrunched-up mattress on the floor, unable to
          sleep.
          
          The van wall is decorated with a MINI-SHRINE Randy has built
          to himself. Old magazine and newspaper clippings, mini-
          posters, etc. A few changes of clothes lie in a messy heap in
          the corner.
          
          He grabs a bottle of pills and pops a few, washing them down
          with a beer. He closes his eyes, trying to unwind.
          
                                                              CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. BACK OF VAN - NEXT MORNING
          
          Randy is asleep in his clothes from the night before. He's
          STIRRED AWAKE by the sound of kids YELLING and BANGING on the
          outside of van.
          
                              KID'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Ram!
          
          He slowly sits upright, massaging his pain-wracked knees.
          Every inch of him feels like shit.
          
                              ANOTHER KID'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Raaam!
          
          RANDY'S POV: Through the front windshield, TWO 8-YEAR-OLD
          KIDS, boosted by TWO OTHER KIDS, are peering in.
          
          
          EXT. PARADISE OAKS - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy is playfully tussling with the four kids. He picks one
          of them up and "bodyslams" him.
          
                              RANDY
                        (announcer voice)
                    Oh, my... look out!
          
          He picks up another one and fake-drops him on his head.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Suplex!
          
                                                                   5.
          
          
          He slams a third one. The kids are squealing with delight.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Tombstone piledriver!
          
          Randy sees a car drive up and park by the MANAGER'S OFFICE.
          He watches it with interest.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Catch you maniacs later...
          
          The kids moan with disappointment as Randy heads off.
          
          
          INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Randy glares at Len, the trailer park's MANAGER.
          
                              RANDY
                    C'mon, Len. Don't be such a fuckin'
                    ballbreaker.
          
                              LEN THE MANAGER
                    You'll get in when I get my rent.
          
                              RANDY
                    You know I'm good for it.
          
                              LEN THE MANAGER
                    Sure. You're good for it every time
                    this happens.
          
          Randy sigh-groans in frustration.
          
                              RANDY
                    Can I at least park in back?
          
          Len looks at Randy. A wave of pity comes over him.
          
                              LEN THE MANAGER
                    Twenty bucks.
          
          
          EXT. PARADISE OAKS - IN BACK - EVENING
          
          Randy sits on a MILK CRATE by his parked van. On the ground
          in front of him is a BLENDER connected to an extension cord
          stretching to another TRAILER. He pours a protein-shake
          packet into the blender.
          
          The trailer door opens. A WOMAN comes out. Lighting a
          cigarette, she looks up at the cloudless, starry sky.
          
                                                                      6.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Thanks, Meg.
          
          She gives Randy a small "You got it" wave.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

          Randy enters a suburban Shop-Rite.
          
          
          INT. SHOP-RITE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy sticks his head in a door marked MANAGER'S OFFICE.
          
                              RANDY
                    Hey, Wayne.
          
          
          INT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Sitting behind a desk is store manager WAYNE (40). He looks
          up at Randy, irked.
          
                              WAYNE
                    Do we not know how to knock?
          
          Wayne casually clicks a porn site closed on his computer.
          
                              WAYNE (CONT'D)
                    Let's try that again.
          
          Randy steps out and closes the door behind him. He knocks.
          
                               WAYNE (CONT'D)
                    Come in!
          
          Randy enters.
          
                              WAYNE (CONT'D)
                    Oh, hi, Randy! What can I do for
                    you?
          
          Randy groans privately. He really hates Wayne.
          
                              RANDY
                    Do you have any extra shifts you
                    could throw my way?
          
                              WAYNE
                    What's the matter, they raise the
                    price of tights?
          
                                                                   7.
          
          
          Randy is not amused. Wayne grabs a LOOSELEAF BINDER.
          
                              WAYNE (CONT'D)
                    Let's see what we got.
          
          Wayne starts flipping through.

          Randy, working alongside some MEXICAN GUYS, lifts a STACK OF
          BOXES off the back of a BOAR'S HEAD DELIVERY TRUCK.
          
          He carries the boxes through a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN, into a
          WALK-IN COOLER. He puts them down and heads back out again.

          Randy stands with GREGG, a huge bodybuilder who's counting
          off some bills. Randy growls with displeasure at the small,
          liquid-filled GLASS BOTTLE in his hand.
          
          ANGLE ON bottle: The label says SUSTANON 250. The rest of the
          label is in SPANISH.
          
                              GREGG
                    I'm tellin' ya, bro, it's identical
                    to the German.
          
                              RANDY
                    I tried Mexican sus once. Gave me
                    bitch tits.
          
                              GREGG
                    Years ago, right? Mexican's way
                    better now.
          
                              RANDY
                    I don't want this.
          
                              GREGG
                    Bro, it's the same.
          
                              RANDY
                    I want my German.
          
                                                                      8.
          
          
                              GREGG
                    I don't have any.
          
                               RANDY
                    Yeah?
          
          Randy steps in front of Gregg's locker and starts ROOTING
          AROUND.
          
                              GREGG
                    What are you doing?
          
          Randy finds a bottle with GERMAN WRITING on it.
          
                              GREGG (CONT'D)
                    That's my own stash. That's my last
                    one.
          
          Randy puts the bottle of Mexican sustanon in the locker and
          walks off with the German.
          
                              RANDY
                    Danke schoen.
          
          
          INT. LOCKER ROOM - TOILET STALL - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy, underwear pulled down, plunges a needle into his ass
          cheek.
          
          
          INT. GYM FLOOR - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy is BENCHPRESSING. He grunts loudly as he squeezes out
          one more rep, his SPOTTER urging him on.
          
                              SPOTTER
                    Push it out----you got this!
          
          
          INT. SUNSATIONS TANNING SALON - LATER
          
          A strip-mall tanning salon. Randy breezes in, nodding hello
          to the FRONT-DESK WOMAN, who's on the phone.
          
                              RANDY
                    How ya doin', Glor?
          
                              FRONT-DESK WOMAN
                        (cupping phone)
                    Hey, babe. Four's open.
          
                                                                      9.
          
          
          INT. SUNSATIONS TANNING SALON - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          ANGLE ON an upright tanning pod. INSIDE THE POD, Randy is
          standing naked, baking under the UV lights.
          
          
          INT. LOOKING GOOD HAIR & NAILS - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy sits in a chair as a KOREAN LADY wearing latex gloves
          BLEACHES HIS ROOTS. His hair is full of plastic clips.
          
                              RANDY
                    Don't leave it in too long. All
                    those pieces broke off last time.
          
                              KOREAN LADY
                    Okay, okay, no problem.
          
                                                              CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. VAN - DAY
          
          MUSIC: GREAT WHITE - "ONCE BITTEN TWICE SHY"
          
          Randy is driving along Route 21. "Once Bitten Twice Shy" is
          blasting on the stereo. One hand on the wheel, he bangs out
          the song's piano riff on the dash with the other.
          
          He passes Cheetah's, a STRIP CLUB. He keeps an eye on it as
          he drives past.
          
          The song fades out. He pops the tape out of the deck and
          tosses it on the passenger seat. On it is a messy pile of old
          cassettes. Skid Row. Mötley Crüe. AC/DC. Guns `N' Roses. He
          sifts through the selection, one eye on the road.
          
          
          INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          MUSIC: AC/DC - "BACK IN BLACK"
          
          Randy is still driving. AC/DC's "Back In Black" cranks loud.
          He pulls into the parking lot of a VFW HALL and parks.
          
          
          INT. PASSAIC VFW HALL - CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          A makeshift locker room/staging area. Randy and 20 or so
          other WRESTLERS stand before the event's sleazy, tracksuit-
          clad promoter, NICK VOLPE.
          
                                                                  10.
          
          
                              NICK VOLPE
                    Listen up, only saying it once. Vic
                    Storm, you're up first against D-
                    Day. Second, Shawn McPride and
                    Funkmaster Garry B. Slick. Third,
                    Frankie Cirillo and Rob Dynamo
                    versus J.T. Anvil and The Ultimate
                    Freak. Fourth, Teddy Brewski and
                    Lex Lethal. Intermission. Fifth,
                    Samoan Savages versus the Disco
                    Brothers. Sixth, the Irish Warrior
                    and Vyper. Seventh, "Sandman" Steve
                    Sambuca versus Hollywood. Last but
                    not least, for the strap, Kid Loco
                    versus Randy The Ram. Got it? Good.
          
          Volpe walks off.
          
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy sits alone a table toward the back. He takes a roll of
          athletic tape out of his supplies-filled WHEELIE TRAVEL BAG.
          He starts WRAPPING HIS KNEES AND ANKLES. He does it in a
          slow, methodical manner. It feels almost ritualistic.
          
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy is hashing out the match with his opponent, a wiry
          Puerto Rican kid whose shiny vinyl pants identify him as KID
          LOCO (22).
          
                              RANDY
                    Right there, you post me. Hard. I
                    show color.
          
          Kid Loco nods, listening closely, deferential to the legend.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    You post me again. Again.
                        (Kid Loco nods)
                    You're fuckin' whalin' on my ass.
          
                              LEX LETHAL (O.S.)
                    Ram.
          
          Randy turns and sees fellow wrestler LEX LETHAL sticking his
          head into the cafeteria door.
          
                              LEX LETHAL (CONT'D)
                    There's some chick out here looking
                    for you.
          
                                                                  11.
          
          
                                RANDY
                    Who?
          
                              LEX LETHAL
                        (SHRUGS)
                    Some chick.
          
                                RANDY
                    Ring rat?
          
                              LEX LETHAL
                    I don't think so.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Randy emerges from the cafeteria. A look of PLEASED SURPRISE
          comes over his face.
          
                              RANDY
                    What's up, kiddo?
          
          RANDY'S POV: Standing there in an otherwise empty hallway is
          a plain-ish YOUNG WOMAN (22). She looks at him with an
          unsmiling expression. This is STEPHANIE.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Long time no see.
          
          Randy pulls her in for a hug. She doesn't really hug back.
          
          She steps back, breaking off the hug. A brief, awkward pause.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Whatcha doing here? Here to root on
                    your old man?
          
          She shakes her head no.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    That's okay----as long as you're not
                    rooting against me!
          
          She is irked by his jokiness.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Is there someplace we can talk?
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm on in a sec.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    It won't take much of your time.
          
                                                                12.
          
          
                                   RANDY
                    What's up?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I'm here because...
          
          Stephanie gathers herself. This isn't easy for her.
          
                              STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    I came to make amends.
          
                                   RANDY
                    Amends?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I'm supposed to talk to people I've
                    hurt.
          
          Randy is puzzled for a moment. Then, it clicks in.
          
                              RANDY
                    Ohh... 12-stepper.
          
                                   STEPHANIE
                          (NODS)
                    AA.
          
                              RANDY
                    Good for you. That's great.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Thank you. I'm sure you mean that.
          
                                   RANDY
                    I do.
          
          She smile-nods insincerely.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    So's that it?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I need to apologize.
          
                                   RANDY
                    For what?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    For anything I've done or said over
                    the years. All the anger at you.
          
                                   RANDY
                    Okay...
          
                                                                  13.
          
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Like the last time I saw you... I'm
                    sorry for what I said.
          
                              RANDY
                        (dismissive wave)
                    Don't worry about it.
          
          Stephanie is irked by his lack of engagement. She looks at
          him with suspicion.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Do you even know what I said?
          
                              RANDY
                    Sure.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    What did I say?
          
                              RANDY
                    It was about your mom. And me.
                        (vague, flailing)
                    Like, how I was bad.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    You have no idea.
          
                              MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Raa-am!
          
          Randy turns and sees TWO MEATHEAD FANS down the hall, headed
          his way.
          
                              MEATHEAD #1
                    Whassup, yo? Randy The Ram!
          
          MEATHEAD #1 gives Randy an excited high-five.
          
                              MEATHEAD #2
                    We gonna see some action tonight?
          
                              RANDY
                        (sly grin)
                    Tonight's forecast calls for severe
                    butt-whoopin's with a 100 percent
                    chance of pain.
          
          Psyched "Yeah!"s from the meatheads. Stephanie is pissed at
          the interruption. And, even more, Randy's embrace of it.
          
                              MEATHEAD #1
                    Could we get a picture?
          
                                                                  14.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    No problemo.
          
          The two meatheads flank Randy, their arms around his broad
          shoulders. Meathead #1 looks tentatively at Stephanie,
          holding up his DIGITAL CAMERA.
          
                              MEATHEAD #1
                    Think you could...?
          
          She coldly takes it.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    No problemo.
          
          She looks into the camera. The meatheads stick their tongues
          out and throw up devil signs. Randy flexes theatrically,
          making his best "Aaargh!" wrestling face.
          
          Stephanie snaps a shot. Meathead #1 takes back his camera. He
          and his buddy pat Randy heartily on the back.
          
                              MEATHEAD #1
                    Thanks a lot, yo. Kick some ass out
                    there.
          
                              RANDY
                    You know it, broski!
          
          The meatheads excitedly head off.
          
          Randy turns his attention back to Stephanie, who's glaring at
          him with cold disgust.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                    Same shit.
          
                              RANDY
                    They're fans.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Same old shit.
          
                              RANDY
                    I hafta. It's work.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I'm in the middle of saying
                    something important and you drop it
                    for the fucking wrestling.
          
                                                                     15.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    I didn't ask them to come over.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    It's like I'm 10 all over again.
          
                              RANDY
                    Are we almost done with this?
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                    This what?
          
                              RANDY
                    This ATTACK.
          
          She looks at him calmly. Sadly.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Yeah. We're done.
          
          She walks off.
          
                                                       HARD CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. THE RING - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy SMASHING KID LOCO IN THE FACE with a flying drop-kick.
          Kid Loco falls to the canvas.
          
          Randy struts around the ring, exhorting the crowd, soaking up
          their cheers.
          
          Distracted, Randy doesn't notice Kid Loco peeling himself off
          the mat. Kid Loco sneaks up behind Randy and SMASHES HIM IN
          THE HEAD. Randy goes down.
          
          Kid Loco lifts Randy up. They're both on their knees, chest-
          to-chest. Kid Loco steps to his feet, lifting Randy with him.
          
          Kid Loco tightens around Randy's arms, arches his back,
          presses out his chest and... WHAM!! He and Randy fly with a
          LATERAL DROP. Randy's head hits the canvas hard as he slams
          down on his back.
          
          As Randy writhes on the mat, Kid Loco HEADS FOR THE
          TURNBUCKLE.
          
          RANDY'S POV: Kid Loco is untying the turnbuckle's padded
          cover.
          
          Randy, clutching his back, discretely reaches into the
          waistband of his tights and pulls out a RAZOR BLADE. He tucks
          the blade between two fingers in his cupped palm.
          
                                                                     16.
          
          
          Kid Loco heads back to Randy. He picks up him by the hair and
          drags him to the turnbuckle, throwing him HEAD-FIRST into the
          exposed metal post beneath.
          
          Randy, clutching his smashed head, discretely runs the blade
          along his hairline. No one sees it happen.
          
          BLOOD STREAMS DOWN Randy's forehead. The crowd's ELECTRIFIED.
          
          Kid Loco slams Randy's head into the metal post again. Again.
          Randy slumps over the corner ropes. Kid Loco cockily struts
          around the ring.
          
                              KID LOCO
                    Look at this loser! How pathetic.
          
          ANGLE ON Randy. The taunting stirs something in him. A look
          comes over him, like he's Bruce Banner about to become the
          Hulk.
          
          Kid Loco saunters back over to Randy. He grabs his head for
          another post smash, but HE CAN'T. Randy's neck and arm
          muscles bulge. His neck veins pop like he's suddenly super-
          charged.
          
          A look of FEAR comes over Kid Loco. He knows the tide is
          about to turn.
          
          Randy reaches over his shoulder and grabs Kid Loco by the
          hair. He pulls him in close.
          
                              RANDY
                        (under breath)
                    Let's go home.
          
          Randy juts his hips back and bends over, gaining the leverage
          he needs for a throw. Kid Loco shakes his head, begging no.
          
          Randy straightens his legs, raises his lower back, and yanks
          down on Kid Loco's head. Kid Loco's feet fly off the canvas
          as his head gets BURIED INTO THE MAT. He gets stuck UPSIDE
          DOWN with his feet over the ropes.
          
          Randy, holding onto the top rope with both hands, thrusts his
          knee into Kid Loco's stomach. Again. Again.
          
          Kid Loco somehow manages to untangle himself from the ropes.
          He scurries away. Randy goes after him.
          
          Randy hits Kid Loco with everything he's got. Dropkicks.
          Elbows. Bodyslams. He pours it on, unstoppable.
          
          Randy drags Kid Loco into the middle of the ring. He looks
          out at the crowd.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          
          RANDY'S POV: A trio of fans are chanting.
          
                                TRIO
                      Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
          
          Randy cups his hand to his ear. The chant quickly spreads.
          
                                WHOLE CROWD (O.S.)
                      RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...
          
          Randy "mulls" it over. He looks at his laid-out foe. He looks
          at the corner. He heads for the corner.
          
          Randy climbs to the top rope. He looks around at the crowd
          like he's still undecided.
          
          RANDY'S POV: The fans are cheering, wild with anticipation.
          
          Randy bends his arms, pressing them against the side of his
          head like ram's horns. (Just like in the photo in the opening
          montage.)
          
          He LEAPS.
          
          The leap is not terribly high or graceful. He crashes down
          onto Kid Loco horns-first. Kid Loco's whole body convulses.
          
          The fans lose it. This is what they wanted. The Ram Jam. The
          money shot.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - LATER
          
          Randy, on a post-match high, sits on a cafeteria table
          enjoying a beer as a pseudo-MEDIC stitches up his hairline
          gash. Nick Volpe wanders over.
          
                                MEDIC
                      Ram, man, you popped that crowd.
          
          Randy smiles contentedly. He sure did.
          
                                NICK VOLPE (O.S.)
                      Yo, Ram. Got a sec?
          
          Nick Volpe comes over.
          
                                RANDY
                      For you, needledick? Always.
          
                                NICK VOLPE
                      Do you realize what's coming up?
          
                                                                   18.
          
          
          Randy looks at him, unsure.
          
                                 NICK VOLPE (CONT'D)
                    May 6th...
          
          Randy racks his brains. He has no idea.
          
                              NICK VOLPE (CONT'D)
                    20th anniversary of you and
                    Ayatollah at the Garden.
          
                              RANDY
                        (AMAZED)
                    Holy shit...
          
                              NICK VOLPE
                    I know. Time fuckin' flies.
          
          Randy sees an excited smile creep across Volpe's face.
          
                              RANDY
                    Whatcha thinkin'?
          
                              NICK VOLPE
                    Two words: Re. Match.
          
          Randy is instantly intrigued.
          
                              NICK VOLPE (CONT'D)
                    I'm doing a big Fanfest thing down
                    in South Carolina that weekend. I
                    wanna main-event it with you two.
          
                                 RANDY
                    Yeah?
          
                              NICK VOLPE
                    Ram-Ayatollah II. 20th anniversary.
                    Hundreds, thousands of screaming
                    fans watching you two make history
                    for the second time.
          
                              RANDY
                    Think Bob'd get back in there? He's
                    pretty retired.
          
                              NICK VOLPE
                    For this?
                        (cool, confident nod)
                    I bet he'd be willing to dust off
                    the old turban.
          
                                                                  19.
          
          
          Randy's mouth is practically watering.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. CHEETAH'S - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          A spring in his hobbled step, Randy gets out of the van and
          heads toward Cheetah's, the strip club he passed earlier.
          Manning the door is BIG CHRIS, a huge bouncer/doorman.
          
                              BIG CHRIS
                    Whassup, Ram? How ya been?
          
                              RANDY
                    Yo, Big Chris.
          
          They chummily shake hands. Big Chris pulls Randy in tight.
          
                              BIG CHRIS
                        (into Randy's ear)
                    Hey, can you get me any more of
                    that IGF-1?
          
                              RANDY
                    What do I look like, some fuckin'
                    two-bit street dealer?
          
                              BIG CHRIS
                    C'mon, hook a brother up. You get
                    the family discount.
          
                              RANDY
                    Swing by the mansion. Any day this
                    week.
          
                              BIG CHRIS
                    You da man, Ram!
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          MUSIC: BIRDMAN & LIL WAYNE - "STUNTIN' LIKE MY DADDY"
          
          A crowded, not-very-glamorous Jersey strip club. Randy stands
          over by the bar. The female BARTENDER slides him a beer.
          
                              RANDY
                    Thanks, hon.
          
          Randy takes a swig, looking around the club.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Cassidy around?
          
                                                                     20.
          
          
                                BARTENDER
                      I think she's VIP-in'.
          
          Randy, nodding, takes his beer and heads over toward the
          STAGE. He settles in at an open table.
          
          
          ON STAGE:
          
          A YOUNG STRIPPER (22) works the pole, grinding lewdly to
          "Stuntin' Like My Daddy", a bass-heavy Dirty South rap song.
          
          
          RANDY:
          
          Randy, watching her, quickly grows bored. He finds the
          stripper, like the song, crude and soulless.
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Randy is at the urinal. He flushes and heads over to the
          sink. He washes his hands, checking his look in the mirror.
          He primps a little.
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy exits the bathroom and heads back toward the table. En
          route, he passes a curtained-off VIP ROOM.
          
                                WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                      Trust me, babe. You're gonna be
                      happy.
          
          Randy, hearing this, slows.
          
                                DUDE #1 (O.S.)
                      We said the other one.
          
                                DUDE #2 (O.S.)
                      The redhead. With the belly chain.
          
          Randy peeks through the curtain. Inside, he sees CASSIDY
          (36), a sexy, tattooed, aging rocker chick in a white spandex
          dress. With her are six hair-gelled, goombah-wannabe BACHELOR-
          PARTY DUDES (early 20s). The BACHELOR is sitting in a chair
          in the middle.
          
                                CASSIDY
                      Sorry, guys, she's on break.
          
                                                                  21.
          
          
                                DUDE #1
                      Well, I'm sorry, but we don't want
                      you.
          
                                DUDE #3
                      How old are you, anyway?
          
                                BACHELOR
                      You're, like, my mom's age.
          
          Stifled laughter from his buddies.
          
          
          OTHER SIDE OF CURTAIN:
          
          Randy's anger builds as he watches.
          
          
          VIP ROOM:
          
          Cassidy, trying to salvage the gig, straddles the bachelor.
          
                                CASSIDY
                      There's nothing like experience.
                          (into his ear, seductive)
                      I've done things your little
                      fiancee's never dreamed of...
          
                                DUDE #2
                      Yeah, like graduate in 1985.
          
          This cracks his friends up. Randy BURSTS THROUGH THE CURTAIN.
          
                                RANDY
                          (to Dude #2)
                      Apologize to this lady.
          
          Everyone is taken aback, including Cassidy.
          
                                DUDE #3
                      Who the hell are you?
          
                                RANDY
                      You speak to her with respect.
          
          Cassidy wedges herself between Randy and Dude #2.
          
                                CASSIDY
                      I got this. It's okay.
          
                                RANDY
                      No, it's not okay. This is
                      definitely not okay.
          
                                                                  22.
          
          
          He turns to the bachelor.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    I guarantee this woman's 50 times
                    hotter than whatever goombah skank
                    you're about to marry.
          
                              DUDE #4
                        (to Dude #1)
                    You hear what he just called Gina?!
          
                              DUDE #1
                    That's my fuckin' sister!
          
          Dude #1 steps to Randy, chest puffed out. Randy whips around
          and GRABS THE CHAIR OUT FROM UNDER THE BACHELOR. He wields it
          menacingly at Dude #1, who backpedals, terrified.
          
          Randy makes like he's going to hit the guy with the chair.
          Instead, he FLINGS IT AT THE WALL.
          
                     DUDE #2                         DUDE #1
          Jesus!!                         What the FUCK!!
          
          The entire bachelor party rushes for the curtain. Just like
          that, they're GONE.
          
          Randy looks at Cassidy, expecting a hearty thank you. Instead
          he gets a PISSED-OFF SHOVE.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Thanks a lot. That was 200 bucks
                    just walked out.
          
          Randy is totally taken aback.
          
                              RANDY
                    I was just trying to help.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    Did I ask for help?
                        (BEAT)
                    Did I need help?
          
          Randy looks down, silent and sheepish.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Then don't fuckin' help.
          
                               RANDY
                    You're right. I'm sorry.
                        (BEAT)
                    I'm sorry.
          
                                                                    23.
          
          
          Cassidy calms down a little.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    That's okay.
          
          She looks at him with a warm smile.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Good to see ya, man.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          MUSIC: KHIA - "MY NECK, MY BACK"
          
          Randy is getting a LAPDANCE from Cassidy. She plants her
          hands against the mirrored wall behind him, her body just
          inches from his face.
          
                              RANDY
                    We're talking one of the historic
                    matches in history. 20,000 people.
                    Another million and a half watching
                    at home on pay-per-view.
          
          She turns, giving him a nice view of her writhing behind. On
          the small of her back is an AC/DC TATTOO.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    We were going back and forth, just
                    killin' each other for a half hour.
                    Any wrestling fan, they know all
                    about it.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Million and a half? Shit.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah, it was big. So a rematch...
                        (smiles, contemplating the
                         PROSPECT)
                    History all over again.
          
          Cassidy turns around again. Randy looks her body up and down,
          savoring her curves as she dances just for him.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Goddamn you are smokin'.
          
          Cassidy smiles a little. This makes her feel good.
          
                                                                  24.
          
          
          "My Neck My Back" ENDS. Cassidy pulls back on her dress and
          casually sits down next to him. A new song comes on.
          
          MUSIC: PITBULL - "UNA MANO LAVA LA OTRA"
          
          They look toward the stage, where a PUERTO RICAN STRIPPER
          shakes her ass to the staccato, abrasive Latin rap song.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Who knows. I put on a good show...
          
          Cassidy nods supportively, sincerely.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Could be the thing that gets me
                    back on top.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You never know who's in that crowd.
          
          An ALARMED LOOK comes over Cassidy's face.
          
                                CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Jesus.
          
          Randy follows her eyes to his HAIRLINE.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    You're bleeding.
          
          A small amount of BLOOD is trickling down from his stitches.
          He grabs a COCKTAIL NAPKIN and casually dabs it.
          
                              RANDY
                    Got cut tonight.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    You okay?
          
                              RANDY
                    Ah, it's nothing.
          
                              CASSIDY
                        (small chuckle)
                    And they say wrestling's fake.
          
          Randy proudly holds out his arm.
          
                              RANDY
                    How's this for fake?
          
          CASSIDY'S POV: A long-ish SCAR on Randy's bicep.
          
                                                                  25.
          
          
                              CASSIDY
                    What's that from?
          
                              RANDY
                    1986. Denver Coliseum. Billy Bob
                    Banjo hit me with his two-by-four.
                    Loose nail tore the bicep open.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Ow. Fuck.
          
                              RANDY
                    I got even better.
          
          He pulls down his shirt collar, revealing a nasty COLLARBONE
          SCAR.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    1988. Orlando Arena. Mr.
                    Magnificent tossed me out of the
                    ring. Landed on my shoulder,
                    clavicle snapped in half.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Doesn't it hurt?
          
                              RANDY
                        (BLISSFUL)
                    Not when they're going crazy for
                    you...
          
          Cassidy stands up and straddles him, gazing soulfully at the
          scar.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    "He was pierced for our
                    transgressions, He was crushed for
                    our iniquities. The punishment that
                    brought us peace was upon Him, and
                    by His wounds we were healed."
          
          Randy contemplates the quote. He likes it.
          
                              RANDY
                    What's that?
          
                               CASSIDY
                    It's from "Passion of the Christ".
                        (BEAT)
                    You never seen it?
          
          Randy shrugs no.
          
                                                                  26.
          
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Dude, you gotta. It's amazing.
          
          She sits down next to him again.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    It's, like, so inspiring. They
                    throw everything at Him. Whips,
                    arrows, rocks... Just beat the
                    living fuck out of Him for the
                    whole two hours. And He just takes
                    it.
          
                              RANDY
                    Huh. I'll have to check it out.
          
          Cassidy lightly traces a finger along Randy's bicep scar.

                    The sacrificial Ram...
          
          The Pitbull song ends. A new song begins.

                                CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Ah, shit.
          
                              CLUB D.J. (O.S.)
                    And now, please welcome to the
                    Cheetah's stage...
          
          Cassidy stands up.
          
                              CLUB D.J. (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    ...the lovely Cassidy!
          
          Randy reaches into a pocket and pulls out some bills.
          
                              RANDY
                    What do I owe?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Just gimme for three.
          
          Randy peels off three $20s and hands them to her.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    You'll wait `til I'm done?
          
          Randy just smiles. She gives him a small peck on the cheek
          and heads off.
          
                                                                     27.
          
          
          THE STAGE:
          
          Cassidy BURSTS ONTO THE STAGE. She owns it with rock `n' roll
          energy.
          
          
          ON RANDY:
          
          ANGLE ON Randy's face as he enjoys the dance.
          
                                                             CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. VAN - DAY
          
          Randy is driving over the Throgs Neck Bridge.
          
          
          EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          The van pulls up to a TWO-FAMILY HOUSE in working-class
          Queens. Out steps Lex Lethal (from the Passaic VFW show).
          
          
          INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy heads down a highway entrance ramp, Lex Lethal riding
          shotgun.
          
                                 LEX LETHAL
                       Thanks for the lift, bro.
          
                                 RANDY
                       No prob. You're right on the way.
          
          Randy merges into traffic on the Long Island Expressway.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                       So how big's this place?
          
                                  LEX LETHAL
                       Nice. Two, two-fifty...

                           (PLEASED)
                       That place?
          
                                 LEX LETHAL
                       Should get a good gate. DiFusco
                       says he's gotten like 20 calls last
                       two days alone.
          
                                                                  28.
          
          
          Randy chuckles cynically.
          
                              RANDY
                    God bless hardcore...
          
          
          INT. DOLLAR TREE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          A Long Island strip-mall 99-CENT STORE. Randy and Lex browse
          an aisle. Randy is holding a TIN CAKE PAN. He bangs it
          against his forehead, testing it out. It makes a LOUD CLANG.
          
                              RANDY
                    Whatcha think?
          
          Lex takes the pan, testing it against his own head.
          
                              LEX LETHAL
                    Cookie trays were better.
          
          Lex spots something exciting on another shelf.
          
                              LEX LETHAL (CONT'D)
                    Hell, yeah.
          
          He grabs a pack of STEEL-WOOL PADS. Randy nods in approval.
          Lex tosses them into the SHOPPING BASKET Randy is holding.
          
          ANGLE ON basket. It's full of all sorts of "supplies": cookie
          trays, lightbulbs, thumbtacks, cheese graters, wire hangers,
          cutlery sets, pizza cutters, etc.
          
                              RANDY
                    Let's see if they got extension
                    cords.
          
          They head off in search.
          
          
          INT. NORTH BABYLON COMMUNITY CENTER - GYM - LATER
          
          MUSIC: AC/DC - "IF YOU WANT BLOOD (YOU GOT IT)"
          
          Randy stands BEHIND A CURTAIN as his entrance song plays. He
          sneaks a peek through it.
          
          RANDY'S POV: A ROWDY CROWD of about 150 fills a COMMUNITY-
          CENTER GYM. The vibe of the crowd is a bit rougher than
          previous events. A banner on the wall reads ECHW - EAST COAST
          HARDCORE WRESTLING. Pressed against the outside of the ring
          are a FOLDING TABLE and a 12-FOOT METAL LADDER.
          
                                                                    29.
          
          
          THE RING:
          
          An ANNOUNCER stands with a microphone.
          
                                ANNOUNCER
                      Ladies and gentlemen...
          
          
          BEHIND THE CURTAIN:
          
          Randy stands quiet and peaceful, head lowered slightly.
          
                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                      From Elizabeth, New Jersey,

                      Randy "The Ram" Robinnnnsonnnnn!
          
          
          THE GYM:
          
          Randy explodes into the gym, full of fire and showmanship.
          
          He does a lap around the outside of the ring. His hand is
          raised high in the air, index finger and pinky curled into a
          set of RAM'S HORNS. Fans do the same.
          
          Kids rush toward Randy, reaching out for HIGH FIVES. He
          obliges as many as he possibly can.
          
          Fans hold out FOLDING CHAIRS in front of him. (Just like in
          the opening montage.) He "rams" each one with his forehead.
          
                                AC/DC
                      If you want blood, You got it!/
                      If you want blood, You got it!
          
          He does a lap around the perimeter of the ring,
          enthusiastically head-butting chairs the whole way.
          
                                AC/DC (CONT'D)
                      Blood on the streets, Blood on the

                      last drop/ If you want blood, you
                      got it!!
          
          Randy climbs into the ring. He does a few neck rolls and knee
          bends, limbering up.
          
          The song fades down. A new song rises...
          
          MUSIC: CELTIC FROST - "DOMAIN OF DECAY"
          
                                                                  30.
          
          
          Ugly, plodding HARDCORE DEATH METAL.
          
                              ANNOUNCER
                    And his opponent: From Hampton,
                    Virginia, weighing in at 295
                    pounds...
          
          The boos begin to rain down.
          
                              ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                    Hellbilly Cannibaaaal!
          
          Through the curtain, HELLBILLY CANNIBAL emerges. A huge,
          overalls-clad, mangy, wild-eyed masochist. Crumbs cling to
          his scraggly beard. He's dragging a heavy CANVAS SACK.
          
          A TEENAGER in the crowd holds up a sign reading HELLBILLY
          CANNIBAL SUCKS A FAT DICK.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal climbs into the ring with his sack and a
          folding chair. He heads to the center of the ring, where
          Randy awaits.
          
          They sit down on chairs facing each other. Under Hellbilly
          Cannibal's chair is his canvas sack. Under Randy's is his
          Dollar Tree plastic shopping bag.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal punches Randy. Randy punches Hellbilly
          Cannibal. They take turns punching each other, each shot a
          little harder than the last. It's like a violent game of
          "slaps".
          
          After a stretch of this, Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his
          sack and pulls out a can of BUG SPRAY. He SPRAYS it in
          Randy's face. Randy falls off his chair. He staggers around
          the ring clutching his face, howling in agony.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal smashes the blinded Randy over the head
          with his chair. Randy falls to his knees. Hellbilly Cannibal
          reaches into his sack and pulls out a FLUORESCENT LIGHT TUBE.
          Wielding it like a bat, he SMACKS RANDY in the face. The tube
          explodes with a pop.
          
          Grabbing a folding chair, Hellbilly Cannibal charges toward
          Randy. He takes a flying leap, riding the chair like a boogie
          board. Just as he's about to crash down on Randy, Randy ROLLS
          OUT OF THE WAY. Hellbilly Cannibal's spine gets a violent
          jolt as the chair hits the mat.
          
          Randy reaches into his Dollar Tree bag and pulls out an
          aluminum COOKIE TRAY. He smacks Hellbilly Cannibal in the
          face with it. The tray makes an awesomely loud METALLIC
          CLANG. Randy hits him a bunch more times.
          
                                                                     31.
          
          
          Randy is starting to get winded. His heart beats faster.
          
          He picks up Hellbilly Cannibal and flings him toward the
          ropes. Hellbilly Cannibal, bouncing off, ducks Randy's
          awaiting forearm. He bounces off the opposite ropes and
          crashes into Randy knee-first.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy by the hair and smashes his
          face into the corner post. He scoops him up and FLIPS HIM
          OVER THE TOP ROPE, out of the ring. Randy LANDS HARD on the
          concrete floor.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal hops out of the ring with the folding
          chair. He WHALES RANDY IN THE FACE with it. Randy stumbles
          backwards toward the metal barricade between the ring and the
          fans. Hellbilly Cannibal kicks him in the chest. Randy flips
          over the barricade, into the crowd. Fans scatter in an
          exhilarated panic.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal throws Randy into a row of empty chairs.
          Randy goes sprawling. Chairs fly everywhere.
          
          Randy gets up. His heart is beating LOUD. FAST.
          
          Randy, dazed, heads toward the SNACK-BAR AREA. Hellbilly
          Cannibal follows after him. Randy grabs a metal GARBAGE CAN
          and WHIPS AROUND WITH IT, smacking Hellbilly Cannibal square
          in the face. Hellbilly Cannibal goes down.
          
          Randy shakes out the can's contents over Hellbilly Cannibal,
          showering him in trash. He shoves Hellbilly Cannibal's head
          into the can and falls on it, ass-first.
          
          Randy grabs the ladder resting along the base of the ring. He
          POUNDS THE GARBAGE CAN with it, making an UNHOLY RACKET.
          
          With the can still over his head, Hellbilly Cannibal rises to
          his feet. He HEADBUTTS RANDY with the can. Randy, stumbling
          around, gets headbutted again. Hellbilly Cannibal throws off
          the can and drags Randy back to the ring by his hair,
          carrying the ladder in his other hand.
          
          Plopping Randy down on the mat, Hellbilly Cannibal sets up
          the ladder in the middle of the ring. He heads back out and
          grabs the folding table, setting it up by the ladder. He
          reaches into Randy's Dollar Tree bag and pulls out a BOX OF
          THUMBTACKS. He scatters the tacks all over the table.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy and pulls him up the ladder
          with him. They stand at the top, perched high above the
          table. Just as Hellbilly Cannibal is about to push off, Randy
          surprises him with a VICIOUS HEAD-BUTT. Hellbilly Cannibal is
          caught totally off guard. Randy headbutts him again. Randy
          grabs Hellbilly Cannibal and PUSHES OFF.
          
                                                                   32.
          
          
          In mid-air, Randy does a 180 twist, causing Hellbilly
          Cannibal to CRASH THROUGH THE TABLE with Randy on top of him.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal rolls around the mat in a daze, his back
          bloodied and covered with tacks. He staggers to his feet.
          Randy hits him with a dropkick.
          
          Randy's heartbeat is DEAFENING. All other sounds drop out.
          
          Randy pulls Hellbilly Cannibal off the mat. As he gears up
          for another dropkick, his KNEES BUCKLE. A look comes over his
          face. He DROPS TO HIS KNEES, one hand on the mat.
          
          Randy grabs his arm. He massages it. He FLOPS OVER, clutching
          his chest. He lies on his back gasping for breath, sucking at
          the air.
          
          RANDY'S POV: The fans are unaware anything is wrong. They
          assume it's part of the act.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal sees a look of FEAR in Randy's eyes. He
          knows this is real. He looks out at the crowd.
          
                              HELLBILLY CANNIBAL
                    Is there a doctor?
          
          Few fans look around. Most of them still think this is a gag.
          
          Among those who sense it's real is JERRY DIFUSCO, the event's
          promoter. He climbs into the ring. Kneels over Randy.
          
                              JERRY DIFUSCO
                    Randy. You okay?
          
          Randy is gasping. DiFusco turns to Hellbilly Cannibal.
          
                                JERRY DIFUSCO (CONT'D)
                    Call 911.
          
          Lex Lethal and some of the other wrestlers climb into the
          ring. They huddle around Randy.
          
                              JERRY DIFUSCO (CONT'D)
                    Let's get him up.
          
          With no small effort, they lift Randy. They carry him to the
          ropes. They slow, unsure how best to get him through.
          
                              LEX LETHAL
                    Put him down.
          
          They lower him to the mat. Lex hops out of the ring and grabs
          Randy's ankles.
          
                                                                    33.
          
          
          Several of the other guys hop out of the ring, supporting
          Randy's underside as they carefully, awkwardly pull him out.
          
          By now, the crowd realizes this is real. They surge forward
          as DiFusco and the wrestlers carry Randy toward the exit.
          
                              JERRY DIFUSCO
                    Get back, get back, get back.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy is carried down a LONG HALLWAY, trailed by curious and
          concerned fans. Lex is closest to Randy's head.
          
                              LEX LETHAL
                    You're okay, buddy. Hang on.
          
          They reach a door and enter. The wrestler holding Randy's
          feet shuts it behind them.
          
          
          INT. LOCKER ROOM/STAGING AREA - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy lies on a table, his eyes rolling back in his head. Lex
          squeezes his hand, trying to keep him conscious.
          
                              LEX LETHAL
                    Stay with us, bro. Help's coming.
          
          EMS WORKERS come rushing in.
          
                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
          
          
          INT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - POST-OP RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Randy lies unconscious. There's a BREATHING TUBE in his mouth
          and ANOTHER TUBE going through his CHEST WALL. He's hooked up
          to a MECHANICAL VENTILATOR.
          
                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
          
          
          INT. POST-OP RECOVERY ROOM - NEXT DAY
          
          Randy lies asleep. The breathing tube is out. The chest tube
          is still in.
          
          His eyes slowly open. He looks around, disoriented. Woozy.
          Confused by all the wires on him, he starts PULLING THINGS
          OFF. Monitors BEEP. Nurses rush into the room, calming him
          down as they try to reattach the wires.
          
                                                                   34.
          
          
          He faints.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S ROOM - NEXT DAY
          
          Randy, transferred to a regular hospital room, is watching
          "All My Children" on the wall-mounted TV. The chest tube is
          out, in its place a large bandage.
          
                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                           (slight Indian accent)
                       Mr. Ramovic.
          
          Randy looks up. DR. TARACHANDANI (40) enters the room.
          
                                 RANDY
                       Call me Randy.
          
          The doctor, nodding, looks down Randy's folder.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                       So how we lookin', doc?
          
                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                       A lot better than before the
                       bypass.
          
                                 RANDY
                       Great. So I'm all good.
          
          From the doctor's face, it's not quite that simple.
          
                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                       Your heart... You're going to have
                       to start taking much better care of
                       it.
          
                                 RANDY
                       Like...
          
                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                       For starters, you must take your
                       medication every day.
          
                                 RANDY
                       I could handle that.
          
                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                       No smoking.
                           (Randy nods)
                       And no cocaine.
          
                                                          35.
          
          
                              RANDY
                        (defensive, offended)
                    I don't do coke.
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI
                    It's all over your blood work.
          
                              RANDY
                        (sheepish, busted)
                    Maybe once in a while.
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI
                    Well, it has to be never.
          
          Randy gives him a reluctant nod.
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D)
                    As for exercise, it's still okay,
                    as long as it's moderate.
          
                              RANDY
                    So, like, wrestling...
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI
                    Not a good idea.
          
                              RANDY
                    What if I do it moderate? I could
                    hold back on certain moves. There's
                    always ways to fake----
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI
                    Mr. Ramovic...
          
                              RANDY
                        (edgy glare)
                    Randy.
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI
                    Randy, a man with your heart should
                    not be flying around a ring
                    crashing into people.
          
          Randy's nostrils flare.
          
                              RANDY
                    With all due respect, Dr...
                        (reads name tag,
                         MISPRONOUNCING)
                    ...Trachanani, I'd like a second
                    opinion on that.
          
                                                                     36.
          
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI
                    Of course. But I promise you, any
                    doctor I showed your file would say
                    the same thing.
          
          Randy lets out a skeptical, sarcastic snort.
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D)
                    You almost died. The next time, you
                    won't be so lucky.
          
                              RANDY
                    I want a second opinion.
          
                              DR. TARACHANDANI
                    Your heart's been through a lot.
                    Even before the heart attack, it
                    was significantly----
          
                               RANDY
                    I want a second opinion.
                        (BEAT)
                    I WANT A SECOND OPINION.
          
          
          INT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - ADMISSIONS DESK - MORNING
          
          Randy is checking out of the hospital.
          
                              ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN
                    This is your copy.
          
          The ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN hands him some paperwork. He folds
          it up and stuffs it in a pocket.
          
                              ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    This was left for you.
          
          She hands him a plain white ENVELOPE. Randy opens it. Inside
          is a NOTE:
          
          YOU EARNED IT DUDE... YOUR A WARRIOR!
          REST UP, FEEL BETTER.
          ----JERRY DIFUSCO
          PS... IF YOUR UP BY THE 23RD, I GOT SOMETHING IN YONKERS
          
          Randy looks into the envelope again and pulls out $300.
          
          He looks at the money, chuckling ironically. It's his biggest
          payday in years. He tucks it in a pocket.
          
                              ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    You have somebody picking you up?
          
                                                                     37.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah.
          
          
          EXT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy steps out of the hospital into the bright light of day.
          He squints, his eyes adjusting. He stands there looking
          around, a lost animal.
          
          
          EXT. NORTH BABYLON COMMUNITY CENTER - PARKING LOT - SHORT
          TIME LATER
          
          A CAB pulls up to Randy's van, still parked in the community
          center's lot. Randy steps out of the cab and limps to the
          van. He gets in.
          
          
          INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy sits in the van in the otherwise empty lot, pondering
          his next move.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. CVS PHARMACY - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy roams an aisle, killing time, idly browsing the
          selection of deodorants.
          
                              WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Robin Ramovic?
          
          Randy looks up. He heads down the aisle, toward the voice. He
          comes to the...
          
          
          PHARMACY COUNTER:
          
          A female PHARMACIST stands holding a small pharmacy bag.
          
                              PHARMACIST
                    Robin Ramovic?
          
          Randy heads toward her.
          
                              PHARMACIST (CONT'D)
                    Is that you?
          
          He gives her a small, embarrassed nod, taking the bag.
          
                                                                    38.
          
          
          INT. PARADISE OAKS - MANAGER'S OFFICE - LATER
          
          Randy hands Len the manager a bunch of cash. Len notices he
          seems a little off.
          
                              LEN THE MANAGER
                    You alright?
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah.
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Len removes the padlock from Randy's trailer door.
          
                              LEN THE MANAGER
                    Welcome home.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - KITCHENETTE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          A messy, junk-filled trailer. Randy stands at the kitchen
          counter with the CVS bag.
          
          He opens the bag and takes out FOUR PRESCRIPTION PILL
          BOTTLES. We catch a glimpse of the drug names on them:
          PLAVIX. COREG. LIPITOR, LISINOPRIL.
          
          He gazes at the patient name on all of them...
          
          RAMOVIC, ROBIN
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Randy is taking a shower. On his chest is a SURGERY BANDAGE.
          He soaps up, careful not to get the bandage wet.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATER
          
          Randy collapses on the bed, exhausted.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - DAY
          
          Randy lies on the bed, gazing off. Restless. Bored. Something
          catches his eye.
          
                                                                    39.
          
          
          RANDY'S POV: On the floor, in front of the TV, is an old
          NINTENDO VIDEOGAME SYSTEM. The game cartridge in the console
          is WRESTLEJAM `88.
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy sticks his head out of his trailer.
          
          RANDY'S POV: In front of the opposite trailer, ADAM (8), one
          of the kids he was play-wrestling with, is idly throwing a
          tennis ball against a car.
          
                                RANDY
                    Yo, Adam!
          
          Adam turns and looks toward Randy.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Wanna play Nintendo?
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy and Adam sit on the floor playing WrestleJam `88.
          
          
          ON TV:
          
          Cyber-Randy is wrestling The Ayatollah at a packed Madison
          Square Garden. The graphics are late-'80s crude.
          
          Randy flies all over the ring, devastating his foe with a
          series of acrobatic leaps and kicks and flips.
          
          
          RANDY AND ADAM:
          
          Randy wears a look of intense concentration. Adam makes a
          scrunched-up face at the screen.
          
                              ADAM
                    What's that square?
          
                              RANDY
                    What square?
          
                              ADAM
                    That you're hitting me with.
          
                              RANDY
                    It's a folding chair.
          
                                                                  40.
          
          
                              ADAM
                    That's a chair?
          
                              RANDY
                        (PISSY)
                    Yes, it's a chair.
          
          Randy grunts, annoyed. They play for a stretch in silence.
          
                              ADAM
                    This is old.
          
                              RANDY
                    1988 ain't old.
          
                              ADAM
                    That was, like, 50 years before I
                    was born.
          
                              RANDY
                    Shut up and fight.
          
                              ADAM'S MOM (O.S.)
                        (outside trailer)
                    Ad-aam!
          
          Adam looks toward the window. Randy hits PAUSE.
          
                              ADAM
                    Coming!
          
          Adam turns back to the TV.
          
                              RANDY
                    Ready?
          
          Adam nods yeah. Randy un-pauses. Play resumes.
          
          
          ON TV:
          
          Cyber-Randy drops The Ayatollah with a knee to the chest. And
          another. The Ayatollah GOES DOWN. Randy heads to a corner and
          CLIMBS TO THE TOP ROPE.
          
          He raises his arms, sticking his elbows out, pressing his
          fists to the sides of his head to form a SET OF RAM'S HORNS.
          
          Randy JUMPS. He flies high in the air, soaring over the mat
          and crashing down on The Ayatollah horns-first. He pins The
          Ayatollah as the ref counts to three for the victory. The
          crowd goes wild.
          
                                                                     41.
          
          
          RANDY AND ADAM:
          
          Randy does a little celebratory fist pump. He hits RESET.
          
                                 RANDY
                    One more?
          
                              ADAM
                    I gotta go.
          
                               RANDY
                    Don't you wanna get even? I whipped
                    your butt.
          
                              ADAM
                    That's okay.
          
          Adam gets up and scampers out of the trailer.
          
          Randy, suddenly alone, looks at the TV. He gazes at the words
          on the screen:
          
                      1 PLAYER        2 PLAYER
          
          He selects 1 PLAYER.
          
          A new match begins. Randy plays without much enthusiasm.
          After a few halfhearted kicks and punches, he TOSSES THE
          CONTROLLER ASIDE.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy, standing in the middle of the trailer, does a JUMPING
          JACK. He does another. A few more.
          
          He feels himself getting winded. A little woozy. He sits
          down. He sits still, trying to slow his heart.
          
          He starts to CRY.
          
          Angry, bitter, frightened tears roll down his cheeks.
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT
          
          Randy enters the club. It's crowded tonight. He looks around
          for Cassidy. He spots her in a corner offering a CUSTOMER a
          lapdance. The customer passes. She moves on.
          
          Randy heads over. She gives him a friendly little cheek peck.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Hey, sweetie. You're back soon.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Ah, I was just in the neighborhood.
          
          Cassidy nods oh.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                        ("CASUAL")
                    Hey, feel like maybe grabbing a
                    burger?
          
          Cassidy finds the offer a little odd. This isn't how they
          operate.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I'm working.
          
                              RANDY
                    How `bout later, then?
          
          She looks at him, puzzled. He seems off.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    You okay?
          
                              RANDY
                    Can we talk for a sec?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Sure. What's up?
          
                              RANDY
                    Someplace more quiet.
          
          Randy glances toward the door. Cassidy, catching his drift,
          looks at him, a little gravely.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Randy, I can't leave with a
                    customer.
          
          Pause.
          
                              RANDY
                    I had a heart attack.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Shit. When?
          
                              RANDY
                    I needed to talk to somebody.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You can't talk here?
          
                                                                   43.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Just a couple minutes.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Randy, I don't do that.
          
                                 RANDY
                    Please.
          
          Cassidy looks at him, torn. She sees the need, the fear in
          his eyes.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Where are you parked?
          
                                 RANDY
                    In back.
          
          Another pause of hesitation from Cassidy. This is big.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Go to your car. I'll meet you out
                    there in 15 minutes.
          
          
          EXT. CHEETAH'S - REAR PARKING LOT - 15 MINUTES LATER
          
          Randy sits in the van, staring at the club's rear EMERGENCY
          EXIT. Cassidy emerges, a jacket covering her dress. Randy
          waves. Spotting him, she comes over, climbing in the
          passenger side.
          
                              RANDY
                    Thanks. I appreciate it.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    That's okay.
          
          She looks at his vulnerable expression.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry. That's fucked up, dude.
          
          Randy nods.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    When was it?
          
                                 RANDY
                    Last week.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    You okay?
          
                                                                  44.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah, yeah. Feelin' much better.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Good, good. What happened?
          
                              RANDY
                    It was while I was wrestling. I
                    collapsed in the ring.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Oh, man. That's terrible.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah, it was pretty fucked up.
          
          He chuckles, a little perversely.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Tell ya, though, it was a big hit
                    with the fans.
                        (amused grin)
                    Promoter told me everybody was
                    hanging around wondering if I was
                    okay, they wound up buying up all
                    of his T-shirts and shit. Whole
                    merch table got cleaned out.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    That's funny.
          
          Randy's grin fades. His expression turns melancholy, fearful.
          
                              RANDY
                    Doctor says I can't wrestle no
                    more.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Damn. What are you gonna do?
          
                              RANDY
                    I don't know. I don't know what to
                    do. If I can't wrestle...
          
          He loses himself in some bleak thought.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    It just happened. You don't have to
                    figure everything out this second.
                    Give yourself some time.
          
                               RANDY
                    Time's all I got. I just sit there
                    all day...
          
                                                                  45.
          
          
          He stares off bleakly again.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You really shouldn't be alone right
                    now.
          
          He turns to her, looking her in the eye.
          
                              RANDY
                    That's why I came to see you.
          
                              CASSIDY
                        (a little unnerved)
                    Randy...
          
          She looks at him with sympathy.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    I feel bad what happened. But you
                    and me... I can't go there.
          
          Randy gives her a sour, disappointed look.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    You should be with family now. You
                    have a daughter, right? Where is
                    she?
          
                              RANDY
                    We don't really get along too good.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    It doesn't matter. You need her.
          
                              RANDY
                        (bitter chuckle)
                    She don't need me.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Everybody needs a father. Trust me.
          
          Randy shrugs, not so sure. Cassidy glances at the dashboard
          clock.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry. I gotta get back in.
          
          She puts a sympathetic hand on his knee.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    You take care of yourself.
          
          She gives him a peck on the cheek. He lingers there for a
          second. A weird, tentative moment.
          
                                                                  46.
          
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    You gonna be okay?
          
          He nods, putting his brave face back on.
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm Randy The Ram. I've taken
                    bigger bumps than this.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    I'm sure.
          
                              RANDY
                    Maybe I'll give my daughter a call.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You should.
          
                              RANDY
                    Why the fuck not? I'm her father. A
                    person only gets one father in this
                    life.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Exactly.
          
                              RANDY
                    Unless you're adopted.
          
          Cassidy laughs. She gives him a friendly pat on the shoulder.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You're gonna be just fine.
          
                              RANDY
                    Definitely.
          
          Cassidy climbs out of the van. Randy watches as she heads
          back into the club.
          
          His cheery expression fades. He is alone again.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - DAY
          
          Randy sits on his bed, sifting through a messy, junk-filled
          shoebox. He pulls out an OLD PHOTO.
          
          RANDY'S POV: It's a mid-'80s photo of Randy and his infant
          daughter Stephanie in front of the family Christmas tree.
          Randy, wearing a Santa cap, is smiling and laughing,
          Stephanie perched on his huge, steroid-pumped bicep.
          
                                                                  47.
          
          
          He flips the photo over. On the back are a bunch of scribbled
          PHONE NUMBERS. They're all crossed-out except the last one.
          The numbers get progressively more faded from bottom to top,
          as if they've been written down over the course of years.
          
          
          EXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy stands at a PAY PHONE with the photo, ringing phone
          cradled to his ear.
          
                              STEPHANIE'S VOICE
                    This is Stephanie, you know what to
                    do.
                        (answering machine BEEP)
          
          Randy listens to the silence. He hangs up.
          
          
          INT. VAN - LATER
          
          Randy sits in his van by the curb of a modest, lower-middle-
          class house. He looks at the house, working up the nerve to
          approach.
          
          
          EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - LATER
          
          Randy stands at the doorstep of the house. Steeling himself,
          he rings the bell. A WOMAN (22) appears at the door in a T-
          SHIRT and PANTIES.
          
                              RANDY
                        (a little thrown)
                    Hey... Is Stephanie home?
          
          The woman looks at Randy a little coldly, sensing who he is.
          
                              THE WOMAN
                    Who can I say it is?
          
                              RANDY
                    Her father.
          
          She disappears into the house.
          
          A few moments later, Stephanie emerges with a BACKPACK slung
          over her shoulder. In her hands is a TEXTBOOK. She heads
          straight down the driveway, blowing past Randy.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Where you going?
          
          He goes after her.
          
                                                                  48.
          
          
                                    RANDY (CONT'D)
                       Stephanie!
          
          He catches up. She stops.
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                       What do you want?
          
                                 RANDY
                       Can we talk?
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                       Now's really not a good time.
          
          She resumes walking, briskly.
          
                                 RANDY
                       Wait!
                           (chasing after her)
                       Where ya going?
          
          He looks at the textbook in her hands: PRINCIPLES OF CHILD
          DEVELOPMENT.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                       You in school? That's great.
          
          She turns DOWN THE SIDEWALK. He continues following.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                       What school?
          
          No answer.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                       What school?
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                       Middlesex County Community.
          
                                 RANDY
                       Middlesex? That's kind of a hike.
                       Where's your car?
                           (no response)
                       You taking the bus? Lemme give you
                       a lift.
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                       That's okay.
          
                                  RANDY
                       It's no problem.
                           (BEAT)
                       Really. I'm parked right by.
          
                                                                  49.
          
          
          Stephanie picks up the pace, trying to lose him.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    You're walking pretty fast there.
                    You running late?
                        (no answer)
                    I could help you with that.
                        (no answer)
                    Give you a ride.
          
          She keeps right on walking.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    New Jersey Transit sucks!
          
          And walking.
          
                              RANDY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    The buses smell like piss!
          
          She fights off an amused smile. She slows a tiny bit.
          
          
          INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy is driving Stephanie.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Left at the second stop sign.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yes, ma'am!
          
          Randy drives. He slows at the second stop sign, which is at a
          bigger, FOUR-LANE STREET. He makes the left. They drive for a
          stretch in awkward silence. Randy seems a little nervous.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    You gonna talk?
          
          A pause as Randy gathers his words.
          
                              RANDY
                    There's something I wanted to tell
                    you.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Okay...
          
                               RANDY
                    I had a heart attack.
                        (BEAT)
                    Last week.
          
                                                                    50.
          
          
          He looks at her earnestly.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    I wanna try to fix things.
          
          Stephanie sits there in calm silence, processing all of this.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    You are such an asshole.
          
                                 RANDY
                           (taken aback)
                    Why?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Now you wanna fix things. Now that
                    suddenly you're all scared and
                    alone from your heart attack.
          
                              RANDY
                    What? No. It's not like----
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    This is so fuckin' you. You only
                    come around when you need something
                    from somebody, when they can do
                    something for you. Selfish fuck.
                    Good. Be alone.
          
          She suddenly OPENS HER DOOR as the van is moving. She HOPS
          OUT. Randy hits the brakes, alarmed.
          
                              RANDY
                    What are you doing?
          
          Stephanie stumbles and falls. She gets up. Walks off in the
          direction they came from.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Stephanie!
          
          She's gone. He angrily punches the steering wheel.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Randy lies on his bed, gazing off depressedly. On his chest
          is a well-worn DAY PLANNER, open to a marked-up page.
          
          ANGLE ON page. Scribbled in marker in one of the boxes is
          RAHWAY AUTOGRAF SHOW.
          
                                                                  51.
          
          
          INT. RAHWAY RECREATION CENTER - GYMNASIUM - MORNING
          
          Randy, standing at a folding table in a gym, unzips a duffel
          bag. He pulls out a stack of 8x10 GLOSSIES of himself. It's a
          high-flying, mid-air Ram Jam photo from the height of his
          '80s glory.
          
          He puts them on the table. Looks around the gym.
          
          RANDY'S POV: He's at an AUTOGRAPH SHOW that hasn't started
          yet. Around the perimeter of the gym, TEN FOLDING TABLES are
          set up. At each one, a BEAT-UP, WORN-OUT OLD WRESTLER is
          laying out his wares----8x10s, old match tapes, etc.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG (O.S.)
                    Didn't think I'd see you here.
          
          Randy looks up and sees Scott Brumberg, the promoter from the
          beginning. He's wearing the same "BRUMBERG - 44" Mets jersey.
          
                                RANDY
                    Why not?
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    Heard you collapsed at the DiFusco
                    show. Sounded pretty scary.
          
          Randy smiles coyly.
          
                                SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
                              RANDY
                    Sold the shit outta that one.
          
                                SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    No way!
          
                              RANDY
                    I gotta give credit. DiFusco came
                    up with the idea. We're setting up
                    an angle for a grudge match.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    Wow... Dude, you are good.
          
          Randy gives a proud "Hey, what can I say?" shrug.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
                    I was sure I'd have to cancel the
                    minivan.
          
                              RANDY
                    What minivan?
          
                                                                  52.
          
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    The one I rented for Fanfest.
          
          Randy looks at him, surprised.
          
                               SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
                    Me and a whole gang's driving down.
                    Terry C., Caggiano, Fatback... I am
                    so fuckin' psyched.
                        (BEAT)
                    You see the flyer?
          
          Randy looks at him blankly. Brumberg walks over to a nearby
          table, where there's a stack of BRIGHT-ORANGE FLYERS. (The
          same flyer can be seen scattered around the room on chairs,
          the floor, etc.) He grabs one and brings it back over.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
                    Volpe gave me an assload to pass
                    out.
          
          He hands it to Brumberg.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
                    That is gonna be epic.
          
          RANDY'S POV: The flyer.

          RANDY:
          
          Randy nods vaguely at the flyer, his feelings hard to read.
          
                              RANDY
                    Looks great.
          
                                                                  53.
          
          
          Brumberg looks around the room as the wrestlers set up shop.
          
                                SCOTT BRUMBERG
                      Should get a pretty good crowd
                      today.
          
          Randy holds up his hand, wiggling his fingers for Brumberg.
          
                                RANDY
                      I'll start loosening up.
          
          Brumberg walks off. Randy looks at the flyer again. A sour
          expression comes over his face.
          
          
          INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          The signing is underway. FIVE OR SO FANS mill about the room,
          drifting from table to table getting autographs and taking
          photos with the motley assortment of washed-up aging
          wrestlers.
          
          
          ON RANDY:
          
          Randy is sitting behind his table, signing one of his 8x10s
          for a FAN. He hands it to the guy, who hands Randy a $5 bill.
          
                                FAN
                      Thanks.
          
                                RANDY
                      You got it, broski.
          
          The fan walks off. Randy tucks the fiver into the FANNY PACK
          he's wearing. There's not much in there, just a meager few
          ones and fives.
          
          Randy zips up the fanny pack. He looks up, ready to sign more
          autographs----just as soon as somebody comes over.
          
          
          INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy sits at his table, bored. There are NO TAKERS. He looks
          around the room at the other wrestlers.
          
          RANDY'S POV: One is asleep. Another looks borderline
          homeless. Across from him is a 40-SOMETHING WRESTLER in a
          WHEELCHAIR. Attached to his calf is a URINE BAG. A feeble
          stream of urine trickles into the bag.
          
                                                                     54.
          
          
          Randy looks down at the stack of Randy The Ram 8x10s on the
          table. He gazes numbly at the high-flying image of himself
          from 20 years earlier.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG (O.S.)
                    Sorry, man.
          
          Randy looks up and sees Brumberg.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D)
                    I was sure the turnout'd be bigger.
          
          Randy shrugs resignedly.
          
          
          INT. VAN - LATER
          
          Randy pulls up to his trailer. He sits there with the engine
          idling, staring at his trailer, scared to go in alone. He
          pulls back out again.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          MUSIC - LIL' KIM - "HOW MANY LICKS?"
          
          Cassidy, roaming the room, approaches a CUSTOMER sitting near
          the stafe. She leans in to his ear, her hand on his arm.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Would you like a lapdance, sweetie?
          
                              CUSTOMER
                    That's okay.
          
          Cassidy moves along. She approaches a PAIR OF GUYS. She leans
          in to one of them.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Would you like a lapdance?
          
                              GUY #1
                    Not right now.
          
          She looks toward the other guy. Before she can even ask:
          
                                GUY #2
                    I'm good.
          
          Cassidy heads off, rejected.
          
                                                                   55.
          
          
                                RANDY (O.S.)
                    Hey.
          
          She turns and sees Randy. She's happy to see him after the
          string of no's.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Hey. How ya feeling?
          
                              RANDY
                    Better. Good.
          
          She leads him over to a table. They sit.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    How'd it go with your daughter?
          
                              RANDY
                        (UNCONVINCING)
                    Good. Fine.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Yeah?
          
          Randy dodges her eye contact.
          
                                CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    You sure?
          
          Pause.
          
                              RANDY
                    Not too good, actually. She tore me
                    a new asshole.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Shit. That sucks.
          
          He nods dispiritedly.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    It's tough. You can't give up. You
                    gotta keep trying.
          
          Another half-hearted nod. A brief conversational lull.
          
                              RANDY
                    I was thinking about maybe getting
                    her a present.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    That's a great idea!
                        (BEAT)
                    What's she into?
          
                                                               56.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm not sure.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    How old is she?
          
                                 RANDY
                    22, 23?
                        (BEAT)
                    22.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    What kind of music does she like?
          
                              RANDY
                    I don't know.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Is she into books? Cooking?
          
          Randy just looks at her blankly.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    How could you not know? She's your
                    daughter.
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm a shitty fuckin' father.
          
          Cassidy, feeling bad, is hit with an urge to help.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    She's 22? Okay...
                        (RIFFING)
                    You should get her some clothes,
                    some kinda clothes... All girls
                    like that.
          
                              RANDY
                    That could work.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    I know the perfect place. This kick-
                    ass little vintage shop in
                    Westfield.
          
                                 RANDY
                    Yeah?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Saturday's the best time to go.
                    That's when they get the new stuff
                    in, all these boxes full of great
                    shit.
          
                                                                   57.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Okay. Cool.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I'll write it down.
          
          Cassidy grabs a pen and a cocktail napkin off the bar.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    I'm pretty sure it's on 28.
          
          She scribbles down YESTERDAZE - WESTFIELD. Hands it to him.
          
                              RANDY
                    Good tip. Thanks.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You got it.
          
          Cassidy starts dancing for him, as is their routine. Randy
          doesn't seem into it.
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm gonna grab a drink at the bar.
          
          Randy gets up and heads off toward the bar. She watches him
          go, feeling rejected.
          
          Cassidy gets up. CAMERA stays on her face as she does a lap
          around the club. She glances back toward the bar.
          
          CASSIDY'S POV: Randy is sitting at bar.
          
          She scans the room. A CUSTOMER is looking her way. She starts
          to approach. Then, she STOPS. She looks back toward Randy
          again. He's sitting at the bar alone. She heads over to him.
          
          He looks up from his drink.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    That was fast.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Listen...
          
          Cassidy pauses, hesitant. She takes the plunge:
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    How `bout I meet you there
                    Saturday? Help you out.
          
                                RANDY
                    Yeah?
          
                                                                  58.
          
          
                              CASSIDY
                        ("CASUAL")
                    I'm actually gonna be running
                    around right in that area anyway,
                    so it's not really a pain.
          
                              RANDY
                    All right. Thanks.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    No problem. You got it.
          
          She gives him a chummy arm tap and walks off.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. SHOP-RITE - MORNING
          
          Randy knocks on Wayne's door.
          
                              WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Yeah?
          
          
          INT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Wayne looks up at Randy, mildly annoyed by the disruption. On
          his computer screen is an ONLINE POKER game.
          
                              RANDY
                    Hey, Wayne. Got a sec?
          
                              WAYNE
                    Not really. What?
          
                              RANDY
                    I was wondering if you had
                    something more steady. Full-time.
          
                              WAYNE
                    Only thing I got right now's got
                    weekends.
          
                              RANDY
                    That works.
          
                              WAYNE
                    Isn't that when you sit on other
                    dudes' faces?
          
                              RANDY
                    What is it?
          
                                                                    59.
          
          
                              WAYNE
                    Deli counter.
          
          Randy seems a little hesitant.
          
                              RANDY
                    So, like, working with customers?
          
                               WAYNE
                    All day long, hot horny housewives
                    begging for your meat.
                        (BEAT)
                    And prepared salads.
          
          Randy thinks it over.
          
                              RANDY
                    That's the only thing you got?
          
                              WAYNE
                    At the moment. You interested?
          
          
          EXT. SUNRISE SHOPPING PLAZA - PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          Randy stands alone in front of YESTERDAZE, a strip-mall
          vintage clothing store. He looks at his watch, almost
          thinking of leaving.
          
                               CASSIDY (O.S.)
                    Hey.
          
          Randy looks up. He seems slightly thrown by what he sees.
          
                               RANDY
                    Hey.
          
          RANDY'S POV: It's his first time seeing Cassidy in street
          clothes and in daylight. She's not wearing makeup, and her
          hair is pulled back in a ponytail. She's also a good three
          inches shorter out of her stripper heels.
          
          They shake hands, a bit awkwardly.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    I almost didn't recognize you. You
                    look all... clean.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    "Clean"?
          
                              RANDY
                    Like classy.
          
                                                                  60.
          
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Gee, thanks.
          
                               RANDY
                    Nah, nah, I don't mean that bad. I
                    like it.
                        (BEAT)
                    It's like in "Grease", where she
                    turns into the hot rock `n' roll
                    chick at the end. Except backwards.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Oh-kaay...
          
          Randy looks at her sneakers, a far cry from the clear heels
          he's used to.
          
                              RANDY
                    So, uh... Should I call you Cassidy
                    or Pam?
          
          She gives the question genuine thought.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Pam.
                        (playful finger wag)
                    But don't get used to it.
          
          
          INT. YESTERDAZE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy follows Cassidy toward the back of the store. He looks
          around, taking in the array of funky `50s/'60s/'70s clothes.
          
                              RANDY
                    This is awesome...
                        (rubs hands together,
                         PSYCHED)
                    We are gonna find something great!
          
          Cassidy is less loose and playful than Randy, much more in
          business mode. They come to the back where, against the wall,
          she finds what she's looking for: a bunch of CARDBOARD BOXES
          bursting with a wildly eclectic assortment of tops, skirts,
          pants, etc. She starts sifting through.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Do you know her size?
          
                              RANDY
                    She's kinda skinny, a little
                    shorter than you.
          
                                                                  61.
          
          
          Cassidy spots a fun, multi-color MINI-SKIRT. She pulls it
          out.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Could you see her in this?
          
                               RANDY
                    Maybe.
                        (BEAT)
                    Not really.
                        (BEAT)
                    I'm not sure.
          
          Cassidy tosses it back in. She unearths a Flashdance-style
          SWEATSHIRT.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    What about this?
          
          Randy makes a sour face. She tosses it back.
          
                               CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    So like, what is she? Goth? Punk?
                    Hippie?
                        (BEAT)
                    Preppy? Stoner?
          
          Randy ponders the choices.
          
                              RANDY
                    Not really...
          
          Cassidy lets out a good-natured groan of frustration. Randy
          watches as she continues searching.
          
                                RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Hey, Pam?
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Yeah?
          
                              RANDY
                    Thank you very much.
          
          Cassidy looks at him. She can feel his sincere appreciation.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You're welcome.
          
          She returns to searching. Sift, sift, sift, sift...
          
                              RANDY
                    I think she might be a lesbian.
          
                                                                     62.
          
          
          Cassidy stops sifting. She looks up at him.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Does that help?
          
          Cassidy leads Randy by the arm over to the...
          
          
          MEN'S AREA:
          
          Cassidy heads to a RACK OF CLOTHES. She quickly zeroes in on
          a RETRO BOWLING SHIRT. She holds it up to Randy, who makes a
          scrunched-up face.
          
                              RANDY
                    Ah, maybe she's just a friend.
          
          Cassidy puts the bowling shirt back. As she does, something
          catches Randy's eye.
          
                               RANDY (CONT'D)
                    What's that?
                        (POINTING)
                    The green.
          
          Cassidy holds up the item for Randy.
          
                              CASSIDY
                        (SURPRISED)
                    This?
          
          An excited look comes over Randy's face.
          
                              RANDY
                    It's perfect.
          
          RANDY'S POV: A satin-green ROLLER-DISCO JACKET. Embroidered
          on the left breast is a big "S" in purple script. It's UGLY.
          
          Cassidy looks at the jacket. She clearly finds it awful.
          
          She looks at Randy, who's beaming with excitement and pride.
          She finds it very endearing.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    I agree.
          
          
          EXT. SUNRISE SHOPPING PLAZA - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Yesterdaze bag in hand, Randy opens the door to his van. He
          and tosses the bag inside. He's on a post-shop high, mission
          accomplished.
          
                                                                  63.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Thanks again.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You found it.
          
                              RANDY
                    I never woulda known about this
                    place.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Okay, I'll give you that.
          
          A tentative pause. Cassidy looks at him, ready to part ways.
          
                                 CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Look, I...
          
                              RANDY
                    Man, I worked up a pretty good
                    thirst in there. What say we grab a
                    beer?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I gotta get going.
          
                              RANDY
                    One beer! We gotta re-hydrate!
          
          Cassidy seems torn.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    I really can't.
                        (BEAT)
                    I got a kid at home.
          
                              RANDY
                    You have a kid?
          
          Cassidy nods. Yup.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    I had no idea.
          
          Cassidy shrugs casually.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Boy or girl?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Boy. Daniel.
          
                                 RANDY
                    How old?
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Nine.
          
                              RANDY
                    Wow... I had no friggin' idea.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    It's not something I usually tell
                    customers. Not exactly a turn-on.
          
          Randy looks off at something by his van. An idea hits him.
          
                                RANDY
                    Wait.
          
          He unlocks the door. Leaning into the van, he TEARS THE RANDY
          THE RAM ACTION FIGURE OFF THE DASHBOARD. He proudly,
          excitedly holds it out to Cassidy.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Now both our kids got something.
          
          She looks at the action figure, reluctant to take it.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    You're gonna turn this down, too?
                    Man, you're rough!
          
          Cassidy chuckles a little. She takes it.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    That's very nice of you. Thank you.
          
                              RANDY
                    Tell him to take good care of that.
                    $300 bucks on eBay.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Really?
          
                                RANDY
                    Nah.
          
          Cassidy laughs a little. She can't help but be charmed by his
          sweetness and earnestness. After a pause...
          
                                CASSIDY
                    One beer.
          
                                                                  65.
          
          
          INT. LOCAL BAR - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy and Cassidy are having beers at the bar. He's holding
          her CELLPHONE, looking at PICTURES of her son. He moves on to
          the next one.
          
                              RANDY
                    He's a good-lookin' kid.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I think so.
          
                              RANDY
                    I see where he gets it from.
          
          Cassidy smiles, flattered.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    He sure doesn't get it from his
                    douchebag father.
          
          Randy skips to the next pic. It's a shot of an UNDER-
          CONSTRUCTION CONDO BUILDING.
          
                              RANDY
                    What's that?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Just this condo thing, down by
                    Trenton.
          
                              RANDY
                    You moving there?
          
                               CASSIDY
                    Working on it.
                        (BEAT)
                    It's a great area. Way cheaper. And
                    the schools are awesome.
          
                              RANDY
                    What about Cheetah's?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I'm done. I'm quitting.
          
                                RANDY
                          (a little disappointed)
                    Oh.
                        (nods to self)
                    Okay...
          
          MUSIC: DEF LEPPARD - "POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME"
          
                                                                  66.
          
          
          Randy's ears perk up at the song on the jukebox.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Hell, yeah.
          
          He stands up, reaching out for Cassidy's hand. She doesn't
          give it.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    C'mon. Let's dance.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Where?
          
                              RANDY
                    Right here.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    This isn't a dance place.
          
                              RANDY
                    Who cares? Fuckin' Def Lep!
          
                              CASSIDY
                        (CHUCKLES)
                    I've danced to this plenty.
          
                              RANDY
                    Fine. Then I'm dancing for you.
          
          Randy starts DANCING in front of Cassidy, who's sitting on a
          barstool. She smiles.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Is this a lapdance I'm getting?
          
          Randy goes into lapdance mode, "seductively" writhing for
          her, silly and self-aware.
          
                              RANDY
                    Just sit back and enjoy.
          
          He turns around, wiggling his ass a little for her. He runs
          his hands up and down her sides. He drapes his long blond
          mane over her shoulders, running it over her face. She
          laughs, charmed and amused.
          
          He gazes into her eyes intensely.
          
                               RANDY (CONT'D)
                    The lapdancer has become the
                    lapdanced.
          
          Cassidy laughs. He continues dancing, totally unembarrassed.
          
                                                                     67.
          
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I think we can get you a shift.
          
          Randy bobs his head along to the kick-ass Def Leppard tune,
          really loving it.
          
          The song builds to its chorus. Randy SINGS ALONG.
          
                              RANDY
                    Take a bottle, shake it up/ Break
                    the bubble, break it u-up...
                        (CHORUS)
                    Pour some sugar on me! In the name
                    of love!
          
          Cassidy, unable to resist the call of the Lep, joins in.
          
                              CASSIDY AND RANDY
                    Pour some sugar on me! C'mon fire
                    me up!
                        (pointing at each other)
                    Pour your sugar on me! I can't get
                    enough...
                        (eye contact, sultry)
                    I'm hot, sticky sweet/ From my head
                    to my feet yeah...
          
          From here, the song veers off into a GUITAR PART. Randy nods
          along, savoring the awesome hair-metal riffing.
          
                              RANDY
                    They don't make `em like they used
                    to.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Fuckin' eighties, man. Best shit
                    ever.
          
                              RANDY
                    Def Lep, Gunners...
          
                              CASSIDY
                    The Crüe...
          
                              RANDY
                    Then that Cobain pussy had to come
                    around and ruin it all.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Like there's something wrong with
                    having a good time.
          
                                                                     68.
          
          
                               RANDY
                    Fuckin' mopey douchebag.
                        (BEAT)
                    "Ooh, look at me! I wear flannel!
                    I'm all depressed!"
          
                              CASSIDY
                    "I'm from Seattle! I like rain!"
          
          Randy shakes his head sourly.
          
                              RANDY
                    Nineties fuckin' sucked.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    No shit...
          
          Their EYES MEET. A moment of CHEMISTRY. Mutual attraction.
          
          Randy moves closer, his eyes locked on hers. He leans in
          for... a KISS.
          
          They MAKE OUT for a few seconds. Cassidy PULLS BACK.
          
          She gives Randy a playfully scolding FINGER WAG, masking her
          fear and discomfort with what just happened.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    No contact with the customers.
          
                              RANDY
                    You're right. My bad.
          
          He keeps right on dancing, totally unaware of the shift that
          just occurred in her.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Shit.
          
                                 RANDY
                    What's up?
          
                              CASSIDY
                        (glancing at watch)
                    I totally didn't realize the time.
          
                              RANDY
                    We just got here.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I should get home.
          
          She stands up. Randy is very disappointed.
          
                                                                     69.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    C'mon. You said one beer!
          
          Randy points toward her ALMOST-FULL BEER on the bar. She
          picks it up and CHUGS the whole thing. She slaps the empty
          bottle on the bar.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Good night.
          
          She gives him an arm pat and walks out of the bar. Randy is
          impressed.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. SHOP-RITE - EMPLOYEE ROOM - MORNING
          
          It's Randy's first day of work. He slips into a DELI COAT.
          Tucks his hair into a hairnet. Pulls a Shop-Rite baseball cap
          over the hairnet.
          
          He walks over to a mirror to see how he looks in his new
          uniform. He feels a little silly.
          
                              WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Here ya go.
          
          He turns and sees Wayne, who hands him something. Randy looks
          at the item in his hand, vaguely bothered.
          
                              RANDY
                    I thought it was gonna say Randy.
          
          ANGLE ON item, a Shop-Rite NAME TAG. The name on it is ROBIN.
          
                              WAYNE
                    Guess they got it off your W-4.
          
                              RANDY
                    Do I really even need to wear one?
          
                              WAYNE
                        (SARCASTIC)
                    Are you gonna be interacting with
                    our valued Shop-Rite customers?
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah, but I----
          
                                WAYNE
                    Then yes.
          
                                                                     70.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Could they maybe re-do it?
          
                              WAYNE
                    Just wear the fucking thing.
          
          Wayne walks off. Randy pins the name tag to his apron. He
          takes another look in the mirror, sighing unhappily.
          
          Randy looks up at the employee-room clock. It's 8:59 AM.
          
          He heads toward a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN leading to the deli
          counter. Standing before the curtain, he pauses a moment,
          gathering himself like before a wrestling match.
          
          He steps through. Showtime.
          
          
          INT. DELI COUNTER - DAY
          
          About 10 CUSTOMERS hover in front of the deli counter with
          Take-A-Number tickets.
          
          Randy, manning the counter, hands an OLD GUY in a WWII
          VETERAN baseball cap a packet of roast beef. The guy shuffles
          off. Randy looks up at the Take-A-Number sign.
          
                                 RANDY
                    Seventeen.
          
          A WOMAN (60s) steps forward holding a 17 and a SHOP-RITE
          CIRCULAR. She carefully surveys the TURKEY-BREAST SELECTION
          in the case.
          
                              WOMAN
                    The Hudson Acres, are they all on
                    sale or just the regular?
          
          Randy looks clueless.
          
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        (holding up circular)
                    It's a little unclear.
          
          She hands the circular to Randy to take a look.
          
          RANDY'S POV: It says HUDSON ACRES TURKEY BREAST - $5.99/LB.
          
          He still has no idea.
          
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    I'd prefer the maple-glazed, but if
                    it's full price...
          
                                                                     71.
          
          
          Randy briefly catches eyes with another customer, a BIG-
          HAIRED, SEMI-HOT PARTY CHICK in her forties. The kind of
          woman Randy would hit on in a bar. He dodges her eye contact,
          embarrassed by the context.
          
                              RANDY
                        (to circular lady)
                    Hang on, let me...
          
          Randy picks up a phone behind the counter.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                        (into phone, over
                         SPEAKERS)
                    Wayne, please come to the deli
                    counter.
          
          He cringes a bit as his voice booms over the store speakers.
          He hangs up and returns to the customer.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    It'll just be a minute.
          
          The woman, nodding, looks into the deli case again.
          
                              WOMAN
                    Which in your opinion is the best
                    smoked ham?
          
                              RANDY
                    I guess it depends what you like.
          
                               WOMAN
                    I tried the Apple Valley Farms
                    once, and it was very salty. Do you
                    find that?
          
          Randy steals a self-conscious glance at the party chick.
          
          
          INT. DELI COUNTER - LATER
          
          ANGLE ON Take-A-Number sign. It says NOW SERVING: 46.
          
                                 RANDY
                    Forty-six.
          
          A WOMAN (35) in workout clothes steps forward with a 46.
          
                              WORKOUT WOMAN
                    Could I get a half-pound of the
                    pesto pasta salad?
          
                                                                   72.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Sure.
          
          Randy grabs a plastic container.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Pesto change-o.
          
          The woman smiles at Randy's little offhand pasta pun. This
          pleases him.
          
          Randy scoops pesto pasta salad into the container. He puts
          the container onto the scale. It reads .51 LB.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Wow. I am good.
          
          This gets Randy a small chuckle from the woman. Randy slaps a
          price tag on the container.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Can I get you anything else?
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Nope. That's it.
          
          He hands her the container.
          
                              RANDY
                    You have yourself a nice day.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                        (friendly smile)
                    I will. You, too.
          
          The woman heads off. Randy's spirits are lifted by the
          exchange.
          
          
          INT. DELI COUNTER - LATER
          
          Randy looks up at the Take-A-Number sign: NOW SERVING: 57.
          
                              RANDY
                    O-57.
          
          A HOUSEWIFE-TYPE steps forward with the number.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Bingo!
          
          The housewife smiles.
          
                                                                   73.
          
          
                              HOUSEWIFE
                    What's my prize?
          
                              RANDY
                    Anything in the case, sweetheart.
          
                              HOUSEWIFE
                    A pound of chopped liver and a half
                    a pound of egg salad.
          
                              RANDY
                    I think that can be arranged...
          
          He grabs a plastic container and throws it in the air,
          catching it behind his back.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. MIDDLESEX COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE - DAY
          
          Stephanie emerges from the Middlesex County Community College
          building. A look of surprise comes over her face.
          
          STEPHANIE'S POV: Randy is standing there waiting for her by
          his van. Under his arm is a LUMPILY WRAPPED PRESENT, no box.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    What are you, stalking me?
          
                              RANDY
                    Do stalkers bring presents?
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                    Sometimes.
          
                              RANDY
                    Well, I ain't a stalker. But...
          
          He excitedly hands her the present. She looks at it warily.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Open it.
          
          She opens it. Inside is the green satin jacket. She holds it
          up, trying to process.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    The "S" is for "Stephanie".
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                    Oh. Okay.
          
          She looks at the jacket. It's nothing she would ever wear.
          
                                                          74.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    I got it just for you.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I see that. What's it for?
          
                              RANDY
                    No reason. Just because. Do you
                    like it?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I do. It's... shiny.
          
          She looks at Randy. He is excited and proud.
          
                              RANDY
                    I was looking in this store and saw
                    it, and I just said, "That is it."
          
          Stephanie nods, smiling politely.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    So what are you doing now?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    What am I doing?
          
                              RANDY
                    Got any time? I was thinking we
                    could swing by our old favorite
                    spot.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    We have an old favorite spot?
          
                              RANDY
                    You'll remember when you see.
                    Whaddaya say?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Now's not the best time. I've got
                    some things to do.
          
                              RANDY
                    What kinda things?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Stuff.
          
                               RANDY
                    You ain't got stuff!
                        (BEAT)
                    C'mon, give an old man a break.
          
                                                                     75.
          
          
          He giver her his biggest, most charming puppy-dog smile.
          
          
          EXT. POINT PLEASANT BOARDWALK - LATER
          
          Randy and Stephanie walk along the boardwalk. It's a charming
          little Jersey-shore boardwalk/beach lined with Skee-Ball
          games, ice-cream parlors, T-shirt shops etc. It's a bit cold
          and not very crowded, still out of season.
          
                              RANDY
                    You really don't remember?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    No.
          
                              RANDY
                    Guess you were pretty young.
          
          They walk for a stretch in silence. He points to a spot.
          
                               RANDY (CONT'D)
                    There used to be this funhouse.
                        (BEAT)
                    The Monster Motel...
          
          Randy chuckles at the memory.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    They had this cheesy-ass skeleton
                    that popped out of a coffin. You'd
                    get so scared, you'd cry. Then
                    you'd beg to go in again.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                        (chuckles to self)
                    Always was a glutton for
                    punishment.
          
                              RANDY
                    You'd hop on my foot and wrap your
                    arms around my leg. I'd have to
                    walk you the whole way through like
                    that.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I totally don't remember.
          
                              RANDY
                        (looks at her sweetly)
                    I do.
          
                                                                  76.
          
          
          EXT. BOARDWALK - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy and Stephanie sit on a bench facing the ocean eating
          mint-chocolate chip ice-cream cones. Randy is quiet and
          contemplative, not in his usual "on" mode. He takes a deep
          breath.
          
                              RANDY
                    I accept your apology.
          
          She shoots him an irked look.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Not like that. I just mean... You
                    made amends. I free you.
          
          Her expression softens.
          
                               RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Anything you've ever done or said
                    or thought, I forgive. You've done
                    nothing wrong to me. And anything
                    I've ever done...
                        (BEAT)
                    I'm sorry. Truly.
          
          Stephanie is surprised by his emotion and sincerity.
          
                                 STEPHANIE
                    Thank you.
          
                              RANDY
                    I was young. My career was booming.
                    All those lights, the fans, the
                    crazy shit on the road... I wasn't
                    thinking about my kid. Or my wife.
          
          Stephanie nods.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    My priorities were all fucked up. I
                    know that. But now... I wanna try
                    to make things right. I wanna try
                    to get to know you.
                        (lump in throat)
                    I just hope it's not too late.
          
          Randy gazes off at the ocean, filled with fear and love and
          regret. A tear starts to gather in his eye. He wipes it away
          before it has a chance to form.
          
          Stephanie looks at him, moved.
          
                                                                     77.
          
          
          INT. BOARDWALK ARCADE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy and Stephanie play Skee-Ball side-by-side, father and
          daughter.
          
          
          EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy stands with Stephanie in front of her house, dropping
          her off.
          
                              RANDY
                    Hope that wasn't too painful.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    It was okay.
          
                              RANDY
                    Well...
          
          Randy, unsure what to do, extends his hand.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Bye.
          
          They shake. He pulls her in for a brief, mechanical hug.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Bye.
          
          Another pause.
          
                              RANDY
                    So... How about dinner sometime?
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Dinner?
          
                              RANDY
                    Maybe Tuesday?
          
          Stephanie thinks it over.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I'm sorry. I don't think so.
          
                              RANDY
                        (nodding, "casual")
                    Or not. That's cool, whatever...
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Wednesday would work better.
          
          Randy is surprised and happy.
          
                                                                  78.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATER
          
          Randy sticks the old Christmas photo of Stephanie and himself
          on the fridge.
          
          
          EXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - DAY
          
          Randy stands at the pay phone, ringing phone to his ear. In
          his hands is his day planner, open to a page marked up with
          upcoming gigs.
          
                               RANDY
                    Yo, Miggy. Ram. How ya doin'?
                        (BEAT)
                    Good, good.
                        (BEAT)
                    Listen, you're gonna have to count
                    me out for Utica.
                        (momentous pause)
                    I'm retiring.
          
          
          EXT. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Another call.
          
                               RANDY
                    Hey, how ya doin', Frank?
                        (BEAT)
                    Good, good. Listen...
          
          
          EXT. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Another call. Randy is holding the Fanfest flyer.
          
                               RANDY
                    Sorry, Volp. You know I'd kill to
                    do it.
                        (BEAT)
                    I realize. I understand.
                        (BEAT)
                    No more. I'm done. I'm retired.
                        (BEAT)
                    Positive. It's time to move on.
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT
          
          MUSIC: WARRANT - "CHERRY PIE"
          
                                                                    79.
          
          
          Cassidy is up on stage, doing her thing for a sizable crowd.
          She slinks up to a customer who's holding out a dollar bill
          for her. She pulls on her G-string band, snapping it shut on
          the bill.
          
          She moves over to another customer holding out a dollar and
          does the same.
          
                              RANDY (O.S.)
                    Hey. Over here.
          
          She looks toward the voice, coming from another side of the
          stage.
          
          CASSIDY'S POV: Standing there is Randy, holding out a PURPLE
          ENVELOPE. He looks toward her G-string, like he wants to put
          it in like a dollar bill.
          
          She takes it with her hand instead.
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy and Cassidy sit together at a table. Cassidy is holding
          the purple envelope, looking a little uncomfortable.
          
                               RANDY
                    Open it.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I'll do it later when it's quiet.
          
                              RANDY
                    I wanna watch.
          
          Reluctantly, Cassidy opens it. Inside is a GREETING CARD.
          
          CASSIDY'S POV: On the card's front, a cartoon monkey is
          holding a big bunch of bananas. Across the top, it says
          THANKS A BUNCH!
          
          Randy watches excitedly as she reads the inside. She puts the
          it down after reading it.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    That's very sweet. Thank you.
          
                              RANDY
                    Thank you. I couldn't've done it
                    without you.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I'm glad I could help.
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    It was fun, right? We had a good
                    time.
          
          She nods politely, reservedly, clearly trying to pull back.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                        (FISHING)
                    Shopping...
          
          Another guarded nod.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Hey, you ever been to Mother
                    Kelly's?
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    On 46?
          
                              RANDY
                    They got this kick-ass cover band
                    Tuesday nights. Play anything you
                    can think of. What do you say we----
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Randy.
          
                                 RANDY
                    What?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I can't do this.
          
                                 RANDY
                    Do what?
          
                              CASSIDY
                        ("you and me" gesture)
                    This.
          
          Randy is confused and disappointed.
          
                              RANDY
                    I thought we had a little something
                    going here.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    I think you're awesome. You're a
                    great guy.
          
                                 RANDY
                    But...
          
                                                          81.
          
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You think I'm, like, this stripper,
                    but I'm not. I'm a mom, with
                    responsibilities. I don't think you
                    wanna get with that.
          
                              RANDY
                    What if I do?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I can't go there.
          
                              RANDY
                    What about the other day?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    That was a mistake.
          
                                 RANDY
                    Why? How?
          
                               CASSIDY
                    The club and the real world, they
                    can't mix.
          
                              RANDY
                    What if we'd met someplace else?
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    We didn't.
          
                              RANDY
                    But what if we did?
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    We didn't.
          
                              RANDY
                    What if we did?
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    We didn't.
          
                              RANDY
                    You say I don't know you, but you
                    won't let me get to know you.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You're a customer. You're just a
                    fucking customer. That's it. Okay?
                    Got it?
          
          A long, wounded pause from Randy.
          
                                                                     82.
          
          
                                 RANDY
                    Yeah.
                        (BEAT)
                    I got it.
          
          He takes a $20 out of his pocket, holding it out to her.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    What's that for?
          
                              RANDY
                    A lapdance.
          
          He slides it across the bar to her. She slides it back.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    You're refusing a customer?
          
          He slides the $20 back to her.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Gimme a lapdance.
          
          She slides it back again.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    What? Am I a customer or not?
          
          He waves the $20 tauntingly in her face. She pushes it away.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Stop it.
          
                              RANDY
                    What's the matter?
                        (no answer)
                    Not in the mood?
                        (no answer)
                    So fake it. I'm just a stupid
                    customer.
          
          He tauntingly dangles the $20 in front of her again.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Stop.
          
                              RANDY
                    It doesn't mean anything.
          
          She looks away, trying to ignore him.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    C'mon, give the customer a
                    lapdance. Shake your tits. Smile.
          
                                                                     83.
          
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Fuck off.
          
                              RANDY
                    Pretend you like him.
          
                                CASSIDY
                    Fuck off.
          
                              RANDY
                    I want a lapdance.
          
          She SWATS HIS HAND. The $20 falls to the floor. He picks it
          up and SLAMS IT on the bar.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    I WANT A LAPDANCE!
          
          People turn and stare. Randy storms out of the club,
          humiliated.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. SHOP-RITE - DELI COUNTER - DAY
          
          About 10 CUSTOMERS hover in front of the DELI COUNTER
          clutching Take-A-Number tickets. Randy, manning the counter
          with a COWORKER, hands a WOMAN a packet of roast beef.
          
                              RANDY
                    Can I help who's next?
          
          An OLD LADY steps forward.
          
                              OLD LADY
                    Pound of German potato salad,
                    please.
          
          Randy grabs a container and starts scooping potato salad. He
          puts the container on the scale. It reads 1.06 LB.
          
                              OLD LADY (CONT'D)
                    A little less.
          
          Randy scoops out a little and weighs it again. The scale
          reads .96 LB.
          
                              OLD LADY (CONT'D)
                    A little more.
          
          Randy puts a little more in. The scale reads 1.03.
          
                                                                   84.
          
          
                              OLD LADY (CONT'D)
                    A little less.
          
          Randy, trying to contain his aggravation, takes a tiny bit
          out. The scale reads 1.00. The lady nods in approval.
          
          Randy slaps a price sticker on the container and hands it
          across the counter.
          
                              RANDY
                    Have a nice day.
          
          She shuffles off with her potato salad.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Can I help who's next?
          
          A BLUE-COLLAR GUY (40s) steps forward.
          
                              CUSTOMER
                    Yeah, could I get a...
          
          The guy does a DOUBLE-TAKE, noticing Randy's face.
          
                              CUSTOMER (CONT'D)
                    Do I know you from somewhere?
          
                              RANDY
                    I don't think so.
          
          The guy studies Randy's face, trying hard to place it.
          
                              CUSTOMER
                    You look so damn familiar.
                        (racking his brain)
                    You Teamsters?
          
                              RANDY
                    Sorry, man. What can I getcha?
          
                              CUSTOMER
                    Half pound of Virginia ham and a
                    half pound of the Jarlsberg.
          
          Randy reaches into the case and pulls out a ham. He brings it
          over to the slicer, his back turned away from the guy.
          
                              CUSTOMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    I know we've met someplace.
          
          Slice, slice, slice, slice...
          
                              CUSTOMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    You play softball?

                              RANDY
                    Nah.
          
          Slice, slice, slice, slice...
          
                              CUSTOMER (O.S.)
                    You're not one of Mikey Bosch's
                    buddies, are you?
          
          Randy, shaking his head no, brings the sliced ham over to the
          weigh scale. The guy SNAPS HIS FINGERS.
          
                              CUSTOMER (CONT'D)
                    Wait a sec.
          
          He looks at Randy, surprised and amazed.
          
                              CUSTOMER (CONT'D)
                    Randy The Ram?
          
          Randy stands there frozen.
          
                              RANDY
                    Huh?
          
                              CUSTOMER
                    The old wrestler. From the '80s.
          
          Randy, shrugging blankly, wraps up the ham and slaps a price
          sticker on.
          
                              CUSTOMER (CONT'D)
                        (forms Ram horns)
                    Ram Jam!
          
          Randy grabs the Jarlsberg from the case and brings it over to
          the slicer. He starts slicing.
          
                              CUSTOMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Wow, that's freaky. You look just
                    like the dude. Except older.
          
          ANGLE ON the block of cheese as Randy slices. There's only a
          SMALL CHUNK left. The chunk dwindles, getting smaller and
          smaller. The cheese separating Randy's fingers from the blade
          grows thin.
          
          He almost seems tempted.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATE NIGHT
          
          Randy, unable to sleep, sits shirtless on the couch, staring
          blankly at the TV.
          
          
          ON TV:
          
          An NBA HIGHLIGHT CLIP of a FEROCIOUS DUNK. The crowd goes
          wild. The player roars as he runs back up court, full of
          macho swagger.
          
          
          RANDY:
          
          Randy's eyes drift downward toward his chest. He gazes at the
          still-fresh scar. Touches it tenderly.
          
          He takes a big swig of wine, polishing off a bottle. He pops
          a cassette into the BOOMBOX on the floor. GUNS `N' ROSES -
          USE YOUR ILLUSION II.
          
          Randy cranks up the volume and hits PLAY...
          
          MUSIC: GUNS `N' ROSES - "GET IN THE RING"
          
          The song begins with the sound of a ROARING STADIUM CROWD. A
          chant begins:
          
                              CROWD (ON THE SONG)
                    Guns! And! Roses!... Guns! And!
                    Roses!...
          
          Randy starts to prowl the floor like it's a wrestling ring
          before a match. He waves his arms, exhorting the crowd on the
          song as if their cheers are for him.
          
                              RANDY
                        (cups hand to ear)
                    What's that?
          
          Randy works the crowd. He points at a fan in the back row.
          Flexes theatrically. Bangs his head on pretend chairs.
          
          Randy grabs the top rope and gives it a hard shake. Loosening
          up with some neck rolls and trunk twists, he heads to the
          center of the ring.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                        (ANNOUNCER-LIKE)
                    Folks, we are ready to rumble...
          
          The song, which starts with a slow, bluesy guitar intro,
          kicks in. FAST, RAGING HARD ROCK.
          
                                                                     87.
          
          
          Randy stares down his invisible opponent. The opponent SUCKER
          PUNCHES him. Randy drops to the ground.
          
          Randy lies on the floor getting kicked and punched. He knocks
          his opponent down with a LEG SWEEP and pops up.
          
          Randy hits his opponent with a flurry of backhand chops.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    I've never seen such determination!
          
          Randy immobilizes his opponent in some sort of headlock.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Sleeper claw!
          
          Randy flips his opponent upside down, his head between his
          knees. He drops him headfirst onto the bed/mat.
          
                               RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Piledriver!
                        (BEAT)
                    Just listen to this place!
          
          Randy scoops up his opponent again and SLAMS HIM TO THE MAT
          with another fancy move.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Powerbomb!
          
          The song reaches its frenzied, chant-like CHORUS:
          
                              GUNS `N' ROSES
                    Get in the ring! Get in the ring!
                    Get in the ring! Get in the ring!
          
          Randy joins in, pumping his fist.
          
                              RANDY
                    Get in the ring! Get in the ring!

          A strip-mall sports-card/comic-book shop. Tacked to the wall
          by the entrance are FLYERS for various events----card shows,
          autograph signings, etc.
          
          Behind the counter is promoter Scott Brumberg, scarfing down
          a sloppy Subway sub. The door opens. He looks up, smiling.
          
                                                                    88.

          Randy heads over and gives him a warm hello handclasp.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yo, Brummy.
          
          Brumberg pulls him in for a hug.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    How's tricks? Good to see ya, man.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah, good, good.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    So what brings ya by?
          
                              RANDY
                    Well... I was thinking about maybe
                    doing a reffing gig.
          
                              SCOTT BRUMBERG
                    I thought you're retired.
          
                              RANDY
                    No wrestling, just reffing. Thought
                    it might be fun. Shits `n' giggles.
          
          Brumberg, nodding, reaches down and grabs out a beat-up
          SPIRAL NOTEBOOK with old event flyers sticking out.

          A high-school cafeteria. Randy is slipping into a REFEREE
          UNIFORM. Along the wall hangs a vinyl banner reading CAPW -
          CONNECTICUT ALL-PRO WRESTLING.

                    Randy The Ref!
          
          Randy looks up and sees BOOKER D (30s), a big, black wrestler
          in FULL PIMP REGALIA. Though not a pro like Randy, he's upper-
          tier indie circuit. Randy gives him a grin and handshake.
          
                                 RANDY
                    `Sup, bro?

                      I really ain't lookin' to mix it up

          Booker D looks at him, surprised and puzzled.

                      One!... Two!...
          
          McPride kicks out. Booker D lifts up McPride. He hits him
          with a CHEST CHOP, sending him stumbling backwards into the
          ropes. Booker D goes after him.
          
          CAMERA STAYS ON RANDY'S FACE as he watches them wrestle off-
          screen.
          
          Randy's eyes are glued to the action... Punches. Kicks.
          Suplexes. Bodyslams. The crowd is going crazy.
          
          He is tempted. Salivating almost.
          
          More punches. More cheers. Bodies crash loudly against the
          mat. Randy's temptation grows with each shot. He can't resist
          any longer. He...
          
          JUMPS IN.
          
          Randy pushes Booker D out of the way. He's SMASHED IN THE
          FACE by a McPride-swung folding chair meant for Booker D.
          
                                                                     90.
          
          
          Randy goes down. A TRACE OF A SMILE is visible on his face.

          Randy, Booker D, and McPride are SHOWERING in the open shower
          area. They're on a post-match high.
          
                              BOOKER D
                    What a screwjob.
          
                              SHAWN MCPRIDE
                    Crowd was pissed.
          
          McPride gives Randy a "We're not worthy" bow of respect.

                    Just reffing, my ass. I knew you'd
                    get in there.
          
          Randy gives him a "Hey, what can I say?" shrug.
          
                              SHAWN MCPRIDE
                    Y'all feel like grabbing a drink?
          
          McPride and Booker D both look toward Randy. He's the one
          they're interested in hanging with.

          A hotel bar, lively and hopping with a weekend crowd. Randy
          sits at the bar, holding court with Booker D and McPride.
          They're all well on their way to being drunk.
          
                              RANDY
                    By the time Ruckus fixes the tire,
                    we've had so many Nyquil coladas we
                    don't even realize we missed the
                    damn gig!
          
          Booker D and McPride CRACK UP.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Swear to God. Can't make stuff like
                    that up.

                    You never heard that one?
          
          McPride looks at him blankly.
          
                               RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, man, fuckin' classic.

                    1990. Nashville Coliseum, Rage In
                    The Cage II. I'm in the locker room
                    shaving when behind me the stall
                    door opens. I turn and there's
                    Chris Columbo on the can taking a
                    dump. He goes, "This is for
                    Petrov", fuckin' wipes his ass,
                    takes the shit-covered toilet paper
                    and rubs it in his armpit. Five
                    minutes later, he's in the ring
                    with Petrov in a headlock, poor
                    Petrov stuck there in CC's pit
                    lookin' like he's gonna puke!
          
          McPride and Booker D roar with delight.

                    Uh-oh...
          
          Booker D spots something intriguing by the bar entrance.
          Randy and McPride follow his gaze there.
          
          RANDY'S POV: TWO WOMEN----late 30s, frosted hair, tight denim
          miniskirts----just walked in the bar. He catches the twosome
          stealing a glance in their direction.
          
                              BOOKER D (CONT'D)
                    Ring rats, 12 o'clock.
          
          Randy and McPride seem to agree with his assessment.

          The wrestlers are dancing with the women, MELISSA and ALYSSA,
          on the bar's dance floor. Melissa is sandwiched between
          Booker D and McPride, shaking her ass for them like a 19-year-
          old spring breaker.
          
          Alyssa is paired off with Randy, grinding her ass against
          him. She turns, facing him. Looks at him with a coy smile.
          
                              ALYSSA
                    I know who you are.
          
          She slowly runs her hands up Randy's sides.
          
                              ALYSSA (CONT'D)
                    My brother used to have your poster
                    on his door.
          
          Randy smiles, pleased.
          
                              RANDY
                    Dude's got taste.
          
          Alyssa notices something intriguing over Randy's shoulder.
          Randy turns to see what she's looking at.
          
          RANDY'S POV: Standing by the bar is a MAN.
          
          He turns back to Alyssa.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Who's that?
          
                              ALYSSA
                    A.J. My old coke dealer.
          
          Randy nods oh. A slightly weird moment between them.
          
                              ALYSSA (CONT'D)
                    I don't do that anymore.
          
                              RANDY
                    Me neither.
          
          They exchange a look.

          There's a KNOCK at the door.

          BLACK SCREEN.
          
          RANDY'S POV:   His eyes slowly open. Staring down at him from a
          white stucco   ceiling is a poster of a HUNKY, SHIRTLESS
          FIREMAN with   a pair of suspenders stretched across his oiled-
          up six pack.   Across the bottom it says FIVE-ALARM FIRE.
          
          Randy looks around, disoriented. He is NAKED in a strange bed
          in a strange bedroom. His clothes lie on the floor next to a
          LARGE GLASS BONG.
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy, wearing only a pair of bikini briefs, staggers into
          the KITCHEN. A ROOMMATE (23) in a Tweety Bird nightshirt is
          pouring herself a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios. She looks at
          Randy with a casual "wassup" head-nod.
          
                              ROOMMATE
                    Alyssa's in the shower.

          Randy emerges from Alyssa's building in the previous night's
          clothes, squinting at the blinding sunlight.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy enters his trailer, chuckling amusedly. He tosses his
          keys on the table.
          
          He heads over to the fridge and grabs a beer. As he closes
          the fridge, his expression changes. A look of DEEP DISMAY
          comes over his face.
          
                                                                     94.

                              RANDY
                    Hey.
          
          She stares at him coldly and unnervingly.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Is Stephanie home?
          
          She goes into the house, closing the door behind her. Randy
          stands there awkwardly, unsure what that meant.
          
          He thinks about knocking but doesn't. He carefully turns the
          knob, leaning into the house. From somewhere inside, he hears
          the MUFFLED SOUND of Stephanie and The Friend talking.
          
          
          INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Stephanie and The Friend are arguing in the living room.
          
                              THE FRIEND
                    You don't have to go out there. You
                    don't owe him shit.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I know that.
          
                               THE FRIEND
                    Then why would you even----
                        (looks up toward front
                         DOOR)
                    Who said you could come in?
          
          THE FRIEND'S/STEPHANIE'S POV: Standing there is Randy, gazing
          guiltily at Stephanie.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Please leave my house.
          
                                RANDY
                    I'm so, so sorry. I completely,
                    TOTALLY----
          
                                                                  95.
          
          
                              THE FRIEND
                    Get the fuck out of here!
          
                              STEPHANIE
                        (to The Friend)
                    I can handle this.
          
                              THE FRIEND
                    Obviously not.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                        (teeth gritted)
                    I can handle this, Jen.
          
          The Friend, disgusted, grabs her coat and STORMS OFF out the
          front door.
          
          Randy and Stephanie are alone. She glares at him for what
          feels like a long time.
          
                              STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    You're such a fucking asshole.
          
                              RANDY
                    I feel horrible.
          
                               STEPHANIE
                    I waited in that restaurant two
                    hours. Two fucking hours. Just in
                    case you showed up late. "Maybe he
                    got stuck in traffic. Maybe I got
                    the time wrong"...
                        (BEAT)
                    Nope.
          
                              RANDY
                    I know I fucked up. I fucked up
                    bad.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    You didn't fuck up. You are a fuck-
                    up. A walking, living, breathing
                    fuck-up.
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm trying to change. Really. I
                    can't stand when I----
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Just please shut the fuck up.
                    Because I can't even stand the
                    sound of your voice.
                        (SEETHING)
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                   96.
          
                               STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    I thought about having a drink for
                    the first time in 11 months last
                    night. That's what you do to me.
                        (BEAT)
                    You asshole!
          
          She grabs a SMALL POTTED PLANT off the table and THROWS IT AT
          HIM. It NARROWLY MISSES HIS HEAD, exploding against the wall.
          
                              STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    Fucking piece-of-shit asshole!
          
          She grabs a CAN OF SODA off the same table and THROWS IT. It
          NAILS HIM IN THE THIGH, exploding open on the floor. Soda
          sprays everywhere.
          
                              RANDY
                    Jesus! Stop!
          
          She looks around, half-crazed, searching for something else
          to throw. He rushes toward her, wrapping her up in his arms.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    Get off me!
          
                                 RANDY
                    Calm down!
          
          He SQUEEZES TIGHTER. She THRASHES AROUND, fighting it.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    GET THE FUCK OFF ME!
          
                                 RANDY
                    Calm down!
          
                              STEPHANIE
                        (thrashing violently)
                    I HATE YOU!
          
                              RANDY
                    You don't mean that!
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    FUCKING HATE YOU!
          
                              RANDY
                    YOU DON'T MEAN IT!
          
          Suddenly, she STOPS RESISTING. A STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED CALM
          washes over her.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I don't mean it?
          
                                                            97.
          
          
          She is silent and still.
          
                              STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    You're right. I don't.
          
          She shakes her head, placidly gazing off.
          
                              STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    I don't know why I got so
                    hysterical. There's no reason. I
                    don't hate you. I don't love you. I
                    don't like you. I was stupid to
                    think you could change.
          
                              RANDY
                    I can change.
          
                              STEPHANIE
                    I don't care.
          
                              RANDY
                    I know I can.
          
                               STEPHANIE
                    Doesn't matter. I don't care. I'm
                    done.
                        (BEAT)
                    No more fixing it. It's broke.
                    Permanently. I'm cool with it. It's
                    better that way.
          
          She turns and looks him in the eye.
          
                               STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    I don't want to ever see you again.
                    I don't wanna see you, I don't want
                    to hear you...
                        (BEAT)
                    Done. You understand?
          
          Randy doesn't.
          
                              STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    Actually, I don't care if you
                    understand.
          
          She walks toward the front door. Opens it wide.
          
                               STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    Goodbye.
          
                                                                      98.
          
          
          EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy steps out the front door. Stephanie's cellphone rings.
          She looks at the caller ID and picks up.
          
                               STEPHANIE
                    You can come home.
                        (BEAT)
                    He's gone.
          
          She closes the door on him, disappearing inside the house.
          
          Randy stands there alone on his daughter's front step. Unsure
          what to do. He starts to CRY.
          
                                                             CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. SHOP-RITE - DELI COUNTER - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON Take-A-Number sign. It reads NOW SERVING: 54
          
          A crowd of AGGRAVATED CUSTOMERS stand waiting at the counter.
          A FAT GUY in a motorized cart clutching a 71 throws a fellow
          customer a "Do you believe these morons?" eye roll.
          
          Behind the counter are Randy and a COWORKER. Randy is putting
          a block of Havarti onto the slicer. He moves lackadaisically,
          distractedly.
          
          Wayne, noticing as he roams past, heads over.
          
                              WAYNE
                    Let's pick it up. Rush hour.
          
          Wayne gives him TWO QUICK CLAPS and walks off. Randy adjusts
          the machine's setting and begins to slice. He isn't moving
          much faster.
          
                CUSTOMER #1 (O.S.)               CUSTOMER #2 (O.S.)
          While we're young...             Any year now...
          
          Randy keeps right on slicing at his unhurried pace. He gets
          in a nice, meditative groove.
          
          Slice, slice, slice, slice, slice...
          
          He watches as his thumb inches closer to the spinning blade.
          He stares at his thumb. At the blade. His thumb.
          
          He JAMS HIS THUMB INTO THE BLADE.
          
          Blood squirts everywhere. On his coat. On the deli meat.
          
                                                                     99.
          
          
          Randy stares at the DEEP GASH, watching as blood pulses out
          in crimson surges. He smiles strangely at it.
          
          A customer GASPS. A commotion quickly spreads.
          
                                 WAYNE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Randy!
          
          Randy turns and sees a shocked Wayne rushing toward him.
          Wayne takes Randy's arm and tries to lead him into the back,
          out of view.
          
                              WAYNE (CONT'D)
                        (conscious of customers
                         WATCHING)
                    Let's get that patched up.
          
          Randy roughly SHOVES him away. Wayne stumbles backwards.
          
          Randy, turning toward the onlookers, raises his thumb to his
          face. He dramatically smears the BLOOD ACROSS HIS MOUTH.
          
          Customers GASP. A woman SHRIEKS.
          
          Randy drags the gash across his cheek. He SMEARS A LINE OF IT
          under each eye like WARPAINT.
          
                              RANDY
                        (striking wrestling pose)
                    Let's get it onnn!
          
                              WAYNE
                    Somebody call the cops!
          
          Randy ROARS at Wayne. Wayne JUMPS BACK, frightened. Randy
          rumbles out of the deli area LAUGHING.
          
          
          SUPERMARKET AISLE:
          
          Randy dashes down an aisle. He dodges a WOMAN PUSHING A
          SHOPPING CART, purposely "over-dodging" her so he CRASHES
          INTO THE SHELVES and sends stuff flying. He dodges ANOTHER
          SHOPPER, dramatically crashing into the shelves again.
          
          
          FRONT REGISTER AREA:
          
          Randy charges past the CASHIERS, out of the supermarket.
          
                                                                 100.
          
          
          INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy sits in the van in the Shop-Rite parking lot. He gazes
          at himself in the rear-view mirror, dried blood caked on his
          face.
          
          He likes it.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

          Randy is on the pay phone.

          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - DAY
          
          Randy is digging through a pile of clothes in a closet. He
          pulls out his WRESTLING TIGHTS.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Randy, wearing rubber gloves and a towel around his neck,
          combs PEROXIDE through his hair.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Randy is SHAVING HIS CHEST. The hair has grown in since he
          last wrestled.
          
                                                                 101.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATER
          
          Randy stands in the middle of the trailer in just a pair of
          bikini briefs. In his hands is a product called TAN IN A CAN.
          He gives the can a good shake and starts spraying his body.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy puts a snacks-and-soda-filled plastic bag in the front
          of the van. He is surprised to see Cassidy pull up in her
          car. She gets out.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Hi.
          
                              RANDY
                    How'd you find me?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Big Chris. Cheetah's bouncer.
          
          Randy nods oh.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Look, I'm sorry if I came off like
                    a bitch. I didn't mean that stuff I
                    said. You're not just a customer.
          
          Randy nods. He heads toward his trailer. Cassidy follows.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    I'm sure it seems retarded, but I
                    gotta keep that line. It's how I've
                    been able to live with myself the
                    last 12 years.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy enters the trailer, Cassidy close behind.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    There's a place I'm trying to get
                    to in my life. For me and my son.
          
          Randy heads to his wheelie bag, open on the bed.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    I'm leaving that world behind. And
                    I can't bring anybody with me who----
          
                                                                  102.

                        (doesn't really care)
                    Good for you. Quitting's hard.
          
          He zips up his bag. Walks outside toward his van. She
          follows.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Where are you going?
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS
          
          He gets in the van.
          
                              RANDY
                    Got a match.
          
          He grabs the Fanfest flyer off the passenger seat and hands
          it to her.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    See ya later.
          
          He DRIVES OFF. She watches him go, the van kicking up dust in
          its wake.
          
          She looks at flier. A look of concern comes over her face.
          
          
          INT. VAN - EVENING
          
          MUSIC: SKID ROW - "I REMEMBER YOU"
          
          Randy is driving south on the New Jersey Turnpike.
          
          
          INT. CASSIDY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cassidy grabs her purse and car keys off the kitchen table.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    In bed by 11. Don't let him
                    bargain.
          
          The BABYSITTER (15) nods at the instructions. Cassidy heads
          toward the...
          
          
          LIVING ROOM:
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Bye, monkey...
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
          She is struck by what she sees.
          
          CASSIDY'S POV: DANIEL (9) is on the floor, playing with the
          Randy The Ram doll.
          
          She watches as he makes the Randy doll climb up the couch's
          armrest. The doll takes a FLYING LEAP off the couch, onto a
          STAR WARS FIGURE laid out on the floor below. Daniel makes an
          EXPLOSION SOUND as Randy slams down on his foe.
          
          Cassidy looks at the doll, worried.
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - LATER
          
          MUSIC: WARRANT - "CHERRY PIE"
          
          Cassidy is dancing onstage. She has a distracted, faraway
          look in her eye.
          
          She abruptly WALKS OFF mid-song.
          
          She heads toward the dressing room, disappearing through the
          curtain.
          
                                CLUB D.J. (O.S.)
                    Cassidy----where ya goin', baby?
          
          
          INT. DRESSING AREA - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cassidy unlocks her locker. She throws everything in it into
          a duffel bag. She grabs the MASTER LOCK off the locker door
          and throws it into the bag, too.
          
          
          INT. CHEETAH'S - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cassidy, wearing her coat, steps through the curtain with the
          bag.
          
                                 CLUB D.J. (O.S.)
                    Pam.
          
          She cuts across the empty stage, toward the exit.
          
          
          EXT. CHEETAH'S - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cassidy steps out of the club.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                           (to self)
                    Pam.
          
                                                                 104.
          
          
          EXT. I-95 - LATER
          
          Randy stands at a ROADSIDE PAY PHONE, ringing phone cradled
          to his ear.
          
                              STEPHANIE'S VOICE
                    This is Stephanie, you know what to
                    do.
                        (answering machine BEEP)
          
                               RANDY
                    It's me. I promise I won't call you
                    ever again.
                        (BEAT)
                    I'm going back to the ring. You
                    were right about me. Everything you
                    said. Anyway... I just wanted you
                    to know...
                        (BEAT)
                    Your daddy loves you.
                        (BEAT)
                    That's all.
          
          He hangs up.
          
          
          INT. CASSIDY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cassidy is driving south on the New Jersey Turnpike. She's on
          her cellphone. On the passenger seat is the Fanfest flyer.
          
                               CASSIDY
                    There's waffles in the freezer and
                    some burritos if he wants for
                    lunch. He knows where.
                        (BEAT)
                    I'm not sure what time I'll be
                    headed back yet. I'll keep you
                    posted as I go.
          
          
          EXT. I-95 - SIDE OF THE ROAD - MIDNIGHT
          
          Randy's van is pulled over on the side of the interstate.
          
          
          INT. BACK OF VAN - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy is catching a nap as 18-wheelers barrel past.
          
                                                                  105.
          
          
          INT. VAN - NEXT MORNING
          
          Randy pulls into the empty-ish parking lot of the GREENVILLE
          CIVIC AUDITORIUM.
          
          
          INT. LOCKER ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Randy enters the locker room with his wheelie bag.
          
                              MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Yeah, nah, business is rockin'.
                    Just opened a third dealership.
          
          Randy looks down a row of lockers.
          
          RANDY'S POV: A huge, dark-skinned man in khakis and a BOB
          ZAYID PONTIAC polo is talking to SOME OTHER WRESTLER. This is
          THE AYATOLLAH (52).
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    That makes two in Columbus, one in
                    Dayton. Next 12 months, I'd say
                    Cincy's not out of the question.
          
                              OTHER WRESTLER
                        (not too interested)
                    Wow...
          
          The Ayatollah looks up and sees Randy looking at him.
          
                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                    Ram-A-Lam.
          
          Randy heads over.
          
                              RANDY
                        (shakes Ayatollah's hand)
                    What's up, Bob?
                        (shakes other guy's hand)
                    Yo, Carl.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    Good to see ya, bro. Didn't think
                    we were gonna do this.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah, well, I'm here.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    Thursday night, I get a call, "It's
                    on! He's back in!" I'm like "What?"
          
          The Ayatollah chortles.
          
                                                                 106.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    When you get settled in, we should
                    go over things.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    What things?
          
                              RANDY
                    Y'know, the spots.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    Ah, we can just wing it.
          
                              RANDY
                    You don't wanna hash it out?
          
          The Ayatollah gives him a dismissive, cavalier wave.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    It'll be fine.
          
                              RANDY
                    We should have at least a basic
                    plan.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    How's this: I'm the heel, you're
                    the face. Done.
          
          The Ayatollah chuckles. Randy walks off, highly annoyed.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        (to other wrestler)
                    Anyway, if you're ever in Ohio,
                    swing on by. I'll make you a nice
                    deal on a G6.
          
          
          INT. GAS STATION - SHORT TIME LATER
          
          Cassidy pulls into a gas station. She rolls down the window.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Excuse me.
          
          A GAS STATION ATTENDANT looks her way.
          
                              CASSIDY (CONT'D)
                    Do you know where the Civic
                    Auditorium is?
          
                                                                   107.
          
          
          INT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - LOCKER ROOM - LATER
          
          The card is underway. Through a wall, we hear the muffled
          sounds of a MATCH IN PROGRESS: cheers, boos, crashes, etc.
          
          Randy, sitting alone on a bench in just his jock strap, tapes
          up his legs. His focus and intensity builds.
          
          
          EXT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME
          LATER
          
          Cassidy pulls into the lot. There's a lot more cars than when
          Randy pulled in.
          
          
          INT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - OUTER CONCOURSE - SHORT
          TIME LATER
          
          The building's outer concourse. A handful of fans mill about
          at a CONCESSIONS STAND and a SOUVENIR TABLE.
          
          Cassidy, handing a ticket to an USHER, enters the building.
          She looks around the concourse, not quite sure where to go.
          
          
          INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER
          
          Randy, suited up in his tights, paces the floor, gearing
          himself up for the match. The only other wrestler in the
          locker room at the moment is The Ayatollah, doing neck rolls
          nearby. Randy catches his eyes.
          
                              RANDY
                    Ready to do this?
          
          Through the wall, ARABIC MUSIC starts to play.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    Believe so.
          
          The Ayatollah grabs a large IRANIAN FLAG leaning against the
          lockers. He heads toward an ENTRANCE CURTAIN, Randy close
          behind.
          
                               ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        (through curtain)
                    From the Islamic Republic of Iran,
                    weighing in at 252 pounds... The
                    Tehran Terror, the Beast Of The
                    Middle East...
                        (BEAT)
                    The Ayaaa-tooo-laaaaaah!
          
                                                                    108.
          
          
          The Ayatollah steps through the curtain, Iranian flag raised
          high. He is promptly greeted with LUSTY BOOS.
          
          
          INT. OUTER CONCOURSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cassidy is walking around the concourse with a mounting sense
          urgency. She spots a SECURITY GUY in a yellow windbreaker
          sitting by an UNMARKED DOOR. She heads toward him.
          
                                 CASSIDY
                    Excuse me.
          
          
          INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy is peering through the narrow gap in the curtain,
          watching The Ayatollah make his entrance.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.)
                        (faint, amidst the boos)
                    Death to America!
          
                                 CASSIDY (O.S.)
                    Randy.
          
          Randy, turning, is surprised to see Cassidy standing there.
          She looks tired and worried and scared.
          
                              RANDY
                    What are you doing here?
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Don't do this. This is dumb.
          
                              RANDY
                    This ain't the best time to talk.
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    What about your heart?
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    I'll be fine.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I thought the doctor...
          
                              RANDY
                    They always say that. Whatever you
                    got.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    You could really hurt yourself.
          
                                                                   109.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    I know what I'm doing in there.
                        (turns vaguely sad)
                    Out here's where I get hurt.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Out here's what counts. The real
                    world.
          
                              RANDY
                    Fuck the real world. Nobody gives a
                    shit about me in the real world.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    I quit my job, drove 14 hours
                    through the night to get here. What
                    do you call that?
          
          Randy looks away, unable to hold her gaze. Through the
          curtain, we hear the Arabic music DIE DOWN.
          
                              ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        (from auditorium)
                    And his opponent...
          
          A new, familiar song rises on the auditorium speakers.
          
          MUSIC: AC/DC - "IF YOU WANT BLOOD (YOU GOT IT)"
          
          The crowd roars.
          
                              RANDY
                        (points to curtain)
                    Listen to them! This is where I'm
                    great. This is where I belong.
          
          Randy looks at the curtain. He looks at Cassidy.
          
                              ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                    From Elizabeth, New Jersey,
                    weighing in at 219 pounds...
          
                              RANDY
                    I gotta go.
          
                              CASSIDY
                    Randy. Please.
          
                              RANDY
                    I'll see you after the show.
          
                                CASSIDY
                          (grabs him)
                    No.
          
                                                                    110.
          
          
          He pulls her off.
          
                              RANDY
                    Enjoy the show.
          
          He turns away from her, toward the curtain.
          
                               ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                    A true wrestling immortal, one of
                    the greatest of all time...
                        (BEAT)
                    Randy "The Ram" Robinnnnsonnnnn!
          
          He steps through.
          
          
          INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy bursts through the curtain to HUGE CHEERS. There's
          probably 700 people there in the 2,200-seat facility.
          
          
          INT. COMMENTATORS' TABLE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Seated at a ringside table are the match's COMMENTATORS, a
          pair of wannabe Marv Alberts in their 20s. A sign taped to
          the table reads CAROLINA WRESTLING NETWORK. Next to the table
          is a VIDEOCAMERA on a tripod.
          
                              COMMENTATOR #1
                    There he is, folks! Randy The Ram!
          
          Randy raises a set of ram's horns high in the air. Fans do
          the same in tribute.
          
                              COMMENTATOR #2
                    History about to be made here at
                    the Greenville Civic Auditorium.
          
          Randy takes a long lap around the ring, ramming chair after
          chair. His head gets a little bloody. The fans eat it up.
          
          Randy climbs into the ring, where The Ayatollah awaits.
          
          The cheers continue. Loving, appreciative, sustained cheers.
          Randy stands there soaking it in, basking in their love.
          
          He grabs the microphone from the ring announcer. He looks
          around. A hush comes over the crowd.
          
                              RANDY
                    I just got one thing to say to you
                    people...
          
                                                                   111.
          
          
          Randy looks toward Cassidy, standing over by the entrance
          curtain. He looks out at the larger crowd.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.
          
          LOUD CHEERS. Randy takes a contemplative pause.
          
                               RANDY (CONT'D)
                    You take your lumps and bruises in
                    this game. But you know what? It's
                    all worth it. Because of you guys.
                    Your cheers keep me young. They
                    make me feel alive.
                        (BEAT)
                    In 1982, the year I wrestled my
                    first professional match, I was six-
                    foot-one. By 1993, I was five-foot-
                    eleven. Three back surgeries in 11
                    years knocked two full inches off
                    my height. I may be down to five-
                    eleven, but performing in front of
                    you people has always made me feel
                    10 feet tall. And that's the way
                    it's always gonna be.
          
          Randy looks toward Cassidy, who's standing over by the
          entrance curtain. Their eyes meet.
          
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                    Forever.
          
          Randy lowers the mike, finished. The fans CHEER WILDLY, the
          loudest cheers yet.
          
          As Randy nods appreciatively at the crowd, The Ayatollah
          SNEAKS UP BEHIND HIM with a folding chair.
          
          Fans shout, trying to warn Randy about the sneak attack, but
          he doesn't hear them.
          
          The Ayatollah SMASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD. Randy goes down. The
          match is on.
          
          The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes.
          Randy bounces back toward The Ayatollah, who lazily puts up
          an elbow for Randy to run into. Randy practically has to lead
          his face to the elbow. Hitting the mat, Randy pops back up
          and grabs The Ayatollah.
          
          The Ayatollah, phoning it in, throws Randy into the ropes
          again. This time, The Ayatollah has a raised knee waiting for
          Randy. Randy runs into it, doing his best to sell the shot.
          
                                                                  112.
          
          
                                RANDY (CONT'D)
                          (under breath)
                      You're workin' pretty light here.
          
          Randy gets up and grabs The Ayatollah's arms. With a nifty
          move, he flips The Ayatollah over his shoulder, SLAMMING HIM
          HARD into the mat. Randy falls on top of him, pressing The
          Ayatollah's face into the canvas.
          
                                THE AYATOLLAH
                      Jesus. Relax.
          
          Randy flips The Ayatollah over onto his back, pinning his
          shoulder blades. The REF swoops in.
          
                                REFEREE
                      One!... Two!...
          
          The Ayatollah KICKS OUT. They both get up. The Ayatollah jogs
          toward the ropes. He bounces off. Randy braces for something
          good, but all he gets is a feeble CHEST SLAP. Randy grabs The
          Ayatollah and puts him in a headlock.
          
                                RANDY
                      Anytime you wanna join in.
          
          Randy scoops up The Ayatollah and drops him over his knee
          with a BACKBREAKER. The Ayatollah grimaces in pain as he hits
          the mat. Before he has a chance to get up, Randy hits him
          with a FLYING ELBOW DROP.
          
          The Ayatollah gets up, pissed at the rough treatment.
          
          Randy goes for a dropkick, but The Ayatollah catches his
          ankles in midair. He JERKS UPWARD on Randy's legs, sending
          Randy CRASHING TO THE MAT on the back of his head. The
          Ayatollah falls on Randy's throat with his knee. He grinds
          Randy's face into the canvas as Randy did to him.
          
          
          ENTRANCE CURTAIN:
          
          Cassidy is cringing. It's hard for her to watch this.
          
          
          THE RING:
          
                                THE AYATOLLAH
                      That better?
          
                                RANDY
                      Much.
          
                                                                     113.
          
          
          The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes.
          Randy bounces back, flinging himself sideways at The
          Ayatollah. The Ayatollah catches him in mid-air, cradling him
          in his arms. The Ayatollah drops Randy onto his bent knee.
          Randy falls to the canvas, clutching his side. The Ayatollah
          falls on top of him.
          
                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                       Forgot how much fun this is.
          
          The ref swoops in.
          
                                 REFEREE
                       One!... Two!...
          
          Randy KICKS OUT. As Randy "recovers", The Ayatollah jumps out
          of the ring and grabs a folding chair.
          
          The Ayatollah, climbing back in, props up the chair in a
          corner. He picks Randy off the mat and flings him at the
          chair. Randy VAULTS OVER IT, sailing through the ropes and
          OUT OF THE RING. He hits the concrete floor, CRASHING against
          the metal barricade.
          
          
          ENTRANCE CURTAIN:
          
          Cassidy winces. She starts to tear up a little.
          
          
          THE RING:
          
          The Ayatollah hops out of the ring. He stands over Randy,
          kicking him repeatedly. He grabs his Iranian flag, waving it
          tauntingly at the crowd.
          
                  FAN #1 (O.S.)                      FAN #2 (O.S.)
          Camelfucker!                       Fat piece of shit!
          
          The Ayatollah looks down at Randy.
          
                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                       Pathetic.
                           ("spits" on Randy)
                       Pitiful godless infidel!
          
          
          THE CROWD:
          
          Boos rain down on The Ayatollah.
          
                                                                 114.
          
          
          JUST OUTSIDE RING:
          
          The Ayatollah takes the butt end of his flag pole and JABS IT
          into Randy's side. Randy grimaces in pain.
          
          The Ayatollah unties the flag from its pole and WRAPS IT
          around Randy's neck. He JERKS UPWARD on the flag, lifting
          Randy off the mat by his neck. Randy THRASHES AROUND,
          fighting for breath.
          
          The Ayatollah releases Randy from the choke. Randy crumples
          to the ground, gasping for air. The Ayatollah picks up Randy
          by his hair and flings him back in the ring.
          
          
          THE RING:
          
          The Ayatollah grabs the folding chair from the corner. He
          SMASHES RANDY OVER THE HEAD with it. Randy's forehead is
          BLEEDING. The Ayatollah hits him again, taking dead aim at
          the forehead cut. MORE BLOOD. Randy crumples to the mat.
          
          
          ENTRANCE CURTAIN:
          
          Cassidy, alarmed, instinctively goes halfway toward the ring.
          
                                   CASSIDY
                      Randy!
          
          
          THE RING:
          
          The Ayatollah scoops up Randy and BODYSLAMS him. He falls on
          Randy knee-first and starts punching him repeatedly.
          
                                THE AYATOLLAH
                          (under breath)
                      Wanna take it home?
          
          Randy's eyes drift in Cassidy's direction.
          
          RANDY'S POV: Cassidy is CRYING.
          
                                CASSIDY
                      Stop it! Stop it, Randy!
          
          Randy turns back to The Ayatollah.
          
                                   RANDY
                      It's time.
          
                                THE AYATOLLAH
                      All you, bro. Lead the way.
          
                                                                 115.
          
          
          Randy flips The Ayatollah over. Randy struggles to his feet.
          He picks up The Ayatollah and levels him with a dropkick.
          
                              COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)
                    Dropkick!
                        (a second one)
                    And another!
                        (a third one)
                    And another!
          
          His heart is POUNDING. The fans sense it's near the end. A
          chant rises:
          
                              CROWD (O.S.)
                    Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
          
          Randy falls on top of The Ayatollah, putting him in a rest-
          move headlock.
          
                              CROWD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
          
                              COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.)
                    Just listen to this crowd!
          
          The Ayatollah can hear how labored Randy's breathing is.
          
                              THE AYATOLLAH
                    If you ain't up to it...
          
                              CROWD (O.S.)
                    Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
          
          Randy looks around at the crowd, chanting, hungry for the Ram
          Jam. He looks The Ayatollah in the eye.
          
                              RANDY
                    Let's do this.
          
          Randy gets up. He lifts The Ayatollah off the mat, locking up
          with him chest-to-chest. He arches his back and thrusts his
          hips. The Ayatollah's feet fly off the canvas as his legs
          whip into the air. His body does a COMPLETE FLIP as he slams
          onto his back. Randy stays with him, his body contorting in a
          tight BACK FLIP as he CRASHES DOWN on top of him.
          
                              COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)
                    Lateral drop!
          
          Randy gets up. His HEART LURCHES.
          
          He lowers himself back down to his knees. Puts his hand to
          his chest. Something just happened.
          
                                                                    116.
          
          
          Randy looks out at the crowd. The whole place is on its feet.
          
                                CROWD (O.S.)
                      Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
          
          Randy's heart LURCHES AGAIN.
          
                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                      Y'okay?
          
          The Ayatollah sees he's clearly not.
          
                                THE AYATOLLAH (CONT'D)
                      Just pin me.
          
          Randy looks out at the crowd again. The fans are in a frenzy.
          
                                CROWD (O.S.)
                      RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...
          
                                THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.)
                      Finish it. Pin me.
          
          Randy is torn. He...
          
          GETS UP.
          
          Randy STAGGERS to the corner. His heartbeat is UNNATURAL AND
          DEAFENING.
          
          BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM...
          
          
          ON CASSIDY:
          
          Cassidy can't take any more. She turns and WALKS.
          
          
          ON RANDY:
          
          Randy plants a foot on the bottom rope. He looks toward
          Cassidy.
          
          RANDY'S POV: He catches a glimpse of Cassidy disappearing
          through the curtain into the locker room.
          
          Randy looks out on the crowd. Chanting, cheering. He starts
          to climb. Standing on the top rope, he looks again at the
          curtain. She's gone.
          
          
          HALLWAY:
          
          Cassidy exits the arena sobbing.
          
                                                                 117.
          
          
          THE RING:
          
          The Ayatollah lies on the ground in pain.
          
          
          ON RANDY:
          
          Randy raises his arms and sticks his elbows out, pressing his
          fists to the sides of his head to form a set of RAM'S HORNS.
          
                                 COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.)
                       Uh-oh, the horns are out...
          
          Randy takes a long look around the auditorium, lingering on
          the fans' faces, savoring their cheers.
          
          He SMILES.

                       Here we go...
          
          BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM...
          
          He LEAPS.
          
          FREEZE on Randy in mid-air, glorious and immortal.
          
                                                               THE END
