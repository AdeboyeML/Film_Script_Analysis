           Well, hello, Dale, Mary, Mark and

           very FREEZE TO MEET YOU!

          Cannon, which ZAPS them with KRAZY GLUE, freezing them!
                         
                          BLACK FALCON
           Exactly how I planned! BAHAHAHA!
           And it's totally permanent!
                         
                          DORIS
           You want to do this to the whole
           world?

                          DORIS
          But-- I'll never see my son again.
          No mother will ever see her son.
                         
                          BLACK FALCON
          Unless they're frozen when they
          happen to be looking at each
          other, exactly. Oh Doris, I'm so
          glad we could finally meet again,
          after all these years.

                          BLACK FALCON
          Isn't it obvious? I want you to
          make me a better Kragle-Thingy!
                         
                          DORIS
          That's really dumb.
                         
                          BLACK FALCON
          I mean this works okay, but it
          doesn't have a wide enough spray.
          I need to make like a big cloud of
          sticky mist. And it's not scary
          enough. And I hate the color.
                         
                          DORIS
          You'll never get aw-- You'll not
          achieve that which you have just
          described!
                         
                          BLACK FALCON
          What, do you think your pathetic
          son is going to save you or
          something? He can't even put two
          bricks together.

                          BLACK FALCON
          Did you? I think you protected
          him. Because you were afraid to
          have him live under the spectre of
          being found out. Of being hunted.
          You wanted him to fit in. To feel
          normal, isn't that right?
           39.
                         
                         
          Doris can't look at him. BF shows her a poster with a
          goofy image of Emmet. "Wanted: Broken or Together."
                         
                          BLACK FALCON
           Big mistake, Doris. Thanks to
           that call, he's going to get his
           butt kicked. He'll fit in,
           alright. Into a coffin!
                         
                          DORIS
           Leave him out of this!
                         
                          BLACK FALCON
           I would, but I'm pretty sure he
           has the MasterPiece. It wasn't in
           your apartment, and it's not on
           you. But your son seems to have
           interesting taste in handbags.
                         
          He grabs a LEGO MAGNIFYING GLASS from his desk and shows
          Doris the out-of-focus PURSE Emmet's holding in the
          Wanted photo.
                         
                          BLACK FALCON
           So, just to tie up all the loose
           ends, I'll have to kill him and
           take the MasterPiece so the
           prophecy will never come true.
                         
                          DORIS
           No! Don't, please! I'll do what
           you want, please don't hurt him.
                         
                          BLACK FALCON
           Oh, don't worry, dear. You'll do
           what I want regardless. I'll
           simply use my very special
           electromagnetic machine to extract
           your thoughts and steal your ideas
           like I've done for all the other
           imprisoned MasterBuilders.
                         
                          DORIS
           No!
                         
                          BLACK FALCON
           Yes. Send her to the THINK TANK!!!

          They come upon a majestic canyon with an immense LEGO
          waterfall (clear pieces tumbling down). Lucy climbs up
          the rock wall. Emmet follows.
                         
                          EMMET

           I guess not.
                         
          Two-thirds up the canyon wall is a ledge with a cave
          behind the waterfall. And a sign. "Beware of Dragon."
          Gulp.
                         
          YAPYAPYAP! DRAGON, a nasty yippy DOG startles them.

           He was clever and smart. It was
           the age of the MasterBuilders. The

           He became enraged. Instead of
           improving his work, it became
           stagnant and weak. He began to
           amass power, and hunt down
           MasterBuilders. Harvesting their
           ideas. Forcing them to write
           instructions for him. Instructions
           that he in turn forced on the
           world. The remaining
           MasterBuilders went into hiding.

           making new things came as
           naturally to everyone as
           breathing. The world was messy and
           wild, and that made it beautiful.
           But then, everything became rigid
           and prefabricated, so everyone
           just stopped thinking of new
           things. Making has been outsourced
           to Empura. The Black Falcon has
           paved over the world that was.

           Emmet.
                         
          She motions to an "IDEAS" notebook. There is nothing in
          there. There's also a picture of the BF's middle school
          class photo with Doris in it. The BF has drawn a funny
          moustache on her. Emmet smashes the picture in anger.

           Well, yeah, we can't be together.
           We can't touch or see each other.
           But in here-- and if I could, I'd
           be pointing to my head-- I'm not
           stuck. In my brain we're sharing
           a delicious meal together.

           They can freeze you. They can tell
           you what to do. But they can't
           stop our secret weapon. Ideas.

           Wait. Batman, give me your
           Batperiscope.
                         
          Emmet grabs some nearby tubes and goes to work. He's not
          a quickbuilder, he's more methodical. What's he up to?

          They smile at one another. Emmet smiles. Lucy looks at
          him. That's the guy she used to love.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - LATER
                         
          The Black Falcon stomps down the hallway. People tremble
          in his wake. A flank of baddies stops and salutes.
                         
           "THE BLACK FALCON"
           You there. Listen to me.
                         
          REVEAL it's not the The Black Falcon at all, but rather,
          Neckbeard's head on top of a black-Sharpied R2D2.

          walk NECKBEARD and the GANG, all dressed up as ninjas.
                         
          They stare up at the THINK TANK. All kinds of
          MasterBuilders hooked up to tubes. Awful. You can't
          help but be upset at the inhumanity of the whole thing.

          the crap out of the guards, who try and fail to sound an
          alarm. It's a bar brawl, and Batman really shines.
                         
          Emmet rushes up into the Think Tank and finds his MOM.
          Everything else slows down. The sounds of the fighting
          fall away. He's so glad to see her. Wouldn't you be?

          squares off with the Black Falcon. Vitruvius spins, grabs
          some pieces of the Think Tank and uses his staff to guide
          an ELECTRICAL BOLT at him. The Black Falcon deflects.

          Surrounded by laserbeams, Emmet is levitated through the
          universe. He is split into pieces - like he is becoming
          one with the fabric of the universe. He is traveling
          between the seams. Eventually rising straight towards
          the brightest star in the sky.
                         
          The closer we get, we realize that it is not a star at
          all, but a HOLE in the fabric of the universe. A hole
          just barely big enough for Emmet to fit through. Well,
          not quite big enough. He is stuck.

          representations of the city, waterfall, space cube, etc.
          Each area separated by walls - backdrops laid down by a
