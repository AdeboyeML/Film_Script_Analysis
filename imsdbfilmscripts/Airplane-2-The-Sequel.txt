          EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
          
          A machete slashes INTO FRAME.  An American in battered
          fedora and leather jacket, accompanied by two gunbearers,
          hacks his way through dense bush.  We see him from the back
          only.  He hacks an opening, bats fly out AT CAMERA and the
          bushes part, revealing huge overgrown stone letters -- the
          Mayan ruin look -- that spell "AIRPLANE II."

          The Jupiter shuttle stands ready to fly.

          A number of men in futuristic-looking mining outfits,
          carrying futuristic gear, unload a truck with a corporate
          logo that reads:  TRX DEEP SPACE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT.

          Two miners head to terminal doors and pass FOUR NUNS, who
          bid farewell to FATHER O'FLANAGAN.  O'Flanagan shakes the
          hands of the first three elderly nuns, then grabs the last
          young gorgeous nun and kisses her passionately.
          
                                  OLDER NUN

          A group tour moves through the room behind controllers.
          
                                  GUIDE
                   All lunar shuttle landings are handled by
                   these computers and simulated on these
                   video units.
          
                                  CONTROLLER 1

          INT. LUNAR SHUTTLE COCKPIT - NIGHT
          
          Three crew members watch the lit landing strip as their
          shuttle approaches.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                        (to co-pilot)
                   It's out of our hands now, gentlemen.
          
          They smile.
          
          
          INT. MISSION CONTROL
          
          The CONTROLLER moves away from his video unit.  A kid from
          the tour who has lagged behind hits a switch.  The screen
          turns into a video game with SFX.  He flips knobs.
          
          
          INT. LUNAR SHUTTLE
          
          The crew are tossed from side to side and try to regain
          control of the ship.
          
          
          EXT. NIGHT SKY
          
          The Lunar shuttle careens towards the terminal, out of
          control.
          
          
          INT. CONTROL ROOM
          
          The kid is still playing like mad.  A flash appears on the
          screen.  SFX VIDEO GAME EXPLOSION and a corresponding
          EXPLOSION from outside.  SIRENS WAIL.  CONTROLLERS run
          around.  The kid is oblivious and walks away.
          
          
          EXT. TERMINAL - NIGHT
          
          BUD KRUGER, head of the space center, and the COMMISSIONER
          get out of a limo under a sign that reads, "MERCURY
          SHUTTLE."  They walk and talk.
          
                                  KRUGER
                   Commissioner, we both know the Mercury
                   shuttle needs another month of pre-launch
                   testing.
          
                                  COMMISSIONER
                   Forget it.  The boys on the board want
                   that shuttle to go on schedule.

                                  KRUGER
                   And what do the boys on the board know
                   about safety, Commissioner?  Let me talk
                   to them.
          
                                  COMMISSIONER
                   Bud, get wise to the political realities.
                   The boys on the board are under a lot of
                   pressure from the boys downtown.

          Commissioner buys a newspaper.
          
                                  KRUGER
                   And I'll be the one they'll hang if
                   there's a screw-up.

          Kruger and Commissioner get shoes shined.  A MAN next to
          them in white shoes reads paper with headline -- "SOLAR
          PLANT MELTDOWN, 500 WORKERS SERIOUSLY TANNED" -- and doesn't
          notice his shoes are getting black polish.
          
                                  COMMISSIONER
                   Listen, Bud, the boys downtown are under
                   heavy fire from the boys in Washington.
                   That's why they're putting pressure on the
                   boys on the board.

                                  KRUGER
                   Well, you tell the boys on the board to
                   tell the boys downtown to let the boys in
                   Washington know that the press has been
                   nosing around my people in the front
                   office.

                   You handle your front office people, I'll
                   handle the press and leave the boys in
                   Washington to the boys downtown and the
                   boys downtown to the boys on the board.

          They stop and look at each other.

                   What?
          
                                  KRUGER
                   I just wish it was that simple.

                   This condition isn't as bad as it could be
                   if it were a lot worse.  Take these pills.
                        (hands him pills and water)
                   Here's some water.
          
                                  CONTROLLER
                   What is it, doctor?
          
                                  RUMACK
                   Two parts oxygen, one part hydrogen.
                   It'll make the pills go down easier.

          A JAPANESE COUPLE get out of a taxi -- the man has about
          fifty cameras around his neck.  His wife hangs another
          camera on him.  He crashes to the ground under the weight.
          
          Simon and Elaine are approached by a BUSINESSMAN with
          handful of roses.
          
                                  BUSINESSMAN
                   Would you like to buy a rose to help bail
                   out Chrysler?  We're an all-profit
                   organization and need all the money we can
                   get.
          
          Simon hands the Businessman a dollar and takes a rose.
          
                                  SIMON
                        (to Businessman)
                   Here.
          
          The Businessman joins six other BUSINESSMEN carrying signs
          with LEE IACCOCA's picture.  They all smile and chant.

                   IACCOCA, IACCOCA, IACCOCA, IARAMA.
          
          Simon hands Elaine the rose.  She takes his arm as they walk
          towards the sign that reads, "MERCURY SHUTTLE."
          
                                  SIMON
                   For the best little computer officer on
                   the Mercury mission.

                                  SIMON
                   Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was
                   once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago
                   run.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged
                   to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very
                   lucky woman.
          
          A man with a suitcase on a leash walks beside them.  The
          case pulls him along like a dog and takes a leak on a post.
          
                                  SIMON
                   Women and the space program have come a
                   long way, sweetheart.  But after the
                   wedding, no more complicated computers for
                   my little girl.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   But, darling, they've offered me a chance
                   to head up the computer analysis division
                   for the Jupiter probe.
          
                                  SIMON
                   You're heading up the division in charge
                   of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
          
          He kisses Elaine and smiles.
          
                                  SIMON
                   And that's an order, Lieutenant.
          
          The man with the case on a leash passes a woman with a case
          on a leash.  The cases start a violent, BARKING DOG FIGHT.

                                  MARGE
                        (in evening gown, a cigar stuck
                         in her mouth)
                   We've got a condition red with our
                   marriage.  I think you're in love with
                   that shuttle, not with me.  I want a
                   divorce, Sarg.
          
          Sarg lights his cigar.
          
                                  SARG
                   Is there someone else, Marge?  Is that it?
          
          Sarg throws the lit match towards the "ABSOLUTELY NO
          SMOKING" sign.  The worker grimaces but nothing happens.
          
                                  MARGE
                   Sarg, there's been someone else for
                   fifteen years.  You were just too involved
                   in your work to see it.
          
          They hang up.  Sarg bites off the end of his cigar and spits
          it in the direction of the "NO SPITTING" sign, blowing the
          worker OUT OF FRAME with a MASSIVE EXPLOSION.  Sarg hops
          into his car, takes a Lava lamp from the seat and puts it on
          the car roof -- like Kojak's flasher.  The lamp flashes, the
          SIREN WAILS, as Sarg pulls away.

          He thinks about his wife.  SPLIT SCREEN FLASHBACK OF THEIR
          BEDROOM.  Marge, a cigar in her mouth, is in bed with five
          football players -- other half-clad athletes (hockey,
          baseball, wrestling, basketball) line up for their turn at
          her.  Sarg has to climb over them to kiss her goodbye.

                   just have to be locked up with the
                   luggage.
          
          The man in the cage seems to relish the latter suggestion.
          Two Porters lift the cage onto a conveyor belt next to
          Jimmy's dog.

          whiskey.  The room is hot and dusty.  Ted lies on the bed
          soaked with sweat, a drink in his hand, a cigarette dangling
          from his lip.  He takes a drink and, forgetting to remove
          the cigarette, swallows it without batting an eye.  LOOSEN

          Simon pulls Elaine away.  They all walk and talk.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Ted, we've been worried sick ever since
                   you escaped from the Ronald Reagan
                   Institute For The Mentally Feeble.
          
          They walk faster.  The b.g. starts whipping by as if they're
          running.  Wind blows in their hair.

                   That's right, Striker.  And we're getting
                   married when we return.
          
          The b.g. moves faster.  The wind gets stronger.  They pass a
          marathon refreshment stand and are handed wet sponges and
          cups of Gatoraid.

                   gone out.
          
                                  TED
                   I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe
                   and, Kurtz, you know why.

          Simon signals the guards.  They grab Ted.  He struggles and

                   threat to this mission and his behavior
                   does absolutely nothing to promote peace
                   in the Middle East.

          Elaine collapses on Simon's shoulder, sobbing.  Simon smiles
          evilly.  The technician with the jumper cables, b.g.,
          signals the driver to start the car.  The car revs and the
          rocket fires.

                   But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a
                   good provider.  I want that at this stage
                   of the game, Ted.  He might have his
                   faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning
                   of the word fear and I need that in a man.

                   His name's David Stockman.  He's been here
                   twenty years, that's all he says.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Ted, you must remember what the doctor
                   said, the first step on the road to sanity
                   is admitting that you're sick.  Now take
                   your electro-shock and you'll be back at
                   the space center in no time.  And by the
                   way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
          
          Ted gags on his spaghetti.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I just can't go on living with a man who
                   refuses to deal with reality, Ted.  I have
                   to go now.  Believe me, it's best for all
                   concerned.
          
          Elaine leans over to kiss Ted.  He turns away.
          
                                  TED
                   No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   If that's the way you want it.
          
                                  TED
                   That's the way I want it.  Just turn the
                   radio on and go.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
          
          Elaine flips a switch by the bed thinking it's the radio.
          It's the "ELECTRO-SHOCK."  Ted goes into convulsions as she
          leaves.

          Frank Morgan kisses JANE DENNIS, his mistress.  In b.g. is a
          bookstore window with a display of yellow covered books with
          plain black titles and a sign advertising, "NO-NAME BOOKS."
          
          Visible titles include:  "DEEP BOOK," "FASCINATING BOOK,"
          "THE WORLD ACCORDING TO JOHN DOE."  A man next to the window
          reads a newspaper with headline, "SENSELESS MURDER UP 99%
          AND RISING!"
          
                                  FRANK
                   Carol's not going to give me a divorce
                   that easily, Jane.
          
                                  JANE
                   I'm worried about her, Frank.  She could
                   do something senseless, something violent.
          
                                  FRANK
                   You're the one who's not making sense,
                   Jane.  Carol's not the violent...
          
          Frank sees CAROL.
          
                                  FRANK
                   Carol!
          
          Carol whips out a gun.
          
                                  FRANK
                   No!  This is senseless!
          
          
          CAROL 
          
          FIRES.  Jane faints.  Other women nearby faint.  Two
          S.W.A.T. cops faint.  Carol bolts.  The newspaper, b.g.,
          clicks over from 99% to 120%.

          Ted pushes through crowd and passes a spherical booth with
          sign that reads, "ORGASMIC EXPERIENCES, 25¢."  MRS. GOOCH,
          an elderly woman, stops Ted next to the booth door.
          
                                  MRS. GOOCH
                   Young man, would you have change for a

                                  MRS. GOOCH
                   Thank you anyway, but I wanted it in
                   quarters.
          
          Ted keeps moving past a police line which has gone up around
          Frank Morgan's body.  We HOLD on the murder scene.  A
          DETECTIVE kneels beside the body which now has a chalk mark
          around it.
          
                                  SERGEANT

                                  DETECTIVE HALLICK
                   Senseless or not, Sergeant, there's a
                   pattern here.  This is the 12th victim
                   this week with a chalk mark around the
                   body.  I want this whole area cordoned
                   off!  I want everyone in this terminal
                   booked and beaten until they talk.  I want
                   an M.O. on everyone who has seen THE SOUND
                   OF MUSIC and I want the entire population
                   of Hawaii off that rock and into the water
                   within one hour.
          
          Hallick stands up and finds the area surrounded by 30
          accordian players playing "Lady of Spain."
          
                                  DETECTIVE HALLICK
                   Sergeant.  I said cordon off, not
                   accordian off!  Now dust this area for
                   prints.
          
          One cop pulls out a duster and dusts the wall.  Other cops
          follow after him hanging prints by Picasso, Lautrec, etc.
          
                                  DETECTIVE HALLICK
                   And run a check on their plates.
          
          A cop looks at people's upper false teeth plates.

                   When will this senseless killing end?
          
          A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER straddles the body and shoots it

                                  COMMISSIONER
                   That just doesn't make any sense.

                   I wonder how your boys in Washington are
                   going to take this one.

                                  KRUGER
                   You've made your point, Commissioner.
                   There's only one other pilot who can
                   handle that shuttle and that's Clarence
                   Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I
                   want him pulled.

                   little nervous about Oveur's record.
          
          The Commissioner throws an album on Kruger's desk.  On the
          cover is a photo of Oveur with an accordian.  The title

                   pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The
                   kids have no winter clothes...

                        (holding a finger to his lips)
                   Joey, what's more important, the kids'
                   clothes or your sexual potency.
          
                                  JOE
                        (anxiously looking around)
                   I don't want to hear that word!
          
                                  WIFE
                   Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax.
                   This hospital in Des Moines is the best
                   sex clinic in the country.
          
                                  JOE
                   All right.
                        (hands her an envelope)
                   Here.

          She kisses him.  He recoils, wipes off his mouth, and
          leaves.  She looks at the envelope, then yells at him
          through the crowd.
          
                                  WIFE
                   Joey!  Remember, sexual impotence is
                   nothing to be ashamed of!
          
          The entire terminal looks at him.

          Ted is tied to a chair surrounded by packing crates -- one
          is stamped "JIMMY HOFFA, THIS END UP" with the arrow
          pointing to the ground.  Ted struggles to free his hands.

          The actual DR. BENJAMIN SPOCK stands in front of the
          machine.  Next to the machine at the magazine rack is a red-
          bearded MAN in tweed jacket and a tartan kilt reading a
          magazine titled "GAY SCOTS."  Spock puts a coin in the
          machine and it explodes in sparks and smoke like the bridge
          panel on "STAR TREK."

          Joe Salucci snaps his attache case closed.  Wipes the sweat
          from his brow.  Takes out a "Des Moines" ticket and throws
          it away.  Looks at another ticket -- "Mercury."  Takes a
          last drag from his cigarette, throws it on the ground and
          hurries off.  The cigarette rolls under the "STORAGE ROOM"
          door.
          
          
          INT. STORAGE ROOM
          
          Ted, tied in chair, watches the cigarette roll up to some
          oil rags.  They burst into flame.  The flames lap up against
          a yellow oil drum labeled "EXPLOSIVE."  PAN to three more
          drums labeled, "DYNAMIC!", "BRILLIANT!", "A MUST SEE!".

          EDITH and DAVE WALTERS, a middle-aged couple, carry their
          hand luggage.  Edith appears very nervous.
          
                                  DAVE
                   I'm telling you, Edith, space travel is
                   safer than driving a car.
          
          The storage room door EXPLODES open in front of them.  Ted
          flies out with the debris.  Edith faints.  Ted gets up,
          brushes himself off and heads to the ticket counter just as
          the ticket agent flips a sign over that reads, "MERCURY --
          SOLD OUT."  Ted spots a SCALPER and reaches for his wallet.
          
                                  SCALPER
                   Mercury seats.  I got a pair.  I got aisle

          INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT - MORNING
          
          Computerized panels line all walls.  Windows are similar to
          an airplane -- outside carwash brushes soap down the nose.
          The "HOT WAX" sign flashes.  Two attendants wipe windows
          with soap gloves and move to the DISTANT STRAINS of "CAR
          WASH."  Elaine sits at computer, two other CREW are in their
          seats.  Simon enters with Oveur.
          
                                  SIMON
                   Gentlemen, this is Captain Oveur.  He's
                   taking over for Frank Morgan.
          
                                  MR. UNGER
                   What's the problem?
          
                                  SIMON
                   Morgan was senselessly murdered about an
                   hour ago.
          
          Elaine gasps.

                        (black, sports afro)
                   Murdered?  I hope it's not serious.
          
                                  SIMON
                   We won't know until after the autopsy.
          
                                  MR. DUNN
                   Of course.  Welcome aboard, sir.

                   Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger,
                   and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.

          The Terrorists still seem confused as to where they're
          going.  They pass through the security metal detector, guns
          raised above their heads.  A GUARD runs a hand-held metal
          detector up and down their bodies.  At the same time, Mrs.
          Gooch is being held spread-eagle against the wall.  One
          Guard holds a gun to her head, another frisks her.  Ted
          moves through behind the Terrorists.

          A young boy passes through the X-ray tunnel.  His dental
          chart appears on the screen.  A DENTIST at the other end
          stops him and looks in his mouth.

          A car wash attendant opens a side door to the cockpit and
          enters in headphones, moving to "CAR WASH," with a vacuum.
          He cleans the floor and an ashtray and finds a baseball
          behind the Captain's seat which he pockets.

          Dr. Rumack and Elaine walk across the well-groomed lawn.
          Elaine carries a box of spaghetti-to-go.  As they walk, they
          pass patients in wheelchairs pushed by nurses.  The further
          they walk, the more wheelchairs appear until the lawn is
          jammed with two hundred wheelchairs bumping into each other,
          patients falling out, total wheelchair chaos.

                                  O'BRIAN
                   You're right.  They're off course and
                   heading right for the sun.  I've seen
                   enough, Bob.
          
          Controller 2 hits a switch and the console screen flips to
          baseball game.
          
                                  O'BRIAN
                   Get me Jack McCrosky and fast!
          
                                  CONTROLLER 3
                   McCrosky?  He hasn't handled a tower in
                   twenty years.
          
                                  CONTROLLER 4
                   Ever since Reagan fired the controllers,
                   he's been completely senile and hasn't
                   done a day's work.
          
                                  O'BRIAN
                   What about McCrosky?
          
                                  CONTROLLER 3
                   Pretty much the same as Reagan.
          
                                  O'BRIAN
                   Get him.
          
          
          INT. RETIREMENT HOME
          
          Two Nurses stand by a phone in a dormitory of beds.  Many
          old men sleep or eat in bed.
          
                                  NURSE
                   It's for Mr. McCrosky.
          
                                  NURSE 2
                   Do you think we should bother him?  He's
                   been acting a bit odd lately.
          
          They look to McCrosky (Lloyd Bridges).
          
          
          ANGLE ON McCROSKY
          
          He is in bed in scuba gear.
          
          
          ANGLE ON NURSES
          
                                  NURSE 1
                   He's fine.  He just thinks he's Lloyd
                   Bridges.
          
          Nurse 1 takes the phone to McCrosky.  He is a lot older than
          in "Airplane."
          
                                  NURSE 1
                   The phone's for you, Mr. McCrosky.
          
                                  McCROSKY
                   What's a phone?
          
                                  NURSE 1
                        (holding it to his ear)
                   Here, let me help you.  I think it's the
                   space centre.  Now, let's not get too
                   excited.
          
                                  McCROSKY
                   What?
                        (pause)
                   What?
                        (pulls off his scuba mask and
                         snorkle)
                   What?
                        (gets more alert and grabs a
                         cigarette)
                   I'll be right down!
                        (he hangs up and jumps out of
                         bed)
                   Looks like I picked the wrong time to go
                   senile.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT
          
          Simon is taking another slug of booze; Elaine enters.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Simon!
                        (she spots Oveur slumped on the
                         panel)
                   Captain Oveur!
          
          Elaine pulls him up.
          
                                  OVEUR
                        (still gasping)
                   Mets... nine... Phils... three... Cubs...
                   four...
          
          Elaine drops him and turns to Simon.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Simon, what's happening?!
          
                                  SIMON
                   He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed
                   him.  That computer is running this ship
                   and we're heading right for the sun.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Can't we change course?
          
                                  SIMON
                   We're computer locked and the manual
                   navigation unit is down.
          
          Elaine looks at the floor.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Then Ted was right!

          BACK TO SCENE
          
                                  SIMON
                   My career is shot.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Your career!  What about the lives of
                   those people out there.  Simon, what
                   happened to the man I thought I loved?
          
          She goes to the door.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I've got to get Ted.  Just don't come
                   apart on me now, Simon.
          
          She leaves.  Simon's uniform starts bursting at the seams,
          buttons pop off.

          The Terrorists stop Elaine.  There's pandemonium in the
          cabin.

                   This is flight to Miami, yes?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   No.
          
          Elaine addresses the PASSENGERS.
          
                                  ELAINE

                   Please, ladies and gentlemen, please calm
                   down.  Listen to me!
          
          They calm down.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   We've been thrown off course just a tad.
          
                                  PASSENGER
                   What's that mean?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   In space terms, about 70 million miles.
          
          The Passengers appear interested and sensible, nod their
          heads.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   The bumps you feel are car-sized asteroids
                   smashing into the hull.
          
          The hood of a car smashes through the cabin wall.  The
          Passengers still appear interested and sensible.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Also, we're heading right for the sun and
                   can't seem to change course.
          
          Passengers still appear interested and sensible.  They all
          put on sunglasses.
          
                                  PASSENGER
                   Are you telling us everything?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Not exactly.  We're also out of coffee.

                   But Father, I'm not Catholic.
          
                                  O'FLANAGAN
                   Then worship the god of your choice.

                   unfaithful just once.  Remember Jill, my
                   first secretary?  Forgive me.
          
                                  MARY-JANE
                   I knew all about it.  I was unfaithful
                   once, too.

          He wears a raincoat and shirt and tie.  He is met by
          Controller 1.  They move across room.

                   First the earth cooled.  Then the
                   dinosaurs came but were too big and died
                   and everything got rotten and turned into
                   oil and the Arabs bought Mercedes Benzs
                   and then there was the best TV special on
                   Judy Garland.  Then we lost the war with
                   Albania.  Then...

          McCrosky stands in front of a huge painting of himself.
          Both he and painting are in the same pose -- one hand

          Stella approaches in nurse's uniform splattered with blood.
          A cigarette dangles from her lip.  She wipes her hands on a

                   Can I help?

                   Keep an eye on that side of the ship.
          
          The Sergeant drops into a seat next to a window, smashes out
          the glass with his rifle butt and is immediately sucked out. 
          
          MARY moves down the aisle with a cart collecting boiling
          water.

                   Joe, the insurance policy won't help your
                   wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance,
                   not life insurance.
          
                                  JOE
                   What?
          
                                  TED
                        (inching up on him)
                   That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to
                   hurt you and no one has to know what's
                   wrong with you.
          
                                  JOE
                   You're sure?
          
                                  TED
                   I'm sure.
          
          Ted is almost up to Joe when:
          
                                  JIMMY
                        (yells)
                   That's the guy from the terminal who can't
                   get it up!!
          
          Joe bolts.  Passengers panic.  Ted tackles him.  The case
          flies into the air in SLOW MOTION.  It turns slowly, hanging
          for the longest time as we CUT, still in SLOW MOTION, to
          horrified faces watching it.  This SLOW MOTION sequence
          lasts for about 60 seconds -- people put on make-up, do
          macrame, read, etc. -- while the case is still in the air.
          Suddenly, Scraps leaps high into the air in SLOW MOTION and
          comes down with the case between his teeth.

                   Do we use the bomb to blow that computer
                   or is there another way?  I want to know
                   what everyone thinks.

                   her steady.  Nose up.

                   Ted, what's going to happen to us?
          
          Ted stops and looks into the distant, dark sky.  A printed
          crawl begins:

          Ted and Elaine walk towards crawl and are approached by two
          strange CREATURES -- bald with a shock of hair sprouting
          from the top of their heads.
