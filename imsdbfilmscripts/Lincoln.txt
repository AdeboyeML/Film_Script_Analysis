          EXT. BATTLEFIELD, JENKINS' FERRY, ARKANSAS - DAY
                         
          Heavy grey skies hang over a flooded field, the water two
          feet deep. Cannons and carts, half-submerged and tilted,
          their wheels trapped in the mud below the surface, are still
          yoked to dead and dying horses and oxen.
                         
          A terrible battle is taking place; two infantry companies,
          Negro Union soldiers and white Confederate soldiers, knee-
          deep in the water, staggering because of the mud beneath,
          fight each other hand-to-hand, with rifles, bayonets,
          pistols, knives and fists. There's no discipline or strategy,
          nothing depersonalized: it's mayhem and each side intensely
          hates the other. Both have resolved to take no prisoners.

           Some of us was in the Second Kansas
           Colored. We fought the rebs at
           Jenkins' Ferry last April, just

           And we didn't leave a one of `em
           alive. The ones of us that didn't

          Lincoln reclines on a French chair, too small for his lengthy

          A working room, sparsely furnished. Lincoln's desk is heaped
          with files, books, newspapers. The desk's near a window, now
          open. Comfortable chairs and a rocker are in a corner. Near
          the fireplace, in which embers are dying, there's a long
          table, eight chairs around it, settings by each chair of
          inkwells and pens.

          TAD LINCOLN near the hearth, sleeping, sprawled on a very

          topographical and strategic survey of the no-man's land

          scrutinizes the precisely drawn blue and grey lines.
                         
          He lifts one of the glass plates and holds it to the

          black boy. There's a caption, in elegant cursive script:

          Carefully brushing the toy soldiers aside, he lies down
          beside Tad. He touches Tad's hair and kisses his forehead.
          Tad stirs as Lincoln gets on all fours; without really waking
          up, knowing the routine, Tad climbs onto his father's back.
          Tad holds on as his father stands, weary, and maybe a little
          surprised to find his growing son slightly heavier than he
          was the night before.

           Goings, 77 years old, they said she
           murdered her husband; he was 83. He
           was choking her; and, uh, she
           grabbed ahold of a stick of fire-
           26.

           No one was keen to see her
           convicted, he was that kind of
           husband. I asked the prosecuting
           attorney if I might have a short
           conference with my client. And she
           and I went into a room in the
           courthouse, but I alone emerged.
           The window in the room was found to
           be wide open. It was believed the
           old lady may have climbed out of
           it. I told the bailiff right before
           I left her in the room she asked me
           where she could get a good drink of
           water, and I told her Tennessee.
           Mrs. Goings was seen no more in
           Metamora. Enough justice had been
           done; they even forgave the

                          LINCOLN
           I decided that the Constitution
           gives me war powers, but no one
           knows just exactly what those
           powers are. Some say they don't
           exist. I don't know. I decided I
           needed them to exist to uphold my
           oath to protect the Constitution,
           which I decided meant that I could
           take the rebels' slaves from `em as
           property confiscated in war. That
           might recommend to suspicion that I
           agree with the rebs that their
           slaves are property in the first
           place. Of course I don't, never
           have, I'm glad to see any man free,
           and if calling a man property, or
           war contraband, does the trick...
           Why I caught at the opportunity.
           Now here's where it gets truly
           slippery. I use the law allowing
           for the seizure of property in a
           war knowing it applies only to the
           property of governments and
           27.
                         
                         
           citizens of belligerent nations.
           But the South ain't a nation,
           that's why I can't negotiate with
           'em. So if in fact the Negroes are
           property according to law, have I
           the right to take the rebels'
           property from `em, if I insist
           they're rebels only, and not
           citizens of a belligerent country?
           And slipperier still: I maintain it
           ain't our actual Southern states in
           rebellion, but only the rebels
           living in those states, the laws of
           which states remain in force. The
           laws of which states remain in
           force. That means, that since it's
           states' laws that determine whether
           Negroes can be sold as slaves, as
           property - the Federal government
           doesn't have a say in that, least
           not yet -
           (a glance at Seward,
                          THEN:)
           - then Negroes in those states are
           slaves, hence property, hence my
           war powers allow me to confiscate
           `em as such. So I confiscated `em.
           But if I'm a respecter of states'
           laws, how then can I legally free
           `em with my Proclamation, as I
           done, unless I'm cancelling states'
           laws? I felt the war demanded it;
           my oath demanded it; I felt right
           with myself; and I hoped it was
           legal to do it, I'm hoping still.

           But let's say the courts decide I
           had no authority to do it. They
           might well decide that. Say there's
           no amendment abolishing slavery.
           Say it's after the war, and I can
           no longer use my war powers to just
           ignore the courts' decisions, like
           I sometimes felt I had to do. Might
           those people I freed be ordered
           back into slavery? That's why I'd

          bins, muffin and pastry molds, spoons and knives, the
          detritus of the preparations for the finger food served at
          the reception, which has now transitioned into a dance and is

          hundreds of thousands of free Negro
          farmers, and at their side soldiers
          armed to occupy and transform the

           to you, I'd've declared every slave
           free the minute the first shell
           struck Fort Sumter; then the border

           confederacy, the war would've been
           lost and the Union along with it,

           to me. You claim you trust them -
           but you know what the people are.
           You know that the inner compass
           that should direct the soul toward
           justice has ossified in white men
           and women, north and south, unto
           utter uselessness through
           tolerating the evil of slavery.
           White people cannot bear the

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE ARMY HOSPITAL - MORNING
                         
          Robert, brooding, waits in the buggy.
           83.
                         
                         
          Hearing a creaking, rumbling sound, Robert turns to see TWO
          BLACK ORDERLIES in grey uniforms wrangling a large top-heavy
          wheelbarrow, covered with filthy canvas. One orderly pushes
          while the other keeps the barrow from tipping over.
                         
          Robert notices, in the barrow's wake, a trail of blood. He
          gets out of the buggy and follows as the orderlies turn a
          corner of the building.
                         
          Behind the building, where the ground is bare, pitted with
          puddles of water, Robert watches as the orderlies reach the
          edge of a shallow pit. One orderly pulls the canvas back,
          revealing severed legs, arms, hands, rotten, burnt, shattered
          by bullet or bomb.
                         
          Robert watches as they toss the remains into the pit.
          Quicklime is shoveled atop the limbs.
                         
          Robert walks away, unsteady.
                         
          Around the corner, he fumbles through his pockets for rolling
          paper and tobacco. He locates these and tries to focus on
          rolling a cigarette, his hands shaking. He tries harder to
          control his hands, his feelings, but he can't. He has a panic
          attack, crying, hiccupy shallow breathing, face flushed.
          Frustrated, he throws down the cigarette and tries to hold
          back tears.

           What's the matter, Bob?
                         
          Robert looks up, mortified, to see Lincoln watching him with
          concern. He wipes his eyes, his mouth.
                         
                          ROBERT

           your damn permission, you miserable
           old goat, I'm gonna enlist anyhow!"
           And what wouldn't those numberless
           fathers have given to be able to
           say to their sons - as I now say to
           mine - "I'm commander-in-chief, so
           in point of fact, without my
           permission, you ain't enlisting in
           nothing, nowhere, young man."

          Lincoln slaps Robert in the face. It shocks them both.
                         
          Lincoln tries to embrace Robert, but Robert shoulders past
          him and walks back toward the front of he building. He turns.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           I have to do this! And I will! Or I
           will feel ashamed of myself for the
           rest of my life. Whether or not you
           fought is what's gonna matter. And
           not just to other people, but to

           Slavery troubled me, as long as I
           can remember, in a way it never
           troubled my father, though he hated
           it. In his own fashion. He knew no
           smallholding dirt farmer could
           compete with slave plantations. He
           took us out from Kentucky to get
           away from `em. He wanted Indiana
           kept free. He wasn't a kind man,
           but there was a rough moral urge
           for fairness, for freedom in him. I
           learnt that from him, I suppose, if
           little else from him. We didn't
           care for one another, Mr. Yeaman.

          Lincoln, his stovepipe hat atop his head, is mounted on a
          horse on a rise at one end of the field. Behind him, several

          limbless, torn in two, blown out of their clothing or charred
          too badly to tell. He sees soldiers killed by rifle and
          bayonet, whose corpses are intact.
                         
          At the beginning of his ride, all the dead and wounded are in
          Union blue, the casualties of Confederate cannon fire, felled

          OFFICERS OF THE CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMY stand around in
          the afternoon sun. Everyone's solemn, even stunned by what's
          just happened. No one is speaking.

           APRIL 9, 1865
                         
          ROBERT E. LEE comes down the steps of the McLean house, as a
          CONFEDERATE OFFICER brings his horse to him. His face is
          blank. Lee mounts his waiting horse.
                         
          Lee should leave, having just surrendered to Grant inside;
          but he's immobile. Some of the officers of both sides look at
          Lee, some can't bear it. Lee tries out various expressions:
          pride, defiance, blankness.
                         
          Grant stomps onto the porch of the house, followed by his
          staff. Among them is Robert Lincoln.
           121.
                         
                         
          Grant, lost in thought, stops, taken aback, realizing that
          Lee's still there, astride his horse. Everyone looks at the
          two men who look awkwardly at one another.
                         
          Then Grant removes his famous slouch hat. Everyone freezes
          for a moment, and then one by one, the officers of the Union
          Army remove their hats.
                         
          Lee is visibly moved by this gesture of respect. He raises
          his hat, briefly, only an inch from his head. Then, pulling
          slightly on his horse's reins, he rides away.

          Lincoln laughs, takes her hand. She leans against him.

          Lincoln's in the shirtsleeves and vest of his formal evening
          wear, his hair brushed down and plastered in place. William
          Slade is working the tie and gloves. James Ashley and
          Schuyler Colfax stand with him, holding glasses of scotch
          whiskey. Slade waits with Lincoln's coat, clothes brush, the
          stovepipe hat and gloves on the table.
                         
          John Hay tears down several of the military maps, heavily
          marked, from the bookcases where they're tacked. He drops
          these on the floor. As they watch Hay:

          On the way out, Lincoln tosses the gloves on a side table.
          Slade grabs them, considers chasing after Lincoln, then
          thinks better of it. He walks back towards the office. Then
          some strange feeling stops him, and he turns around again.
          Lincoln is walking away, past the petitioners' chairs, down
          the empty hallway.

          then plunges his scimitar into the afrit's heart. The demon
          screams and topples to the ground. The audience gasps as a

          joining in, as is his companion for the evening, Tom Pendel.
                         
          Onstage, the bird flies off, the young man is freeing the
          young woman, when the scene is halted by the red curtain
          lowering, surprising actors and audience. The music dies,
          the gas lights in the house are being raised as the owner of
          the theater, LEONARD GROVER, steps out before the curtain and
          walks to the center of the stage, pale and badly shaken.
                         
          In the box, Tom Pendel glances quickly at Tad, who's fixed on
          the stage, eyes open, alarmed.
                         
          The audience knows something's wrong. Their rising murmur of

          Tom Pendel is frozen in shock, then turns to draw Tad close
          to him. Tad pulls away and begins shrieking, clinging to the
