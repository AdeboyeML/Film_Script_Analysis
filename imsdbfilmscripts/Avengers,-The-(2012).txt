           The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a
           little world. A human world. They would
           wield its power,...

          THE OTHER faces a HORNED SHAPED SHADOW. LOKI. Loki is handed the
          CHITAURI SCEPTER, a long golden handle, fitted with a blue gem
          encircled with silver blades.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)

          Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a
          state of panic. It's an evacuation. A SWOOPING helicopter flies
          in.

          CHAOS. Men in suits run around like in the typical `we have to
          leave' fashion. Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating
          the hell out of there. A VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers.

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD ­ CONTINUOUS

          Standing a few yards from the landing pad, A Fed in a suit with
          badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands. This is

          SHIELD AGENT PHIL COULSON.

          Walking out of the helicopter is SHIELD AGENT MARIA HILL, SEXY,
          FIERCE AND DETERMINED. Following her, SHIELD DIRECTOR NICK FURY
          climbs out. Hill and Fury approach Agent Coulson.

                          NICK FURY
           How bad is it?

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON
           That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR ­ NIGHT

          Agent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section
          of the facility. Hundreds of technicians and other staff run
          around, taking only the essentials.

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from
           the Tesseract four hours ago.

                          NICK FURY
           NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test
           phase.

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in
           the room. Spontaneous advancement.

                        AGENT MARIA HILL
           It just turned itself on?

                          NICK FURY
           What are the energy levels now?

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it
           down, we ordered the evac.

                          NICK FURY
           How long to get everyone out?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Campus should be clear in the next half
           hour.

                          NICK FURY
           Do better.

          CONTINUOUSLY HEADING DOWN TO RADIATION FACILITY FLOOR

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, evacuation may be futile.

                          NICK FURY
           We should tell them to go back to
           sleep?

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           If we can't control the Tesseract's
           energy, there may not be a minimum safe
           distance.

                          NICK FURY
           I need you to make sure that PHASE 2
           prototypes are shipped out.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, is that really a priority right
           now?

                          NICK FURY
           Until such time as the world ends, we
           will act as though it intends to spin
           on. Clear out the tech below. Every
           piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL
           Yes, sir.
           (to standing agents)
           With me.

          INT. NASA SPACE RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER ­ CONTINUOUS

          Fury enters the lab facility where the Tesseract is being held
          by a COMPACT MUON SOLENOID COIL CHAMBER.

                          NICK FURY
           Talk to me, doctor.
          DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned.
          The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings
          shoot out at random.

                          SELVIG
           Director.

                          NICK FURY
           Is there anything we know for certain?

                          SELVIG
           Tesseract is misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY
           Is that supposed to be funny?

                          SELVIG
           No, it's not funny at all. The
           Tesseract is not only active,
           she's...misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY
           How soon until you pull the plug?

                          SELVIG
           She's an energy source. If we turn off
           the power, she turns it back on. If she
           reaches peak level...

                          NICK FURY
           We've prepared for this, doctor.
           Harnessing energy from space.

                          SELVIG
           We don't have the harness. Our
           calculations are far from complete. Now
           she's throwing off interference,
           radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels
           of gamma radiation.

                          NICK FURY
           That can be harmful. Where's Barton?

                          SELVIG
           The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.
          We see CLINT BARTON, dressed in black tactical gear, is up on
          the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his
          earpiece.

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Barton, report.
          BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They
          both walk around the facility in a discreet manner.

                          NICK FURY
           I gave you this detail so you could
           keep a close eye on things.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Well, I see better from a distance.

                          NICK FURY
           Are you seeing anything that might set
           this thing off?

                          NASA SCIENTIST

                          (TO SELVIG)
           Doctor, it's spiking again.

                          CLINT BARTON
           No one's come or gone. It's oven is
           clean. No contacts, no I.M.'s. If there
           was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at
           this end.

                          NICK FURY
           At this end?

                          CLINT BARTON
           Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the
           other end of space, right? The doors
           open from both sides.
          DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the
          monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract
          THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both
          Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends
          of the facility.
          The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and
          louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy
          builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS
          at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The
          great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then
          forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.
          A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of
          SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars
          appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding
          everyone.
          The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the
          top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally
          quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.
          SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is
          kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.
          Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile
          dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and
          Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.

                          NICK FURY
           Sir, please put down the spear!
          Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury
          and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT
          TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss
          Loki's fired shot.
          ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the
          bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the
          platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.
          In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his
          KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to
          see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost
          gone to shit.
          Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton
          raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.

                          LOKI
           You have heart.
          Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's
          eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind
          is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands
          straight.
          As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of
          several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,
          placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...

                          LOKI
           Please don't. I still need that.

                          NICK FURY

                          (TURNING)
           This doesn't have to get any messier.

                          LOKI
           Of course it does. I've come too far
           for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard,
           and I am burdened with glorious
           purpose.

                          SELVIG
           Loki? Brother of Thor?

                          NICK FURY
           We have no quarrel with your people.

                          LOKI
           An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

                          NICK FURY
           You planning to step on us?

                          LOKI
           I come with glad tidings, of a world
           made free.

                          NICK FURY
           Free from what?

                          LOKI
           Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.
           Once you accept that, in your heart...
          Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's
          standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart.
          Selvig's eyes glow BLACK.

                          LOKI
           You will know peace.

                          NICK FURY
           Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think
           you mean the other thing.
          From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud
          RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This
           place is about to blow. Drop a hundred
           feet of rock on us. He means to bury
           us.

                          NICK FURY
           Like The Pharaohs of Odin.

                          SELVIG
           He's right. The portal is collapsing in
           on itself. You got maybe two minutes
           before this goes critical.

                          LOKI
           Well, then...
          Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY
          WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the
          Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other
          S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER, ENTRANCE OF EXITING TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in
          the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain
          weapons. Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki.

                          CLINT BARTON
           (pointing to the Loki team)

           Who's that?

                          CLINT BARTON
           He didn't tell me.
          Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck
          and turns to leave, as she's walking away...

                          NICK FURY
           (through the walkie talkie)
           Hill, do you copy?!
          Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill.

          BACK AT THE LAB
          Fury is sitting up, pulling out the bullet, breathing heavily.

                          NICK FURY
           Barton is...

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER ­ NIGHT

          Suddenly, Hill turns to SHOOT AT BARTON, but Barton is already
          POINTING HIS GUN at her and starts SHOOTING, he moves the
          driver's seat of the truck and DRIVES OFF as Hill keeps
          shooting.

          BACK AT THE LAB
          Fury is holding his side, running.

                          NICK FURY
           He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
          The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the
          vacuum chamber ceiling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER/TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Agent Hill SLIPS into a JEEP and follows after Barton's
          truck.Loki's trucks SCREECH across the tunnel. Several SHIELD
          trucks pull up to them. A drive-by shooting ensues.
          Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his
          scepter and EMITS energy blasts, flipping over SHIELD trucks.
          They get in, the cars roar out after them. Agent Hill puts
          herself at a distance.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR ­ NIGHT

          Fury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes. The
          entire facility is now in a full earthquake.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR, ELSEWHERE ­ CONTINUOUS

          Agent Coulson and several SHIELD agents fall down the steps,
          dropping SILVER CASES of information. They attempt to grab them,
          but...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No! Leave it!
          They run out of there like a bat from hell.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Agent Hill's JEEP ROARS out of a side of Barton's truck and
          pulls up alongside them on the left. She goes way ahead and
          pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and
          driving in reverse.
          Barton's ARMS reach out the open window and OPENS FIRE. Agent
          Hill figures `fuck it' and SHOOTS her windshield OPENING FIRE on
          Barton.

          EXT. VAN ­ NIGHT

          Agent Coulson jumps into a SHIELD VAN. On his walkie:

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're clear, sir! You need to go!

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD ­ CONTINUOUS

          Fury BOLTS out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter. The
          surface of the pad gives way, PLUNGING the helicopter through
          the surface. But Fury's chopper BARELY makes it out.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Still in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the
          pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and
          put her back behind.

          INT. RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER ­ NIGHT

          The Tesseract's energy cloud now SHRINKS into a SMALL BALL OF
          WHITE LIGHT. Then...

          A CLOUD OF BLUE LIGHT CONSUMES THE ENTIRE FACILITY AND PARTS OF
          THE DESERT. Fury watches from below, a RAPID build-up into what
          may be an implosion. Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van
          feels a JOLT of the Tesseract's BLASTWAVE. THE ENTIRE FACILITY

          SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF-- A TERRIFYING, UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          The BLASTWAVE of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it.
          Like an ocean wave, blinding crumbles of falling rock, fall onto
          Agent Hill's JEEP, leaving her NEARLY trapped under this blanket
          of rock.
          On the Barton's truck, they escape the tunnel and drive into the
          desert landscape. Fury's helicopter ROARS over Barton's truck.
          Loki looks up.
          From the chopper's door, it slides open and Fury stands there,
          holding a gun, SHOOTING at Barton's, giving an honoring image of

          JULES WINNFIELD.
          Loki looks at Fury and in a fit of RAGE, points his scepter
          SHOOTS OUT THE BLUE LIGHT. The chopper CATCHES on fire, GOING
          DOWN in a FIERY BALL. Fury, like the boss he is, JUMPS OUT and
          touches down onto the desert floor. The chopper BARRELS along
          the ground.
          Fury, coming back to his senses, FIRES at Loki, but they're
          toofar and too late. Loki looks back, smiling. Fury stands
          there, MIND REELING. Then...

          Fury stands there. Thinking. He looks up. On his face is sign of
          hope.

                         THE AVENGERS

          EXT. RUSSIA, SOLENSKI PLAZA, 3RD FLOOR ­ NIGHT

          Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction
          building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN
          GENERAL along with his THUGS.
          TALL THUG is in the middle of a brutal beating on NATASHA
          ROMANOFF, a SLEWING, FOXY, UNBELIEVABLY SEXY SPY. He BACKHANDS
          NATASHA'S face. She feels the pain, but does not breakdown.
          LUCHKOV, smiling, walks up to her. Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.

                          LUCHKOV
           This is not how I wanted the evening to
           go.

                          NATASHA
           I know how you wanted this evening to
           go. Believe me, this is better.

                          LUCHKOV
           I'd like to know why they sent you to
           carry out a carrier, a stained glass
           and other random items.
          TALL THUG rocks her chair back, balancing her off the edge of an
          open floor. Natasha is now scared.

                          NATASHA
           I thought General Soholob was in charge
           of the export business.

                          LUCHKOV
           Soholob? Your reputation is quite a
           progression. THE FAMOUS BLACK WIDOW.
           Nothing but a pretty face.

                          NATASHA
           You really think I'm pretty?
          LUCHKOV slowly walks over to a table filled with tools. He picks
          up a pair of pliers. TALL THUG opens up her mouth wide open.

                          LUCHKOV
           We do not need the Lermontov to
           transfer the tanks. Tell him, well,...

                          (IN ENGLISH)
           You may have to write it down.
          Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings. Confused, he answers.

                          WEASELLY THUG
           Ya?
           (looks at LUCHKOV)
           It's for you.
          LUCHKOV takes the phone, pissed.

                          LUCHKOV
           Who the hell is...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor.
           We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put
           the woman on the phone or I will blow
           up the block before you can make the
           lobby.
          HOLY SHIT. LUCHKOV places the cell phone against Natasha's ear
          seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her
          back.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We need you to come in.

                          NATASHA
           Are you kidding? I'm working!

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This takes precedence.

                          NATASHA
           I'm in the middle of an interrogation
           and this moron is giving me everything.

                          LUCHKOV
           I don't give everything.
          Natasha gives him a look.

                          NATASHA
           Look, you can't pull me out of this
           right now.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Natasha. Barton's been compromised.
          A beat.

                          NATASHA
           Let me put you on hold.
          She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her,
          Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider,
          she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by
          KICKBOXING him in the face.
          Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him.
          She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then

          KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH HER HEAD.
          Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line. She
          then FLIPS over and FALLS down hard on WEASELLY THUG, BREAKING
          THE CHAIR. She sees TALL THUG stand.
          Giving her momentum, she runs at him DROP KICKING him, FALLS
          DOWN and FLIPS right back up and WRAPS HER LEGS AROUND HIS NECK

          AND KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD.
          She grabs LUCHKOV, wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and
          drops him down the open floor, dangling. She picks up the phone
          and her heels, like a boss.

                          NATASHA
           Where's Barton now?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We don't know.

           But he's alive.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We think so. I'll brief you on
           everything when you get back. But
           first, we need you to talk to the big
           guy.

                          NATASHA
           Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
           about as far as he can throw me.

           No, I've got Stark. You get the big

          INT. SHACK ­ NIGHT

          A tiny shack. The LITTLE GIRL runs up the steps, only to be
          stopped by an attending woman. Then, the LITTLE GIRL spots him.
          BRUCE BANNER, their LOCAL doctor.

                          ATTENDING WOMAN
           What are doing here?! Get out! You
           shouldn't be here!

                          LITTLE GIRL
           My father...
          Banner looks behind him seeing how the girl is staring at a few
          people, lying down, looking very sick.

                          BANNER
           Is he like them?
          The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world.

           Please.

          EXT. SLUMS ­ CONTINUOUS

          Banner and the LITTLE GIRL hastily run nearly to the edge of
          town. The LITTLE GIRL gets ahead of herself. Banner spots local
          government car, he turns around, blocking any view of him.

          EXT/INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK ­ NIGHT

          Banner quickly follows the LITTLE GIRL inside her house. As he
          walks in, the LITTLE GIRL ESCAPES THROUGH THE WINDOW. Banner is
          left standing there like a dumbass.

                          BANNER
           Should have got paid up front, Banner.
          Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns
          around, quietly.

                          NATASHA
           You know, for a man who's supposed to
           be avoiding stress, you picked a hell
           of a place to settle.

                          BANNER
           Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

                          NATASHA
           Then, what is it? Yoga?

                          BANNER
           You brought me to the edge of the city,
           smart. I uh... assume the whole place
           is surrounded?

           Because that's not gonna work out for
           everyone.

                          NATASHA
           No. No. Of course not. I'm here on
           behalf of SHIELD.

                          BANNER
           SHIELD. How did they find me?

                          NATASHA
           We never lost you, doctor. We've kept
           our distance, even helped keep some
           other interested parties off your
           scent.

           Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I
           need you to come in.

           I'll persuade you.

                          BANNER
           And what if the... other guy says no?

                          NATASHA
           You've been more than a year without an
           incident. I don't think you wanna break
           that streak.

                          BANNER
           I don't always get what I want.

                          NATASHA
           Doctor, we're facing a potential global
           catastrophe.

                          BANNER
           Well, those I actively try to avoid.

                          NATASHA
           This is the Tesseract. It has the
           potential energy to wipe out the
           planet.
          She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner
          takes a closer look.

                          BANNER
           What does Fury want me to do? Swallow
           it?

                          NATASHA
           Well, he wants you to find it. It's
           been taken. It emits a gamma signature
           that's too weak for us to trace.
           There's no one that knows gamma
           radiation like you do. If there was,
           that's where I'd be.

                          BANNER
           So Fury isn't after the monster?

                          NATASHA
           Not that he's told me.

                          BANNER
           And he tells you everything?

                          NATASHA
           Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.

                          BANNER
           He needs me in a cage?

                          NATASHA
           No one's gonna put you in a...

                          BANNER

           STOP LYING TO ME!
          The THUNDEROUS TONE in is voice makes Natasha QUICKLY grab her
          gun and point it at him, but something is now OFF in the
          atmosphere. Banner stands straight up, smiling.

                          BANNER
           I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted
           to see what you'd do. Why don't we do
           this the easy way, where you don't use
           that, and the other guy doesn't make a
           mess? Okay? Natasha...
          Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun
          and speaks into her earpiece.

                          NATASHA
           Stand down. We're good here.

          Natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM ­ NIGHT

          Fury is facing several LARGE MONITORS as he as a conference with
          members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           This is out of line, Director. You're
           dealing with forces you can't control.

                          NICK FURY
           You ever been in a war, Councilman? In
           a firefight? Did you feel an
           overabundance of control?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           You saying that this Asgard has
           declared war on our planet?

                          NICK FURY
           Not Asgard. Loki.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           He can't be working alone. What about
           the other one? His brother.

                          NICK FURY
           Our intelligence says, Thor is not a
           hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't
           depend on him to help. It's up to us.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Which is why you should be focusing on
           phase 2, it was designed for exactly...

                          NICK FURY
           PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We
           need a response team.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

                          NICK FURY
           This isn't about The Avengers.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           We're running the world's greatest
           covert security network and you're
           gonna leave the fate of human race to a
           handful of freaks.

                          NICK FURY
           I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We
           need a response team. These people
           maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I
           believe with the right push they can be
           exactly what we need.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           You believe?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

                          NICK FURY
           No, it's won by soldiers.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Somewhere in an old, almost WWII-esque boxing gym, STEVE ROGERS,
          a man out of time, THE FIRST AVENGER, FUCKIN' CAPTAIN AMERICA is
          PUMMELING a punching bag. With every swing, it's like a memory
          he's trying to fight off and repress.

          EXT. HYDRA BASE ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Captain America is running through the forest, dodging mortars,
          gunfire and the Tesseract's energy firearms.

           STEVE (V.O.)
           There's not enough time! I gotta put
           her in the water!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve's rage keeps building as he punches the bag. It gets
          harder...

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Steve places his COMPASS with an image of PEGGY CARTER. The time
          is here for him to crash the plane.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve closes his eyes. Goes at the bag harder.

           PEGGY (V.O.)
           You won't be alone.

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The RED SKULL picks up the TESSERACT.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve opens his eyes and fuckin' tears the bag as the last
          memory kicks in. I don't think he can physically stop...

           SHIELD SCIENTIST (V.O.)
           Oh my god!

          INT. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S, ANTARCTICA ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          A half frozen Steve Roger is lying down on a medical slab. Two
          SHIELD SCIENTISTS run over hi-tech devices to see if his vitals
          are up. And it seems...

                          SHIELD SCIENTIST
           This guy is still alive!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve FUCKING tears the bag open, off its chain, spilling out
          the sand. He stands, breathing hard, letting out 70 years of
          over repressed feeling.
          After taking a few breathers, Steve picks up another punching
          bag, which is laying next another DOZEN BAGS. He hooks the bag
          up and starts punching again. Fury walks in.

                          NICK FURY
           Trouble sleeping?

                          STEVE
           I slept for seventy years, sir. I think
           I've had my fill.

                          NICK FURY
           Then you should be out, celebrating,
           seeing the world.
          Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the
          tape off his hands. He sits down.

                          STEVE
           I went under, the world was at war, I
           wake up, they say we won. They didn't
           say what we lost.

                          NICK FURY
           We've made some mistakes along the way.
           Some very recently.

                          STEVE
           You here with a mission, sir?

                          NICK FURY
           I am.

                          STEVE
           Trying to get me back in the world?

                          NICK FURY
           Trying to save it.
          Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files
          on HYDRA'S projects.

                          STEVE
           Hydra's secret weapon.

                          NICK FURY
           Howard Stark fished that out of the
           ocean when he was looking for you. He
           thought what we think, the Tesseract
           could be the key to unlimited
           sustainable energy. That's something
           the world sorely needs.

                          STEVE
           Who took it from you?

                          NICK FURY
           He's called Loki. He's not from around
           here. There's a lot we'll have to bring
           you up to speed on if you're in. The
           world has gotten even stranger than you
           already know.

                          STEVE
           At this point, I doubt anything would
           surprise me.

                          NICK FURY
           Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a
           debriefing package waiting for you back
           at your apartment.
          Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of
          the gym.

                          NICK FURY
           Is there anything you can tell us about
           the Tesseract that we ought to know
           now?

                          STEVE
           You should have left it in the ocean.

          INT. OCEAN ­ NIGHT

          Out in the Atlantic Ocean, TONY STARK, in his IRON MAN suit, is
          cutting a PIPELINE TRANSPORT with a laser cutter coming from his
          hand. He then places a STARK ENERGY REACTOR. It lights up. IRON
          MAN rockets out of the water and flies towards STARK TOWER.

                          TONY
           You're good on this end. The rest is up
           to you.

                          PEPPER POTTS
           (on the other line)
           You disconnected the transition lines?
           Are we off the grid?

          INSIDE THE SUIT -- PEPPER APPEARS ON HIS HUD MONITOR.

                          TONY
           Stark Tower is about to become a beacon
           of self-sustaining clean energy.

                          PEPPER
           Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over
           and it actually works?

                          TONY
           I assume. Light her up.
          As IRON MAN flies to the STARK TOWER BUILDING, the power is
          switched on and the STARK sign LIGHTS UP.

                          PEPPER
           How does it look?

                          TONY
           Like Christmas, but with more... me.

                          PEPPER
           Gotta go wider on the public awareness
           campaign. You need to do some press. I
           can do some more tomorrow. I'm working
           on the zoning for the next billboards.

                          TONY
           Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?
           Enjoy the moment.

                          PEPPER
           Then get in here and I will.
          TONY arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process
          of taking off his IRON MAN suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of
          gadgets.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the
           line.

                          TONY
           I'm not in. I'm actually out.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

                          TONY
           Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.

          INT. TONY'S PENTHOUSE ­ NIGHT

          PEPPER POTTS stares up at the monitors of the reactor device.

                          PEPPER
           Levels are holding steady... I think.

                          TONY
           Of course they are, I was directly
           involved. Which brings me to my next
           question: how does it feel to be a
           genius?

                          PEPPER
           Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now,
           would I?

                          TONY
           What do you mean? All this came from
           you.

                          PEPPER
           No. All this came from that.
          Points to the energy in his chest plate.

                          TONY
           Give yourself some credit, please.
           Stark Tower is your baby. Give
           yourself... twelve percent of the
           credit.

                          PEPPER
           Twelve percent?

                          TONY
           An argument can be made for fifteen.

                          PEPPER
           Twelve percent? For my baby?

                          TONY
           Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.
           Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
           And sorry, but the security snafu? That
           was on you.

                          PEPPER
           Oooooh.

                          TONY
           My private elevator...

                          PEPPER
           You mean OUR elevator?

                          TONY
           ...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm
           going to pay for that comment about
           percentages in some subtle way later,
           aren't I?
          Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne.

                          PEPPER
           Not gonna be that subtle.

                          TONY
           I'll tell you what. Next building's
           gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.

                          PEPPER
           On the lease.

                          TONY
           ...Call your mom, can you bunk over?

                          JARVIS
           Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my
           protocols are being overwritten.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up
           his phone and looks into it at Coulson.

                          TONY
           You have reached the life model decoy
           of Tony Stark, please leave a message.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This is urgent.

                          TONY
           Then leave it urgently.
          At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears.

                          TONY
           Security breach.

                          (TO PEPPER)
           That's on you.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Mr. Stark.

                          PEPPER
           Phil! Come in.

                          TONY
           Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.

                          PEPPER
           Come on in, we're celebrating.

                          TONY
           Which is why he can't stay.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We need you to look this over.
           (he holds out a file towards

                          STARK)
           Soon as possible.

                          TONY
           I don't like being handed things.

                          PEPPER
           That's alright, `cause I love to be
           handed things. So, let's trade.
          She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file
          from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and
          passes the file over to Stark.

                          PEPPER
           Thank you.

                          TONY
           Official consulting hours are between
           eight and five every other Thursday.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This isn't a consultation.

                          PEPPER
           Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I
           know nothing about.

                          TONY
           The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I
           thought. And I didn't even qualify.

                          PEPPER
           I didn't know that either.

                          TONY
           Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-
           obsessed, don't play well with others.

                          PEPPER
           That I did know.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This isn't about personality profiles
           anymore.

                          TONY
           Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?
          Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own
          databases.

                          TONY
           You know, I thought we were having a
           moment.

                          PEPPER
           I was having twelve percent of a
           moment. This seems serious, Phil's
           pretty shaken.

                          TONY
           How did you notice? Why is he Phil?

                          PEPPER
           What is all of this?

                          TONY
           This is, uh...
          Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in
          holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and
          Pepper.

           This.
          Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS

          HE ATTACKS THE ARMY AT CULVER UNIVERSITY, THOR FIGHTING THE
          DESTROYER and another is of Loki and the Tesseract, to which
          Stark and Pepper look on in awe.

                          PEPPER
           I'm going to take the jet to D.C.
           tonight.

                          TONY
           Tomorrow.

                          PEPPER
           You've got homework. You've got a lot
           of homework.

                          TONY
           Well, what if I didn't?

                          PEPPER
           If you didn't?

                          TONY
           Yeah.

                          PEPPER
           You mean if you finished?
           (Stark nods his head)
           Well, um...then...
          She whispers something in his ear. Tony GASPS. Coulson looks
          away in embarrassment.

                          TONY
           Square deal. It's the last date.
          Pepper kisses him.

                          PEPPER
           Work hard.
          As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in
          holograph form, worried.

          INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          Inside the QUINJET, Steve is sitting down, holding a TABLET,
          watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver
          University.

                          PILOT
           We're about forty minutes out from
           base, sir.
          Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.

                          STEVE
           So, this Doctor Banner was trying to
           replicate the serum that was used on
           me?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           A lot of people were. You were the
           world's first superhero. Banner thought
           gamma radiation might hold the key to
           unlocking Erskine's original formula.
          The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart.

                          STEVE
           Didn't really go his way, did it?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Not so much. When he's not that thing
           though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.
          Steve looks confused.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He's like a smart person. I gotta say,
           it's an honor to meet you, officially.
          Steve smiles at Coulson.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I sort of met you, I mean, I watched
           you while you were sleeping.
          Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to
          the side with Coulson following.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I mean, I was... I was present while
           you were unconscious from the ice. You
           know, it's really, it's just a... just
           a huge honor to have you on board.

                          STEVE
           Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've
           made some modifications to the uniform.
           I had a little design input.

                          STEVE
           The uniform? Aren't the stars and
           stripes a little... old fashioned?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           With everything that's happening, the
           things that are about to come to light,
           people might just need a little old
           fashioned.
          Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB ­ DAY

          Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing
          to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down,
          watching Selvig work with a CMS device. Loki meditates, until...

          EXT. THRONE ROOM ­ NIGHT

          ...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of THE
          OTHER, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. THE OTHER
          appears from the steps.

                          THE OTHER
           The Chitauri grow restless.

                          LOKI
           Let them go at themselves. I will lead
           them into glorious battle.

                          THE OTHER
           Battle? Against the meager might of
           Earth?

                          LOKI
           Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is
           as formidable as you claim.

                          THE OTHER
           You question us? You question HIM? He,
           who put the scepter in your hand, who
           gave you ancient knowledge and new
           purpose when you were cast out,
           defeated?

                          LOKI
           I was a king! The rightful king of
           Asgard! Betrayed!

                          THE OTHER
           Your ambition is little, born of
           childish need. We look beyond the Earth
           to greater worlds the Tesseract will
           unveil.

                          LOKI
           You don't have the Tesseract yet.
          THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his
          scepter.

                          LOKI
           I don't threaten, but until I open the
           doors, until your force is mine to
           command, you are but words.

                          THE OTHER
           You will have your war, Asgardian. If
           you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from
           us, there will be no realm, no barren
           moon, no crevice where he can't find
           you. You think you know pain? He will
           make you long for something as sweet as
           pain.
          THE OTHER places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back
          to Earth. Loki looks around, menacing.

          EXT. HELICARRIER LANDING STRIP ­ DAY

          The QUINJET lands down a MASSIVE BATTLESHIP known as the
          HELICARRIER. It has two runways. One with direct access to a
          hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel.
          Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with
          Natasha.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Agent Romanoff. Captain Rogers.

                          STEVE
           Ma'am?

                          NATASHA
           Hi.

                          (TO COULSON)
           They need you on the bridge. Face time.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           See you there.
          Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking
          towards the railing of the ship.

                          NATASHA
           There was quite the buzz around here,
           finding you in the ice. I thought
           Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you
           to sign his Captain America trading
           cards yet?

                          STEVE
           Trading cards?

                          NATASHA
           They're vintage, he's very proud.
          Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he
          isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in
          hisway.

                          STEVE
           Dr. Banner.
          Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.

                          BANNER
           Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be
           coming.

                          STEVE
           Word is you can find the cube.

                          BANNER
           Is that the only word on me?

                          STEVE
           Only word I care about.

                          BANNER
           (takes in the sentiment)
           Must be strange for you, all of this.

                          STEVE
           Well, this is actually kind of
           familiar.

                          NATASHA
           Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in
           a minute. It's gonna get a little hard
           to breath.
          Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly
          "sail."

                          STEVE
           Is this is a submarine?

                          BANNER
           Really? They wanted me in a submerged
           pressurized metal container?
          They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE

          LIFT FANS MOUNTED ON THE SIDES STARTS TO LIFT INTO THE AIR IN
          VTOL FLIGHT. Steve watches in AWE as Banner smiles.

                          BANNER

           OH, NO. THIS IS MUCH WORSE.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP ­ a flurry of
          activity ­ dozens of agents sit in front of their VIEWSCREENS.
          Agent Hill shouts her instructs to leave. Turns to NICK FURY,
          who is at the command chair.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           We're at lock, sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Good. Let's vanish.

          EXT. SKY

          The HELICARRIER rises high into the heavens. Suddenly, the
          entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then
          camouflages in the sky.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ CONTINUOUS

          Steve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge,
          taking his position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE.

                          NICK FURY
           Gentlemen.
          Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement
          about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and
          extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.

                          NICK FURY
           Doctor, thank you for coming.

                          BANNER
           Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how
           long am I staying?

                          NICK FURY
           Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,
           you're in the clear.

                          BANNER
           Where are you with that?
          Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha
          Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We're sweeping every wirelessly
           accessible camera on the planet.
           Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected
           to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for
           us.

                          NATASHA
           That's still not gonna find them in
           time.

                          BANNER
           You have to narrow the field. How many
           spectrometers do you have access to?

                          NICK FURY
           How many are there?

                          BANNER
           Call every lab you know, tell them to
           put the spectrometers on the roof and
           calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll
           rough out a tracking algorithm based on
           cluster recognition. At least we could
           rule out a few places. Do you have
           somewhere for me to work?

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Romanoff, would you show
           Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please.
          Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall.

                          NATASHA
           You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all
           the toys.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB, VACUUM ROOM ­ DAY

          Selvig and several scientists work around the CMS device.
          Bartonwalks in, holding a tablet.

                          SELVIG
           Put it over there!

                          (TO BARTON)
           Where did you find all these people?

           SHIELD has not shortage of enemies,
           Doctor.
          He holds up a screen showing information on IRIDIUM.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Is this the stuff you need?

                          SELVIG
           Yeah, iridium. It's found in
           meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's
           very hard to get hold of.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.

           Well, I didn't know!
           (sees Loki coming)
           Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so
           much. It's more than just knowledge,
           it's... truth.

                          LOKI
           I know. What did it show you, Agent
           Barton?

           Tell me what you need.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I'll need a distraction.

           And an eyeball.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ NIGHT

          As they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial
          recognition, Coulson and Steve stand side by side, waiting.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

                          STEVE
           No, no. It's fine.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's a vintage set. It took me a couple
           of years to collect them all. Near
           mint, slight foxing around the edges,
           but...

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL
           We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent
           match. Weight, cross match, seventy-
           nine percent.

           Location?

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL
           Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse.
           He's not exactly hiding.

          Loki standing in front of the museum, dressed in 21st century
          attire and with the scepter, disguised as a cane, walks up to
          the entrance of the gala.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA ­ NIGHT

          Inside, a lavished gala with an orchestra playing, is
          interrupted as the HEAD DOCTOR walks up to the mic.

          INT. HELICARRIER, STEVE'S LOCKER ­ NIGHT

          Steve walks into his own locker room. As he approaches to the
          steel cabinet, the doors already reveal the updated CAPTAIN
          AMERICA UNIFORM, along with the famous SHIELD. He stands in
          silence.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM ­ NIGHT

          Outside the museum, GERMAN GUARDS stand in their positions. One
          of them is standing on top of the roof, scoping. He then hears a

          THWACK!
          He looks down. One of his guards is shot with an ARROW. He
          raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton
          and his CREW arrive at the doors of the locked science building.
          Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye
          scanner instrument.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA ­ NIGHT

          Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the
          HEAD DOCTOR is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he FLIPS
          his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out
          his gun, but Loki CLUBS his head in. CHAOS ERUPTS.
          Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and
          flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures
          BILCHSTEIM. Loki pulls out an OPTICAL TORTURE DEVICE. He PLUNGES
          down the doctor's eye. The doctor TWISTS in pain.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM ­ NIGHT

          Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the
          head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on
          screen.
          The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a
          cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium.

          EXT. STUTTGART GALA ­ NIGHT

          As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes
          in his gold armor and helmet. The POLICE arrive and with no
          hesitation, he BLASTS the cars, FLIPPING them over and over.

                          LOKI
           Kneel before me.
          The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd.
          Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their
          spears, encircling the crowd.

                          LOKI
           I said. KNEEL!!!
          Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing
          his arms out, smiling.

                          LOKI
           Is not this simpler? Is this not your
           natural state? It's the unspoken truth
           of humanity, that you crave
           subjugation. The bright lure of freedom
           diminishes your life's joy in a mad
           scramble for power, for identity. You
           were made to be ruled. In the end, you
           will always kneel.
          As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN
          refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN
           Not to men like you.

                          LOKI
           There are no men like me.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN
           There are always men like you.

                          LOKI
           Look to your elder, people. Let him be
           an example.
          Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS
          blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN
          AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast
          with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           You know, the last time I was in
           Germany and saw a man standing above
           everybody else, we ended up
           disagreeing.

                          LOKI

                          (STANDING UP)
           The soldier. A man out of time.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I'm not the one who's out of time.
          From above Cap, the QUINJET arrives. A machine gun is pointed
          towards Loki.

                          NATASHA
           Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
          Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the
          QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time
          to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT.
          Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but
          Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is
          KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's
          tip on his helmet.

                          LOKI
           Kneel.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Not today!
          Cap FLIPS and KNOCKS him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and
          FLIPS him over.

                          NATASHA
           The guy's all over the place.
          Suddenly, AC/DC's "Shoot to Thrill" overdrives the QUINJET'S
          speakers.

                          IRON MAN
           Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?
          Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his
          IRON MAN suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. IRON MAN
          touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry
          the suit has.

                          IRON MAN
           Make your move, Reindeer Games.
          Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor materializes
          away.

                          IRON MAN
           Good move.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Mr. Stark.

           Captain.

          INT. QUINJET ­ NIGHT

          Natasha watches the skies. THUNDER. Coming out of nowhere. Fury
          speaks over her headset.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Said anything?

                          NATASHA
           Not a word.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Just get him here. We're low on time.
          With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch
          from a distance, whispering.

                          STEVE
           I don't like it.

                          TONY
           What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

                          STEVE
           I don't remember it being ever that
           easy. This guy packs a wallop.

                          TONY
           Still, you are pretty spry, for an
           older fellow. What's your thing?
           Pilates?

                          STEVE
           What?

                          TONY
           It's like calisthenics. You might have
           missed a couple things, you know, doing
           time as a Capsicle.
          Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match.

                          STEVE
           Fury didn't tell me he was calling you
           in.

                          TONY
           Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury
           doesn't tell you.
          THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake
          violently.

                          NATASHA
           Where's this coming from?
          Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently.

                          STEVE
           What's the matter? Scared of a little
           lightning?

                          LOKI
           I'm not overly fond of what follows.
          What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet.
          Not a light. A King.
          THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the
          throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony
          puts the IRON MAN helmet on.

                          IRON MAN
           Now there's that guy.

                          NATASHA
           Another Asgardian?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Think the guy's a friendly?

                          IRON MAN
           Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or
           kills him, the Tesseract's lost.
          Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after
          Thor.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, we need a plan of attack!

                          IRON MAN
           I have a plan. Attack.
          IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a
          parachute to follow.

                          NATASHA
           I'd sit this one out, Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I don't see how I can.

                          NATASHA
           These guys come from legends, they're
           basically gods.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm
           pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
          Cap JUMPS OUT of the jet.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN LEDGE ­ NIGHT

          Somewhere out in the European mountains, Thor throws Loki into
          the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJÖLNIR.
          He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is
          angry to see him alive in this fashion.

                          THOR
           Where is the Tesseract?

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           I missed you too.

                          THOR
           Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!

                          LOKI
           Oh, you should thank me. With the
           Bifrost gone how much dark energy did
           the Allfather have to muster to conjure
           you here? Your precious Earth.
          Thor drops MJÖLNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up
          Loki. His brother.
          Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is
          everything to a man or god.

                          THOR
           I thought you dead.

                          LOKI
           Did you mourn?

                          THOR
           We all did. Our father...

                          LOKI
           Your father. He did tell you my true
           parentage, did he not?
          Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even
          bigger wedge between them.

                          THOR
           We were raised together, we played
           together, we fought together. Do you
           remember none of that?

                          LOKI

                          (TURNS AROUND)
           I remember a shadow. Living in the
           shade of your greatness. I remember you
           tossing me into an abyss. I was and
           should be king!

                          THOR
           So you take the world I love as
           recompense for your imagined slights.
           No, the Earth is under my protection,
           Loki.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           And you're doing a marvelous job with
           that. The humans slaughter each other
           in droves, while you idly threat. I
           mean to rule them. And why should I
           not?

                          THOR
           You think yourself above them.

                          LOKI
           Well, yes.

                          THOR
           Then you miss the truth of ruling,
           brother. Throne would suit you ill.
          Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up
          to the ledge. Turns around.

                          LOKI
           I've seen worlds you've never known
           about! I have grown, Odinson, in my

           the Tesseract, and when I wield it...

                          THOR
           Who showed you this power? Who controls
           the would-be-king?

                          LOKI
           I am a king!

           Not here! You give up the Tesseract!
           You give up this poisonous dream! You
           come home.

                          LOKI
           I don't have it. You need the cube to
           bring me home, but I've sent it off I
           know not where.
          Mjölnir flies back to his grasp.

                          THOR
           You listen well, brother. I...

          THOR IS KNOCKED OFF THE MOUNTAIN BY IRON MAN WHO TACKLES HIM IN

          MID-FLIGHT.

          EXT. FOREST ­ CONTINUOUS

          THOR and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up.
          IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet
          opens up.

                          THOR
           Do not touch me again!

                          TONY
           Then don't take my stuff.

                          THOR
           You have no idea what you're dealing
           with.

                          TONY
           Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother
           know you weareth her drapes?

                          THOR
           This is beyond you, metal man. Loki
           will face Asgardian justice!

                          TONY
           He gives up the Cube, he's all yours.
           Until then, stay out of my way...
           tourist.
          The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick
          move, Thor pulls Mjölnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear
          across into a tree.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Okay.
          From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises
          his hand. Mjölnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the
          hammer, summoning a ray of energy.
          IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY
          KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and
          knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch!
          Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjölnir to his hand, raises
          it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points
          the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting
          increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          JARVIS
           Power at 400% capacity.

                          TONY
           How about that?
          IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his
          knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON
          MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.

          EXT. SKY ­ NIGHT

          The two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING
          him into the side of a mountain.
          THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him.

          EXT. FOREST ­ CONTINUOUS

          THOR and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every
          tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both
          HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as
          much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face.
          Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor,
          with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with
          his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest.
          IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the
          arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up,
          ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN
          SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift
          him and SMASH him down hard.
          Thor summons back Mjölnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put
          the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across
          the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him,
          but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands
          facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce...
          CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN,
          stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on

          DOZENS of SHIELD POLICE escort Loki, who is in handcuffs,
          smiling. As they pass the HELICARRIER LAB, Banner stops working

          cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass.

          chasing after her. Natasha maneuvers like a black widow should.
          She rolls under a turbine, starts to crawl within the maze of
          pipes. The HULK pulls them out from above the catwalk.
          Natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and
          stealthily escapes. The HULK lets out a ROAR OF RAGE unlike
          anything. PRIMAL. Not human.

          Natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk
          and spins.
          ...and then a ROAR. THE HULK. Natasha FIRES a shot into a liquid
          nitrogen pipe that hits the hulk in face. The HULK SMASHES THE
          SHIT OUT OF IT. Natasha begins to run through the maze of

          Finally, she reaches and a long corridor. As she runs, behind

          The HULK marks his territory. Natasha looks up. A fear she has

          The HULK makes his move.
          SWING AND A MISS. Thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks
          HULK off his feet. HULK keeps swinging and missing, pissing him
          off. Finally, he brings down his arm, but Thor grabs it and
          wraps around it.

          Thor CRASHES into another stack of crates. As he raises his
          head, he feels something on his lips. BLOOD. As he swipes it
          off, the ROAR of the HULK is not too far. Thor extends his hand
          out.
          The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains
          toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs
          right at him. At the last second, MJÖLNIR flies into his hand
          and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET.
          HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just
          happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the
          jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS

          THE MASSIVE PLATE AT THOR.
          Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws
          Mjölnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over
          heels. HULK falls down, hammer in hand. HE tries to lift it, but
          can't. Mjölnir rests atop his hand.
          Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The
          hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his
          might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING.
          Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his
          hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his
          CHOKEHOLD. Hulk tries to pull him off.

          IRON MAN continuously SPINS Engine 3, giving it all he has. THE

          Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is
          then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the
          rotors, getting chewed up.

          CAPTAIN AMERICA CLIMBS up the loose cable and reaches the
          railing.
          BARTON'S MAN opens fire once more. CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls himself
          up and finally PULLS the lever.
          A VENT opens up from Engine 3. IRON MAN falls out, but the suit
          heavily damaged, hardly keeping him up. IRON MAN heads for Cap.
          BARTON'S MAN turns his AIM to IRON MAN, who TACKLES him into the
          wall. IRON MAN rolls over, tired. Cap lets out a sigh of relief.

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER

          Fury gathers Tony and Steve back into the briefing room everyone
          there has a look as if in a daze. A look of numb shock is shown
          on their devastated faces.

           them.
          Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table

           chips on that number though, because I
           was playing something even riskier.
           There was an idea, Stark knows this,
           called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The
           idea was to bring together a group of
           remarkable people, see if they could
           become something more. See if they
           could work together when we needed them
           to, to fight the battles that we never
           could. Phil Coulson died still
           believing in that idea, in heroes.
          Tony gets up and walks off, not wanting to hear it anymore.

           They needed the push.
           (holding Coulson's cards)
          A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying
          off as well as the QUINJET.

                          NICK FURY
           They found it. Get our communications
           back up, whatever you have to do. I
           want eyes on everything.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Yes, sir.

          EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE - STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          IRON MAN arrives at STARK TOWER where Selvig, ACTIVATES the CMS
          device, holding the Tesseract.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, I took off the arc reactor. The
           device is already self-sustained.

                          TONY
           Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

                          SELVIG
           It's too late! It can't stop now. He
           wants to show us something! A new
           universe.

                          IRON MAN
           Okay.
          IRON MAN aims his hands toward the CMS and FIRES. The energy
          from his boosters SHATTERS with a deafening CRACK! Selvig falls
          backwards. DOWN BELOW, CITIZENS OF NEW YORK look up at STARK
          TOWER. IRON MAN stares in disbelief at the CMS ... unharmed.

                          JARVIS
           The barrier is pure energy. It's
           unbreachable. The Mark VII is not ready
           to be deployed.

                          TONY
           Skip the spinning rims. We're on the
           clock.
          TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits
          him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into
          the penthouse.

          INT. STARK PENTHOUSE ­ DAY

          Loki walks in, holding the scepter. Tony casually walks down the
          steps, towards the bar.

                          LOKI
           Please tell me you're going to appeal
           to my humanity.

                          TONY
           Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten
           you.

                          LOKI
           You should have left your armor on for
           that.

                          TONY
           Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.
           You've got the blue stick of destiny.
           Would you like a drink?

                          LOKI
           Stalling me won't change anything.

                          TONY
           No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You
           sure? I'm having one.

                          LOKI
           The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will
           change that. What have I to fear?

                          TONY

           THE AVENGERS.
           (Loki looks at him, confused)
           It's what we call ourselves, sort of
           like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES'
           type of thing.

                          LOKI
           Yes, I've met them.

                          TONY

                          (SMILING)
           Yeah, takes us a while to get any
           traction, I'll give you that one.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
           But, let's do a head count here. Your
           brother, the demi-God; a super soldier,
           a living legend who kind of lives up to
           the legend; a man with breath-taking
           anger management issues; a couple of
           master assassins, and you, big fella,
           you've managed to piss off every single
           one of them.

                          LOKI
           That was the plan.

                          TONY
           Not a great plan. When they come, and
           they will, they'll come for you.
          From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE
          BRACELETS, a honing device.

                          LOKI
           I have an army.

                          TONY
           We have a HULK.

                          LOKI
           I thought the beast had wandered off.

                          TONY
           You're missing the point. There's no
           throne, there is no version of this,
           where you come out on top. Maybe your
           army comes and maybe it's too much for
           us, but it's all on you. Because if we
           can't protect the Earth, you can be
           damned well sure we'll avenge it.

                          LOKI
           (slowly walks up to him;
           raising the scepter)
           How will your friends have time for
           me,when they're so busy fighting you?
          Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing.
          Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING.

                          LOKI
           It should work.

                          TONY
           Well, performance issues. You know?
          In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across
          the room.

                          TONY
           Jarvis. Anytime now.
          Loki grabs Tony by the throat again.

                          LOKI
           You will all fall before me.
          LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower.
          From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out.
          The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD
          begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit.
          It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits
          the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry.

                          IRON MAN
           And there's one other person you pissed
           off! His name was Phil.
          Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on
          his ass.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Selvig looks up at the sky. The Tesseract's energy BEAMS into
          the sky. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up

          ANOTHER PORTAL.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          A hole in space rips open, and from it, the CHITAURI ARMY SPILLS
          out in FLYING CHARIOTS, carrying ENERGY RIFLES with a bayonet on
          the end.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Right. Army.
          IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a
          miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the
          JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no
          missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN
          flies towards the city.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          The CHITAURI UNLEASH. New Yorkers fill the streets, staring at
          the fire fight in the distance. BOOM!!! The CHITAURI unleashes
          BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame.

          AN EXPLOSION RIPS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE TOP CORNER OF

          BUILDINGS. FLAME AND STONE RAIN DOWN. A DOMINO-EFFECT OF

          EXPLOSIONS RIPPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Loki walks onto the balcony as the SOUNDS of the CHITAURI rings
          out. He admires his soon to be kingdom. THOR LANDS ON THE TOWER.
          Loki turns to his ENEMY.

                          THOR
           Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll
           destroy it!

                          LOKI
           You can't. There is no stopping it.
           There is only the war!

                          THOR
           So be it.
          Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons
          collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing another pent-up rage
          and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          SOLDIERS AND COPS have taken positions covering the streets.
          They see from the sky, IRON MAN leading a trail of CHITAURI
          towards his tower.

          EXT. SKY ­ DAY

          The QUINJET BOOMS into the city.

           BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
           Stark, we're heading north east.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          IRON MAN
           What, did you stop for drive-thru?
           Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out
           for you.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          IRON MAN BANKS around his tower. Sees Thor and Loki still going
          at it. IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street, causing a CHITAURI to
          crash.
          Flying up, IRON MAN puts the following CHITAURI in view of the
          QUINJET. BLACK WIDOW takes out machine gun and FIRES at the

          CHITAURI.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          JARVIS
           Sir, we have more incoming.

                          TONY
           Fine. Let's keep them occupied.
          IRON MAN heads back to the portal.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires ENERGY from the
          scepter, sending Thor sliding across the floor.

          INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          HAWKEYE looks out to his left window, finding a target.

                          HAWKEYE
           Yeah.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           See them.
          HAWKEYE BANKS the jet towards STARK TOWER. Aims the MINIGUN at
          Loki. Loki AIMS the scepter at the QUINJET and FIRES A BLAST OF
          ENERGY. Thor gets to his feet, TACKLING Loki down hard.
          THE QUINJET is soon caught on fire. HAWKEYE maneuvers one wing
          of the jet. They SPIN and SLOW. DROPPING OUT OF THE AIR AS IT
          PASSES OVER SKYSCRAPERS. Then... they SLAM into the street.

          INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          With everyone okay, HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW unfasten their
          seatbelts and open the ramp. CAPTAIN AMERICA runs down, followed
          by HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW. Each one has their respected weapons
          in hand.

          EXT. FOUR WAY STREET ­ DAY

          The TRIO arrives in the middle of a four-way street. Suddenly,
          the city LURCHES to a stop. A DEEP, PRIMAL RAGE BELLOWS OUT.
          With that roar, a SHADOW comes over them.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          From the portal, a FUCKING CHITAURI LEVIATHAN FLIES OUT!
          Carrying hundreds of SOLDIERS, the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN PASSES
          OVER the TRIO.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          They look up, out of their element. From both sides, CHITAURI
          SOLDIERS CLING OFF and attach themselves to the sides of the
          buildings, sliding down. Some CRASH into these buildings and
          begin FIRING from their ENERGY RIFLES at innocent people.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, are you seeing this?

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           I'm seeing, still working on believing.
           Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           Banner?

                          TONY
           Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a
           soft spot.
          IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Thor holds down Loki's face straight ahead, forcing him to watch
          the city falling to ash.

                          THOR
           Look at this! Look around you! You
           think this madness will end with your
           rule?

                          LOKI
           (tries to look away)
           It's too late. It's too late to stopit.

                          THOR
           No. We can. Together.
          Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki
          stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over.

                          LOKI
           Sentiment.
          Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then
          SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor
          looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of
          CHITAURI follow his lead.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          The TRIO runs behind upside taxis. They look up and see Loki
          taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A

          CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS. SMASHING CARS AND HURLING PEOPLE AS IT GOES

          IT GOES OFF IN ONE FINAL CONFLAGRATION.
          TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from Loki, looking over their
          shoulders, coming straight at us. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks down the
          bridge.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Those people need assistance down
           there.
          CHITAURI SOLDIERS that have landed near them and begin FIRING at
          them. BLACK WIDOW pulls both pistols and FIRES. Turns to Cap.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           We got this. It's good. Go!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (AT HAWKEYE)
           You think you can hold them off?

                          HAWKEYE
           Captain.
           (pulls a trigger on his bow;
           a narrow is mechanically

                          CHOSEN)
           It would be my genuine pleasure.
          HAWKEYE shoots an ARROW into the creature's head, gaining a few
          seconds for CAPTAIN AMERICA as he falls down the bridge,
          followed by an EXPLOSION.
          Cap races over to the plaza, jumping over dozens of EXPLODING
          cars. THE FIRST AVENGER RUNS LIKE A FUCKING CHEETAH.
          HAWKEYE runs over a bus full of people. From the windows, SMALL
          CHILDREN are held by their parents for HAWKEYE to pull them out
          to safety. He runs over to the jammed door and JERKILY opens it.
          People begin to run out.
          BLACK WIDOW empties out her CLIPS. HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the
          ranks of the CHITAURI, hitting his mark each time he shoots.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Just like BUDAPEST all over again!

                          HAWKEYE
           You and I remember Budapest
           verydifferently.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          The COPS continuously fire at the flying chariots. It's pretty
          pointless. A YOUNG COP runs over to his POLICE SERGEANT.

                          YOUNG COP
           We need to get out! They gotta bring
           the National Guard!

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           National Guard? Does the army know
           what's happening here?

                          YOUNG COP
           Do we?
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps in front of them. They look up at this
          ridiculous looking man.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I need men in these buildings. There
           are people inside that can run into the
           line of fire. You take them through the
           basement or through the subway. You
           keep them off the streets. I need a
           perimeter as far back as 39th.

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           Why the hell should I take orders from
           you?
          Suddenly, an EXPLOSION comes up from behind Cap. An ENERGY BLAST
          is blocked by his SHIELD. TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS attack. The cops
          watch in shock as CAPTAIN AMERICA FIGHTS them off with ease. The
          Sergeant turns to his officer.

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           I need men in those buildings, lead the
           people down and away from the streets.
           I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

          IRON MAN swerves around a building and faces the CHITAURI
          LEVIATHAN. He pulls out his miniature multiple rocket launcher
          and FIRES. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN ROARS in annoyance. The
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN turns to him.

                          (TO JARVIS)
           We got his attention. What the hell is
           step two?!
          IRON MAN flies away.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          HAWKEYE TRIPS a CHITAURI SOLDIER and RAMS an arrow down its
          throat. BLACK WIDOW gets her hands on an ENERGY RIFLE and
          STICKFIGHTS the hell out of them.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA joins back in and using his SHIELD, SWAPS and
          WHACKS oncoming CHITAURI SOLDIERS. It's all too much on them,
          until...
          Lightning strikes down from the sky, channeling the blast,
          firing the electricity out at the CHITAURI SOLDIERS around them.
          They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The CHITAURI
          SOLDIERS convulse, drop dead to the ground. THOR TOUCHES DOWN.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           What's the story upstairs?

                          THOR
           The powers surrounding the cube is
           impenetrable.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           Thor is right. We gotta deal with these
           guys.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           How do we do this?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           As a team.

                          THOR
           I have unfinished business with Loki.

                          HAWKEYE
           Yeah, get in line.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight
           focused on us and that's what we need.
           Without him these things could run
           wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna
           need us...
          Just then, BANNER ARRIVES ON A SMALL MOTORBIKE. Getting off, he
          looks around the city.

                          BANNER
           So, this all seems horrible.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I've seen worse.

                          BANNER
           Sorry.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           No. We could use a little worse.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark? We got him.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           Banner?

           Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing
           the party to you.
          IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI
          LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          The rest of the AVENGERS look up, getting ready and standing
          still.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I... I don't see how that's a party...
          IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN also
          swoops down, BARRELING down the street like a FREIGHT TRAIN that
          keeps building and building its intensity.Banner looks behind.
          Cap looks at him. Banner begins to walk towards the monster.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Dr. Banner. Now might be a really good
           time for you to get angry.

                          BANNER
           That's my secret, Captain. I'm always
           angry.
          Banner's body starts to swell and stretch and harden. GREEN

          SHOOTS THROUGH HIS BODY. THE HULK.
          Aaaannndddd.........SSSMMMAAASSSHHH!!!! HULK POPS the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN IN THE NOSE. THE CREATURE FLIPS OVER A 360.
          IRON MAN, in mid-flight, extends his arm out and a ROCKET, ready
          to shoot. IRON MAN FIRES -- the rocket hits a SOFT SPOT ­ LARGE
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN are BLOWN COMPLETELY AWAY. Real pain from the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Other pieces of meat CATCH FIRE and
          withdraw... SIZZLE as they hit the pavement. CAPTAIN AMERICA
          raises his SHIELD to block them.
          From above and on the buildings, the CHITAURI ARMY watches in
          horror as a group of EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES FIND THEMSELVES

          UNITED AGAINST A COMMON THREAT. TO FIGHT THE FOES NO SINGLE

          SUPER HERO COULD WITHSTAND! THE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!

          MORE CHITAURI LEVIATHANS FLY OUT!

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          THE AVENGERS look up. Way out of their fucking element.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Guys.

                          IRON MAN
           Call it, Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Alright, listen up. Until we can close
           that portal up there, we're gonna use
           containment. Barton, I want you on that
           roof, eyes on everything. Call out
           patterns and strays. Stark, you got the
           perimeter. Anything gets more than
           three blocks out, you turn it back or
           your turn it to ash.

                          HAWKEYE
           Wanna give me a lift?

                          IRON MAN
           Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS.
          IRON MAN lifts HAWKEYE up to the building.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck
           that portal. Slow them down. You've got
           the lightning. Light the bastards up.
           (Thor flies up; to Natasha)
           You and me, we stay here on the ground,
           keep the fighting here. And Hulk.SMASH.

          THE HULK SMILES A MOST MAGNIFICENT GRIN AND LEAPS, SOARING HIGH

          UP INTO THE NEAREST BUILDING, HULK RUNS UP THE WALL HITS SEVERAL

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS, SNAPPING IN HALF.

          HE DIVES TOWARDS A BUILDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET,
          THROWING THE DEAD CHITAURI SOLDIERS TOWARDS OTHER SOLDIERS. The
          CHITAURI SOLDIERS fire at him. THE HULK BACKHANDS THEM, SEIZES

          THEM AND WITH RAW POWER, THROWS THEM DOWN.

          IN HIS MOST POWERFUL LEAP YET, THE HULK FLIES UP AND IS IN THE

          MIDDLE OF A FLYING CHARIOT TRAFFIC JAM, TO WHICH HE SMACKS THEM

          OUT OF ALTITUDE.

          Thor grabs onto the tower. Raises MJÖLNIR and KRAKAKABOOM! A
          BLINDING BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on

          MJÖLNIR. THOR AIMS THIS MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE TOWARDS THE PORTAL.

          THOR CHANNELS THE BLAST AND FIRES THE ELECTRICITY OUT AT THE

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS FLYING OUT OF THE PORTAL. THEY'RE BLASTED BACK

          IN A MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE. THE CHITAURI SOLDIERS CONVULSE, DROP

          DEAD TO THE GROUND. HE EVEN RIPS THE SHIT OUT OF A CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN, WHICH THEN FUCKING EXPLODES.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the destruction
          going on in NEW YORK. Agent Hill walks up to him.

           Sir. The council is on.
          OH SHIT. Fury presses his screen.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY

          Atop the rooftop, HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the streaming flow
          of the CHITAURI RIDERS, hitting his mark each time. Hell, heeven
          AIMS his bow behind him, WITHOUT LOOKING and releases the arrow,
          EXPLODING a RIDER.

                          HAWKEYE
           Stark. You got a lot of strings
           sticking to your tail.

                          IRON MAN
           Just try and keep them off the streets.

                          HAWKEYE
           Well, they can't bank worth a damn.
           Find a tight corner.

                          IRON MAN
           I will roger that.
          IRON MAN does so and leads towards TIGHT CORNERS and in
          HAWKEYE'S view, who fires arrow upon and arrow, EXPLODING the
          CHITAURI RIDERS. IRON MAN keeps leading CHITAURI RIDERS UNDER
          TUNNELS, THROUGH OPEN PARKING GARAGES. He looks back. None left.

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM ­ DAY

          We are looking INTO a conference room where office workers sit
          around a table. But the NOISE has caught one worker's eye, then
          another, and soon they are all rising, stepping to the window,
          mesmerized by what lies beyond.
          WORKERS' POVA CHITAURI LEVIATHAN SWIMS right in front of them.

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM ­ DAY

          Suddenly, another NOISE catches the worker's attention. THE HULK

          CRASHES THROUGH THEIR FLOOR. SLASHES HIS THROUGH THE ROOM,

          POUNDING AWAY AND JUMPS OUT ONTO THE JAW OF THE CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN. THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN BEGINS TO HEAD DOWN, TRYING TO

          WAVE OFF THE HULK.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          BLACK WIDOW, using the ENERGY RIFLE, is taken off her feet by a
          CHITAURI SOLDIER. She TIRESOMELY takes it down by cutting its
          throat. She grabs the ENERGY RIFLE, turns to attack. Cap stands
          there, holding his SHIELD. She slumps back, tired.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Captain, none of this is gonna mean a
           damn thing if we don't close that
           portal.

           Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

           need a ride.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I got a ride. I could use a lift
           though.
          BLACK WIDOW backs up giving herself a running start. Cap lifts
          and angles his SHIELD.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Are you sure about this?

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

          BLACK WIDOW RUNS AT CAPTAIN AMERICA. BLACK WIDOW DOES A PARKOUR

          MOVE, USING HER FEET TO RUN UP THE CAR AND JUMPS UP ON CAP'S

          SHIELD, WHO GIVES HER A BOOST WITH THE SHIELD. SHE GRABS ONTO A

          FLYING CHARIOT.
          [Note: The following sequence will take us through the action in
          one extended shot.]
          - BLACK WIDOW climbs onto the chariot and CUTS the turret
          shooter's linkage to it. She then JUMPS on the rider and STICKS
          her knives into his nervous system. She gets him to BANK over a
          building.
          - IRON MAN arrives and SHOOTS any other CHITAURI RIDERS
          following her. He makes his way down to CAPTAIN AMERICA, who
          fights off more CHITAURI SOLDIERS. IRON MAN points his HAND
          BOOSTERS at his SHIELD. The energy comes off and Cap uses it as
          a REFLECTION BEAM and takes down nearby CHITAURI.
          - From above them, HAWKEYE sends down remaining arrows. He sends
          one across the street, taking down a CHITAURI RIDER following

          IRON MAN.
          - Finally, we have THOR and HULK fight on top the back of the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, tearing apart and fighting SOLDIERS. HULK

          BREAKS OFF A MASSIVE PIECE OF ARMOR AND SLAMS IT DOWN ONTO THE
          SPINE OF THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Summoning all his strength he,

          Several HUMVEES aim their MOUNTED .50 Cal guns into the sky,
          FIRING and HITTING CHITAURI RIDERS. CAPTAIN AMERICA fights off a
          SOLDIER who is pinning him down with its energy rifle. Cap

           I'm on it.

          INT. 42NDBANK ­ DAY

          Dozens of civilians are gathered in bank. Tension and
          uncertainty surround them. THREE CHITAURI SOLDIERS oversee them,
          pointing their weapons at them. One of them charges a BOMB. It

          BEEPS.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps through the window and throws his SHIELD
          at the CHITAURI BOMBER. The TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS aim their
          rifles, but Cap heads for cover under a desk, which he KICKS at
          them.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps over the desk, HEADLOCKS A SOLDIER, while
          BACKHANDING another one over the railing. The crowd moves away.
          A CHITAURI SOLDIER attacks him from behind and RIPS OFF HIS
          HELMET. The bomb is beeping faster.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Everyone! Clear out!
          CAPTAIN AMERICA flips over the SOLDIER, grabs his SHIELD and
          just as the BOMB is about to GO OFF, CHITAURI BOMBER dives for,
          trying to stop it, but it GOES OFF, sending CAPTAIN AMERICA
          through the window, landing very hard on a car. The civilians
          look up from below. They're okay.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE BANK ­ CONTINUOUS

          Cap gets off the car, looks around the city. Destroyed. The
          police and firemen arrive, pulling out those civilians he saved.

           I recognize the council has made a
           decision, but given that it's a stupid
           ass decision, I've elected to ignore
           it.

          BLACK WIDOW, still driving the chariot with the RIDER, is hit at

          at Loki, smiling.

          As Loki looks up, shocked at what just happened, THE HULK IS

          COLLAPSES as he hits the wall. THE HULK jumps in, ready to

          BLACK WIDOW walks up the CMS machine. Selvig, slumped down,
          weakened, looks at her desperately. The Tesseract's energy is
          firing towards the portal, gaining in strength, at the surge of
          energy moving through the sky.

          THOR rides on top of chariot, SMACKING SEVERAL RIDERS with the
          hammer. As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes
          through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting
          off SOLDIERS.
          IRON MAN flies right next to the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN and aims his
          LASER BOOSTER at it. Nothing.

          IRON MAN FLIES TOWARDS THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, UNLEASHING EVERY
          ARSENAL ON THE SUIT. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN opens its mouth.
          IRON MAN flies in and BURSTS out the other end, making the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN collapse. IRON MAN rolls down the street. The
          wind is knocked out of him. He looks up with an overwhelming
          sigh as a SMALL BAND of CHITAURI SOLDIERS rush towards him,
          holding out their rifles.

          he knocks some CHITAURI SOLDIERS, before yanking his last arrow
          off the dead body a CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
          HAWKEYE nocks his arrow, DIVES DOWN THE BUILDING and FIRES his
          GRAPPLING ARROW up into the side of building. Falling down,
          HAWKEYE finds the MOMENTUM and SWINGS himself into a building
          and CANNONBALLS in.

          down. More keep coming. HULK looks up. HUNDREDS OF RIDERS HOVER
          OVER HIM. Then... they begin to fire ENERGY BLASTS. HULK TAKES
