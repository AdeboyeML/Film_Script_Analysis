INT. KOWOLSKI'S BAKERY - KITCHEN - DAY

A news crew shuttles around a GIGANTIC COOKIE. Standing by
are the KOWOLSKI BROTHERS, GUSTOV and VOL, two SHORT, STOCKY,
MEN, along with MOTHER KOWOLSKI and other bakery family
employees. A "30 YEAR ANNIVERSARY" sign hangs in the
background.
BRUCE NOLAN looks into a make-up mirror, desperately trying
to place a large segment of wayward hair.
                     BRUCE
          Oh, God, no! The hair's wrong.
          This is a bad sign.
               (calling out)
          We really need to get a make-up
          person?!
The segment producer, ALLY LOMAN, steps over.
                     ALLY
          Not in the budget. And not to                         *
                                                                *
          worry, you're going to look great
          in this.
She holds out a HAIR NET.
                     BRUCE
          A hair net? I'm not wearing a hair
          net. I just did the hair.
                     ALLY
               (matter of fact)
          Health code. In the kitchen or
          around the cookie, you gotta have
          it.
                     BRUCE
               (to crew: re hair net)
          You guy's should tell me this
          before hand, this is like a huge
          waste of...moose.
Bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up
looking ridiculous and very disgruntled.
                     BRUCE
          Remind me to swing by an elementary                   *
          school after this and serve lunch.
Ally laughs.

                                                       2.



                     ALLY
          You're a thing of beauty.     In
          three, two, one. . .
Bruce SNAPS from pissed to instant charismatic TV newsman.
(Note: Whenever Bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his
"REPORTER'S VOICE" - that recognizable, too-smooth delivery
that all news reporters seem to have. In mathematical terms
Bruce's version is to the 7th power.)
                    BRUCE
          For three decades the Kowolski
          Family Bakery has been a mainstay
          in downtown Buffalo. Known for
          their sinfully rich, cream filled,
          deep fried polski pierogis. And
          the occasional sugar induced coma
          that follows. Today, in honor of
          their 30 year anniversary, Momma
          Kowolski and her sons Gustov and
          Vol, decided to do something, a
          little bit different. Tell me
          guys, how did this idea come about?

                       GUSTOV
          Well,    Vol said to me, 'Gustov, why
          don't    we make the biggest chocolate
          chip    cookie in Buffalo?' And I
          said,    'Yeah, sure.'
                    BRUCE
          Wow. Fascinating.
Bruce steps up to the HUGE COOKIE.
                    BRUCE
          The previous Buffalo cookie record
          was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by
          Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth
          cookie clearly proving that Gustov
          and Vol have much more free time.
The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background,
toasting with big mugs of milk. Bruce steps forward, looks
dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.
                       BRUCE (CONT'D)
          As we witness the ceremonial
          toasting with milk it makes one
          pause and think. What are we
          really looking at here?
                       (MORE)

                                                        3.

                    BRUCE (CONT'D)
          Is it just a big cookie or does
          this cookie represent the pride of
          Buffalo? Our dedicated and hard
          working citizens the key
          ingredient, with a few nuts thrown
          in.
              (motions his eyes to the
               Kowolski twins)
          And finally, the love of our
          families which provides the warm
          chewy center making our beloved
          Buffalo the sweetest place to live.

Camera is in CLOSE as Bruce signs-off.
                    BRUCE (CONT'D)
          And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles. I'm Bruce Nolan,
          Eyewitness News.
Bruce's hair net SLIPS UP, PUFFING HIS HAIR INTO A BUN ON THE
TOP OF HIS HEAD. The Kowolskis and bystanders all laugh.
The frame FREEZES.
We PULL BACK from the TV and find Bruce holding the remote,
watching the recorded spot on TV. We are now...
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bruce is with his longtime girlfriend, GRACE. She has a box
of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them
into a photo album.
                    BRUCE
          So, what do you think?
                       GRACE
          It's good.
                       BRUCE
          It sucks. It's a story about a
          cookie. People with eating
          disorders will be riveted,
               (goes into huge pathetic
                fan character)
          Dear Bruce, love the bakery piece.
          I can't wait to vomit so I can make
          room for more cookies.
                       GRACE
          I thought it was funny. I love the
          hair net. How'd you get it to do
          that?

                                                             4.



                        BRUCE
          What? I'm cutting that. They made
          me wear that stupid thing. I don't
          even look like myself. The hair is
          one of the most important parts of
          an on camera persona. Right out of
          the gate, I lost the hair
          advantage.
Grace looks at a photo,
                        GRACE
          Oh, my gosh, look at this one. My
          sister is so drunk.
She places it in the album.
                        BRUCE
          Grace. Try to stay focused here.
          I need your help.
                     GRACE
          Aren't you taking this a little too
          seriously?
                        BRUCE
           It's sweeps Grace. It is serious.
           There's an anchor job open. This
           is important. This is our future!
Bruce points to the TV as he says "future," not realizing
he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the
hair net bun. Grace can't help but giggle.
                        GRACE
           I'm sorry.
Bruce collapses into Grace's arms like a child. He clearly
has a fragile temperament.
                     BRUCE
               (sighs)
          I'm never going to get anchor doing
          these kind of assignments. I want
          my work to matter.
                     GRACE
          It does matter. You're funny. You
          make people smile. Come on, take a
          break, help me put this album
          together.

                    BRUCE
               (reluctant)
          Alright.
Grace holds up a photo.
                    GRACE
          Oh look at this. It's the first
          day we moved in together.
It's the two of them, younger, laughing.
                      BRUCE
               (down)
          Yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.
                    GRACE
          Oh, here's me at my sister's
          wedding. I caught the bouquet.
It's a picture of Grace overpowering the other bridesmaids
for the bouquet.
                    BRUCE
          You look pretty intense, hun.
                    GRACE
          Well, I was thinking about you.
Grace cuddles into Bruce.
                    BRUCE
          So, you're attracted to me in some
          way, is that what you're trying to
          say?
Grace rolls over onto Bruce.
                    GRACE
          You have no idea.
                    BRUCE
          I was saving myself for the wedding
          night, but if you keep this up, I
          may lose my resolve.
Grace stands, pulling Bruce up.
                    GRACE
          Well, that's the way the cookie
          crumbles.
They kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom.

                                                           6.



                       BRUCE
            Hey, that's a good line, but you
            need more resonance. From the
            diaphragm.
                (newscaster voice)
            That's the way the cookie crumbles.
                      GRACE
            Oh, say it again.
                      BRUCE
                (bigger)
            That's the way the cookie crumbles.
                      GRACE
                (sweet, southern groupie)
            Oh, I just love on-air
            personalities.
                       BRUCE
                 (newscaster voice)
            Well then, let me take these
            clothes off and slip into my hair
            net.
Grace laughs, Bruce joins in as they disappear into the
bedroom.
                                            CUT TO:
A TELEVISION SCREEN

We see the INTRO FOR SIXTY MINUTES:

LESLIE STAHL is HIT IN THE NECK WITH A TRANQUILIZER DART.
Her head wavers, then DROPS on the desk. The camera PANS to
BRUCE, who lowers a bamboo blow gun, cooly addresses camera.
                      BRUCE
            ...Bruce Nolan. And this is Sixty
            Minutes.
THE SIXTY MINUTES TICKING CLOCK

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

BRUCE'S ALARM CLOCK - IT RINGS
We are in. . .

                                                            7.



INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Bruce lies next to Grace with a big smile on his face. Grace
hits the alarm, rolls over snuggling close to Bruce.
                    GRACE
          Sweety, time to get up...
She kisses Bruce, gets up.
                    BRUCE
          No, I'm having a great dream.
The covers are RIPPED OUT OF FRAME.   Bruce throws a mock
hissy fit.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Bruce watches TV as he buttons his shirt.
                     SPORTSCASTER
          ...and the Sabers lost another
          close one last night. Four to
          three to the Toronto Maple Leafs.
                     BRUCE
          Of course they lost, they're my
          team.
                                            CUT TO:
MOMENTS LATER

Bruce checks his hair in the mirror practicing his new sign-
off.
                     BRUCE
          "And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles."
               (calls to Grace)
          You know, I think there might be
          something to that cookie line.
          Everything great anchor has his own
          signature sign-off.
               (as Walter Cronkite)
          "And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles."
ANGLE - SAM

Peeing in the corner on the carpet.

                                                              8.


                     BRUCE
          Oh no!   Grace, the dog!
                    GRACE (O.S.)
          I'm in the shower!
                     BRUCE
          Ah!
INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE
Bruce runs along carrying the peeing Sam with extended arms
dodges a man ascending the stares, who gets sprinkled.
                    BRUCE
          Whoops, sorry.
EXT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Bruce makes it outside, sets Sam down on the grass. Sam
looks up innocently at Bruce, finished.
                     BRUCE
          Oh, you're all done, huh?
          B-e-a-utiful.
EXT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - MORNING
Bruce pulls up in his Ford Tauras to a cluster of cars
unloading kids. A 2003 MERCEDES SRL passes by.
                    GRACE
          Wow, nice car, huh?
                     BRUCE
          Yeah, if you want to rub your
          success in people's faces.
Then Bruce notices a big medical van in front of the school
with a BLOOD DRIVE SIGN.
                     BRUCE
          What's with the hubbub?
                     GRACE
          We're having a blood drive.
                    BRUCE
          Creepy. Needles, yech...
                     GRACE
          Oh, that's a nice response.

                                                       9.



                     BRUCE
          I mean, it's just s o . . .
                    GRACE
          Helpful and life saving?
                    BRUCE
          C'mon, that's your...blood. It's
          in your body and I don't think it's
          supposed to come out. Besides,
          they stockpile that stuff. They
          have an endless supply frozen in a
          warehouse somewhere then tell
          everyone there's a shortage.

                    GRACE
          They do not. Now stop it. I'm                        *
          giving. I have a very rare blood                     *
          type, AB positive.
                    BRUCE
          Well, I'm IB positive. IB positive
          they aint touchin' me with no
          needle.
Grace sighs in exasperation, starts out when...
                      GRACE
                (suddenly remembers
                 something)
          O. . .
          h
She places a STRING OF PRAYER BEADS on the rearview mirror.
                    BRUCE
          What's that?
                    GRACE
          Prayer beads. The kids made 'em.
          Keep you safe.
                      BRUCE
          Well, I hope they work, cause it's
          going take a miracle to get me to
          work on time.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
Bruce is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. He stares at the
prayer beads with a "thanks alot" look.

                                                          10.



A big accident ahead. Bruce looks at his watch, he's
screwed. A person is CARRIED BY ON A STRETCHER, Bruce is
oblivious.
                       BRUCE
             This is just my luck.
Bruce's BEEPER sounds.      He checks it.
                        BRUCE.
             The meeting's starting, perfect...
                  (thinks)
             Screw it.
He looks to the right of the car in front of him, then peels
off onto the shoulder, passing tons of cars.
                       BRUCE
                 (laughs)
             Catch you later, lemmings 1 It's
             kill or be killed, only the strong
             survive, no guts, no glory1
SFX: SIREN
Bruce pulls over, fumes.
                        BRUCE
                  (looking heavenward)
             Thank you.
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
Bruce screeches into a space, races out of the car, bumping
over a trash can, goes back to pick it up, sees a HOMELESS
MAN who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket and sign
boards. The various "warnings" change daily. Today's SIGN
reads:
                  R EWE BLIND?
Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
continues on.
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
Bruce rushes through the newsroom, rounds a corner and runs
right into BOBBY, the endlessly yammering PASTRY CART GUY.

                                                         1.
                                                         1

                     BOBBY
          Bruce the goose! Morning, Buddy.
          Don't even move, I got somethin'
          special today. My mom made it just
          for you.
                     BRUCE
          Well, that's- Bobby, I gotta go-
          I'm late...
                     BOBBY
               (bending down)
          You like Quiche?
He comes back up, proudly presents a slice of quiche.
                     BOBBY
          You know, contrary to popular
          belief the quiche was actually
          invented by the Mayans, then stolen
          by the French. They shoulda said,
          "Hey, that quiche ain't yours, it's
          Mayan!"
Bobby belts out a laugh.
                    BRUCE
          Bobby, I can't, I--
                     BOBBY
          Just taste it, taste it...
Bobby shoves a bite into Bruce's mouth. Bruce feigns liking
it with exasperation.
                     BRUCE
          Mmm, delicious, I really gotta go.
                     BOBBY
          That's a buck seventy-five.
                     BRUCE
          Can you get Kelly- Ahh...
Bruce tosses the thought, digs into his pocket, fishing for
cash.
                     BOBBY
               (excited)
          Oh, two o'clock, two o'clock, two-o-
          five, two-ten...

                                                       12.



Bruce glances over, annoyed but freezes at the sight of sexy
anchorwoman, SUSAN ORTEGA across the room.
                    BOBBY
          Way out of our league, huh?
Bruce offers his money to Bobby.
                     BOBBY
          You know, I saw them editing your
          cookie piece.

                     BRUCE
          Really?

                    BOBBY
          They must have gotten high or
          something, cause they was orderin'
          everything, I had. Hey, how long
          have you been interested in pastry?
          'Cause I've got an aunt who makes
          baklava twenty layers deep.

                     BRUCE
               (holding money out)
          Bobby.
                     BOBBY
               (gets a brilliant idea)
          Maybe you could do a story on her!
Bruce tosses the money on the cart, heads off.
                    BRUCE
          Keep the change.
                     BOBBY
               (calling after)
          I'll give her a call, we'll talk
          about it later!
INT. STAFF MEETING ROOM - DAY

ON THE MONITOR:

                     EVAN
          Is something killing your kids?
          Find out tonight at eleven.
Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
continues on.

                                                        13.



IN THE ROOM
The morning meeting is well in progress. Leading the group
is the station manager and Bruce's boss, JACK KELLER, 50's, a
constant furrow in his brow.
Also in the room: Bruce's fellow field reporter and rival
EVAN BAXTER, 30' s , a walking statement. Impeccable posture,
perfect speech, perfect everything and he knows it.
FRED DONOHUE, the ever jovial sports reporter; always tanned,
vain weatherman, DALLAS COLEMAN and segment producer Ally
Loman.

                    JACK
          Okay, promos are approved, let's--
                    ALLY
          Ah, isn't that last one a little
          misleading? I mean, the story's
          about flu shots. Do we have to
          scare people to death?
                    EVAN
          No, just into watching. Or I could
          change it to: "Slow news day, come
          yawn with us. At eleven."
                    FRED
          Sniffles at eleven is nice.
                    DALLAS
          Attack of the killer sniffles?
                    ALLY
              (to Dallas)
          The tanning booth is starting to
          zap your brain, you know that?
                    DALLAS
          I don't use a tanning booth.
A beat and they all crack up.
                    FRED                                        *
          Come on. You're turning orange.                       *
                    EVAN                                        *
          He looks Florida ripe to me.         .                *
More laughs.                                                    *

                                                     14.



                    JACK
          I would have swore I already said
          this, but promos are approved. Now                  *
          can we move on?                                     *
                    ALLY
          Jack, shouldn't the promos be                       *
          focusing on Pete's retirement.
          This is his last week.
                    EVAN
              (leading)
          Yeah, yeah. Any word on the open
          anchor position, Jack?
                     JACK
          Evan, you'11 know something when I
          know something.
Bruce bursts into the room. The meeting stops. Jack doesn't
need to say anything, he just looks at his watch.
                    BRUCE
          Sorry, Jack. It wasn't my fault.
          The traffic was -- You guys already
          played the spots?
                    JACK
          Nice story, Bruce, but we're going
          with Evan's piece on the sex
          scandal at the mayor's office for
          sweeps.
This hits Bruce hard. A beat of silence.
                    EVAN
          And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles.
The others chuckle. Only Ally remains sympathetic.
                    EVAN
          I'm just messin' with you, Bruce.
          See you've got to remember that the
          news room is like a cookie...
More laughs.
                    BRUCE
               (re: Evan's perfect
                posture)
          That's great Evan.
                      (MORE)

                                                          15.

                    BRUCE (cont'd)
          Is you're posture naturally that
          good, or do you have to shove a
          stick up there?
                    JACK
          Okay, knock it off... Bruce we're
          holding your story in reserve.
          Now, can we get back to the board
          so we have something to air today?
Jack continues with assignments. Evan sits smugly, as Bruce
slides down into his chair, deflated.
INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jack is at Bobby's cart, paying for a sandwich. Bruce
catches up .to him.
                    BRUCE
          Jack, Jack, hey.     Can I talk to you
          for a second?
                    JACK
          Sure, Bruce. What do you need?
                    BRUCE
          Sweeps.
Jack takes his sandwich and leaves. Bobby leans to Bruce.
                    BOBBY
          Don't worry about it.    I called my
          aunt, we're on.
Bruce looks at Bobby, continues after and catches Jack.
                     BRUCE
          Look, Jack. Hear me out, I'm
          getting desperate man, I am pushing
          forty and what have I got to show
          for it? The point is, I've hit
          some kind of a ceiling here. Some
          kind of anti-Bruce barrierI And
          Evan is just lovin' it, by the way.
          He gets the good stories, he gets
          on sweeps. Maybe I have to be more
          like Evan.

                    JACK
          You don't want to be like Evan.
          Evan's an asshole.
                    BRUCE
          I can be an asshole.

                                                          16.



                          JACK
             No, Bruce.     You can't.
Bruce thinks, then flips Jack's sandwich plate over. It
scatters on the floor. Jack and Bruce stare at each other
for a beat.
                       JACK
             Are you going to pick that up?
                       BRUCE
             Yeah, I'm sorry.
Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food.
                       BRUCE
             It's just- this anchor position
             looming, it's gotten me nuts...
He hands the plate to Jack, as sexy anchorwoman SUSAN ORTEGA
saunters by.
               JACK                               BRUCE
Hi, Susan.                           Hi, Susan.
                          SUSAN ORTEGA
             Hi, Jack.
Bruce blanches at this obvious snubbing.
                       JACK
             Look, Bruce. You're a good
             reporter. You make people laugh.
             God knows today we can use it.
Bruce slumps, he's heard this a thousand times before.              *
                        JACK                                    *
                 (beat)
             Alright, tell you what. It's the                   *
             23rd anniversary of the Maid of the
             Mist. I want you at Niagara Falls
             in an hour.
                       BRUCE
             Maid of the Mist. That's always
             live.
                          JACK
             Yep.
                       BRUCE
             Evan gets the live feeds.

                                                          17.



                    JACK
          Well now you and Evan get the live
          feeds.
                    BRUCE
          I'm going live. In sweeps.
                    JACK
          Yes, but watch yourself, Bruce.
          I've seen your outtakes.
Bruce hugs Jack, pressing the sandwich against his chest.
                     BRUCE
          Yes 1 You will not regret this,
          Jack.
               (releases Jack)
          I will not forget you when I go
          national.
Bruce takes off, Jack looks down, peels the sandwich off his
chest. We hear children's joyous SHRIEKS...
INT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - DAY

He shakes his head "no."

          Martin. Open your mouth. Abra su

He does. His tongue sparkles with glitter.
                     GRACE
          Oh, you're not huh? Well, then
          you've got a bad case of Liberace.

          They didn't teach you Spanish in
          nursing school, did they?
                       DEBBIE
          Well, it seemed like they were
          speaking a foreign language
          sometimes, but no. Problemo?
                     GRACE
          Martin has decided to explore new
          food groups.
               (back to Martin)
          Martin, this is for art. Like this.
She spreads paste on the paper, sprinkles glitter.
                     DEBBIE
          Is it so wrong to tie them up?
                        GRACE

Martin is busted with the paste spreader stuck in his mouth.
Grace snatches it.
                      GRACE
          Okay, go rinse your mouth with
          water. Lave su boca. Go.

          They're seeing if I can think on my

          a live news anchor situation.
                    GRACE
          Oh, my gosh.
                    BRUCE
          This is happening for us, Grace.
          What we've always talked about.
          Jack practically came out and told
          me.
Grace quickly switches gears.   She experienced the premature-
celebration before.
                    GRACE
          Wait, what do you mean practically?
                    BRUCE
          Well, he didn't spell it out, but
          this is exactly what happened to
          Susan Ortega right before she was
          bumped up to the desk.
                    GRACE
              (being cautious)
          I just want to make sure we're not
          getting too ahead of ourselves.
                    BRUCE
          I totally agree, but in the mean
          time you should start thinking
          about what coast you want to live
          on.
Ally interrupts, indicating the time.
                    BRUCE

EXT. NIAGARA FALLS - MAID OF THE MIST BOAT - DAY

Ally hustles Bruce toward the bow of the boat, as he places
his ear piece.
                    ALLY
          They want you close to the falls.
                    BRUCE
          What for? I'll get soaked.
                    ALLY
          That's the point.    They want you to
          hold up this.
She hands Bruce a very stupid looking, blue "falls" shaped
UMBRELLA with the MAID OF THE MIST INSIGNIA.
                    ALLY
          Part of the condition of us getting
          the exclusive.
Bruce takes the umbrella.
'     '               BRUCE
          Lovely.    Glad I wore my tap shoes.
                     ALLY

          anniversary. Capacity is 59. They
          cater to tourists, honeymooners. . .

She positions A VERY, VERY OLD WOMAN next to Bruce.
                     ALLY

          with her late husband. Okay, 90                      *

Bruce looks upward at the ridiculous umbrella. Mutters
encouragement to himself.

THE LIVE FEED IN THE CAMERA TRUCK AT THE FALLS

Some of the CREW MEMBERS watch the feed.

ON TV

Pete Fineman is reporting.
                     PETE FINEMAN
           ...but because of the fast response
           by our local fire fighters, the
           toxic chemicals were cleaned up
           without incident. Susan.
The female co-anchor, SUSAN ORTEGA:
                     SUSAN
           Bruce Nolan is standing by at
           Niagara Falls with a report on the
           Maid of the Mist sightseeing boat,
           but before we go live to Bruce, we
           have an announcement to make. As
           everyone knows, after 33 years, our
           beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.
Pete smiles a proud, heart-felt smile.
                      SUSAN
           Pete's shoes are virtually
           impossible to fill, but the show
           must go on. And we could think of
           no one better than our very own
           Evan Baxter.
ON BRUCE

Listening to the feed. His FACE GOES WHITE.      He stands in
shock.
Evan is seated next to Susan.

                                                         23.


                    SUSAN
          Congratulations, Evan. Looks like
          we'll be sitting side by side from
          now on.
                    EVAN
          Thanks, Susan. I ' m thrilled and
          honored. Like you said, no one can
          replace the great Pete Fineman, but
          I'll do my best. I have to say I
          am so proud to be a part of our
          local community. Of Buffalo. I
          think a great city is a lot like a
          great recipe really. Put in some
          hard working citizens, add some
          care givers, maybe a few nuts...
The other news anchors and Evan himself chuckle at "his"
joke. Bruce listens on the feed, beyond stunned.
                     EVAN (CONT'D)
          All sprinkled with the strength and
          love of our good families, that
          ultimately creates a sweet place to
          live. Thank you.

              (touched)
          Wow. That was amazing. And now
          let's go live to wacky Bruce Nolan
          out at Niagara Falls.

          congratulations to Evan Baxter.
          It's good to see what someone with
          real talent can accomplish when
          great opportunities are given to
          him instead of me.
               (still smiling)
          Anyway, I'm here, I believe with
          Katherine Hepburn's mom. Tell me,

          of Titanic?
The Old Woman doesn't know what to say.

          Leonardo Decaprio freeze, while you
          were safe floating on the big door?
          Do you think he would have survived
          if you had taken turns, or were you
          too afraid to freeze your big fat
          ass off?

Bruce carries his box to his car, when he HEARS A NOISE.
A street GANG is hassling the HOMELESS SIGN GUY. Pushing him
around, breaking and painting over his signs.
Instinctively, Bruce walks over.
                    BRUCE
          Hey, come on guys. What are you
          doin'? Just leave him alone.
They turn, look at Bruce, laugh and head off.    Bruce helps
the Sign Guy up, looks after the Gang.

          Yeah, you'd better keep walkin'.
They stop cold, turn back to Bruce and CHARGE AT HIM. Bruce
attempts to run, but they leap on him in a big dog pile,
swinging and kicking.
Bruce is left with a bloody lip, lying beside his car. We
hear the sound of smashing glass and scratching metal and the
gang running off. Bruce slowly gets up.

          Oh, don't worry, he's not
          listening. If he is he doesn't
          care. Have you seen the news
          lately? We got gangs, we got
          drugs, we got corruption. What
          kind of God lets that happen?
          Every time we cure a disease he
          comes up with a new one!

          treatment for syphilis down there.
          I think it's time to release the
          tainted monkey. Oh, and there's a
          guy in Ohio who's praying for
          strength and wisdom, blind him and
          cut off his legs.
                    GRACE
          So God is torturing us?

          It's part of the mysterious plan.
Grace puts Sam outside. Returns, trying to calm Bruce.
                    GRACE
          Honey, you're mad right now. It's
          understandable. And what Evan did
          was slimy and wrong. But your job
          doesn't matter to me. You matter
          to me. You could've really been
          hurt. I'm just glad you're okay.

                    BRUCE
          Okay? News flash: I'm not okayi
          And I'm not okay with the fact that
          you think everything is okay. I'm
          not okay with a mediocre job. I'm
          not okay with a mediocre apartment.
          I'm not okay with a mediocre LIFE!
Bruce angrily swipes at the table knocking the photos and the
photo albums to floor.
                    GRACE
          Is that what you have, Bruce?
          A mediocre life? Well, I'm sorry
          for being a piece in your mediocre
          puzzle.
                    BRUCE
          Terrific. I'm drowning and you
          throw me a brick!
Grace starts to cry.

            Perfect! I'll have the worst day
            of my life with a side order of
            guilt, please. I-- I don't need

            you? Then talk back. Tell me
            what's going on? What should I

          no boils? Come on, you got me on
          the ropes, don't you want to finish
          me off?! You're the one who should
          be fired! The only one around here
          not doing his job is YOU! What are
          we, you're little pet project? A
          hobby you tinker with now and
          again? Answer me. ANSWER ME!!!
A beat of silence then Bruce's BEEPER GOES OFF. He cynically
chuckles at the timing, checks it, sees 772-5623.
                     BRUCE
           Sorry, don't know you, wouldn't
           call you if I did.
Bruce walks off toward his wrecked car, it BEEPS AGAIN.
                                             CUT TO:
CLOSE ON - AN ALARM CLOCK

The BEEPING continues. We are in. . .

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

Bruce wakes, slaps at the alarm clock, groggy, reaches for
the phone, finally realizes it's the beeper. He gets up,
begrudgingly, checks it. The same number.

                                                          32.



                    BRUCE
          Well, hello again 772-5623, don't
          hold your breath.
Bruce tosses the pager on the bed, heads for the bathroom.
The beeper BEEPS. Bruce stops in his tracks, turns, opens
the window, grabs the beeper and FIRES IT OUT. It SHATTERS
against a telephone pole. He calmly continues to the
bathroom.
INT. BATHROOM

A note is stuck in the bathroom mirror, with an old picture
of he and Grace in happier times. The note simply says:
"I LOVE YOU.    WE NEED TO TALK.
Grace"

Peering over top of the note, Bruce sees Sam circling on the
rug.
                       BRUCE
          Oh, no.
EXT. STAIR WELL - CONTINUOUS
Bruce runs down the stairs carrying the trickling, Sam.
EXT. APARTMENT - DAY

Bruce sets Sam on the grass. Sam looks up, finished.
                     BRUCE
          What's the point?
BEEP, BEEP, BEEP...

Bruce walks over to the shattered beeper. He picks up a
small piece of it containing the LED read out: 772-5623
ON BRUCE - AMAZED

                                         CUT TO:

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

A PHONE - BRUCE DIALS THE NUMBER

A PRERECORDED VOICE ANSWERS

                                                           33.



                       COMPUTERIZED VOICE
             Denied that promotion at work? Is
             life unfair? Everywhere you turn
             is there someone less talented than
             you reaping all the benefits ? Is
             your name Bruce? Then do we have
             the job for you. We're located at
             77256 23rd Street...
Bruce reaches for a pen, begins jotting down the address.
                       COMPUTERIZED VOICE
             So come on down, or we'll just keep
             beepin' ya.
EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
An old building on the outskirts of town. A faded sign
painted on the wall reads, OMNI PRESENTS.
Bruce's demolished car enters frame.      He studies the area and
building suspiciously.
Bruce cautiously moves towards the structure and then, STEPS
IN A PUDDLE. He SINKS UP TO HIS KNEE.
                        BRUCE
             Perfect.
He gets out, shakes off his sopping leg, and heads inside.
INT. OMNI PRESENTS - DAY
Bruce enters and checks the BUILDING DIRECTORY.      It reads:
OMNI PRESENTS UNLTD.

Pers onnel    Rm. 7
Ac coun ting Rm. 7
Security      Rm . 7
Creativ e     Rm. 7
                       VOICE (O.S.)
             You're looking for room 7.
Bruce turns to see a JANITOR mopping the floor.     He looks at
Bruce's wet leg, offers the mop.
                       JANITOR
             Want me to even those up for you?

                                                            34.


                     BRUCE
               (feigns a smile)
          How would I get to room 7?
                     JANITOR
          That'd be on the seventh floor.
          Stairs are right over there.
                     BRUCE
          What about the elevator?
He points to an elevator bank a couple of steps away.
                     JANITOR
          Out of order.
Bruce heads for the stairs.
                     JANITOR
          You mind giving me a hand with this
          floor?
                    BRUCE
          What? Yeah, I mind.
He continues on.

SEVENTH FLOOR

The stairwell door opens up to a LARGE ROOM with a SINGLE
DESK at the end of an otherwise empty space.
Bruce hears someone tinkering atop a tall ladder extending
into a hole in the ceiling.
                     BRUCE
          Excuse me. Hello. I'm, ah,
          looking for whoever runs this
          joint...
                     MAN (O.S.)
          Be right with y.a, just fixin' a
          light. Tell me if it's working?
CLICK and an INSANELY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATES, shining
down blinding Bruce.

                     BRUCE
          Yep, seems to be.
               (wiping his eyes)
          Kinda bright, though.

                                                         35.



An electrician, silhouetted in the bright light, descends the
ladder.
                    MAN (O.S.)
          Yeah, it is for most people. They
          spend their lives in the dark...
As he talks he steps down next to Bruce and we see that it is
the SAME JANITOR.
                      JANITOR (CONT'D)
          . . . thinkin' they can hide from me.
The two stand, angelically illuminated.    Bruce tries to put
everything together.
                    BRUCE
          Oh, the elevator's broken, huh?
                    JANITOR
          Yeah, but I'll get around to it.
The Janitor CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE and the light goes off.
                    BRUCE
          You installed a clapper?
                     JANITOR
          Nope.   Catchy jingle, though.
              (sings)
          CLAP ON. CLAP OFF.    CLAP ON, CLAP
          OFF. THE CLAPPER.
               (claps twice)
          You can't get it out of your head.
                    BRUCE
          I gotta go.
                    JANITOR
          Okay, but the boss'11 be right out.
The Janitor unzips his uniform, revealing a very nice suit.
He extends his hand to Bruce.
                    JANITOR
          You must be Bruce. I've been
          expecting you.
                    BRUCE
          Oh, this is hilarious. So you're
          the boss and the electrician and
          the janitor.

                                                         36.



                     JANITOR
          Nothin' wrong with rollin' up your
          sleeves, son. People underestimate
          the benefits of good 'ol manual
          labor. There's freedom in it.
          Happiest people in the world stink
          like hell at the end of the day.
He strolls down the room, takes a seat behind the big desk.
                     JANITOR
          Your father knew that. He was a
          damn good welder.
Bruce approaches the desk.
                     BRUCE
          How do you know my father? And how
          did you get my pager number?
                     JANITOR
          Oh, I know a lot about you Bruce.
          Pretty much everything there is to
          know. Everything you've ever said,
          done or thought about doin', is
          right there in that file cabinet.
He points out a single drawer file cabinet.
                     BRUCE
               (sarcastic)
          Wow, a whole drawer. Just for me?
          Mind if I take a look?
                     JANITOR
          It's your life.
Bruce pulls the drawer and it FLIES OPEN, DRAGGING HIM THE
FULL LENGTH OF THE ROOM --
The Janitor casually pulls a file.
                     JANITOR
          Now this last entry was a little
          disturbing.
He thumps the file cabinet with his fist and the drawer
dramatically sucks closed, DRAGGING BRUCE BACK. The Janitor
reads from the file.
                     JANITOR
               (reads, scanning)
          Thanks for everything, Lord.
                     (MORE)

                                                         37.

                      JANITOR (cont'd)
          I am so honored that my horrible
          demise is a part of your loving and
          mysterious plan.. The gloves are
          off, pal.. Smite me oh mighty
          smiter.
               (aside)
          I'm not much for blaspheming but
          that one made me laugh. Oh, and
          let's not forget "What kind of a
          God would let this happen? I mean,
          have you seen then news lately?"
Bruce stands, dazed. ·
                     BRUCE
          Who are you?
                     JANITOR
          I'm the creator of the heavens and
          the earth. I'm the alpha & omega.
          The first and the last.
                     BRUCE
          Sorry, it's not ringing a bell.
                     JANITOR/GOD
          I'm God, Bruce.
                     BRUCE
          Oh, you're God. Well that explains
          everything1 That's how you know
          everything about me. That's how
          you got up to the seventh floor so
          quickly.
               (placating)
          Well, it's really nice to meet you.
          Thanks for the Grand Canyon and,
          ah, good luck with the apocalypse.
Bruce turns to leave, BUT FINDS HIMSELF WALKING RIGHT TOWARD
GOD AND HIS DESK. He tries again, and again.
                     BRUCE
          Okay, I don't know how you're doing
          that, but I really gotta go. This
          place is obviously rigged in some
          way. We're on some freaky hidden
          camera show.
               (playing to the "cameras")
          ...for which I will not sign a
          release, by the way! But you know
          what, I'd be a little more
          impressed if you didn't use the
          cheesy file cabinet illusion.
                     (MORE)

                                                               38.

                        BRUCE      (cont'd)
              Everyone with a      brain in their head
              would know that      the drawer is being
·             fed through the       wall from behind--
    Bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall, sees it has a
    normal back.
                           BRUCE
              Okay.     That's good.   That's a good
              one.
    Bruce quickly puts his hands behind his back.
                        BRUCE
              Okay, God. How many fingers am I
              holding out?
    Bruce extends three fingers.
                           GOD
              Three.
    He quickly pulls one finger in.
                           GOD
              Two.
    Bruce begins switching fingers rapidly.      God doesn't miss a
    beat.
                        GOD
              Four. Nine. Six. Eight. One...
    One final attempt, Bruce holds seven fingers.
                        BRUCE
              Okay, how about now.
    He quickly pulls in two fingers.
                           GOD
              Seven.

                          .BRUCE
              AH HAl
    Bruce proudly presents his single hand of five extended
    fingers to God, then immediately notices he has SEVEN FINGERS
    ON HIS ONE HAND.

                          BRUCE
              AAAHHHl

                                                             39,



He shakes his fingers wildly and the two extra fingers
disappear. God approaches Bruce.
                    GOD
          You've been doing a lot of
          complaining about me, Bruce. And
          quite frankly, I'm tired of it...
Bruce backs away from God.
                    BRUCE
          You stay away from me! I don't
          know what your doing. But whatever
          you're doing is probably
          actionable!
                    GOD
          Well, that's not very neighborly.
          I brought you here to offer you a
          job.
                    BRUCE
          Job? Wh at job?
                     GOD
          My job. You think you can do it
          better, so here's your chance.
          When you leave this building you
          will be endowed with all my powers.
                    BRUCE
          Sure, whatever you say, Pal.
He turns to go but GOD STANDS BEFORE HIM in the Janitor
uniform, holding the mop.
                     GOD
          All the power of God.
Bruce glances back at the empty desk, turns back again and
God the Janitor has also vanished. A beat, then Bruce
sprints out of the room.
EXT. OMNI PRESENTS - DAY
Bruce barrels out of the building --
                     BRUCE
          Okay, that did not happen.
He races to his car stepping in the SAME PUDDLE, but this
time his foot doesn't sink, he WALKS RIGHT ACROSS IT. He
paus es f or a bea t --

                                                           40.



                     BRUCE
          No.

He races on.

INT. BRUCE'S CAR

Bruce jumps in, turns the key, the car turns over but doesn't
start.
                    BRUCE
          I'm having a breakdown. That's
          what it is. Just a normal,
          everyday psychotic episode, brought
          on by tumor or brain lesion...
We hear the car wind down to nothing. Bruce releases the key
pounds the steering wheel in frustration.
                    BRUCE
              (to the car)
          Come on, startI
The car INSTANTLY starts.
                     BRUCE
               (denial)
          Well, that was lucky.
Bruce backs up, peels out.
MUSIC UP: "HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD IN HIS HANDS"

EXT. CITY STREETS

Bruce drives, whistling the tune, catches himself,
immediately stops whistling.
                     BRUCE
          Okay, just relax here. I did not
          meet God and I do not have his
          powers.
               (laughs)
          If that was God, then I'm Mario
          Andretti.
Instantly, Bruce's car PEELS OUT, races through traffic,
dodging and passing cars right and left.
                     BRUCE
          AAAHHHHHHHH!J!

                                                            41.


Suddenly there is a GUY IN A RED PIT CREW SUIT standing
before Bruce waving a red flag. Bruce swerves to avoid the
man and SCREECHES into a pit stop. Several other red-suited
Italian men engulf the car. Bruce watches in amazement as the
professional racing team jacks up his car, slaps on HUGE MAG
TIRES, gases him up, etc. PAUL NEWMAN leans into the
driver's window.
                    PAUL NEWMAN
          Hey Mario, did you get that box of
          dressing I sent you?
Bruce responds against his will IN PERFECT ITALIAN --
                    BRUCE
              (in perfect Italian)
          Si, dovete venire sopra per il
          pranzo un certo tempo.
              (SUBTITLES: Yes, you must
               come over for dinner some
               time.)
Bruce reacts shocked.   The crew backs off and urges him on in
Italian.
                     PIT CREW
          Vete l Ve tel
Bruce's car peels out on it's own, he struggles to control
the wheel, finally pulling over to a curb. His car door
won't open so he has to crawl out of the driver's window.

He rushes onto the sidewalk, backing away from his normal
looking Tauras. Not knowing what to do, he slips into a
diner.
INT. DINER - DAY
Bruce quickly walks to a back corner booth. The only other
patron is an OLD MAN seated at the counter.
                    BRUCE
          It isn't real, it isn't real, it
          isn't real...
An older. Sally Kirkland-type WAITRESS, order pad in hand,
stands listening to Bruce with a raised eyebrow.
                    BRUCE
          Oh hi, ah, coffee please.
The waitress pours him a cup.

                                                         42.



                    WAITRESS
          We've got a special on soup today.

                    BRUCE
          No, that's okay.
                    WAITRESS
          It's tomato.
                    BRUCE
          Alright, okay.
She heads off.    Bruce sits thinking.   Could it be real?
He looks at the SUGAR down at the end of the table, holds out
his hand and the SUGAR SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE RIGHT INTO HIS
HAND. The CREAMER slides into his other hand.
Bruce is half scared, half thrilled. He pours some cream and
sugar into his cup, looks around the table.
                    BRUCE
          Excuse me I need a spoooo...
Bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his
napkin.
                     BRUCE
          That's alright, I found one.
The Old Man eyes Bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves
further down the counter.
The Waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back.
                     WAITRESS
          I lie to my sister.
                     BRUCE
          What?
                     WAITRESS
               (becoming emotional)
          And I'm sleeping with my best
          friend's husband. I know he's just
          using me but.. I'm just so tired of
          being alone. I don't know why I'm
          telling you all this. Just seems
          like you'd understand.
                     BRUCE
          Okay.

                                                       43.



                     WAITRESS
               (sets the check down)
          Take care of that whenever you're
          ready.
Bruce looks at the soup. His look grows intense.   He slowly
raises his hands over the soup bowl....
MUSIC UP: THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THEME

The front door blows open, as A WIND SWIRLS through the diner
and with all the flourish of Moses at the Red Sea, BRUCE
PARTS HIS RED SOUP.
A little cockroach scurries across the table, climbs up the
edge of the bowl and walks through to the other side.
                    GOD (O.S.)
          Havin' fun?
Bruce is startled and the soup splashes back to normal
collapsing on the cockroach. He looks up at God standing
beside the booth. Bruce is now awestruck.
                    BRUCE
          You- He- Thy...
                    GOD
          Let's take a walk.
EXT. LAKE ERIE - DAY

God leans down, lets the little soup covered cockroach go.
God and Bruce then walk along the lake shore.
                     GOD
               (re: the cockroach)
          Most people want to kill these
          guys. I'm quite fond of em'. Very
          streamlined design. Like little
          armored tanks. Y'know, they can
          hold their breath for forty minutes
          and their cells divide only once
          per molting cycle creating a
          cytoskeleton with cell adhesion
          that...
               (catching himself)
          Oh, this is a bit over your head,
          isn't it?
Off Bruce's look.

                                                        44.



                    GOD
          Okay, let me explain the rules.
                     BRUCE
          Rules ?
                    GOD
          Yeah, you left in such a rush I
          didn't get a chance to explain.
                    BRUCE
          Well the two extra fingers freaked
          me out a little bit.
                     GOD
               (laughs)
          I figured that would get your
          attention.. I did the same thing to
          Ghandi, he couldn't eat for three
          weeks. Now, here's the deal. You
          have all my power. Use it any way
          you choose. There are only two
          rules. You can't tell anyone
          you're God. Believe me you don't
          want that kind of attention. And
          you can't mess with free will.
                     BRUCE
          Uh huh.   Can I-ask why?
                    GOD
              (excited)
          Yes you can. That's the beauty it.
Suddenly a LARGE SAILBOAT SAIL PASSES RIGHT BY THEM.   Bruce
looks to the sail, oddly, then...
WIDE ANGLE - REVEAL God and Bruce are now walking ON THE LAKE
about 100 feet from the shore. They watch the sailboat pass.
Bruce is awestruck.
                     BRUCE
          This is amazing.
                     GOD
          Oh, speaking of amazing...
God dips his hand in the Lake and pulls out THE PRAYER BEADS.
He pockets them as he talks.

                                                         45.



                     GOD
           Since you're finished with these, I
           think I'll hang to 'em. Might come
           in handy someday.
WIDE MASTER - BUFFALO CITY-SCAPE

God and Bruce are tiny figures on the river, as God begins to
walk away.
                     GOD
           I'll be seein' ya.
                     BRUCE
           Where are you going?
                     GOD
           I'm taking a vacation.
                     BRUCE
           God can't take a vacation. Can he?
           Can you?
                     GOD
           Ever hear of the Dark Ages?
           Besides, I'm covered. You can fix
           everything in five minutes if you
           want to, right?
ON BRUCE
                       BRUCE
           ...Right.
Left alone, Bruce begins to carefully tip toe back to shore,
progresses to a full sprint.
INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

Grace and Debbie stand at the check-out stand. Grace flips
through a celeb magazine, as Debbie places the last few items
from the cart to the conveyor belt.
In the background, throughout, Debbie's daughter, Zoe is
grabbing random items off the shelves and placing them on the
belt.
                       GRACE
                (re: magazine)
           Gosh, this girl is so talented and
           all they ever talk about is her
           hair.

                                                       46.



                    DEBBIE
          Yeah, she should marry somebody
          famous, take the focus off.
Grace checks her cell phone screen.
                    DEBBIE
          We would have heard it ring.
                    GRACE
          I know. It's just that he usually
          calls during the day.
                    DEBBIE
          He just needs to blow off some
          steam, he'll be fine.
                    GRACE
          I hope so. I've never seen him                        *
          that mad. An d I lashed back--                        *
                    DEBBIE
          Wow, you lashed? You never lash.
          I'm impressed.
                    GRACE
          I feel bad for him.   He's wanted
          anchor for so long.
Zoe begins pulling groups of items onto the belt.
                    DEBBIE
          Well, I've been praying to win the
          lottery for fifteen years, but it's
          not going to happen. You know,
          it's not all about money.
The CLERK finishes ringing the last item.
                    CLERK
          That'll be four hundred and twenty-
          seven, eighty.-
                       DEBBIE
          What?!
Debbie looks in a bag, pulls out a handful of various counter
items. Zoe giggles and proudly holds up one of the hundred
or so Tic-Tac mint containers.
                      DEBBIE
          Zoe.
                 (to Clerk)
                       (MORE)

                                                           47.

                       DEBBIE (cont'd)
             Hang on, I might need you to un-
             check a few things.
The people in line hem and haw, exasperated.
                       GUY IN LINE
             Come on, lady.
                     DEBBIE
               (snaps)
          Hey, everybody back-off i
Zoe laughs, enjoying the commotion.
                     GRACE
          Listen, I better get back. I want
          to be there for him.
                    DEBBIE
          You're a saint, Grace.
                    GRACE
          What can I say, I love him. And if
          I know Bruce, he's out there
          wandering around with the weight of
          the world on his shoulders.

                                            CUT T0:

EXT. CITY STREETS - DUSK
Bruce struts down the street the embodiment of confidence.
He turns shooting a finger at a fire hydrant, it BLASTS
WATER. KIDS run off their front steps, start playing.
A PRETTY GIRL IN A DRESS, comes' walking toward him. As she
passes he BLOWS A LITTLE AIR OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH
and turns to watch her SKIRT FLY UP.
                    BRUCE
          And he saw that it was good.
He spots a    mannequin in a store window display, wearing a
cool, casu   al outfit. He closes his eyes. When he opens
them, HE'S   WEARING THE COOL NEW OUTFIT and the mannequin is
dressed in   his clothes. He checks his reflection. . . better.
Bruce rounds the corner, sees the SAME GANG that beat him up,
hanging out in the alley.
                    BRUCE
          B-e-a-utifull

                                                              48.


EXT. ALLEY

Bruce approaches the gang.
                       BRUCE
             Hey guys, remember me?
The gang members turn to Bruce.
                       HOOD #1
             Oh look, it's the hero.
                       HOOD #2
             Hungry for another can of whoop-
             ass?
                        HOOD #3
             Your stereo sounds great in my car,
             man.
He and a couple other gang members laugh and high-five.
                       BRUCE
             Look, I don't want to fight you
             guys. So as soon as you apologize,
             I'll be on my way.
A beat, then the Hoods BURST OUT LAUGHING.         A few circle
behind, surrounding Bruce.
                       HOOD #1
             Oh, yeah. I'll apologize... The
             day a monkey climbs out of my butt.
                        BRUCE
             What a coincidence. That's today.
The Hood gets a PAINED LOOK, starts gyrating around, then a
MONKEY comes climbing out the back of his baggy pants.
The Big Guy looks at Hood #1.
                       BIG GUY
             Did that come out of your butt,
             man?
Hood #1 faints from shock.
                       BRUCE
             Now I'm going to have to teach the
             rest of you guys a lesson.

                                                         49.



                     HOOD #2
           Yeah, you and whose army?
                     BRUCE
           Just me... and me...
ANOTHER BRUCE steps out from behind a stack of crates.
                     BRUCE
           And me, and me, and me, me, me, me,
           me and me and me.
As Bruce talks, DUPLICATE BRUCE'S begin popping out from
various spots, a doorway, hanging down from a fire escape, a
dumpster pops open, six Bruce's jump out.
                      BRUCE
           PILE ON THE RABBIT1
T HE B RUGES CONV ERGE ON TH E GA NG --

Hood #2 is instantly tackled by THREE BRUGES --
ONE BRUCE kneels down behind a hood, ANOTHER BRUCE pushes him
down over his back. The two Bruce's high-five --
A Hood climbs a fire escape. ONE BRUCE gives a hand up to
ANOTHER BRUCE, who takes pursuit. ANOTHER BRUCE leans out of
a window SMASHES a potted plant over his head --
ON THE MONKEY - SCREECHING, ENJOYING THE EXCITEMENT

Our Bruce stands in the middle of the action, happily
watching the mayhem.
                      HOOD #2
           Let's get out of here, manl
Hood #2 takes off running, the gang members follow.
                      BRUCE
           Okay guys, Kum Ba Yal
The Bruce's jog over, leaping and diving into Bruce's body.
                      BRUCE
           I'll take it from here.
Bruce takes a deep breath, OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE, RELEASING A
SWARM OF LOCUSTS --

                                                             50.



EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

The gang streams out of the alley screaming, COVERED IN
LOCUSTS.
Bruce exits the alley, the monkey at his side.        He looks down
to the monkey.
                     BRUCE
           Back home for you, little one.
The monkey takes off back into the alley, as we see HOOD #1
stumbling to his feet.
                       HOOD #1
           NoI   NOOOOO1
He takes off running, the monkey in hot pursuit.
ON BRUCE
He belches and one last locust flies out.      He reacts to the
unpleasant aftertaste and walks off.
                                            CUT TO:
CLOSE ON - BRUCE

We widen to an UP ANGLE of him standing on the top of
Buffalo's tallest SKYSCRAPER. Clouds swirl behind him. He
looks out over the vast city lights, opens his arms and
proclaims to the world.
                      BRUCE
           I AM THE LORD THY BRUCE ALMIGHTY.
           MY WILL BE DONE I
Bruce poses in dramatic god-like form, lightning crashes
behind him. He is an awesome god.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Grace sits on the floor next to the coffee table with a box
of photos working on the album. She takes a sip of wine,
sets down the glass. Sam walks over and laps up the wine.
                      GRACE
                (to Sam)
           Well, at least I have someone to
           drink with.
Grace hears Bruce coming up the stairs, singing.

                                                       51.



                     BRUCE
          What if God was one of us. . .
          Just a slob like one of us...
          Just a stranger on a bus...
          Trying to make his way. . .
Grace reacts a bit surprised by Bruce's happy tone, she gets
up, opens the door and there stands BRUCE, beaming smile,
holding a very unique BOUQUET OF FLOWERS.
                    BRUCE
              (finishing song)
          ...home.
                    GRACE
              (re: the flowers)
          Oh, my God.
                    BRUCE
          You can call me Bruce.
                    GRACE
          Where have you been? You're
          so...happy.
                     BRUCE
          Who wouldn't be on a night like
          this?
               (holding out the flowers)
          For you.
Grace takes the flowers, gives Bruce a kiss, still sizing up
his mood.
                    GRACE
          These are amazing. What are they?
                    BRUCE
          It's a totally new breed. A cross
          pollination between tulips and
          Daisies. I call them Todayzees.
                    GRACE
          Todayzees? Okay...
Grace goes to put them in water.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
                    GRACE
          Bruce, is there something you're
          not telling me?

                                                            52.


                    BRUCE
          Nothing of this world. Why?
                    GRACE
          What do you mean, why? Last night
          you weren't exactly happy with
          life.
                    BRUCE
          Last night, I was only human.
Bruce backs out of the kitchen seductively.
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Bruce breezes through, casually instructs the stereo as he
passes.
                    BRUCE
          CD 4, Track 7.
The Stereo illuminates and Barry White music plays.
EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
Bruce opens the doors, steps onto the balcony. He surveys
the cloudy sky, reaches up with his hand and ERASES THE
CLOUDS, LIKE ON A CHALKBOARD.
Still not completely satisfied he reaches up toward the moon
and makes a LASSOING MOTION, THEN BEGINS TO PULL.
                                          CUT TO:
OUTER SPACE - BEHIND THE MOON
Earth far off in the distance - And with a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE
the MOON starts MOVING CLOSER TO EARTH.
BACK TO SCENE
Bruce adds a finishing touch by adding several stars with
points of his finger.
Grace joins Bruce on the balcony and is taken aback by the
perfectly orchestrated sky.
                     GRACE
          Wow, it really cleared up. I've
          never seen the moon that big.
Bruce puts his arms around Grace from behind.

                                                        53.



                    BRUCE
          We shouldn't waste it.
Bruce starts kissing her neck. Grace turns, .they kiss and a
METEOR SHOWER lights the sky behind them. The kiss ends.
                       BRUCE
          Bedroom.
                    GRACE
          Five minutes.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Grace grabs a neglige from the drawer, heads into the
bathroom. Bruce enters, adjusts the ambience of the room,
BLOWS THE LIGHTS OUT with a quick puff of air, LIGHTS CANDLES
with a gesture. His clothes magically fall away.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Grace slips her neglige on, begins brushing her hair.
                    GRACE
          I'11 be out in a minute.

BRUCE
Standing at the door with both arms extended toward the
bathroom like an WARLOCK CASTING A SPELL. Suddenly the light
hits him from the open bathroom door and he quickly strikes a
casual pose.
Grace stands in the open doorway, panting like an animal.
She dives on Bruce, attacking him.

          desperate effort to rescue hundreds
          of people stranded by a freak tidal

Grace half watches the newscast as she finishes breakfast.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
Bruce lies blissfully asleep. Big smile, life is good.
Then, we hear WHISPERING - Like distant voices MURMURING all
at once. Bruce wakes with a start. He looks around puzzled,
sticks his finger in his ear checking his hearing as the
voices fade away.
ANGLE - SAM
Circling, getting ready to go on the carpet. Bruce casually
warns.
                    BRUCE

Sam looks at Bruce for a beat, then  walks into bathroom,
raises the toilet seat with his nos e, and STANDS UP ON HIS
TWO HIND LEGS, HOLDING HIS SNAUSAGE WITH HIS FRONT PAWS (NO,
WE DON'T SEE IT) AND STARTS TO GO.   He looks proudly back at
Bruce.

          Good boy.

Grace places breakfast on the table. Bruce comes out, fully
dressed with a spring in his step.
                     BRUCE
          Good morning.
                     GRACE
               (gushy-lovey, sing songy)
          Good morning. Cooked you grilled
          cheese.
                     BRUCE
          Oo, my favey.
Bruce sits, Grace sets down his plate, leans close.
                     GRACE
          Last night was just...
                      BRUCE
          Heavenly?
                      GRACE
          Mmm hmm.
Bruce enjoys his grilled cheese.
                      GRACE
          It's funny, but when I woke up this
          morning, It felt like my boobs were
          bigger.
Bruce looks away, guilty, trying to be nonchalant.
                     GRACE
               (holding them up)
          Do they look bigger to you?
                     BRUCE
          Huh? Ah, no, they, ah, look the
          same to me.

                                                            56.


They aren't.    They are clearly bigger.      She holds them.
                      GRACE
            They're definitely bigger.      They
            feel huge to me.
Bruce throws up his hands.
                       BRUCE
            You got me. Probably just a
            hormonal thing.
                 (takes a quick final bite)
            Well, enjoy your breakfast, I've
            gotta run.
                      GRACE
            Where are you going?
He stops, turns. A new confident Bruce.
                      BRUCE
            To get my job back.

          I certainly wouldn't want to be a
          fugitive on the run with Hank,
          Buffalo's number one police dog, on

          Yeah, I had a bad day. But things

          Well, go with that. It's served

Phil and a couple of his crew laugh, as they load the last of
their equipment into the van and shut the doors.

Phil turns back, Bruce and he exchange a glance.

Hank is DIGGING FURIOUSLY, making a BIG HOLE. The Policeman

          The body of Jimmy Hoffa was
          uncovered in a field today outside
          of a canine training center in
          Buffalo New York. Local Buffalo
          freelance field reporter Bruce
          Nolan was the first on the scene...

                                                         59.


We cut to the pre-taped story. Bruce stands with Hank and
his trainer before camera, the body being exhumed from the
ground behind him.
                    BRUCE
          Since the disapearence of Teamster
          president Jimmy Hoffa in the
          nineteen sixties, his whereabouts
          have remained one of this country's
          great unsolved mysteries. That is
          until just moments ago, when during
          a routine training session, a
          police dog named Hank sniffed his
          way right into the history books.
          As you can see behind us, the body
          is being carefully exhumed and will
          be transported to a hospital
          facility where DNA testing will
          confirm the identity. That, of
          course, only a formality as in a
          bizarre twist, the body was found
          buried with a birth certificate and
          complete set of dental records.
               (rubs Hank's neck)
          Sort of a two-in-one for Hank
          today, as moments later, he busted
          a local news camera crew with four
          kilo's of marijuana.
We see footage of PHIL AND HIS NEWS CREW, being cuffed on the
ground, as large stacks of marijuana plants are being pulled
from the van.

As Bruce pulls up in front of the building the NO PARKING
SIGN flies back into the bushes and the RED CURB TRANSFORMS

Bruce exits the car and smooths past the Homeless Sign Guy,
who sits in his usual spot. His sign reads:

Bobby CUTS BRUCE OFF WITH HIS CART.    Bruce is forced to stop.

          Tell you    what? I wasn't going to
          break it    open until lunch time, but
          I made a    batch of rhubarb that you
          have got    to try.

Bruce continues    off, as Bobby stops cold, adopts an odd
expression, then    his EYES ROLL UP IN THEIR SOCKETS, SPIN ALL
THE WAR AROUND,    THEN GLOW RED. LITTLE HORN BUMPS PUSH UP
FROM HIS SKULL.     He turns instantly demonic.

An overly PERKY FEMALE OFFICE WORKER approaches Bobby from
behind.
                     FEMALE OFFICE WORKER
          Hi, Bobby. Is there any of that
          split pea soup left?

Evan's voice suddenly becomes HIGH PITCHED, like a girls.

           ...Uh-hum, that the Chief of
           Police...
Evan tries to clear his throat again, but his voice remains
HIGH PITCHED.

                   Evan is starting to visibly sweat.

                   Evan shoots Susan a look to cover for him.        Susan tries to
                   cover with a joke.

EXT. FAIR GROUNDS - DAY
Bruce is bored off his ass, interviewing some BLUE HAIRED OLD
LADIES at the Mark Twain chili cook off.
                    BLUE HAIRED LADY
              (talks so slow you want to
               kill yourself)
          My secret is I let the jalapeno's
          marinade in a spicy sauce for over
          24 hours before I--
We see Bruce's pained face, realizing what horrible news this
is, when he gets an idea and SCHWWWWWAAAAAAM!11 AN ASTEROID
CRASHES to earth behind them.
                     BRUCE
          Hold that thought, Hazel!
               (Bruce walks back toward
                the explosion)
          It seems some type of meteor or
          asteroid has, by chance, hit the
          earth right behind the Mark Twain
          Chili Cook Off. . .

                 budge)
           My rip cord appears to be a bit
           stuck.
Bruce yanks again harder, nothing, then again and the cord
rips free from the suit.

                        BRUCE
              This is a very unfortunate turn of
              events. I'm heading toward the
              earth at a very precarious speed...
The cameraman pops his shoot and we see Bruce continue to
stream toward the ground below. He falls into a wooded area.
A CAMERA ON THE GROUND picks up the coverage, runs through
the brush with other BYSTANDERS to find Bruce laying on top
of a BIG, HAIRY CREATURE.
                         BYSTANDERS (O.S.)
              He's okay...What's that?...It's

              Oh, honey, would you hand me the
              scissors?
Bruce diverts his attention, when the Sabers screw up and the
crowd GROANS. Bruce immediately turns, looks intently at the
puck and GOAL, SABERS! THE CROWD ROARS!

           problem today.
REVEAL A MALE PANDA wholeheartedly humping another PANDA.

WIDE SHOT of the enclosure - PANDA'S are coupled off and
humping everywhere. Mothers are frantically covering
children's eyes, ushering them away from the exhibit.

          So this is what success buys you.
                    GRACE
          I guess.
              (wiggling around)
          I feel like a human taquito.
                    DEBBIE
          Well, thank Mr. Exclusive for me.
          He's on a quite a roll. What'd he
          do make a deal with the devil?
                     GRACE
          And he's taking me out tonight to
          dinner at Chez L'Amour.
                     DEBBIE
          Well, la-ti-da. Mike's idea of a
          romantic evening is Chez Sizzler.

          EstS para su grasa.
                    DEBBIE
          Grasa? Doesn't that mean fat?

                                                          71.

          Afraid so.
Debbie eyes Margarita.
                    GRACE
              (gushing)
          So, Bruce said and I quote:
          "Prepare yourself for an amazing
          evening that will change our lives
          forever."
Margarita reaches Debbie's waist and YANKS tightly.
                     DEBBIE
          Good - you wouldn't want to leave
          any spare oxygen in there.
               (back to Grace)
          Wait a second, you don't think he's
          going to propose, do you?
                    GRACE
          I don't think anything.
                       DEBBIE
          You do. You think he's going to
          propose.
                       GRACE
          Well, he's always said when he gets
          his career together, you know...
          And his career is more than
          together. I mean, come on, Chez
          L'Amour. Change our lives...
                       DEBBIE
          I don't know, hun. I mean, I like
          Bruce but that man's priority list
          is him, him, him, then him some
          more and then you.
                     GRACE
          Well, he just might surprise you.
                     DEBBIE
          That's what I'm worried about.
               (re: Margarita)
          Careful, you missed a spot of free
          flowing circulation.
Margarita senses the attitude and pulls tighter. Debbie
reacts.

                                                         72.


                    DEBBIE
          That'd do it.
Margarita motions for Debbie to lay down and leaves.    Debbie
struggles to lay down.
                    DEBBIE
          Let's see, how do I--
Debbie slides to the ground, Grace cracks up, gets up to
help, but also in mummy wrap, topples on top of her. They
both laugh and struggling to get up.
Hearing the ruckus, Margarita enters and gasps.
                       MARGARITA
          Lesbianas1
Grace and Debbie crack up harder.
                    DEBBIE
          Hey, I'll take that over fat...
Margarita tries to pull them up, but falls too.
                    MARGARITA
          No sexo, no sexol
Grace and Debbie can't stop laughing.
INT. CHEZ L'AMOUR - NIGHT
A waiter pours the first trickle of wine into Bruce's glass.
Bruce whiffs it, tastes it.
                    BRUCE
          Very good. If you run out just
          bring me some water, I'll take it
          from there.
Grace looks over the menu as Bruce notices people at various
tables eyeing him. He glances up to a ceiling light and
REDIRECTS IT with his mind, so it SPOTLIGHTS HIM in golden
light.
TWO CUTE GIRLS with dates SMILE and wave.     He waves back.
                       GRACE
          Should we ask for a more private
          table?

                                                         73,



                    BRUCE
          Huh? Oh, no this is fine right
          here.
Bruce looks at Grace lovingly.      He takes her hand.
                    BRUCE
          I was going to wait until after the
          meal, but I think it's going to
          just bust out of me if I don't do
          it now.
Grace beams, looks at Bruce with total love.
                       BRUCE
          You ready?
                    GRACE
              (nervous)
          I think so.
                    BRUCE
          I got anchor.
Grace's face falls.    She does her best to cover.
                       BRUCE
          Evidently, they're having problems
          with Evan. He's finishing up the
          week and I go live Monday.
                    GRACE
          That's great, honey.
          Congratulations. Wow. So that's
          what's tonight is about?
                       BRUCE
          Well, yeah. Grace, I got anchor.
          We got anchor!
She's having a hard time covering her let down.
                     BRUCE
               (noticing her flat
                reaction)
          What's the matter?
                       GRACE
          Well, to be honest, I thought that
          maybe tonight, you--
The TWO CUTE GIRLS interrupt, approach Bruce.

                                                                       74.



                                  CUTE GIRL #1
                       I'm sorry, but we had to come over.
                       We just think you're amazing and...
                                 CUTE GIRL #2
                       Well, we can't believe it's you!
             They both laugh, Bruce enjoys the attention.
                                  BRUCE
                            (laughing along)
                       Yep, it's me.
                                  CUTE GIRL #1
                       Can we get a picture with you?
                                  BRUCE
                       Well, sure.
                            (glances to Grace)
                       Just one second, hun.
                            (leans to Grace)
                       Fans. We better get used to this,
                       huh?
             Grace sits watching the two girls take turns sitting on
             Bruce's lap, taking pictures. Sees Bruce relishing in the
             attention. One girl gives Bruce a peck on the cheek and they
r"sS!w^w!s
             leave. Grace is clearly upset.
                                  GRACE
                       You have lipstick on your face.
                                  BRUCE
                       Oh, thanks...
                                 GRACE
                       Bruce, we need to talk. I thought
                       we had an understanding--
             Suddenly, the WHISPERS start again. Bruce looks around,
             figures it's coming from the restaurant patrons.
                                 BRUCE
                       Wow. It's kind of loud in here.
             Grace looks around the quiet romantic setting.
                                 GRACE
                       What are you talking about? It's
                       not loud.
             The WHISPERS GROW IN VOLUME.

                                                         75.



                     BRUCE
          Geez...
               (shouts to the restaurant)
-----   - COULD YOU ~KEEP TT DOWNl---  --
                     GRACE
          Bruce, this isn't funny.
                       BRUCE
               (talking loud .over the
                "racket")
          WHAT? WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME FOR A
          SECOND?
He gets up and darts off.
INT. CHEZ L'AMOUR KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Bruce races through the restaurant kitchen holding his ears -
EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
He BURSTS out the kitchen exit into the alley. Unclasps his
ears, but no relief. The whispers are now loud voices. We
start to make out fragments of words "Please," "Help me,"
etc.
Overwhelmed and scared, he slides down the alley wall,
covering his face, then TOTAL SILENCE --
Bruce lowers his hands and finds himself SITTING ATOP A HIGH
MOUNTAIN PEAK.
                     GOD (O.S.)
          Really something isn't it?
God sits down next to Bruce.
                    BRUCE
          Is this heaven?
God laughs at this one.
                     GOD
          It's Everest. You should try
          flipping on the Discovery Channel
          every now and then. Well, I guess
          you can't now, being dead and all.
                       BRUCE
          I'm dead?I
God laughs.

                                                         76.



                    GOD
          No, I'm just messing with you.
                    BRUCE
          Those voices...
                    GOD
          They're prayers, Bruce. You keep
          ignoring them and they're going to
          build up on. you like that. You
          didn't think being God was going to
          be all fun and games did you?
                    BRUCE
          Prayers? Those are prayers? Why
          can't I understand them?
God forms a snowball in his hands as he talks.
                    GOD
          You aren't listening, son. Let's
          see, you've had my powers for over
          a week now and how many people have
          you helped?
                     BRUCE
          Okay, so maybe I've righted a
          couple of the wrongs in my own
          life. I was going to get around to
          others. I can do both. I can help
          the world.
                    GOD
          The world? That wasn't the world,
          Bruce. That was just Buffalo,
          between Commonwealth and 57th.
          Didn't want to start you out with
          more than you can handle. Now how
          you doing otherwise? Personal life
          in good shape?
                    BRUCE
          Yeah. Everything is great.
A DOORWAY OPENS like a crack in space. Grace steps out, sees
Bruce.
                     GRACE
          Bruce? What are you doing out
          here?
With that, the terrain TRANSFORMS back into the alley where
Grace has been standing all along. She can not see .God.

                                               77,



                     BRUCE
          Oh, ah,
               (to God)
          She can't...
               (God shakes his head, back
                to Grace)
          I just, ah, needed a little fresh
          air.
Bruce fakes a couple big breaths.
                    GRACE
          Bruce, what is going on? The
          second I want to talk about us you
          run out on me.
                     GOD
               (to Bruce)
          Everything's great, huh?
                    BRUCE
          I wasn't running out on you...
                    GRACE
          You know, I actually had the crazy
          idea that you were going to ask me
          to marry you tonight.
                    GOD
          Now it's heating up.
                     BRUCE
               (to God)
          You are not helping.
              (back to Grace)
          ...me at all here, Grace.
                     GOD
               (sarcastic)
          Nice recovery.
Bruce looks to God to shut up.
                    GRACE
          Not helping you what?
                    BRUCE
              (to Grace)
          Look hun, I want to talk about
          this. This just isn't a good time.
          Okay?

                                                               78.


                    GRACE
          When is it a good time? It's never
          a good time.
                        GOD
              She's got a point.
                        BRUCE
                  (to God)
              Stay out of this.
Grace looks at him like he's nuts.
                                                           *

                    GRACE
          Who are you talking to?!
Just then, the WHISPERS start in again.        Bruce reacts.
                        BRUCE
              Oh, not now.
Bruce puts his hands to his ears.       Grace takes this as him
not wanting to listen to her.
                        GOD
          You're going to have to answer
          those things, y'know.
                        GRACE
          Fin e. Yo u kn ow wh at? I 'm go in g t o
          go home and if by some miracle it                          *
          suddenly becomes a 'good time', you                        *
          know where to find me.                                     *
               (starts out, then)                                    *
          And speaking of time, you're                               *
          running out of it.                                         *
Grace heads back into the restaurant. Bruce stands
completely frustrated.
                     BRUCE
              (to God)
          Thank you.
                     GOD
          You want some friendly advice?
                        BRUCE
          No.
God smiles.

                                                               79.



                         GOD
               You wanted the job, Bruce.     I                        *
               suggest you get to it.                                  *
     INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - DAY                            *

     Grace is asleep in the bedroom while Bruce paces in the           *
     living room.                                                      *

     He concentrates for a second and in an instant, the WHISPERS      *
     start in.
                           BRUCE
               Okay, first off, this creepy
               whisper thing has got to go.
                    (paces)
               Organization and management. I

     Bruce WAVES HIS HAND---                                           *
     Instantly, the room is JAMMED FULL OF FILE. CABINETS.             *

                Too b ulky. Ah! Praye r po st-it s!                  *
     Instantly, the files are gone and millions of POST-IT'S, EACH *

     themselves to everything in the room.                           *
     Bruce himself becomes a big post-it mummy. He pulls the one *

"1,567,432 unread messages"                                        *

          Whoa.                                                    *
Suddenly, Grace bounds out of the bathroom.                        *
                     GRACE
          Okay, this is getting ridiculous I
Grace's boobs are enormous! A healthy D-cup.
                    GRACE
          I have to see a doctor. There's
          definitely something wrong with me.
                                                                       *
Bruce jumps up from the computer, hides what he's doing...
                       BRUCE
          No.     You look great.
                       GRACE
          I look like a hooker I My whole
          body is changing.
She turns profile, her back sways causing her ass to stick
out.
                       GRACE
          My back didn't used to arch like
          this.
Bruce gets up, walks to Grace.
                     BRUCE
          I think you look amazing.                                *

                                                         81.


                     GRACE
          Bruce, I feel like our relationship
          is becoming all about sex.
                     BRUCE
          No it's not. Come on, give me a

          No, Bruce. Come on.                                   *
She breaks away and sees the computer is on.                    *
                      GRACE                                     *
           What's that? What are you doing?                     *
Bruce tries to cover.                                           *
                     BRUCE                                      *

                     GRACE                                      *
          Is this why you didn't come to bed?                   *
                     BRUCE                                      *
          No, ah...Honey, you're going to be                    *
          late.
                     GRACE
          No, I'm not.
Bruce looks over Grace's shoulder and ADJUSTS THE CLOCK FORTY
MINUTES FORWARD. Grace turns and is surprised.
                     GRACE
          Oh my goshI How did I sleep this
          late? I've got to run. Are you
          giving me a ride?
                     BRUCE
          Don't need to.
Bruce motions to the window. Grace walks over, looks out and

          Yes to you, loyal Sabers fan. And
          no to you.

          We'll have the money. Listen to me

          national, and then you and I are

Mission accomplished.                           *
          BRUCE
Honestly, I thought you'd be a
little more appreciative.
          GRACE
Appreciative of what? The fact
that you didn't include me on a
major life decision or that we now
live in the Sultan of Bernai's                  *
house?                                          *
            BRUCE
     (under his breath)
Like pearls to swine.
          GRACE
What is that supposed to mean?
          BRUCE
Let those with ears hear.
          GRACE
What is happening to you? You're
changing.

            BRUCE
Exa ct ly. F or th e bet te r. I' m not
poor and s truggling . And mayb e
that threatens you. I'm telling
you, there are plenty of women who
would love this place.
            GRACE
Yeah, and so would their pimps.                 *
           BRUCE                                *
I can't believe this. I did all                 *
this for us.                                    *
            GRACE                               *
Us ? W hat us? Yo u a lwa ys said wh en         *
your career takes off we'd get                  *
married. What happened to that us?              *

                                                          90.



                     BRUCE
           I want that.
                    GRACE                                       *
           'That'. You can't even say the                       *
          word.                                                 *
                     BRUCE                                      *
          Marriage, I want marriage, okay.                      *
          It's just not a great time right
          now.
                     GRACE
          Not a great time. What is that,
          your mantra? This is never going
          to change. . .
Grace heads down the stairs.                                    *
                    BRUCE
          Come on Grace, lighten up.                            .*
          Tomorrow's Saturday. The office is                    *
          throwing me a party here, for
          getting anchor. Let's enjoy the
          ride for a whi le. We're just
          starting to have some fun.
                      GRACE
           No, you're just starting to have
           fun.
Suddenly, the TOILET FLUSHES off camera. Grace sees Sam in
the bathroom spraying some deodorizer before he exits.
                      GRACE
           And what in God's name is going on
           with that dogI?
Grace pulls her cell phone .out of her purse, heads for the
door.
                     GRACE
          I'm going to have Debbie pick me
          up.
                     BRUCE
          Grace.
                     GRACE
          I'm sorry, but    I won't be attending
          your little pa   rty tomorrow. And if                 *
          you would like    to see me after I
          will be at our   home.                                *

                                                           91.


She starts out.
                      GRACE (CONT'D)
           Oh, and that poor, struggling guy
           you talked about? I miss him.
ON BRUCE - BUMMED

PARTY MUSIC UP:
INT. UPSCALE HOME - NIGHT
The PARTY OF PARTIES is in order. The place is jam packed
with co-workers, fellow reporters, and various news contacts
Everyone is in an ecstatic mood, many prayers having been
recently answered. We MOVE THROUGH THE PARTY and hear
snippets of various conversations.
                     BUSINESSMAN
           I'll drink to that! My tech stocks
           tripled in five days.
They clink glasses.
                     WOMAN
           You seem taller.
                      JOE
           I am!
                     FATHER TYPE
           My son pitched a no hitter!
                      HEAVYISH WOMAN
           I lost 47 Ibs on the Krispy Kreme
           diet.
ON SAM
Walking on his hind legs, delivers a cold beer to Bruce.
ON BRUCE
Well on his way to plastered, takes a swig, then glances at
the beer.
                      BRUCE
                (to Sam)
           Hello...
               (pointing to bottle)
           Corona. Lime next time?

                                                           92.



Sam walks away, his tail between his legs.
Bruce maneuvers down the hall dancing, high-fiving, drunkenly *
accepting the praise coming at him from all sides.              *
                     PARTIERS
          There he is. . . The manI.. All
          hail our new anchor!I
                    BRUCE
          Bless you. Bless you.
                     PARTYING SPORTS GUY
          Hey Bruce, who do you like in the
          game tonight?
                     BRUCE
          Put your money on the Sabers.
          Coach prays a lot.
A FRENCH WAITER approaches Bruce.

                     FRENCH WAITER
          Ah, Mr. Nolan, we're running out of
          hors doerves. I'm afraid we under-
          ordered, sir. And the people are
          hungry.
                     BRUCE
          What do you have left?
The Waiter holds up a small basket.
                     FRENCH WAITER
          Only three chips and two shrimp.
                     BRUCE
               (confident)
          Just take it around.
The Waiter gets a confused look.
                                            CUT TO:
CHIPS OVERFLOWING, SHRIMP SPILLING OUT OF BASKETS, HANDS
REACHING GLUTTONOUSLY FOR THE BOUNTY.

The Waiter walks along amazed as handfuls of shrimp and chips
are pulled from the small basket.
Partiers crowd around Bruce, start to chant.

                                                          93.



                      CROWD
          Speech!   Speech!!   Speech!

Bruce takes center stage, quiets the crowd.
                      BRUCE
          I ' d thank you all for coming, but
          the liquor is free so maybe you
          should THANK ME!
Everyone laughs.

                     BRUCE
          And now let me tell you a story.
          There was a man who had two sons.
          The younger son took his
          inheritance and squandered his
          money on a life of lust and
          debauchery. I LOVE THAT GUY!!

Everyone throws their hands up and continues to party.

Bruce's big smile fades. He looks around the room, hoping to
spot Grace. He grabs a phone, walks out to the balcony,
di al s --

He gets their answering machine, hears their outgoing message
together from happier times. He hangs up.

                       FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey there.

Bruce turns, sees SUSAN ORTEGA, completely stunning in a sexy
dress.
                     SUSAN
          Hi Br uce. What are you d oing out
          here all alone?
                     BRUCE
          Oh, ah, I was calling Grace.

                       SUSAN
          Yeah, I didn't see her in there. I
          love the new place, by the way. So
          how are you and Grace doing?
                     BRUCE
          I don't know, we had a fight
          earlier. Ever since I . . Well,
          things are different now and...

                                                           94.



                     SUSAN
          You're on fire Bruce. Some women
          can't handle fire. Some can.
Susan smooths close to Bruce.
                     SUSAN
          You know, I always had an instinct
          about you. I knew you were going
          to make something of yourself.
                     BRUCE
          Really?
                     SUSAN
          There's something special about you
          Bruce. I like special...
                    BRUCE
          Look Susan, I don't know, I--
Susan grabs Bruce, kisses him passionately. Bruce doesn't
join in, but doesn't fight it either.
ANGLE - THE FRONT DOOR

Grace and Debbie enter.

                     DEBBIE
          So this is your new place, huh?
                     GRACE
          Cozy, don't you think? Come on
          help me find him.
They head into the room.
                     DEBBIE
          You sure you want to do this?
                     GRACE
          I don't know. It's his big night.                      *
          I don't want to spoil it. I know                  .    *
          how much this means to him.                            *
                     DEBBIE                                      *
                                                                 *
          So much for lashing back...
Grace stops dead in her tracks. Her face drops.
GRACE'S POV - BRUCE, still lip-locked with Susan Ortega.

                                                       95.



                     DEBBIE
          Oh, boy.

Bruce turns and sees Grace.
                     BRUCE
          Grace, I...
                     GRACE
             . (fighting back tears)
          Get the car, Deb.
                     DEBBIE
          Right.

                    BRUCE
          Grace, wait.
Grace follows Debbie out.
EXT. UPSCALE HOME - NIGHT
Bruce follows Grace outside.
                    BRUCE
          Grace, come on.
Grace stops, opens her purse, tosses the keys to her new car
in Bruce's chest.
                     GRACE
          Here. I do n't w ant your car. I
          don't want your things. . . I don't
          want you.
                     BRUCE
          Come on, don't say that. I was
          just calling y ou--
                     GRACE
          And you thought Susan's mouth was
          the phone?
                    BRUCE
         I didn't think you were coming-- I
         mean, I . . . I screwed up, okay.
         Let me make it up to you.
                    GRACE
          How about a boat, Bruce?

                    BRUCE
          If that's what you want.

                                                        96.



                     GRACE
          Yeah, a big boat and oh, maybe two
          bags of cash, you know, the ones
          with the big cartoon dollar signs
          on the front. Then I'll be happy.
          Because I'm just hollow inside.
          Debbie's been right. All this
          time. I defended you, told her
          there was good in you. Another
          side to you. Well, I just saw that
          other side and I don't want
          anything to do with it.
Debbie pulls up, Grace storms off to the car. Bruce follows,
                     BRUCE
          Grace, come on, don't do this.
                     GRACE
          Go back to your little co-anchor.
          Or is that ho-anchor?
               (tearing)
          I came back here to apologize. How
          stupid am I?
Grace turns and heads to the car.
                     BRUCE
          You're the one that didn't like the
          new place!
Grace gets in, slams the door.
                    BRUCE
          You can't walk out on me! I'm the
          alpha, lady! I'm the Omega!
Debbie peels out.
                     BRUCE
               (desperate last attempt)
          I could make you stay!
Bruce is left alone in the middle of the street.
                    BRUCE
          Fine! I don't need you! I have
          everything I need. Did you hear
          that?!
               (yelling)
          I have EVERYTHING!

                                                      97.


INT. UPSCALE HOME - MOMENTS LATER
Bruce walks in, Susan is waiting for him.
                     SUSAN
           I was right. She couldn't handle
           the fire.
                                                             *
Bruce looks at Susan with disgust, then glances to a FIRE
ALARM on the wall, mentally TRIGGERS IT. The sprinklers turn
on, as well. People scream, rush toward the exit.
Bruce sits down on the sofa, being rained on by the
sprinklers, alone. He finally plops back and God is sitting
next to him.
                     GOD
          Enjoying your party? Yeah, nothing
          like spending time with some real
          frien ds. Any s hrimp left ?
                     BRUCE
           Grace left me.
                     GOD
           I know.
                     BRUCE
               (certain)
          She'll take me back.
               (uncertain)
          Will she take me back?
                     GOD
          Would you take you back?
Bruce mulls this over,- then...
                     BRUCE
          How do you make someone love you
          when you can't effect free will?
                     GOD
          Welcome to my world, son. You come
          up with an answer to that one, you
          let me know.
Off of Bruce thinking...
                                            CUT TO:

                                                          98.



INT. DEBBIE AND MIKE'S HOUSE - MORNING
Grace's alarm goes off. The radio comes on and it plays a
John Cougar Mellencamp song. But the lyrics are different.
                     JOHN COUGAR MELLENCAMP
           Here's a little ditty,
           about Grace and her man Bruce,
           two Americans growing up,
           needing to make a truce.
Grace's eyes pop open.    Is she dreaming?
EXT. DEBBIE'S HOUSE
Bruce hides behind a hedge, watches Grace jog past.
ON GRACE
notices something    CARVED IN THE TREE it reads: "GRACE +
BRUCE". Carved in     the next tree, "A COUPLE FOR THE AGES".
Carved in the next    tree, "COME ON ALREADY, GIVE HIM ANOTHER
CHANCE". She does     a double take, continues on.
INT. COFFEE SHOP

Grace reaches in her purse to pay for her coffee and a bunch
of PICTURES FALL OUT. They are all of Bruce and Grace. She
thinks, definitely didn't -put them there.
INT. SMALL WONDER'S DAY CARE - DAY

Grace is helping one of the kids, when she notices something
outside the window. It's a cloud formation that strangely
looks like BRUCE (in profile) HOLDING HANDS WITH GRACE. She
reacts as the imagery melts away into a very faint "FORGIVE
HIM."
EXT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - LATER

Grace is talking with one of the other teachers. The kids,
playing dodgeball in the background, laugh and scream louder
and louder. Grace turns and sees...
Bruce getting pelted by multiple balls.
                      BRUCE
           Okay, surrender, surrender.
He walks over to Grace.
                      BRUCE
           Hi.

                                                         99.



                       GRACE
          Hi..
                    BRUCE
          I, ah, have my first anchor
          tonight.
                    GRACE
          That's great. I hope it goes well
          for you.
He's hit in the head by a ball.    Grace can't help but smiles
Bruce leaps at the opportunity.
                    BRUCE
          I miss you.
              (off her silence)
          I just took the first step, shot
          myself out on the ledge, awaiting
          vulnerably your response.
                      GRACE
          . . . I don't know what to say.
                    BRUCE
          How about you love me and you'll
          take me back.
                       GRACE
          No, Bruce.
                    BRUCE
          Come on, what about all the signs?
                    GRACE
          What? How do you know about that?
          Did you talk to Debbie?
                      BRUCE
               (beat)
          Would it help if I told you I acted
          like an ass?
Martin is standing nearby.
                    MARTIN
          Hey, you said ass.
                    BRUCE
          It's okay as long as you mean a
          donkey. I didn't add "hole." It's
          only bad when you say "ass-ho--

                                                        100.


                      GRACE
           Alright, inside, Martin.
                (to the others)
           Okay everyone, inside.
The kids race in. Grace starts to follow.
                     BRUCE

           I have to go...                                      *
She starts off. . .
                      BRUCE
           Wait.
Bruce DRAMATICALLY RAISES A HAND TOWARD GRACE, like putting a
love spell on her.
                     BRUCE
           Now how do you feel?
She looks at him, oddly.
                      GRACE
           ...Are you out of your mind? Have
           you been drinking?
                       BRUCE

Bruce RAISES BOTH HANDS IN FULL HEXING FASHION...

                      GRACE
                (a beat)
           You need help.
She heads back inside. Bruce throws his hands in the air,
frustrated.
EXT. SMALL WONDER'S PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
Bruce heads for his car as he sees a two guys in PRISON SUITS
(from the prison yard) drive off with it.

                                                         101.

                    BRUCE
          Thou shalt not steal.
The prisoners JUMP.
                    BRUCE
          Car, show them the way out.
Instantly, the car doors fly open and the seats tilt sideways
dumping the prisoners.
                     BRUCE
          What is wrong with the world?

ON JACK
                     JACK
          The world's gone mad.
Jack clicks off the monitor. Bruce hustles in from make-up.
An air of forced confidence about him. Nothing and no one is
going to ruin his big moment.
                     JACK
          Oh, there you are. Your big debut.
          How you feeling?
                     BRUCE
          You know what? I'm good. The show
          must go on.
Bruce sits in the anchor desk, breathes in the reality.
                     SUSAN
               (whispers)
          Bruce, if I had any idea Grace was
          going to be there last night...

          Oh, really. . . that's nice.
                     JACK
          Okay, the Sabers just won the
          Stanley Cup. It's getting pretty
          crazy out there. We're going to
          kick live to Fred at the stadium.
          Oh, and Bruce, you won the pool
          again. Exact score, dead on.
          Twenty-three to one, who would have
          thought.

                                                               103.

    Bruce nods, straightens in his chair, prepares for his dream
    ON THE MONITOR
    The Eyewitness News opening plays, then fades away to Bruce
    and Susan.

              What happened? What the hell
              happened?
    The Stage Manager listens to his wire.
                         STAGE MANAGER
              We lost the signal. It's another
              power surge.
                         JACK
              Aw, geez. Ever since that damn
              asteroid hit.
    The power comes back up.
                         STAGE MANAGER
              We're back.

                         SUSAN
              We apologize for the interruption,
              and now back to the news. Bruce. . .

              Thank you, Susan--
    Susan gets a feed in her earpiece.

          won the Stanley cup. Fred...
Bruce is noticeably bothered.

          Tucker who has lead the Sabers to

ON BRUCE'S mounting frustration. He gives a look.
                     FRED
          Tell me coach...
Fred's face registers A PAINED LOOK. He tries to keep it
together. A beat of silence...

The Stage Manager again listens to his wire.

                     STAGE MANAGER
          The whole booth is down.
CRASH! A BRICK flies through a front window.       Bruce turns to
see...
EXT. DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

A FULL ON RIOT in progress. College students, city dwellers
going crazy. Cars are burning, people are out of control.
Escaped convicts are running in and out of stores looting
right alongside ordinary citizens.
The Kowolski brothers and Momma Kowolski are helpless against
the onslaught as pillagers run out of the bakery carrying
cakes, pies, bread - whatever they can get their hands on.
Bruce stumbles through the mayhem, confused.
                    BRUCE
          What's going on?
                    COLLEGE KIDS

Cars are being rolled over. A lone POLICE OFFICER protects
himself with his shield as he's pelted with various debris.
The Officer PULLS BRUCE down behind a car.
                       POLICE OFFICE
          Stay down.

                     BRUCE

                       POLICE OFFICE
          What other    officers? Half the

          "ship came    in." You better get
          home pal. I   t's dangerous out here.
The Officer heads out. Bruce stands, then quickly DUCKS, as
a bottle is tossed through a window that has a lotto sticker
on it.

BACK TO SCENE

Bruce looks up at a burning building with a flaming "Mr.
Exclusive" billboard above - it comes CRASHING DOWN. Bruce
looks out over the rioters.
ON BRUCE

We see the anger build in his face, like Moses looking down
on the Israelites. He RAISES HIS ARMS. DARK CLOUDS SWIRL IN
THE SKY. WIND BLOWS. LIGHTENING CRACKS.

                     BRUCE
           Hear, O' Buffalo, you have awakened
           my wrath. Vengeance is mine!
A BOLT OF LIGHTENING shoots right into the middle of the
rioters, scattering them. People flee in every direction as
THUNDER CRASHES and lightning bolts continue to strike.
Bruce stands alone in the street, surveys the smoldering
mayhem, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out the key
God gave him. He grips it tightly and...

Bruce stands there, sees God as he originally found him,
mopping. God looks up at Bruce, not surprised to see him.
                     BRUCE
           They're all out of control. I
           don't know what to do.

satisfied.

          There we go. Wonderful thing. No
          matter how filthy something gets,
          it can always be cleaned right up.
God collects Bruce's mop.
                    BRUCE
          What happened? I gave everyone
          what they wanted.
God sets the mops down.
                    GOD
          Since when does anyone have a clue
          about what they want?
God holds up a REMOTE AND CLICKS, changing the room into the
DINER where Bruce first parted his soup. (NOTE: Whenever the
room "changes" we're actually still in the room, but seeing a
full projection of an environment on the walls and columns)
The older waitress, Ginnie, clears some dishes...
                    GOD
          Remember Ginnie?
Ginnie bends down behind the counter and when she comes back
up she is a hot 21 YEAR OLD.
                    GOD
          Ginnie thought she lost her beauty
          when she got older. I'm trying to
          convince her otherwise.
Ginnie bends down again, and when she comes back up, she is
HER OLDER SELF again.
God clicks the remote, changing the environment into a SCHOOL
YARD. We see the grade school where Filbert Davis, the boy
Bruce helped up the rope, is in a fight.
                    GOD
          Ah yes, Filbert. Brilliant young
          man. He was going to be a great
          poet.

                     GOD (cont'd)
          The soul of his work would have
          been built out of his hardships.
          He would have touched millions.
               (feigns cheery)
          But now he's headed for a career as
          a professional wrestler.
God clicks, changing the environment into a CONDO. We see a
lonely woman (who found the cash in her purse) sitting
depressed, rocking in a chair.
                     GOD
          Ester Maha. I love Ester. Ester
          was bankrupt. She was going to

          sister. Would've got the two of
          them together again. Instead, she
          bought a condo in Florida.

          But what they don't understand is,
          they're the one's holding the
          power.
God claps the bright ceiling light on, walks over to the
latter.
                    BRUCE
          Wait. Where are you going?
                    GOD
          This is good-bye, Bruce. You've
          learned a lot. I think you should
          be able to handle things now.
God climbs, ascending into the light.
                    BRUCE
          What if I have a question? What if
          I need you?
God stops, looks down to Bruce.

                                                        110.


                     GOD
          See Bruce, that's your problem.
          That's everybody's problem. You
          keep looking up. . .
He smiles and disappears into the light, leaves Bruce
thinking.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - DAY
Bruce stands in the apartment, Sam at his side. No signs of
Grace. The bed is made. Empty.
Then, he notices the BOX OF PHOTOS, the incomplete albums.
He picks up a photo of he and Grace in an even tinier
apartment, Sam is a puppy, they have little money, and
despite it all look very happy. Bruce smiles at the memory.
Reaches for a stack of photos...
EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING
Bruce sits in bumper to bumper traffic. A man's car is
broken down in the middle of the street causing the
bottleneck.
Bruce sees THE SIGN GUY by the side of the road.   His sign
reads: ALL FOR WON.
Bruce looks out at the other drivers honking and shouting at
the frustrated man.

                    BRUCE
          Come on, Sam. Let's do this the
          right way... Oh, alright...
Bruce pulls out a SWATCH OF CARPET, lays it on the grass.
Sam happily goes. They walk off together.
                    BRUCE
          That's not normal you know.
INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY
Bobby places three blue home address number tiles on the

                    BOBBY
              (demonic voice)
          Do you have these in red?
Bruce walks up behind Bobby.
                    BRUCE
          Okay Bobby, it's time to come back.
Bobby HISSES at Bruce, turns INSANELY DEMONIC.

                     BOBBY
          LEAVE ME HOLY MAN OR I WILL FEED ON

Bobby instantly transforms to normal.

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
Evan is packing his things at his desk, still looking much
worse for the wear. Bruce walks up to him.
                    EVAN
          You're probably here to gloat over
          the anchor position. Go ahead, I'm
          sure I deserve it.
                    BRUCE
          You know, Evan.    I've been a real
          prick.
Evan stops, looks up at Bruce, confused.
                    BRUCE
          You were born to anchor. I'm not
          taking the position. Oh, and I
          never really congratulated you on
          getting the job in the first place.
          Congratulations, Evan.
Bruce offers his hand, Evan takes it. When their hands meet,
there is a kind of ELECTRICAL CHARGE that passes between
them. Bruce walks off, Evan is confused when he catches his
reflection in the mirror. HE'S BACK TO NORMAL!
INT. JACK'S OFFICE - LATER
ON TV

Evan is manning the anchor desk and looking good doing it.
Jack is relieved.
                      EVAN BAXTER
          In the financial world, things are
          settling back to normal in what
          analysts are calling a fluke market
          fluctuation...
Bruce enters.
                     BRUCE
          You made the right choice, Jack.

                                                                 113.



                           JACK
                So what about you? What will you
                do?
                          BRUCE
                With your permission, I think I'll
                go out there and make the people
                laugh. To quote a friend, "God
                knows we could use it."
Jack smiles.
                          JACK
                Permission granted.
Bruce turns to go, then turns back.
                          BRUCE
                Oh, are you hungry? I know a place
                that makes a mean tomato soup.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Bruce walks along side Jack. Jack talks and talks, happy to
have the company. Bruce opens a door for Jack, leading to..

Jack and the waitress lock eyes - there's an instant
attraction. Bruce smiles.
                           BRUCE
                Jack. This is a friend of mine,

EXT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - DUSK

Bruce paces, waiting for Sam.
                    BRUCE
          You can do it, Sam. Without the
          carpet. Come on.
Sam does. Bruce celebrates, does a happy dance and is
surprised to see Debbie standing there.
                     DEBBIE
               (re: the peeing dog)
          Looks like your rain dance worked.
                    BRUCE
          Debbie. Hey. You know, I never
          got to apologize for--
                    DEBBIE
          I didn't really come to chat, I
          came for Grace's things.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT

Debbie is packing items into a box. She sees the photo
albums on the coffee table. She flips through, surprised.
                    DEBBIE
          They're full... You did all this?
Bruce nods. Debbie looks at Bruce, sizing him up.
                    DEBBIE
          You really hurt her, you know.
                      BRUCE
          I know.
Debbie starts to go, but turns back.
                    DEBBIE
          You know what I do before I go to
          sleep every night? I tuck my kids
          in bed, I eat a scoop of ice cream
          and watch Conan.

                     DEBBIE (cont'd)
          You know what Grace does? She
          prays. Most of the time for you.
This not only touches Bruce, but it gives him an idea.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE' S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Bruce sits anxiously at the computer with Sam, checks the e--
mails and types in GRACE CONNELLY. He hits "search". 1,273
entries appear.
                     BRUCE
          The woman does pray a lot.
He types in "Grace and Bruce" and eagerly awaits. There are
335 matches. He checks a few...
     "Dear God, please help Bruce to find himself, find
     contentment, find You."
     "Dear God, please help Bruce. He's struggling to find
     meaning."
     "Dear God, help Bruce to be happy. He can't seem to
     find his way..."
Over and over, he finds the same prayer, the same entry every
morning and night for months on end.
Bruce is touched.
                     BRUCE
          She still loves me, Buddy.
He KISSES SAM and races out.
EXT. DEBBIE HOUSE - NIGHT
Bruce stands in front of the house with flowers, another
special creation. He looks at the lavish bouquet, then sets
them down, picks a single, normal Daisy from the garden.
Better.
He heads for the door when he hears crying. It's Grace. He
looks up, sees a light on in the upstairs guest room.
He climbs the fire escape and looks in the window.
GRACE is sitting on the bed crying. As Bruce watches her
cry, feeling her emotion, it starts to LIGHTLY RAIN.
                    GRACE
          Please God. Please...

                                                          11 6.



Through her tears she is praying.     Bruce looks at her with
total love.
                       GRACE
             Please God. I still love him...
Bruce smiles, thankful.
                       GRACE
             ...but I don't want to love him
             anymore. Please God. Help me to
             forget.
                  (cries)
             I don't want to hurt anymore. I
             want to forget.
Bruce just stands there, stunned. He gets it. He raises a
hand, and with a simple wave, he performs an excruciatingly
selfless act. He lets Grace go.
ON GRACE
Her face changes.     She wipes her eyes.   The pain is lifted.
And it is Bruce now who feels that pain. He looks at Grace.
A sad smile.
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

Rain droplets splash on the river where Bruce first raged at
God. He stands in the middle of the street, looks up
heavenward, weakly. Humble.
                       BRUCE
             You win. I' m done. Please. I
             don't want to do this anymore. I
             don't want to be God.
                  (sighs)
             Please, help me.
And with that, the rain stops. The dark clouds slowly open
as beams of light cut through, shining down upon Bruce,
birds begin to chirp.adding to this magical moment as. . .
HONK1 HONKI

A MAC TRUCK SLAMS THROUGH FRAME, MOWS BRUCE DOWN. His spirit
remains in the same spot, looking confused, then STREAKS UP
heavenward.

SHOOTING HEAVENWARD like a missile, THROUGH THE CLOUDS,
THROUGH THE SKY to...

A HUGE WHITE ROOM - No walls, just white as far as the eye
can see. The flooring is the whitest of white puffy clouds.
Bruce finds himself standing there. He looks around and when
he turns behind him, he sees GOD. Floating on nothing, as
though sitting in the most royal throne.
                     BRUCE
          Am I...?
                     GOD
          You can't expect to kneel down in
          the middle of a highway and live to
          talk about it.
                    BRUCE
          But why? Why now?
                     GOD
          I work in mysterious ways, son.
A beat as Bruce takes everything in.
                     BRUCE
          You knew it all along. You knew if
          I got everything I wanted, I would
          ruin my life.
God doesn't respond, just listens.
                     BRUCE
          So I'm dead... Okay. If this is
          what you want. Okay, okay...
God holds up the PRAYER BEADS, tosses them to Bruce. Bruce
looks at the beads, then up at God, puzzled.
                     GOD
          Go ahead, use 'em.
                     BRUCE
          Alright... I've learned that I
          don't know as much I thought I
          did...
                     GOD
          Boy, you can say that again.
                     BRUCE
          Hey, I'm praying here.

                                                        118.


                       GOD
          Sorry, go.
                    BRUCE
          If I could have just one thing in
          the world. It would be for Grace
          to live a happy, joyful life. And
          that she finds someone...
              (getting emotional as he
               realizes what he's
               saying)
          ...that she finds someone that will
          treat her with the love and respect
          that she so deserves.
God smiles the most satisfied of smiles.
                      GOD
          Now that is a prayer.
               (beat)
          Well, I better get on that one.
          See ya, Bruce.
Off Bruce's puzzled reaction he DROPS THROUGH THE CLOUDS --
FALLING POV - BACK DOWN TOWARDS EARTH, back THROUGH THE
CLOUDS, and right INTO ANOTHER WHITE ROOM where...
BRUCE EYES OPEN and he GASPS FOR BREATH.    The PRAYER BEADS
still clutched tightly in his hand.
TWO DOCTORS stop giving Bruce CPR, see that his vitals have
returned. . .
                       NURSE
          He's back!
                     INTERN
          BP 40 over 110 and rising.
                       DOCTOR #1
               (to Bruce) -
          Bruce? Can you hear me?
               (Bruce nods)
          We almost lost you there.
WIDER ANGLE - The WHITE ROOM is a HOSPITAL ROOM - Bruce is
heavily bruised and bandaged.
                     DOCTOR #1
          You lost a lot of blood. It wasn't
          easy to find a match - you're a
          very rare blood type.

                                                      119.



Bruce looks to the blood bag, sees "A/B Positive" written on
the side.
CLOSE ON BRUCE - THINKING, HIS MIND RACING

                     BRUCE
               (groggy whisper)
          A/B Positive...
                    DOCTOR #2 (O.S.)
          You should thank God for donors.
          We don't have a lot of that type on
          hand.
                    NURSE
          There's your angel now.
Bruce turns toward the hospital door and sees...
GRACE

A cotton swab taped to her arm. Now he remembers where he
heard of that blood type.
                     GRACE
               (re: her swab)
          I hear that all of this winds up in
          a warehouse somewhere. But you
          know me, I'm a sucker for this
          stuff.
The doctors give Grace the nod to enter as they go, leaving
the two of them alone. Grace tentatively approaches.
                     GRACE
          I don't even know what I'm doing
          here. But... When I heard that
          you'd been in an accident and that
          you might not make it. . .
She starts to cry.
                    BRUCE
          Hey, I'm okay.
                    GRACE
          Does it hurt?
                     BRUCE
          Only when I talk., and smile... and
          y'know, exist in general.

                                                         120.



Grace laughs. That's one thing Bruce could always do, is
make her laugh. Grace spots the prayer beads in Bruce's
hand, raises his arm.
                    GRACE
          Oh my gosh, you still have those?
Bruce looks at the prayer beads, then looks at Grace. He
remembers his prayer to God and the emotion wells within him
                    GRACE
          What is it?
                    BRUCE
          Nothing. It's just really nice to
          see you.
She goes to him, Bruce sits up a bit and they embrace.
                                          DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. CITY PARK - DAY
A BIG BLOOD DRIVE in progre   ss. Everyone is there, Grace,
Sam, Debbie and Zoe, Ginnie   and Jack, the Kowolski brothers,
Momma Kowolski, Evan, Susan   , Dallas, Fred. Bobby serves
various food items from his   cart.
                    BOBBY
          You know, French Toast was invented
          by tavern owner, Joseph French, who
          had a poor knowledge of grammar,
          and did not know how to use the
          possessive apostrophe, so he called
          it French Toast instead of French's
          Toast...
Pull back to reveal BRUCE, crutch under one arm, cast on his
leg, mic in hand, reporting. He's now talking in his OWN
VOICE, much more himself.
                    BRUCE
          This is Bruce Nolan at Buffalo's
          first annual "Be the Miracle" blood
          drive. Remember, the life you save
          may be mine, so hurry down. I had
          a close call and, well, can you
          imagine what life would have been
          like without me?
Laughs in the background, from the people that know Bruce.
Bruce walks over to the Kowolski Brothers.

                                                         121.



                    BRUCE
          In honor of this event, the
          Kowolski brothers have baked a one-
          of-a-kind, creation.
The brothers proudly unveil the special cookie and we see
that it's a HUGE SYRINGE SHAPED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE.
                    BRUCE
          Sure, a little creepy and a
          shameless plug, but we love 'em.
              (Bruce breaks off a little
               piece, takes a bite)
          Mmm, good needle. Remember, that's
          Kowolski's bakery. The bakery that
          gets more air time than a high
          speed chase.
Everyone laughs.   The Kowolski brothers beam.
Bruce takes a seat as a VOLUNTEER NURSE pulls up his sleeve,
revealing the prayer beads worn around his wrist. She ties
off his arm, starts to probe for a vein.
                       ·
                    BRUCE
          To be honest, I've never been a big
          fan of shots. . .
The volunteer now is swabbing Bruce's arm and Bruce is
starting to sweat.
                    BRUCE
              (nervous)
          Okay, we're good to go...They just
          stick it into my arm. Breaking
          through the skin, of course...
The volunteer pulls out the needle and Bruce PASSES OUT COLD.
Gasps, the Nurse leans close, total silence, then:
                      BRUCE
          BLLLAAAA!

Bruce jolts awake making the Nurse and several people jump.
They all laugh.

                    BRUCE
          Had you going, didn't IIIIII1

He reacts to the nurse POKING the needle in. Everyone laughs
more.

                                                          122.


                      BRUCE
           No, this is nothing. In fact, this
           is the second time I've given blood
           this week. For those of you who
           haven't heard, I ' d like you to meet
           the soon to be Mrs. Exclusive.
He throws a look to Grace who smiles in return.    The crowd
applauds.
                     BRUCE
           This is Bruce Nolan reporting for
           Eyewitness News.
The camera cuts.   Bruce lowers his mic, turns to Grace.
                      BRUCE
           So, what'd you think?
                      GRACE                                      *
           I don't know, I thought it was very                   *
           pleasurable.                                          *
Bruce smiles, they kiss...
As the blood drive continues, we push through the crowd,
heading somewhere. Bodies clear frame and we see the
HOMELESS MAN sitting on a park bench. His sign reads:
THEE END
The Homeless Man smiles into camera. We continue forward and
in a slow, mysterious, subtle fashion his face slowly
transforms into the very pleased, FACE OF GOD, who winks and
w. . .
