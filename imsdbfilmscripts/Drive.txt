           We're close on a maze of metal rods, tubes, and wires. It's only
           as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over
           the image we hear a voice talking on a phone.

           A map of downtown L.A. spread out on a bed, dozens of different
           routes marked in pencil. The voice continues -

           DRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it
           in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly
           packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a
           cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA
           Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks.

           Driver strides through a dimly lit car park, carrying his duffel
           bag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night
           out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his
           way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle

           The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is
           only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the
           passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes.
           Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives
           carefully, letting other cars overtake.

           Clutching his duffel bag Driver heads towards the car park
           elevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a
           pretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes
           meet briefly, before Driver walks on.

           Driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new
           apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean,
           sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He
           tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again.

           Driver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on
           the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food
           shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage
           lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse -
           vintage cars.

           SHANNON, the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp. Driver
           follows him past rows of vintage cars.

           Won't work.
                         
           They head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they
           arrive at a plain looking Impala.

           Driver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds
           out his hand for the keys.

          10 INT/EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ TOY DISTRICT/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 10
                         
           The basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter.
           Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows
           of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's
           9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street.
                         
          11 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ ELECTRONICS SUPERSTORE/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 11
                         
           A vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street.
           Under the pale yellow glow of the street lamps, Driver sees
           signs advertising a `huge blow out weekend sale'. He pulls over,
           making sure he has a good view of the entrance. On the radio,
           the basketball commentator is getting more excited.
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY

           Driver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld
           scanner. He switches it on, tuning it to the right frequency.
           Crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball
           commentary now.

           Out of the corner of his eye Driver sees two MEN approach. He
           doesn't react, expecting them. They cut through the fence with
           bolt cutters and approach the main building. Driver watches them
           pull on their masks, then one of them takes out a shotgun and
           blasts the lock to the front door. Instantly the alarm shrills.
           The only thing Driver does is to turn on his stop watch.
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY

           The stop watching keeps ticking away, the siren blaring, the
           commentary continuing, the police scanner crackling.
                         
           The storefront is hidden in shadow, impossible to tell what's
           going on inside. Driver looks at his stop watch. Almost three
           minutes. One of the masked men emerges now, carrying a duffel
           bag. He hurries over and gets in the back of Driver's car
           without a word. There's no sign of the other robber.

           The commentary continues, so does the crackling on the police
           scanner. Four minutes. Still no sign of the second armed robber.
           His companion in the back starts to look nervous, wondering
           what's happened to his partner.
                         
           Driver doesn't betray a hint of nerves. Four and half minutes on
           his stop watch. Thirty seconds more and he's on his way.
                         
           Suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows, running as
           fast as he can to the getaway car. He jumps into the back seat a
           few seconds short of five minutes and Driver screeches off.

           Driver thunders over the 1st Street bridge towards Boyle
           Heights, then eases his foot off the gas, slowing to a steady
           speed. In the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their
           masks, looking pumped up with adrenalin. Driver studies them in
           his rear view mirror, then swerves right on Mission Street as
           his police scanner crackles to life.

           Driver swings sharply into 4th Street now, crossing the L.A.

           Up ahead, the lights of Downtown L.A. glitter against the night
           sky. Hovering between the neon green glow of the skyscrapers
           Driver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter. He
           switches off his headlights, turning left on Santa Fe Avenue.

           The armed robbers watch in tense silence as Driver weaves in and
           out of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off.
           It's as if he's trying to find his way out of the maze or
           probing to see if there's anyone out there.

           It's like catching a glimpse of a passing shark's fin. Driver
           taps the brakes gently, his car sliding to a stop. He stays
           there a moment, then eases the Impala forward, turning in the
           same direction as the black-and-white.
                         
          14 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 14
                         
           It's a high-risk strategy but Driver follows the black-and-white
           at a distance, hidden in the darkness, knowing other squad cars
           won't be checking the same route. The police car makes its way
           through the dimly lit industrial zone, unaware it's being
           shadowed. Driver turns his car radio up a whisper.

           Driver turns the sound back down. Up ahead, the police car
           swings left, disappearing from view. Driver slows down too,
           anticipating the next obstacle. He doesn't have long to wait. In
           the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police
           chopper's search-lights, sweeping the area one more time.
                         
           Driver floors the gas, speeding straight towards the approaching
           helicopter. The armed robbers are too stunned to protest. They
           just sit there, watching the sweeping searchlights getting
           closer and closer.
                         
           Then suddenly it becomes clear what Driver's doing. Up ahead,
           there's a small underpass below the 7th Street bridge. Driver
           slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the
           chopper's searchlights spot them.

           The roar of the helicopter thunders overhead. The underpass is
           crammed with dirty mattresses and shopping carts. Sleeping HOBOS
           can be seen under dirty blankets. Driver waits for the echo of
           the helicopter to fade, then moves forward again.

           Gloomy yellow street-lamps shine down on the industrial zone.
           Rows of delivery trucks are parked outside the meat-packing
           factories. Driver cruises cautiously down the deserted street.
           The crackling of the police scanner and the droning of the
           basketball commentary add to the tension. Finally up ahead he
           sees car-lights streaming back and forth on Broadway.

           There's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway. Driver falls in
           behind the other cars. On the radio, the basketball game is
           still playing.

           The passing head-lamps light up Driver's face. There's not a

           approaching in the opposite direction.

           The two cars pass each other slowly. Driver sees the cops in the
           Black-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past. He
           turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner.

           Driver bursts out onto Pico now. A squad car headed in the
           opposite direction slows down as it sees him but is caught up in
           the flow of traffic, unable to turn round and give chase.

           Driver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him, so
           smooth and effortless it's hard to tell how fast he's going. He
           glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper
           overhead. The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging
           its search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position.
                         
           Driver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way
           of outrunning the chopper. Blue light floods the asphalt around
           him as he guns down Figueroa.

           The terraced parking lot looms up ahead. A sign above the
           barrier says `Season Ticket Holders Only'. Driver punches in a
           ticket and roars into the parking lot.

           going on, the parking lot is almost full. Finally Driver pulls
           into a free parking space.

           The jubilant commentary continues, but Driver isn't listening
           anymore. The game has served its purpose. More fans flood into
           the parking lot. Dozens of cars pull out of their places.

           them disappear, then slips on a Clippers cap, climbs out of the
           Impala himself and heads towards another car.

           Doesn't have to be. The big money teams
           burn through three, four million a year but
           that's `cause they're using half a dozen
           test drivers and a stable of cars.

           Sure, but it's not the only way. All I need
           is a hard-used stock car. We start off with
           the small-town action then work our way up.
           There's close to two thousand events out
           there and once we make the Show we're
           talking millions.

           Benicio nods. Driver suddenly gives the TV set a hard smack and
           the interference stops.

           Benicio grins. Driver smiles back then looks away as he hears
           the phone ring. Irene walks out of her bedroom, dressed in her
           waitress's uniform, and answers it.

           Driver sees the look of surprise on Irene's face as she listens
           to the voice on the other end. The doorbell suddenly rings.
           Irene catches Driver's eye and asks him to open it. He heads
           over, checks the spy-hole, then opens the door. A YOUNG WOMAN
           who's sitting for Benicio walks in, looking at Driver curiously.

           The gesture is tiny but charged with emotion. They both stare
           out in silence, fingers clasped, then Irene gently withdraws her
           hand, as if nothing's happened.

           his father helplessly, then looks up at Driver in tears. Driver

           for the corner where he told Standard he'd be waiting.
                         
           He pulls over by the curb when suddenly he notices something.
           Parked a hundred yards down the road he sees another vehicle
           glinting in the sunlight. To the ordinary eye it's no different
           from the other cars parked nearby, but to Driver it stands out.
           For one, it's a Chrysler. Secondly, it has reinforced bumpers
           and racing tires.
                         
           Driver's stopwatch shows four minutes now. He looks away from
           the Chrysler, gazing at the doors of the pawn shop, expecting
           Standard and Blanche to burst out at any moment.
                         
           But there's no sign of them.
                         
           The seconds tick away. Five minutes. Driver hesitates, all his
           instincts telling him to drive off, but he stays where he is,
           thinking of Irene.
                         
           Suddenly he sees Standard and Blanche emerge from the pawn shop,
           Standard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand.

           He smiles at Driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the
           crack of gunshots behind him. Driver sees the look of panic on
           his face as he spins around.
                         
           A GUY IN A SUIT strides out of the pawn shop. Crouching low in
           an expert firing position he squeezes off several shots. The
           force of the bullets sends Standard flying.
                         
           Driver sees him hit the sidewalk, arterial blood pumping from
           his neck. Blanche screams, grabbing the gym bag and leaping into
           the back seat of the car. Driver hesitates, takes one last look
           at Standard's lifeless body, then hits the gas as more gunshots
           crack behind him.
                         
           As Driver's car roars down the street, the Chrysler suddenly
           comes to life, pulling out of its parking place.

           Driver glances in his rear-view mirror and sees the Chrysler on
           his tail. It doesn't seem to be trying to close the gap, just
           following at a discreet distance. In the back seat, Blanche zips
           open the gym bag, then stares in shock.

           There are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed
           inside the gym bag. Driver catches her reaction in the mirror,
           but his attention is focussed on the Chrysler. Up ahead, at an
           intersection, the lights turn red. Driver thinks about running
           them, but decides against it, braking sharply. The Chrysler
           draws up beside him, its windows glinting in the sunlight.
                         
                          BLANCHE

           Driver ignores her, still watching the Chrysler out of the
           corner of his eye. The lights change to green but Driver doesn't
           move. Nor does the Chrysler. Behind them, other cars start
           honking their horns. Suddenly Driver roars off, swerving left at
           speed.
                         
           The Chrysler reacts, screeching off in pursuit.
                         
           Driver floors the gas. On speed and power his vehicle may be no
           match for the Chrysler, but in traffic the odds are even. He
           weaves his way past the slower cars, putting obstacles between
           himself and the Chrysler. The pursuing car matches him move for
           move, staying on his tail.
                         
           In the back seat, Blanche looks terrified, buckling herself in.

           Driver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a
           deserted canyon road. The mustang somehow manages to make
           the same turn. It gets close enough to "pit" Driver, its nose
           pressing against the rear corner of Driver's vehicle. 
                         
           Driver's almost run off the road, but manages to save it and
           regains control of his car.
                         
           The Mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into
           him. As it moves in to deliver the knockout blow, Driver
           pulls the Emergency Brake and spins 180 degrees, causing the
           Mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment.
                         
           Now the two cars are nose to nose, barrelling down the road,
           Driver heading in reverse as fast as he can, the Mustang
           closing fast.
                         
           It rams Driver's front bumper. BAM! The two cars separated
           for an instant.
                         
           The Mustang guns it, ready to smash into Driver again...
                         
           Driver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with
           construction equipment. In a last ditch attempt to evade his
           pursuer he throws a reverse 180, then incredibly keeps going,
           spinning 270 degrees.
                         
           The Mustang tries to make the same turn, but this time the
           maneuver is beyond his ability. Driver's suckered him into a
           corner he can't control. 
                         
           The Mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a
           sickening crunch of metal on metal.

           window where he just shot her.
                         
           Driver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he
           can get off another shot and pulling him through the window. The
           hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his
           forehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes.
                         
           Driver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into
           the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as
           they struggle. Crawling away, he grabs the towel rack and pulls
           the metal bar off the wall. Using it as a spear he impales the
           hitman and grabs his shotgun.

           In the bedroom, the 2nd HITMAN finally kicks the door open.
           Driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time --
           firing the 1st shooter's shotgun. The force of the blast picks
           up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag
           doll.
                         
           The startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as
           it began. Driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion, his hand and
           his arm ripped open by the broken glass. There's blood splatter
           all over the wall. Neon lights from outside flashing on the dead
           man's face. But no panicked footsteps or sirens yet.
                         
           Driver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his
           pockets. All he finds are a set of car keys.

           Driver moves again, dragging the terrified Irene behind him. Tan

           Driver turns to Irene as they take cover behind a pillar. She
           looks terrified -- not just of Tan Suit but of him. It's as if
           all her worst fears have been confirmed.
                         
           Driver stares back at her, then hears Tan Suit's footsteps

           Tan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up
           the darkness. Driver keeps moving. Tan Suit strides after him,
           reloading, when suddenly his gun jams.
                         
           Crouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his
           chance, darting out after his pursuer. Tan Suit sees him coming
           and runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now.
                         
           Still lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing
           footsteps.
                         
           Driver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the

           pursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a
           car.
                         
           Tan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs
           him, swinging him around, smashing him into another car.
                         
           Irene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She
           picks herself up and runs towards the elevator.
                         
           Driver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the
           resistance out of him. As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs
           him by the throat and rams his head into a car window.
                         
           The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering
           Tan Suit's skull.
                         
           Driver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the
           elevator, framed against the light.
                         
           She stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out.

           elevator doors finally close, hiding Irene from view.

           WOMAN polishing his shoes. And now we see more of Nino's MEN,
           also smartly dressed and accompanied by GORGEOUS WOMEN, getting

           clouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves.
                         
           Driver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the
           ocean, a pathetic last attempt to evade him. The crashing waves
           and the undertow are an impenetrable wall. Every time Nino tries
           to wade out further, the ocean drags him back.

           Driver stares at his trapped prey. Nino's attempts become more
           and more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any
           hope of escape. Finally he retreats back into the shallow water,
           barely able to keep his footing. He turns around and faces
           Driver, the crashing waves still smashing into his back.

           silhouetted against the white sand. Nino trapped in the ocean.

           him, staring at the masked man. Driver stares back at him then
           grabs him by the throat, forcing his head under the water. Nino
           splutters as Driver lets him up again.

           Driver continues painfully through the maze of cars.

           Irene looks confused as she hears the quiet urgency in his
           voice, then reaches inside her handbag.
                         
           Sunlight glitters on the roofs of the parked cars, dazzling

           Blood seeps through Driver's shirt, dripping on the tarmac.
                         
           Irene hears his labored breathing now, looking concerned.

           Driver's skin looks deathly pale, his eyes a haunting shade of
           blue. He keeps walking through the maze of cars, casting his
           eyes from one vehicle to the next, looking for the perfect ride.

           Driver stops in front of the white Camaro, unsteady on his feet.

           From above we see the maze of vehicles stretching out forever --
           Chevys, Chryslers, Fords -- the history of America on wheels.
           Driver switches off his cell-phone reluctantly then heads
           towards the Camaro.

           Driver climbs into the front seat of the Camaro, catching his
           breath. He sits there a moment, sheltering from the world
           outside, then pulls out a pocket knife, opening the blades until
           he finds the screwdriver. He starts with the left side of the
           steering column, then gets to work on the section below the turn
           signal.

           His face shows the strain, but his fingers are as steady as
           ever. A master at work. Finally he breaks into the ignition
           device, leaning back in the seat to take a rest.

           almost at peace. There's a long pause, then slowly he leans
           forward and turns on the ignition. As the engine comes to life,
           we CUT TO BLACK.
