      OPEN ON:


1   INT. BATHROOM, YORK HOUSE, LONDON - DAY (MID-1930'S)              1

    A shimmering surface of cold water - held in an immense, free
    standing, white enamelled bathtub with gilded lion's legs -
    bulges in SLOW MOTION to the chords of Handel's "Trumpet
    Volunteer".

    A head emerges.

    White gloved hands, in livery, rush to envelope the surfacing
    naked wet body in white towels.


2   INT.    DRESSING CHAMBER, YORK HOUSE - DAY                        2

    The ritual continues with crisp military precision.

    CLOSE ON the Royal Coat Of Arms stamped in gold: lion and
    unicorn embrace a shield divided into four quarters with harp,
    thistle, and more lions denoting England, Ireland, Scotland and
    Wales. The shield is surmounted by a crown.

    This emblem is on a cuff-link fastened on a starched white
    shirt.

    Trousers, pressed to a knife-edge, are held for stockinged feet
    and gartered legs to be inserted.

    Mirror-polished boots are laced tight.

    Jacket, held ready. Arms, shoulders, chest received.

    Glistening medals attached to front of jacket create a dazzling
    field of ribbons and medallions.

    Epaulets, edged with gold braid tassels, are adjusted.

    Polished buttons are fastened.

    Multi-coloured collar clasped shut.

    White ostrich feathers, topping a tri-corner hat, are fluffed
    and placed upon brilliantined hair.

    PAN DOWN to the handsome features of Albert, Duke of York, known
    to his family as BERTIE. He's in his late thirties, the second
    son of King George V, the reigning King of England. He conveys a
    sensitivity which appears in conflict with the manner in which
    he's been bedecked.

    Reflected in a full length mirror, Bertie tells himself:
           TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    3.


                             BERTIE
                   You look like a Christmas tree.

    He smiles wanly.


3   EXT.    INNER COURTYARD, YORK HOUSE, 145 PICADILLY - DAY            3

    THE ROYAL STANDARD flaps atop a gleaming chrome grill.

    Liveried footmen open the doors of a stately Austin Princess.

    Bertie exits York House with his young wife - ELIZABETH -
    considered by all to be one of the loveliest women in the land,
    truly an English rose. Golden Labradors and Corgis appear from
    all directions, weaving between them, barking boisterously,
    creating a happy chaos.

    Elizabeth and Bertie glance upwards and wave.

    Two little girls, LILIBET and MARGARET ROSE, aged eight and
    four, wave back from their nursery window.


4   INT/EXT.    AUSTIN PRINCESS, HYDE PARK CORNER - DAY                 4

    Bertie nervously lights a cigarette.    Elizabeth pats his hand.

                             ELIZABETH
                   Buck up, Bertie. The BBC said it wouldn't
                   rain.

    BERTIE'S POV - Speaker's Corner with its assortment of orators,
    prophets, protestors, and onlookers gathered around soapboxs,
    agreeing, disagreeing, shouting comments. Others carry
    placards, sing protest songs. A miners' strike is the focus of
    the day.

    A large, rather untidy workingman with a florid rosacea nose
    spots the passing Austin and stares at the occupants.

    REVERSE ANGLE - Bertie's face stares back.

    The first drops splatter against the glass.      Elizabeth sighs.

                             ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                   Never trust the wireless.

    Bertie's face is obliterated by the increasingly heavy downpour,
    which segues into a GARGLING sound.
           TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     4.


5   INT.    BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY                                5

    A gentleman in a tuxedo, carnation in boutonniere, is gargling
    while a TECHNICIAN holds a porcelain bowl and a towel at the
    ready. The man in the tuxedo is a BBC NEWS READER. He
    expectorates discreetly into the bowl, wipes his mouth
    fastidiously, and signals to ANOTHER TECHNICIAN who produces an
    atomizer. The Reader opens his mouth, squeezes the rubber bulb,
    and sprays his inner throat. Now, he's ready. He looks to the
    control room.

    The FLOOR MANAGER begins a count-down: five... four... three...
    two...

                             BBC NEWS READER
                   Ladies and Gentlemen: good afternoon. This
                   is the BBC National and World Programmes
                   taking you to Wembley Stadium.

    He speaks in flawless pear-shaped tones.    There's no higher
    creature in the vocal world.


6   EXT.    WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY                                        6

    ELEVATED SHOT looking down on a sea of dripping black umbrellas
    hiding the spectators from view.

    Bertie and Elizabeth takes their places in a row of gilded
    chairs with the other dignitaries. They are:

    KING GEORGE V - a barrel-chested man with Naval beard and
    uniform, accompanied by his wife.

    QUEEN MARY - an elegant but icy grande dame.

    DR COSMO LANG - a tall, unctuous, churchman with a high, domed,
    balding head, and a perpetual expression of moral superiority.

    WINSTON CHURCHILL - a politician of sixty, as portly as Lang is
    lean. They are bantering rivals in ambition.

    STANLEY BALDWIN - the Prime Minister of the day. Heavy-browed.
    His hair, as always, parted down the middle.

    NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN - Chancellor of the Exchequer. Tall, thin,
    lugubrious, with the expression of a quizzical chicken hawk.

    A BBC technician places a huge imposing microphone suspended on
    springs next to the stadium equipment. It looks frightening,
    even to us. Bertie's shoulders brace as though expecting a
    blow. Elizabeth sees his terror.
           TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                  5.


                             ELIZABETH
                   Why wasn't he told?

                             COSMO LANG
                   Ten million people listening around the
                   world, Mam. Possibly more.
                       (as though Bertie didn't
                        exist)
                   His brother, and father, have been
                   broadcasting since last year.

    The King, growing impatient, hisses:

                             KING GEORGE V
                   Get on with it. Show what you're made of!

    Bertie moves forward diffidently, without an ounce of
    confidence, knowing deep within he's doomed. His stomach knots,
    chest muscles contract, constricting his breath.

                             BERTIE
                   Luh-luh-lords, la-la-ladies, gen-tell-men.

    It is a shock to realize this is a man with a profound stutter.
    A man who cannot speak in public.

    Lang whispers to Churchill.    When Lang whispers, everyone can
    hear.

                             COSMO LANG
                   I wouldn't miss His Highness' maiden voyage
                   for all the world. And on such an important
                   occasion.

    Lang really is a piece of work.

    For ease of reading, Bertie's stutter is not indicated from this
    point on in the script.

                             BERTIE
                   No doubt you wish the Prince Of Wales was
                   standing before you today.

    POV - a sea of dripping umbrellas. No response. This is going
    to be a torment for him, and his audience.


7   INT.    BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY                             7

    A glowing dial on the face of a studio radio.    Everyone
    listening intently.
            TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                  6.


                              BERTIE (ON RADIO)
                        (stuttering profoundly)
                    Be that as it may...my brother David is
                    attending to other duties in the furthest
                    parts of this vast Empire...

     The radio falls silent.       Eyes widen in concern.


8    EXT.    WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY                                     8

     Bertie stands frozen, his mouth agape, jaw muscles locked. He
     knows he's considered by all, especially himself, unfit for
     public life.

     Elizabeth is devastated.

                              KING GEORGE V
                    Just needs more practice.


9    EXT. HARLEY STREET - NEW DAY                                      9

     TRACKING SHOT - rain splatters on brass plaques denoting Dr This
     or Dr That, specialists in various maladies. Halt at a plaque
     that reads: LIONEL LOGUE, SPEECH SPECIALIST.


10   INT. RECEPTION ROOM, LOGUE'S CHAMBERS, HARLEY STREET - DAY     10

     Umbrella stand, coat rack, wooden waiting bench: that's all.

     The door is flung open and Elizabeth enters, drenched, her hat
     decorated with white silk roses, now limp. A veil covers her
     features.

     She waits. Coughs.    No response.    Calls imperiously:

                              ELIZABETH
                    Are you there?

     From behind a door:

                              LIONEL (O.S.)
                    In the lav.

     Princess Elizabeth is not used to this sort of thing. She's
     further appalled by the loud gurgling of a toilet being flushed,
     and startled by the entrance of - LIONEL LOGUE. He's in his
     forties, tall, with piercing eyes and charismatic features. His
     demeanor is friendly, but professional. The accent, although
     Australian, is not heavy, he is after all a speech therapist.
    TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                        7.


                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
            "How poor are they that have not patience!
            What wound did ever heal but by degrees?"

                          ELIZABETH
            Pardon?

                      LIONEL
            Iago...world's greatest villain. Just wants
            to be bad. Sorry, no receptionist.

He offers to shake hands.    She doesn't take it, even though
she's gloved.

                      ELIZABETH
                (with sang froid)
            I'd be more comfortable in your office.

                      LIONEL
            That's for clients. Where's Mister J?

                      ELIZABETH
            He doesn't know I'm here.

                      LIONEL
            That's not a promising start.

                      ELIZABETH
            My husband's seen everyone. They were all
            useless. He's given up hope.

                      LIONEL
            A bit premature.

                      ELIZABETH
            Because he hasn't seen you?

Lionel doesn't disgree.

                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
            You're very sure of yourself.

                      LIONEL
            I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.

                      ELIZABETH
            Of course my husband wants to be cured! His
            position requires public speaking upon
            occasion. A torment. I fear the requirement
            may grow more frequent.

                      LIONEL
            He should change jobs.
    TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     8.


                        ELIZABETH
            He can't.

                      LIONEL
            Indentured servitude?

                      ELIZABETH
            Something of that nature.

                       LIONEL
            Well, have your `hubby' pop by and give his
            personal history. I'll make a frank
            appraisal.

                        ELIZABETH
            Doctor...

Logue tries to object but she over-rides.

                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
            ...I do not have a "hubby". We never talk
            about our private lives. Nor do we `pop'.
            You must come to us.

                      LIONEL
            Sorry, this is my game, played on my turf,
            by my rules.

The lady lifts her veil.

                      ELIZABETH
            Perhaps you'll make an exception?

He recognizes her instantly, and is clearly impressed, yet
refuses to be intimidated.

                       LIONEL
            I thought the appointment was for
            "Johnson"?

                      ELIZABETH
            A name used during the Great War, when the
            Navy didn't wish the enemy to know His
            Royal Highness was aboard.

                      LIONEL
            I'm considered the enemy?

                      ELIZABETH
            You will be, should you continue to be un-
            obliging.
            TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                  9.


                              LIONEL
                    For my method to succeed there must be
                    mutual trust, complete honesty, and total
                    equality. That process takes place in my
                    consultation room. No exceptions.

                              ELIZABETH
                    In which case...
                        (re-lowering her veil)
                    I should have kept my pledge. I promised my
                    husband I'd stop seeking "The Great Cure."
                    I've wasted your time. And mine.

     She exits, closing the door firmly behind her.

                              LIONEL
                    Bloody hell, I buggered that.

     WACK! The sound of something solid meeting leather.


11   EXT.    SOUTH KENSINGTON STREET - LATE AFTERNOON              11

     A foot kicks a ball. Lionel is returning home from work. He's a
     well-known fixture locally. Some lads are playing footie. One
     of them passes the ball to Lionel who, despite briefcase and
     rolled brolly, dribbles skillfully before passing the ball and
     entering a modest brownstone.


12   INT.    LOGUE'S ENTRYWAY AND STAIRWELL - LATE AFTERNOON       12

     As Lionel mounts the stairs he's set upon by three sturdy boys -
     VALENTINE, IAN, and PETER - with handkerchiefs tied around the
     lower portions of their faces and armed with broomstick swords.

                              VALENTINE
                    Stand and deliver!

                    `ow dares molest...Jack The Ripper?!

     The boys scream with delight and a sword fight ensues - Lionel
     using his brolly.

                    Beware, Highwaymen, or I'll run yee

                 gizzards.

     Lionel wife - MYRTLE - appears at the head of the stairs; a
     sweet-faced, down-to-earth woman.

                           MYRTLE
                 You'll all hang from the gallows if you
                 don't come for tea.

     Logue, Myrtle, and the boys are finishing at the table.

                           LIONEL
                 Had a visit from a lady today.

                            LIONEL
                  She came on behalf of her husband. Which is
                  not the proper way. I told her I was fully
                  booked.

     Myrtle is clearly disappointed

                  She was...too high and mighty. Know what I

     She does.   There's an unspoken code between them.

     Silence, then:

     Elizabeth, fashionably attired for an evening-out, is curled on
     a bearskin rug reading "Peter Pan" to the girls.

                  "Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into
                  the nursery too late. The birds were
                  flown."

     Bertie enters, handsome in a tuxedo.     Elizabeth closes the book.

The two little girls clap with joy.

                      MARGARET ROSE
            Oh, to fly away!

                      BERTIE
            Weren't they lucky.

Within his family, Bertie's stutter is virtually absent.

                      LILIBET
            One would have to learn to fly properly of
            course.

                      MARGARET ROSE
            Now a Daddy story!

                      BERTIE
            Can I be a penguin instead?

He drops to his knees and waddles. In his tux he looks like a
penguin. The girls giggle, but are undeterred.

                      LILIBET
            The horsie story, please.

                       BERTIE
            Ah well.

Called upon to perform, the stutter returns slightly. But the
two girls listen raptly, ignoring their father's minor
impediment, and it fades.

                      BERTIE (CONT'D)
            Once upon a time there were two horsies. A
            white horse that went clip clop clip clop
            through Hyde Park. And a black horse that
            went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park.
            They met in the middle of Hyde Park. The
            white horse said "neigh". The black horse
            said, "neigh". The white horse continued
            on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park.
            The black horse continued on, clip clop
            clip clop through Hyde Park. And that's the
            end of the story. Now off to bed.

As the girls exit:

                      LILIBET
            A silly story really. But Father tells it
            rather well.

The girls have gone.

                 David called. He said come round to The

                 Will she be there?

                              BERTIE
                 I suppose.

                              ELIZABETH

     Cold and austere mausoleum illuminated by floodlights.

     On the parade ground, Grenadier Guards in red coats and black
     bearskin busbies drill stiffly like toy soldiers. Viewing stands
     are beginning to fill.

     The King's voice is heard:

     microphone as though it were an alien.

In the presence of his father, Bertie's stuttering returns in
full form, his breathing short and shallow, the muscles in
spasms.

                      KING GEORGE V
            Show who's in command. If you don't, this
            devilish device will change everything.
            Used to be, all a King had to do was look
            reasonable in uniform and not fall off his
            horse. Now we must creep cap in hand into
            people's homes that smell of boiled
            cabbage, and speak nicely to them. We're
            reduced to that lowest, basest of all
            creatures...we've become...actors! Don't
            give me a look of defeated pathos. This is
            a family crisis!

                      BERTIE
            Father, we're not a family, we're a firm.

His father shoots Bertie a surprised look.   Does the lad have a
brain after all?

                      KING GEORGE V
            We're the oldest, most successful,
            corporation in the world and sitting on
            thrones is our business! But any moment now
            we may be out of work. Your brother came to
            me the other day, livid a certain lady has
            been refused an invitation to my Silver
            Jubilee. I pointed out she wasn't a lady
            and most definitely wasn't his wife.

                      BERTIE
            What did David say?

                      KING GEORGE V
            She made him sublimely happy. I said: that
            was probably because she was sleeping with
            him. "I give you my word we've never had
            immoral relations." "As my son, as Prince
            of Wales, as my heir, do you solemnly swear
            your friendship with this woman is an
            absolutely clean one?" "I do", he said.
            "Look me in the eye," I said. "On my
            honour" he said. Stared straight at his
            father... and lied.

             When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself,
             this family, and this nation, within twelve
             months. Who'll pick up the pieces? David's
             friend, Oswald Mosley? His black-shirt
             British Union of Fascists are marching
             through London. Hitler terrorizing half of
             Europe, Stalin the other half. Who'll stand
             between us, the jackboots, and the
             proletarian abyss? You?

A red light attached to the mike begins a series of warning
blinks.

                       BERTIE
             What're you going to say?

                       KING GEORGE V
             The usual guff. The Archbishop writes it.
             My people love to hear me say it. Spoken
             fluently, of course.

They're interrupted by the entrance of the BBC News Reader and
Technicians.

     The edge of the crowd is visible. One can sense a vast sea of
     humanity. When the glass doors of the upper balcony open the
     murmur becomes a ROAR. When the King steps out, it becomes
     tumultuous.


19   EXT.   BALCONY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS                  19

     The King is joined by Queen Mary and the Archbishop of
     Canterbury, other Royals, and dignitaries. The noise is
     deafening. The King beckons impatiently for someone still
     inside to join them. It's Bertie, with Elizabeth.

                       (aside to Elizabeth)
                  You'll have to do a lot more of this. I'm
                  sending him to the Midlands. With all the
                  factory noise they won't hear a word he
                  says.

     The King goes back to waving.   Elizabeth is stunned at the
     prospect.

     The ROAR of the crowd segues into the ROAR of machinery.


20   INT.   MIDLAND FACTORY - NEW DAY                                20

     Huge industrial wheels whir in neutral. WORKERS are lined up
     dutifully to hear the visiting Royal. Bertie's lips move, but
     with the noise he cannot be heard. Elizabeth watches in relief.

     Then a FOREMAN, trying to be helpful, signals.     The machinery
     halts, the factory falls silent.

     At first the momentum of speaking without being heard carries
     Bertie forward.

                            BERTIE
                  What's needed is cooperation...

     Hearing his own voice reverberate through the cavernous factory
     brings Bertie's stutter back in full form.

                  ...buh-buh-between the cuh-cuh-classses...

     One of the workers sullenly pulls a chain, releasing a blast
     from a steam whistle that drowns Bertie out.

                            BERTIE
                  Is this necessary?

                            ELIZABETH
                  You know perfectly well.

     As they pass a corner news stand, the headline chalkboard reads:
     PRINCE OF WALES TELLS MINERS "SOMETHING MUST BE DONE!"

                            ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                  Neglects to tell them what must be done,
                  how its to be done, and who's to do it.

                            BERTIE
                  David has `the touch'. They adore him.

     As the Austin halts for lights, people stare to see who's
     inside. Some point.

                            BERTIE (CONT'D)
                  I'll wager they're saying: There's the
                  useless one who can't speak.


23   INT. LOGUE'S WAITING ROOM - DAY                                23

     Bertie and Elizabeth enter. She explains in a whisper:
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   19.


                      ELIZABETH
            There's no receptionist.

Elizabeth glances nervously at the lavatory door.

                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                (loudly)
            The Johnsons.

From the inner office.

                      LIONEL (O.S.)
            Not finished yet.

Elizabeth is relieved its not coming from the lav.

                      BERTIE
            How'd you find this physician?

                      ELIZABETH
                (poker-faced)
            Classifieds; next to "Saucy model,
            Shepherd's Market".

Bertie smiles despite his mood.

                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
            Comes highly recommended. Charges
            substantial fees in order to help the poor.
                (realizes)
            Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?!

                      BERTIE
            I'm not sure I want to see this fellow.

                      ELIZABETH
            I'm not sure he wants to see you.

The consultation room door opens and a working class young woman
- ANNA - comes out; then realizes with a gasp who they are. She
retreats rapidly back into the consulting room.

                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
            Perhaps this was a mistake.

After an uncomfortable moment, Anna returns, attempting to be
properly formal, and stutters:

                      ANNA
            You can go in now, "Mr. Johnson".

                      BERTIE
            I'm not actually Mr ...
        TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   20.


                           ANNA
                     (whispers, terrified)
                 I know.
                     (then to Elizabeth)
                 Dr Logue says...

                            LIONEL (O.S.)
                 Lionel!

                           ANNA
                 Lionel says...wait here if you wish. Or, it
                 being a pleasant day, take a stroll.
                     (to the consultation room)
                 Was that alright?

                           LIONEL (O.S.)
                 Bloody marvellous.

                           ANNA
                     (choking up)
                 Thank you...Lionel.

     Anna flees quickly.

                           LIONEL (O.S.)
                 Mr. Johnson, do come in.

     The Yorks look at each other.


24   INT. LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY                        24

     A totally different universe from the Spartan waiting area. A
     world of books - piles of them spilling everywhere. Two
     slightly shabby, but comfortable armchairs. Well-worn Turkish
     rug. Hotplate and two chipped mugs. Model airplanes hanging
     from the ceiling. Recording apparatus. The walls are pearl grey
     and smoky blue.

                           BERTIE
                 My wife's favorite colours.

     Here, in a doctor's office, Bertie's stutter returns.

                           LIONEL
                 Glad we have something in common.

     Bertie's head bangs into one of the models.

                           LIONEL (CONT'D)
                 My lads build them. Make yourself
                 comfortable.
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    21.


                         BERTIE
             Please...

                         LIONEL
             What?

                       BERTIE
             You're too close. Five paces is the rule of
             thumb.

                       LIONEL
             That might be difficult in this office.

Bertie perches uneasily on the edge of an armchair.

                       LIONEL (CONT'D)
             Nice girl, Anna. Worried she wouldn't find
             a husband if she couldn't speak. Tried to
             convince her men will find her even more
             attractive as a silent partner. The perfect
             woman. Sorry, bad Australian joke. Why'd
             your wife change her mind and ask for an
             appointment?

                       BERTIE
             I can't discuss that.

                       LIONEL
             What can we talk about?

                       BERTIE
             That's better. When speaking with a Royal
             one waits for the Royal to start the
             conversation and chose the topic.

                       LIONEL
             Your joking. That won't work here.

                       BERTIE
             I admit if one waits for me to start a
             conversation one can wait a rather long
             time.

Silence.   They stare at each other.

                       BERTIE (CONT'D)
             You call this making me comfortable?

                       LIONEL
             You call this being forthcoming?

                       BERTIE
             Aren't you interested in treating me?
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   22.


                      LIONEL
            Only if you're interested in being cured.

More silence.

                          LIONEL (CONT'D)
            Cuppa tea?

                      BERTIE
            No thank you.

                      LIONEL
            I need one.

Turns on the hot plate.

                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
            Any idea what you're letting yourself in
            for?

                      BERTIE
            Apparently a great deal of rudeness, Doctor
            Logue.

                      LIONEL
            Call me Lionel.

                      BERTIE
            I prefer Doctor.

                      LIONEL
            I prefer Lionel. My family calls me far
            worse. What shall I call you?

                      BERTIE
            The Duke of York is appropriate.

                          LIONEL
            Oh please.

                      BERTIE
            Your Royal Highness then.

                      LIONEL
            Much more informal.

                      BERTIE
            Prince Albert? Or Frederick? Arthur?
            George? I've lots of names to choose from.

                      LIONEL
            How about Bertie?
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   23.


                      BERTIE
                (flushes)
            Only my family uses that.

                      LIONEL
            That's what I'll call you then. We must be
            true equals.

                      BERTIE
            If we were equal I wouldn't be here, I'd be
            at home with my family and no-one would
            give a damn.

Bertie starts to light a cigarette from a silver case.

                      LIONEL
            Don't do that.

Bertie gives him an astonished look.

                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
            Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill
            you.

                      BERTIE
            My physicians say it's good for stuttering,
            relaxes the throat.

                      LIONEL
            They're idiots.

                      BERTIE
            They've all been knighted.

                      LIONEL
            Makes it official then. House rules: no
            smoking.

                      BERTIE
            I thought here we're "equal".

                      LIONEL
            As a monarchist I thought you'd appreciate
            these are my digs and here I rule. No
            smoking. What was your earliest memory?

                      BERTIE
            I beg your pardon?

                      LIONEL
            First recollection of the world?
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     24.


                      BERTIE
                (stutter growing in
                 intensity)
            I'm not here to discuss personal matters.

                      LIONEL
            Why're you here then?

                      BERTIE
                (exploding)
            Because I bloody well stutter! And you
            bloody well can't fix it!!!

                       LIONEL
            Temper.

                      BERTIE
            One of my numerous faults.

                      LIONEL
            Do you stutter when you think?

                      BERTIE
            Don't be ridiculous.

                      LIONEL
            One of my many faults. How about when you
            talk to yourself?

                      BERTIE
            I don't talk to myself!

                      LIONEL
            Come on, everyone natters to themselves
            once in a while, Bertie.

                      BERTIE
            Stop calling me that!

                      LIONEL
            Shan't call you anything else.

                      BERTIE
            Then we shan't speak!

Silence. The jug has boiled.    Lionel makes himself a cup of tea.

                      BERTIE (CONT'D)
            Must I pay for this?

                      LIONEL
            Loads. Now: when you talk to yourself, do
            you stutter?
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   25.


                      BERTIE
            Of course not!

                      LIONEL
            Proving your impediment isn't a permanent
            internal fixture.

                      BERTIE
            When I give a speech...I bloody stutter!!!

                      LIONEL
            Bet you a bob you can read flawlessly,
            right here, right now.

                      BERTIE
                (bitterly)
            Easy money. You're on.

                      LIONEL
            See your shilling then.

                      BERTIE
            Royals don't carry money.

                      LIONEL
            How convenient.

Logue fishes a coin from his pocket and puts it on the table.

                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
            I'll stake you. Pay me back next time.

                      BERTIE
            If there is a next time.

                      LIONEL
            Correct, I haven't agreed to take you on.

During this, Logue has uncovered a piece of apparatus, a
recording device with earphones. He sets a blank disc onto the
turntable and positions a microphone, then hands Bertie an open
book. Bertie glares at it defiantly.

                      BERTIE
            I certainly can't read The Bard.

                      LIONEL
            `Easy money'.

Bertie reads, stuttering badly and getting worse.

                      BERTIE
             "To be or not to be, That is the question.
            Whether it is wiser..." There!
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     26.


Reaches for the coin.

                      LIONEL
            Not so fast.

                      BERTIE
            I proved I can't read.

                      LIONEL
            You proved you can't listen.

Hands Bertie a pair of heavily padded earphones.    Bertie doesn't
want to take them.

                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
            A princely bob is at stake.

Bertie reluctantly puts on the earphones. Logue turns a dial.
LOUD MUSIC is heard. Bertie takes off the earphones. The music
stops.

                      BERTIE
            You're playing music.

                         LIONEL
            I'm aware.

                      BERTIE
            How can I hear what I'm saying?!

                      LIONEL
            Bertie, you're Royal. Surely a prince's
            brain knows what its mouth is doing?

                      BERTIE
            You're not well acquainted with Royal
            princes, are you?

                      LIONEL
            I want to demonstrate that when you can't
            hear your voice, you don't stutter, thus
            proving your impediment is not innate.

                         BERTIE
            Rubbish.

Bertie replaces the earphones. Again, the LOUD MUSIC. His lips
move as he reads, but all that can be heard is the music.
Finished reading the passage he takes off the earphones and the
music ceases. He reaches for the coin, but Logue snatches it.

27   EXT.   PRIVATE LANDING STRIP, SANDRINGHAM ESTATE - NEW DAY     27

     A grass strip cut into the moors. Bertie waits beside a shooting
     break, the stiff breeze whipping his coat, as a small plane
     lands and taxis. The cockpit canopy slides back and the pilot
     leaps out, removing his leather helmet and goggles, revealing
     hair gleaming like gold, perfect teeth flashing a dentist's
     smile. This is - DAVID - the Prince of Wales, Prince Charming,
     the media's darling, a sun god descended from the skies
     accustomed to being worshipped by all.

                  quickie divorce and we're going to make our
                  marriage a fait accompli. As an act of pure
                  spite, Father's trying to depart
                  prematurely in order to complicate matters.

     The break almost careens off the lane.

                            BERTIE
                  You believe that?

29   INT.   KING'S BEDROOM, SANDRINGHAM - DAY                       29

     The King is propped up in bed, wrapped in his favorite faded
     Tibetan dressing gown, hooked to an oxygen tank. He's
     surrounded by his wife, Queen Mary, his two eldest sons, his
     Secretary - CLIVE WIGRAM - his personal physician - DR DAWSON,
     and a NURSE.

     Wigram presents a tray with papers and pen.

     David.

     He waves them out of the room, but beckons Wigram to come close,
     and whispers something in his ear.

                            WIGRAM
                  At the appropriate moment, Your Majesty.

     Clear soup is being served at the immense table.    Places set for
     five, but only Bertie and his mother are seated.    The clinking
     of silver and china. Finally:

                            QUEEN MARY
                  I want my jewelry divided equally.
                  Elizabeth gets first choice. She's not

     David, hunched over a table, appears to be sobbing.     He doesn't
     hear Bertie's discreet knock.

     Seeing his brother crying, Bertie is deeply moved, puts a
     comforting hand on his shoulder. David pulls away as though
     touched by a leper and covers the receiver in his hand.

Startled by the salute, a large flock of blackbirds rise up and
streak across the wintery sky.

A MURMUR, then a shocked GASP, as the gun carriage transverses a
tram track and tilts precipitously. Suddenly the Royal Crown
tumbles and falls, knocking off the Maltese Cross.

The Archbishop and Churchill are watching the events from the
shadows at one end of the balcony.

Below - a scramble to restore the Cross to the Crown, and
replace both atop the coffin.

                      COSMO LANG
            Don't be disingenuous. For our late King's
            crown to fall from his coffin is not a
            fortuitous portent. What ever is going to
            happen next?

                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
            Is that be the motto of the new reign?
            Indeed, will there actually be "a new
            reign"?

                      COSMO LANG
            Winston! I'm deeply shocked.

                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
            You don't look it.

                      COSMO LANG
            My function requires me to appear serene.

                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
            That may be increasingly difficult to
            maintain. I've been informed by no less an
            authority than the Prime Minister that our
            populace has no objection to Royal
            fornication, but will never tolerate
            adultery.

                      COSMO LANG
            Well, since we cannot acquire a new
            populace, perhaps we need a new King?

                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
            My turn to be profoundly shocked.

Neither look the slightest traumatized.

                      COSMO LANG
            Scoff, Churchill! Go on... scoff! But you
            more than others know full well we'll soon
            be under siege from the forces of darkness.

                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
            The winds of war...a gathering storm?

                      COSMO LANG
            Oh, you do have a way with words. And who
            would you suggest to rally the troops, the
            nation, the Empire, the world?

INTERCUT to Bertie in the funeral cortege, looking frail and
pale.

                  Thus we're left with David, the rightful

47   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS          47

     Bertie waits at a table with a group of immaculately attired
     courtiers and dignitaries. This is the Coronation Committee.
     The chair at the head of the table is empty, everyone waiting
     for its occupant.

     He finally arrives. David. He gestures for Bertie to come into
     the corridor, but deliberately leaves the door open so the
     committee can hear snatches of Bertie's ensuing humiliation.

                  Hear you're taking elocution lessons, lad.

                             BERTIE
                  Pardon?

     He thrusts a document into Bertie's hands, then pokes his head
     into the conference room.

     Bertie looks at the pages, his throat constricts, his chest
     tightens and his hands begin to shake.

     In the room, they are appalled.

     Bertie stands frozen and shattered.


49   INT/EXT. AUSTIN PRINCESS ON SOUTH KENSINGTON STREET - NEW DAY49

     The lion rampant flutters on the bonnet of the Austin. Inside,
     Bertie, wearing a black armband, gestures for the driver to
     stop. Pulling his homburg over his brow, Bertie wraps his scarf
     around the lower portion of his face. Then catches his
     reflection in the rearview mirror. Tells his driver:

                  Wait down the road.

     Not wanting to draw attention to his destination, Bertie has
     disembarked several buildings away from Logue's address. He
     makes his way hurriedly.

     WACK. A soccer football hits him on the back.    He wheels
     around.

     The group of local lads look at him unabashed.

                  Nice one.

     They go back to their game.

     Bertie rings Logue's bell. A brief pause. Bertie glances
     nervously, hoping not to be recognized. Lionel opens the door.

                            LIONEL

     Bertie has to pick his way through discarded toys and sporting
     equipment, explaining to Logue:

                  I was totally unable to speak.

52   INT.   LIVING AREA, LOGUE'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS               52

     Bertie looks around the cluttered, but pleasant room:
     comfortable furniture a bit battered by the boys, antimacassars
     to hide the wear spots on the arms, family photos everywhere,
     well-used Turkish rug on the floor.

                              LIONEL
                  Home.

     Lionel stares, unsure if he's being patronized.

                            LIONEL
                  Coming from a man who's lived all his life

53   INT. LOGUE'S STUDY - NEW DAY                               53

     Bertie stands shattered, lost in his painful memory.

                           BERTIE
                 I couldn't say anything!

                           LIONEL
                 You could've refused. Don't you know any

                      BERTIE
            Royals aren't allowed emotions in public.

            Which explains a lot.

            What do you want me to do, dammit!? Stage

            operetta?!

                      LIONEL
            Your next public appearance should be very
            well rehearsed.

Without thinking, Lionel instinctively reaches out to pat Bertie
supportively on the shoulder.

Bertie pulls back in offended shock.   All the warning signals
instilled in him are going off.

                      BERTIE
            Don't take liberties! You're a dangerous
            man, Logue. Who sent you?

            Anyone in mind?

                      BERTIE
            The lurking shadows. Courtiers and
            peers...the whole panoply of a class which
            once ruled the nation which once ruled the
            world, afraid of losing their last vestige
            of privilege if the monarchy is further
            debased.

            Your wife was the one who sought me out.

            believes in me!

            I'm beginning to ask myself that very same
            question. Your sailing close to the edge,
            don't push me, Doctor Logue.

            Lionel.

                      BERTIE
            I came here because I was taught from
            childhood to serve a purpose, and that
            purpose is to serve. Duty is our sole
            justification for privilege.

            I came here because I was under the
            illusion you might help me perform that
            function!

                      LIONEL
            Not to worry. They say the King can do no
            wrong.

            He can bugger things up! And I am not the
            King. Mrs. Simpson is seeking a divorce.
            The Coronation is set for the 12th of May.
            Her decree becomes final on the 27th of
            April. That gives them two weeks to marry
            and put this issue to rest.

            And if Mr Baldwin stops them?

            That would be a tragedy. I pray to The
            Almighty they succeed. I'll do anything
            within my power to keep my brother on the
            throne.

            we can parse any document into manageable
            phrases. You can sing them, swear them,

     square jaw - MRS WALLIS SIMPSON. Her most attractive physical

                  decrees royalty must be greeted by the
                  official host. In this case: the King. You
                  behaved impeccably. As always.

            You're well aware, of course, George IV's
            wife, Mrs. Fitzherbert, was very common
            indeed...and previously married. She signed
            an agreement that she could never become
            Queen, and their children could not be
            Royal. A rather sensible morganatic
            arrangement.

                        ELIZABETH
            That was   a very long time ago. You're

         Didn't bother anyone during WWI. And Kaiser
         Willie was our uncle.

                   BERTIE
         Because we took an English name! Windsor.

         We're not ordinary men, David! We were bred

                   Will it? Well, enough chit-chat. The
                   question of a morganatic marriage, as a
                   possible solution, has been put to the
                   Dominion Prime Ministers. After all, HM is

                  This is not about true love, Winston. This

         Your brother held conversations with the
         Duke of Saxe-Coburg, your cousin, a ranking

         Baldwin or I? I myself wish to talk with
         Hitler, and will do so here or in Germany."
         I doubt England is ready to return to
         absolute monarchy.

                  At long last I am able to say a few words
                  of my own. Until now it has not been
                  constitutionally possible for me to speak.
                  A few hours ago I discharged my last duty
                  as King and Emperor.

65   INT.   PLAYROOM, YORK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                      65

     Bertie and Elizabeth listening to the radio with the two
     princesses royal sitting at their parents' feet. Bertie battles
     his emotions.

                            DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)
                  Now that I have been succeeded by my
                  brother, the Duke of York, my first words
                  must be to declare my allegiance to him.

                      (whispers)
                  Daddy, who broke our rocking horse?

                      (whispers)
                  A giant.

     Elizabeth holds a finger to her lips: shush.

                             DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)

                  This has been made less difficult to me by
                  the sure knowledge that my brother has one
                  matchless blessing, enjoyed by so many of
                  you, and not bestowed on me -- a happy home
                  with his wife and children.


66   INT. LOGUE'S PARLOUR - NIGHT                                  66

     The glow of a radio dial. Lionel and Myrtle sit in armchairs,
     the radio on a side-table between them.

                            DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)
                  I have found it impossible to carry the
                  heavy burden of responsibility and to
                  discharge my duties as King as I would wish
                  to do without the help and support of the
                  woman I love.

     Lionel gets up to turn it off as David's voice concludes:

                            DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER) (CONT'D)
                  We all have a new King. I wish him and you,
                  his people, happiness and prosperity with
                  all my heart. God bless you all! God save
                  the King!

     Logue strokes Myrtle's hair.

                            LIONEL
                  I too "married the woman I love."

                   MYRTLE
         You married a shop girl.

                   LIONEL
         A wonderful lass. Someone I can talk to
         heart to heart.

                   MYRTLE
         Using simple words and short sentences. I'm
         very ordinary.

                   LIONEL
         That's why we're suited. I'm just an
         ordinary bloke.

                   MYRTLE
         Ordinary? You're a man with wild dreams,
         Lionel. Mine are so very small. A job, a
         husband, a home. Raising our sons. That's
         all I ever wanted.

                   LIONEL
         Me too.

                   MYRTLE
         Is that why, every day, you've spent hours
         with a man who's about to be King?

                   LIONEL
         That relationship is now past tense.

                   MYRTLE
         Yet, for as long as you could, you did what
         you wanted.

                   LIONEL
         I wanted to be a great actor. That's what I
         wanted.

                   MYRTLE
         And failing that...

                   LIONEL
         I certainly failed!

                   MYRTLE
         A great healer. Always...'great'. Where
         does a shop girl fit in?

                   LIONEL
         Very snugly, into my heart! Always have,
         always will.

                            MYRTLE
                  Trouble is, Lionel, when you say that, I
                  still believe it.


67   INT.   INNER COURTYARD, YORK HOUSE - DAY                    67

     The Royal standard on a gleaming car's bonnet.

     Bertie stands uneasily in the uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet
     as the driver opens the door. Bertie realizes its a Rolls.

                            BERTIE
                  Where's the Austin?

                            DRIVER
                  The Palace changed it, Your Highness.

                            BERTIE
                  I liked the Austin.

                            DRIVER
                  So did I, sir.

     The two girls wave from their open playroom window, and call:

                            MARGARET ROSE
                  You look like a chicken.

                               LILIBET
                  A rooster.

     He waves, and gets in.


68   EXT.   ST. JAMES PALACE - THAT DAY                          68

     A formal voice announces:

                            MASTER OF THE COUNCIL (O.S.)
                  His Majesty will address the Accession
                  Council and take his oath.


69   INT.   ANTECHAMBER, ACCESSION COUNCIL - CONTINUOUS          69

     Bertie looks at himself in a full length mirror, making last
     minute adjustments to his uniform. Staring at his reflection:

                            BERTIE
                  How did this happen to you?
        TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     77.


70   INT.   ACCESSION COUNCIL CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS                 70

     Bertie walks to the podium like a man to the gallows faced with
     an array of the Privy Councillors, members of the House of
     Lords, the Lord Mayor of the City of London, the Aldermen of the
     City of London and the High Commissioners of the Commonwealth
     countries.

     All the old symptoms reappear: the tightening of the neck
     muscles, the protruding Adam's apple, the jaw locking.

                             BERTIE
                  My Lords, members of the Accession Council,
                  I meet you today in circumstances which are
                  without parallel in the history of our
                  Country...

     Its going to be a terrible performance. He bows his head in
     humility. And shame.


71   INT.   PLAYROOM, YORK HOUSE - THAT DAY                        71

     Elizabeth is playing quietly with her daughters when the door
     opens and Bertie appears, still in full regalia, straight from
     the Accession Council. He holds his arm out, expecting them to
     run to him for a hug and kiss, his solace after the ordeal.
     They remain where they are.

                            BERTIE
                  Daddy's home.

     They curtsy formally.

                            LILIBET & MARGARET ROSE
                  Your Majesty.

     Bertie is devastated.   Elizabeth takes him quickly out into the
     corridor.


72   INT.   BERTIE'S STUDY, YORK HOUSE - DAY                       72

                            BERTIE
                  I don't want to lose you.

                            ELIZABETH
                  How could you possibly?

                            BERTIE
                  Being what we both dread most.

                             ELIZABETH
                   Dear, dear, man, I refused your first two
                   marriage proposals because, as much as I
                   loved you, I couldn't abide the thought of
                   living in the Royal gilded cage. Then I
                   realized...you stuttered so
                   beautifully...they'd leave you alone.

     She takes his face in her hands tenderly.

                              ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                   If I must be Queen, I will be a good Queen.
                   The wife of a very great King indeed.

                   You know what you must do.


73   INT.   LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM & WAITING ROOM - NEW DAY     73

     Logue is working with Anna. She's reading smoothly and with
     great intensity.

                             ANNA
                   "Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths

                             LIONEL
                   We haven't much more time together. Give it
                   a go.

     The doorbell RINGS.     Logue is annoyed.

                             LIONEL (CONT'D)
                   There weren't any more appointments today.

     The bell RINGS again.    He yells:

                             LIONEL (CONT'D)
                   Piss off!

                   "The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
                   Of night and light and the half-light..."

     The door opens and Bertie enters the waiting area. Hearing Anna
     he stops outside the consultation room and listens.

Silence.

                      LIONEL
                (softly)
            Read it to him. If he doesn't profess his
            love, he's not a man.

Anna nods earnestly.

                      ANNA
            Thank you...Lionel.

She exits via the Waiting Room and almost runs into Bertie. On
recognizing him, she bobs her head.

                      BERTIE
            That was lovely. Don't take any guff.

                      ANNA
            Can I tell my Harold that's what you said?

                      BERTIE
            I'd be honoured.

She dashes off.

Logue comes to the door of the Waiting Room, in effect blocking
Bertie's way in.

                      LIONEL
            Johnson, isn't it? Have you an appointment?

                      BERTIE
            Want me to beg?

            I told you, Kings don't beg.

                      BERTIE
            I believe this time a bit of begging might
            be required. Elizabeth says I must eat
            humble crow.

                 I was frightened and took refuge in being

                 What's the one essential thing a King must
                 do? He must believe he is King. How can I
                 possibly do that? For pity sake, Lionel, I
                 beg you: get me through! I'll pay you
                 another shilling.

74   INT. LOGUE BEDROOM - NIGHT                                  74

     The double bed is piled high with clothing, a suitcase at its
     foot. Myrtle is sorting. She hears Lionel enter behind her. At
     first, she doesn't turn. Lionel remains silent.

                           MYRTLE
                 I've got the boys sorting their things.
                 Your office will be a chore...

     Realizing something is amiss, she turns, and knows instantly
     what Lionel's going to tell her. Her hand goes to her mouth to
     stifle her emotions.


75   INT. BERTIE'S STUDY - DAY                                   75

     Bertie is with visitors: Churchill and Lang. There's a slight
     but discernible change in his demeanor.

                           COSMO LANG
                 We asked to see Your Highness because
                 there's the urgent question of what to call
                 your brother. Aside from the obvious.

     Bertie is not pleased with His Grace's joke, but lets it pass.

            Mr. Edward Windsor? All he deserves.

            What has my brother given up on his
            abdication, other than the throne?

They look at each other, unsure.

                      BERTIE (CONT'D)
            Wouldn't it be a good idea to find out
            before coming to me? He cannot be Mister,
            as he was born the son of a Duke. Which
            makes him a Lord at the very least.

                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
            Very well, Lord E.W. it is.

                      BERTIE
            And as a Lord of the realm, he's entitled
            to be elected to the House of Commons.
            Heading a King's Party.

                      COSMO LANG
            Unacceptable!

                      BERTIE
            So you prefer he takes a seat in the House
            of Lords? Again, on behalf of a King's
            Party? Is that acceptable?

                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
            Certainly not.

                      BERTIE
            But if he's made a Royal Duke, and called
            His Royal Highness, he cannot stand for
            Parliament. Nor may he speak or vote in the
            House of Lords.

     Myrtle is in the shop window, arranging handbags, luggage, and
     briefcases.


77   INT. D.HENRY LTD. - CONTINUOUS                                77

     In the store Myrtle can be seen dressing the window, while in
     his glass office the OWNER, a portly bald gentleman with a
     Dickensian air, is deep in concerned conversation with a man in
     trench-coat. The Owner keeps glancing worriedly in Myrtle's
     direction.

     The two men nod, shake hands. The fellow in the trench-coat
     leaves. The owner beckons another shop-girl over and whispers
     something to her. She heads towards Myrtle.

                            BERTIE (O. S.)

78   INT. LOGUE'S STUDY AND PARLOUR - DAY                          78

     A wall divides the study from the living area, allowing the
     action in both spaces to be viewed.

     IN THE PARLOUR: Elizabeth waits, ill at ease.

     IN THE STUDY:

                            LIONEL
                  Splendid. Here's another. "She sifted seven
                  thick-stalked thistles through strong thick
                  sieves." At home, twenty-five times, in
                  rapid succession.

                            BERTIE
                  Those are my hardest sounds.

     Lionel gives him a look.

                             BERTIE (CONT'D)
                  Oh.

                            LIONEL
                  Shall we invite your wife in now?
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     83.


Logue goes to the door and starts to open it. He shuts it
quickly.

                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
            I wasn't expecting Myrtle for several
            hours!

IN THE PARLOUR: Myrtle has entered, definitely unhappy. Seeing
Elizabeth, she's even less happy, and flabbergasted.

                       MYRTLE
            Milady?

                      ELIZABETH
            "Your Majesty", the first time. After that,
            "Ma'am". Not Malm as in Palm, Mam as in
            ham. I'm informed your husband calls my
            husband Bertie and my husband calls your
            husband Lionel. I trust, however, you won't
            attempt to call me Liz.

IN THE STUDY: Lionel stands listening, ear to the door.

                      BERTIE
            How're they getting on?

                      LIONEL
            As to be expected.

IN THE PARLOUR: Myrtle announces:

                      MYRTLE
            You may call me "Madam Logue".

Myrtle's at a loss knowing what to do with a Duchess.

                      MYRTLE (CONT'D)
            May I offer you a cup of tea, Ma'am?

                      ELIZABETH
            Thank you, Madame Logue, but I'm waiting to
            be summoned.

Silence.

                      MYRTLE
            You don't like my husband. That's what I
            was told.

                      ELIZABETH
            I was told the same.

IN THE STUDY:

            Do we remain in hiding?

                      LIONEL
            I'm not going out there!

IN THE PARLOUR:

                      MYRTLE
            What do you dislike about my Lionel?

                      ELIZABETH
            I don't wish my husband to be demeaned.
            What don't you like about mine?

                      MYRTLE
            I don't want my Lionel getting hurt.

                      ELIZABETH
            There's only one thing can save him now:
            success.

IN THE STUDY: the men are growing increasingly nervous.

                      BERTIE
            We're being cowards.

                      LIONEL
            Of course. We're sensible men.

                      BERTIE
            You should go in.

                       LIONEL
            Me? You.

                       BERTIE
            Why me?!

                      LIONEL
            You're the Royal.

                      BERTIE
            Being a monarchist, I recognize these are
            your digs. Therefore: here you rule.
            Therefore: you go in.

Urged by Bertie, Logue opens the door.

IN THE PARLOUR: Logue enters, pretending total innocence and
surprise, followed by Bertie, also trying to keep the pretense.
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    85.


                      LIONEL
            Oh! Hello, Lady Elizabeth! Oh! Hello,
            Myrtle darling! What a pleasant surprise.

Myrtle stares at him and takes her revenge.

                      MYRTLE
            Will the Yorks be staying for dinner?

Logue and Bertie look panic-stricken.   Elizabeth comes to the
rescue.

                      ELIZABETH
            A previous engagement.

                      LIONEL
            Some other time, love.

Logue ushers Elizabeth into the study, giving Myrtle a nervous
little wave. She glares and exits.

IN THE STUDY:

                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
            Glad you had a chance to meet Myrtle.

Bertie stifles a snort. Elizabeth glares at him.

                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
                (to Elizabeth)
            Good of you to come.

                      ELIZABETH
            Harley Street is far too public. What is my
            function here?

                      LIONEL
            For me to show you how to pitch in.

                      ELIZABETH
            Oh dear, I may not be a `pitch in' type.

                      LIONEL
            Piece of cake.
                (to Bertie)
            Please assume a supine position on the
            floor.

                       ELIZABETH
            What?!

                      LIONEL
            Firm support is needed.

Bertie dutifully lies on the floor.

                         LIONEL (CONT'D)
               Breathe deeply...expand your chest... now
               your stomach...deep into the diaphragm.
               Splendid. How do you feel?

                         BERTIE
               Full of hot air.

                         LIONEL
               Well on your way to becoming a qualified
               political speaker. Again...

Bertie inhales deeply.

                         LIONEL (CONT'D)
               ... and hold. Now, Princess Elizabeth, be
               so kind as to sit on your husband's
               stomach.

                         ELIZABETH
               Good grief.

                         LIONEL
               Gently of course.

Elizabeth sits gingerly on Bertie's stomach, asking
solicitously:

                         ELIZABETH
               Are you alright, Bertie?

Bertie nods.

                         LIONEL
               Now exhale slowly...down goes Princess
               Elizabeth...inhale slowly...nothing rushed,
               expanding your chest fully, extending the
               column of air til it hits the
               diaphragm...and...up comes Princess
               Elizabeth. Exhale...down goes Princess
               Elizabeth...inhale...up comes Princess
               Elizabeth. You get the idea. Doesn't have
               to be Princess Elizabeth of course, but I
               thought you'd prefer your wife to one of
               the staff. Now comes the fun part.

                         ELIZABETH
               There's actually more?

Bertie springs to his feet while Logue opens a window.
        TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     87.


                             LIONEL
                   You will now shout the vowel sounds, all
                   five of them, as loudly as possible, each
                   to last no less than 15 seconds. There's
                   poor coordination between your larynx and
                   diaphragm. Princess Elizabeth, you can be
                   the official timer.

                             ELIZABETH
                   Vowel sounds? Shouted at an open window? On
                   a public street?

                             LIONEL
                   Anyone who can stand at an open window
                   vibrating loudly in full view of the world
                   can learn to give a public speech.

                             ELIZABETH
                   They can also be considered quite dotty.
                   Don't even contemplate it!

                             BERTIE
                   Sorry, dear, doctor's orders.

            here?!

               Royal saviour?! Who's going to help us?!
               This will bring us down, Lionel. You know
               it will.

                         LIONEL
               When that poor chap first walked into my
               office, he was a slim, quiet man with tired
               eyes and all the outward symptoms of the
               person upon whom a habitual speech defect
               has set the sign. You saw him today; once
               more there was hope.

                         MYRTLE
               You're not listening to me!

She gets up angrily and starts carrying dishes to the kitchen.
He follows her back and forth.

                         LIONEL
               Myrtle, I love you.

                         MYRTLE
               You say that, but you don't listen when I
               say, in so many ways, how desperately I
               want to go home, how I never, ever,
               intended to stay here. This was to be a
               holiday trip to see `Mother England', and
               you turned it into quite something else.
               What happened, Lionel? We went to Wembley
               Stadium, next thing...you'd cashed in our
               tickets.

He's silent.

               Very well, I shan't talk of this ever

                  They're frightened, Lionel. Of what seems
                  so far above them. I sympathize. I'm
                  frightened too.

     Establishing shot of this architectural icon.

                            COSMO LANG (O.S.)
                  Winston, you do read the newspapers?


81   INT.   WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY                              81

     A massive cavern of stone statuary and stained glass. The
     center piece of this particular section is the throne of Edward
     the Confessor. Scaffolding is in the process of being erected
     to supply lighting for the Coronation. Archbishop Lang and
     Churchill inspect it with satisfaction.

                            WINSTON CHURCHILL
                  Only the vulgar ones.

     Churchill pours two nips of whiskey into metal cups nested in a
     hip flask.

                  Let's sincerely hope.

     They look at each other in silence.

                            WINSTON CHURCHILL
                  Is this a `slightly pregnant pause'?
TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   91.


                   COSMO LANG
         They say he is dim.

                   WINSTON CHURCHILL
         Demonstrably untrue.

                   COSMO LANG
         They say he has epilepsy.

                   WINSTON CHURCHILL
         Patently erroneous.

                   COSMO LANG
         Fragile, prone to illness...

                   WINSTON CHURCHILL
         Some correctness in that.

                     COSMO LANG
         ...and will die prematurely. They predict
         he'll be unable to complete the Coronation.

                   WINSTON CHURCHILL
         What do you propose? Shorten the ceremony?
         Or no ceremony at all?

                   COSMO LANG
         My idea exactly!

                    WINSTON CHURCHILL
         I believed so. But what we need is a
         pageant of pomp and pomposity to impress
         the world.

                   COSMO LANG
         What we need, and what we'll get, may be
         two rather different things. Did you hear
         his pathetic attempt at the Accession
         Council? He'll never be able to speak in
         public.

                   WINSTON CHURCHILL
         So, we plonk a tinsel crown on his head and
         lock him in a closet? Who then will
         spiritually lead this great nation into
         war? Who will address the far flung corners
         of the Empire, rallying all to our defense?

                   COSMO LANG
         Well...

                   WINSTON CHURCHILL
         The Head of our Church? Is that what you
         have in mind?
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   92.


                      COSMO LANG
            Would it be such a calamity?

                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
            Best ask our new King.

Bertie has entered with Logue. Lang spins around.

                      COSMO LANG
            Your Majesty.

                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
            Excuse me, sir, duty calls.

He exits quickly. Cosmo continues nervously as they walk
through the Abbey, the Archbishop pointing out the preparations
in progress, particularly a booth for broadcasters.

                      BERTIE
            Is this the scene of the crime?

                      COSMO LANG
            What a peculiar thing to say.

                      BERTIE
            Referring to my assault upon the ears of
            the listeners.

                      COSMO LANG
            Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's
            Box. I have, however, categorically said no
            to the BBC's new "radio-with-pictures"
            gadget. Imagine, the unwashed viewing us as
            we blow our noses or scratch our bottoms.

                      BERTIE
            Radio with pictures?!

                      COSMO LANG
            It is called..."television". Happily, with
            a transmission range of only fifteen miles
            this "TV" thing has no future. We shall,
            however, be forced to permit cinema; the
            product of which I shall personally edit.

                      BERTIE
            That'll keep you busy, removing all my
            stops and starts.

                      COSMO LANG
            Unless of course you'd prefer a quiet
            ceremony?
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   93.


                      BERTIE
            What exactly do you mean?

                      COSMO LANG
            Something...discreet...private. We could
            pre-record an edited version to be
            broadcast to the world. Or even find an
            actor with a similar voice.

Logue has arrived and comes out of the shadows.

                      LIONEL
            A King based upon deception?

Cosmo takes Bertie aside.

                      COSMO LANG
            If your gentleman from Security would give
            us space, we could discuss this in private.

                      BERTIE
            You mean my bodyguard,"Crusher?"

Giving Lionel a scathing look, Lang continues speaking to Bertie
confidentially.

                      COSMO LANG
            Fret not. As I assured our nation in my
            recent broadcast: "When his people listen
            to their new Monarch they will note an
            occasional momentary hesitation in his
            speech. But to those who hear it, it need
            cause no sort of embarrassment, for it
            causes none to him who speaks." You see,
            I've paved the way. But should you wish to
            avoid further stress...

                      LIONEL
            Why not paint him pink and cover him with
            sequins?

                       COSMO LANG
            Pardon?!

                      LIONEL
            If you wish to call attention to his
            anxiety.

                      COSMO LANG
            Does your bodyguard know to whom he's
            speaking? He certainly doesn't know his
            place!
TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   94.


                   BERTIE
         Doctor Lionel Logue, my speech therapist.

                   COSMO LANG
         Therapist?! I'd no idea! Had I known Your
         Majesty was seeking assistance I would've
         made my own recommendation.

                   BERTIE
         Dr. Logue is to be present at the
         Coronation.

                   COSMO LANG
         Impossibly to find room. Even for a Doctor.

                   LIONEL
         Just Lionel.

                   BERTIE
         Behind the chair of Edward the Confessor.

                   COSMO LANG
         The Royal Box!? Your Family will be seated
         there.

                   BERTIE
         Which makes it most suitable.

                   COSMO LANG
         Perhaps I might be able to add a very small
         stool.

                   BERTIE
         Two comfortable chairs. One for Madam
         Logue. She's a close friend of my wife. The
         Queen.

                   COSMO LANG
         I'll have someone attend to it.

                   LIONEL
         And now, if you don't mind, we need the
         premises.

                   COSMO LANG
         My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
         The Church must make preparations.

                   LIONEL
         So must Bertie.

                   COSMO LANG
         Bertie?! We do not call the King: "Bertie"!
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                        95.


                       LIONEL
            I do. During waking hours we'll need the
            facilities. It'll be a closed set. No
            observers.

                      BERTIE
            Those are my wishes, Your Grace.

Lang nods curtly and exits.

                      BERTIE (CONT'D)
            You've made a dangerous enemy.

                      LIONEL
            Wouldn't want him as a friend.

                      BERTIE
            And don't ever call me Bertie in public.

A moment of confrontation.    Lionel knows he's overstepped.

                         LIONEL
            Tell me...

                      BERTIE
            I sense one of your dreadful questions on
            the horizon.

                      LIONEL
            Do you really want to be King?

                      BERTIE
            Knew it! I haven't any choice.

                      LIONEL
            You can be a wounded King who stumbles
            through his Coronation. Or, as the Arch of
            C so archly suggests, no Coronation at all.
            Always a choice.

                      BERTIE
            What's this, you wait til Westminster
            Abbey, then ambush me?

                      LIONEL
            I'm simply asking questions... which you
            seem unable to answer.

                      BERTIE
            I'm a sacrificial lamb being led to
            slaughter! Damn you!
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     96.


                      LIONEL
            Quite possibly. But at least I know what I
            want. You haven't the foggiest.

                      BERTIE
                (explodes)
            I WANT TO BE HEARD!

His words reverberate through the empty abbey.

                      LIONEL
            That's quite different. Let's get down to
            work then, shall we?

Bertie glares at him.

                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
            As soon as you and Elizabeth enter the West
            door, you'll be greeted with the hymn "I
            Was Glad When They Said Unto Me." You won't
            actually be that glad, because they sing it
            for a great long time.

Bertie follows Logue deep into the bowels of the `Abbey'.

                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
            You'll then show yourself to the various
            sides of the Abbey as the Archbishop
            announces four times in a loud voice,
            "Sirs, I here present unto you..." Have you
            decided your name for when you become King?
            For when you become a different person?

            George.

            Like your father?

            Like my father.

                      LIONEL
            Not Albert?

                      BERTIE
            Given the current situation...too Germanic.

                      LIONEL

     "George, your undoubted King!" echoes through the Abby.

82   INT. AN OFFICE IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT                    82

     Lang is on the phone. The door is open. While talking he
     watches the work preparations. On the phone he tells someone:

                           COSMO LANG
                 I've made inquiries.

     Logue enters and sits at the table. Myrtle serves him.

                           MYRTLE
                 A bit dry. Tried to keep it warm.

                           LIONEL
                 Mmm... Kedgeree! Lovely.

                 You look done in.

                           LIONEL
                 I've news for you. You're coming to the
                 Coronation.

                 You must.

                           MYRTLE
                 Stand in the rain hoping for a glimpse?

                           LIONEL
                 Royal Box. You and I.

     Stunned silence, then.

                           MYRTLE
                 Lionel...I'd need a new dress.

                           LIONEL
                 Rather thought you might.

     Valentine calls from the next room:
        TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     98.

                            LIONEL
                  Won't be a sec.

     He exits. Myrtle waits. Looks at herself, bemused, reflected in
     a glass-fronted cabinet. Even does a curtsey.


84   INT.   WESTMINSTER ABBEY - THAT NIGHT                         84

     The last of the preparation crew are being scurried out by Lang.
     He gives a final, satisfied, look at the cavernous space, like a
     director preparing the stage for a final scene. He quotes
     Shakespeare, extremely pleased with himself:

          When the war came, by the time I was ready
          to be shipped out, the first casualties
          were limping home. Poor buggers, broken in
          bone and spirit. `Lionel, you're good with
          your mouth, see if you can help these poor
          sods.' The shell-shocked were the saddest.
          Most stuttered profoundly. Far worse than
          you. Muscle therapy helped somewhat, but I
          found I had to go deeper, as you might well
          imagine.

          I know nothing of those poor men!

                    LIONEL
          I think you do. They had cried out, and the
          universe had not listened. So they'd lost
          faith in their voice. My job was to make
          them shout in righteous anger: "I have the
          right to be heard!"

            Not in Western Australia, not at that time.
            I simply knew what to do. When the war was
            over I kept being a therapist to earn a
            living. When the lads were old enough, I
            thought, "Alright Lionel, you've always
            wanted to be an actor, one last go." I
            pretended it was our trip home to Mother
            England, the Great Australian Pilgrimage.

     The dreaded BBC microphone.

     The room has been transformed into an ad hoc broadcasting studio
     for this all-important occasion.

small cluster of technicians putting finishing touches to their
equipment.

            I've heard he may not even show.

The Floor Manager tries to warn him with his eyes.

Bertie has entered with Elizabeth and Logue. The Reader wishes
he could sink into the floor. Bertie says nothing, but
approaches the looming microphone, while Logue and Elizabeth
watch nervously.

The object is a silver medal. Bertie pins it to Logue's jacket.

            Almost.

The red light on the microphone starts to blink.   Logue joins
the others.

The Reader is at a smaller microphone near the ad hoc `broadcast

            World programme, broadcasting from
            Buckingham Palace. His Majesty, the King.

During this, Bertie's hands begin to shake, the pages of his
speech rattle like dry leaves, his throat muscles constrict, the
Adam's apple bulges, his lips tighten...all the old symptoms
reappear.

Several seconds have elapsed since the Reader finished.   It
seems an eternity.

Elizabeth grasps the sides of her chair with white knuckles.

Lang's eyes roll heavenward.

Churchill studies the situation, ready to leap into the breach.

Bertie and Logue stare at each other.

Logue smiles, perfectly calm, totally confident in the man he's
worked with. His confidence is contagious.

Bertie takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. His hands
grow steady, his throat muscles relax...all the things he's
practiced.

                  are called, with our allies, to meet the
                  challenge of a principle which, if it were
                  to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized
                  order in the world. It is the principle
                  which permits a State, in the selfish
                  pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties
                  and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the
                  use of force, or threat of force, against
                  the sovereignty and independence of other
                  States. Such a principle, stripped of all
                  disguise, is surely the mere primitive
                  doctrine that might is right, and if this
                  principle were established throughout the
                  world, the freedom of our own country and
                  of the whole British Commonwealth of

                  stand calm, firm, and united in this time
                  of trial. The task will be hard. There may
                  be dark days ahead, and war can no longer
                  be confined to the battlefield. But we can

Another `cut' gesture from the Floor Manager, the red light goes
out and the transmission is concluded. The Floor Manager looks
to the Reader.

            He wasn't perfect.
                (barely controlling his
                 tears)
            Not perfect... But by God... He moved me.

AT THE MAIN BBC MICROPHONE - Bertie waits for the verdict of his
peers. Churchill first:

                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
            Couldn't have said it better myself.

The ultimate compliment.   Lang next.

                      COSMO LANG
            I'm speechless.

                (softly)
            Thank God.

She goes to Bertie and kisses him tenderly on the cheek, takes
his hand, then Logue's.

                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
            Well done, Bertie. Well done...
                (for the first time)
            ...Lionel. Well done.

She leaves the two men together.

                      LIONEL
            I always called you Bertie. Today, I call
            you King.

He offers his hand. But instead of taking it, Bertie takes him
by the shoulders and gives him a hug. This is a long way from
the five pace rule. The last barrier has fallen.
