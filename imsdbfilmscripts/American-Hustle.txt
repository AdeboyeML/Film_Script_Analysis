2   INT. PLAZA HOTEL WINDOW NYC - DAY                               

    IRVING ROSENFELD, not a small man, gets dressed and
    meticulously constructs his combover. Camera WRAPS AROUND,
    see his hands with rings adjust his dark velvet suit, up to
    his face, serious, concentrated, intense, he is composing
    himself before a performance.

    Irving is now dressed, ready, and walks down the hall to
    another room.

3   SECOND PLAZA HOTEL ROOM

    Irving composes himself -- looks     
    into cramped surveillance closet, there are FBI Agents -- we
    only see their hands and arms -- he looks at monitors -- sees
    a BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE OF ANOTHER ROOM ON MONITOR: MAYOR
    CARMINE POLITO, swath of salt and pepper hair, cream suit,
    pinky ring, Rotary Club pin -- ALONG WITH CARL ELWAY, preppie
    shady businessman.

    He exhales pressure, turns as CAMERA PANS TO: SYDNEY PROSSER
    (who will also be known for some time as EDITH GREENSLY),
    stylish crafty smart. They stare at each other intensely --
    they have a deep and emotional relationship. A DOOR BANGS
    OPEN, and in walks RICHIE DIMASO, Bronx-born. He stands
    there.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               What are you doing, going behind my
               back? Telling people I'm screwing
               up this operation? I got you a
               suite at the fuckin' Plaza Hotel!

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               The shittiest suite at the Plaza
               Hotel.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               What?!

                         IRV ROSENFELD
               The shittiest fuckin' suite.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               Based on what--?
                                       2.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               And the food is wrong, and--What is
               this? You, like, went in my closet
               or something?

                         EDITH GREENSLY
               No

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Are you dressing him like you're
               dressing me now?

                         EDITH GREENSLY
                   (shakes her head)
               No, what are you thinking? This
               isn't all about you, you know that.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               What, did you try to dress me so I
               would look like him?

                         EDITH GREENSLY
               No, you're not dressed like him,
               all right?

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               But I do, I look like him.

                         EDITH GREENSLY
               No, he's in like, velvet. Come on.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               You asked me to show you how this
               was done, you wanna fuck it up be
               my guest.

                         EDITH GREENSLY
               What is your problem?


                         RICHIE DIMASO
               Hey, look, I never laid a hand on
               her, all right? Is that what this
               is about?

                         EDITH GREENSLY
                        (British accent)
               Well technically, that's not true.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               Look, we never had sex ok? I just --
                                                            3.


                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
               What'd I do? I put my hand like
               this --

    Richie reaches out and puts his hand on Irving's face very
    carefully, not forcefully.

    Irving swipes it away violently the second it touches his
    face.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Don't you fucking touch me. That
          bothers me --

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Oh it does?

                     IRVING ROSENFELD
          Oh yeah.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          That bothers you?

                     IRVING ROSENFELD
          Yes.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          You know, a lot of shit bothers me
          too, but I was trying to help you.
          If I wanted to bother you, if I
          really wanted to fucking bother
          you, this is what I'd do.


    Richie takes his hand and destroys the combover Irving spent
    so much time creating. Irving just stands there, hair ruined,
    staring at Richie.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          You shouldn't have done that.

    Irving just stands there staring at Richie, hair all wild and
    messed up looking very angry.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          How's that? You bothered now? (no
          answer) Alright, don't make a thing
          of it.

                     EDITH GREENSLY
          You shouldn't touch him. He doesn't
          like that.
                                                                4.


                        RICHIE DIMASO
              Oh my god, fix his hair. Don't make
              a thing of it.

                        EDITH GREENSLY
              It takes some time, ok.

    Edith walks over to Irving who is still standing there in
    silence with his hair all over the place. She carefully
    starts helping him put it back together.

                        RICHIE DIMASO
              Big fucking deal. We got to get in
              the other room, come on. The
              mayor's in there.

                        EDITH GREENSLY
              Yes I know that.

                        RICHIE DIMASO
              Should we go to the beauty parlor?
              Is that what we should do?

    Richie walks over and opens up a briefcase that's sitting on
    the dresser. Inside are stacks of cash.

    Edith is still helping Irving put his hair back together.

                        IRVING ROSENFELD
              How's it look.

                        EDITH GREENSLY
              You look fine.

    Richie slams the briefcase shut looking very nervous and
    intense.

                          RICHIE DIMASO
              Let's go.

    POLITO PINKY RING, ROTARY CLUB PIN STANDS FINISHING STORY TO
    BUSINESSMAN CARL ELWAY AS IRVING, EDITH, RICHIE WAIT FOR HIM
    TO FINISH -- THEY ALL SHAKE HANDS AND SIT ON THE COUCH ACROSS
    FROM EACH OTHER. RICHIE CAREFULLY SETS THE BRIEFCASE DOWN ON
    THE GROUND NEXT TO HIS FEET. CUT TO THE SCENE AS VIEWED
    THROUGH A SURVEILLANCE MONITOR. THE DATE AND TIME STAMP
    VISIBLE.

                        CARMINE POLITO
              I thought he was going to be here.
              I do business face to face, person
              to person. That's just who I am.


    Richie reaches down and awkwardly slides the briefcase over
    to Carmine unprompted. LEAVE MONITOR'S POV AND RETURN BACK TO
    THE SCENE.

    IRV'S EYES WIDEN AS IN `NO! DON'T DO THAT!' WHILE HE AND
    RICHIE STARE AT EACH OTHER, EDITH TENSE, CARMINE LOOKS
    DISTURBED AT THE CASE COMING HIS WAY. HE STANDS ABRUPTLY.

                        CARL ELWAY
              Whoa, excuse me, excuse me. I'll
              handle that for the Mayor.

                        RICHIE DIMASO
              No, it's for the Mayor. It would be
              a sign of disrespect to the sheik
              if the mayor didn't take it
              himself. It's for you Mayor.

    Carmine looks angry and confused. He looks over to Carl.

                        CARMINE POLITO
              What are you doing? What-- (to
              Carl) Carl, what the fuck? What is
              this?

                        CARL ELWAY
              No, I'll handle it. I'm gonna take
              care of-- Everything's good. I
              got everything under control. (TO
              RICHIE) That's for me. I handle all
              that for mayor.

                        CARMINE POLITO
              What is this?

    Irving looks over and says nothing. Not surprised at all how
    badly this is all going.
                                                         6.


Edith whispers to Richie.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          (whispers to Richie)
          Just stop it, ok

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          (whispers to Edith)
          He's gotta take it himself, okay?

                    CARMINE POLITO
          I don't know what the fuck that is
          but it's weird you understand?

                    CARL ELWAY
          Misunderstanding. Misunderstanding.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          I came here to meet a sheik, that's
          all I know. I'm very interested in
          that but he's not here apparently.
          Carl?!

Carmine turns and starts to walk out of the room.

                    CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)
          I'm very interested in meeting the
          Sheik. You let me know when THAT
          could happen! Thank you, have a
          good day.

Carmine leaves the room.

Irving looks over and shrugs his shoulders. Not surprised at
all the way this is going and horrified that Richie has
ruined it.

                    CARL ELWAY
              (leaving)
          Irving! You better come get him.


                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (stares at Irv)
          Go out there and get him right now.

                    CARL ELWAY
          Help me get him back!

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Go get him. He needs to take the
          fuckin' briefcase, Irving.
                                                            7.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I didn't wanna do it in the first
          place. This is your show, YOU go
          get him.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          No, you have no choice. You have
          to go get him. Now, go get him, so
          he takes the briefcase by himself!
          That's the whole plan, Irving!

Irving stands up angry and gets in Richie's face.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          What were you doing pushing the
          fucking briefcase, dummy? Huh?

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          The whole fuckin' thing was falling
          apart. You know how much I paid
          for this goddamn hotel that you
          fucking asked for?!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Now I gotta go mop up your mess.
          I'm gonna go fucking mop up your
          mess!

Irving storms out of the hotel suite towards the Elevators to
get Carmine.

          right? It wasn't working.

Irving continues to pace back and forth in the hall waiting

               survive and you knew your choices
               were bad?

     Irving walks over and hits the elevator button again.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               I learned how to survive when I was

               after I saw how my father got

               of guy than my father. I became a

               And I did some art dealing on the

               So, one January I go to my friends
               pool party in Long Island.

     Irving sits holding court with some friends by the pool when
     he turns and sees Sydney for the first time.

     party.

               bracelet?

     She does have on a Duke Ellington charm bracelet.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER
               As a matter of fact, it is. He died
               this year, you know.

              He wasn't necessarily in good
              shape, and he had this comb-over
              that was rather -- elaborate. He
              had this air about him. And he had
              this confidence that drew me to
              him. He was who he was and he
              didn't care.

                        IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
              Like me, she was a very particular
              person. Like me, she came from a
              place where her options were
              limited -- and she had been someone
              she didn't want to be in her past.

              identity. And like me, she
              envisioned a better elegant future

          I have royal banking connections in
          London. I'd love to help you with
          your loan but of course I have to
          be very selective.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          That was fucking fantastic.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          Thank you. Did you like it?
                                                               18.

               I liked it. I didn't think you were
               coming back. Thank god you came
               back.

               connections in London, England.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)

               We kept selling art together, too.

                         EDITH GREENSLY
               It's really a fabulous example of a
               genre painting, which is really
               rare for the time. It's a boy and

               As, as far as I could see, people
               were always conning each other to
               get what they wanted. We even con
               ourselves.

               We talk ourselves into things. We

               don't even need or want by dressing

     bird designs, glass tables, walls, black and brown lacquer
     everywhere. He walks into the house and looks at a picture
     his son did -- a drawing of the Yankees playing baseball --
     that is taped to the refrigerator.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
               Pay attention to that because we're
               all conning ourselves in one way or
               another just to get through life.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)
               He was a really good dad and I
               respected him for that. It was a
               tough situation for everyone.

     Irv's face lights up.

                        IRVING ROSENFELD
               Danny. This is a fantastic
               picture. What did you do today?

                         DANNY
               That kid Donovan is being mean to
               me.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               The big kid? I thought Mommy picked
               you up so he couldn't bother you.

                         DANNY
               She was late, and then after we put
               out the fire, mommy said stay in my
               room with my baseball cards.

     Danny reaches across to Irving and takes his glasses off his
     face and puts them on.

                            IRVING ROSENFELD
               What fire?

                         DANNY
               Did you know they make a lamp that
               has the sun in it? [Irv looks at
               him] Mommy got the lamp. She made
               her special drink and the lamp made
               a fire.

     Irv looks concerned.

     face is burned.

                         ROSALYN ROSENFELD
               I put out the fire. The fire is
               out.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               For the first time in my life I do
               the right thing.

          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
Oh shut up --

          IRVING ROSENFELD
I save a young single mother, and
her kid. I marry her. I adopt him -
-

          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
You fell in love! Don't forget we
fell madly in love!

          IRVING ROSENFELD
Yes, I fell in love. My God, I
fell in love. Yes. But you know
what? I thought you were
mysterious like my mother until it
turned out that mysterious just
meant depressed, hard to reach. I
mean, I'm dying here! And you need
somebody who's gonna be quiet like
you. You're young, you're
beautiful. You gotta find somebody
else. You gotta go out and get
some friends all right? Don't sit
inside --

          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
I don't like going out. You know
that I get anxiety when I have to
meet people. You know how hard that
is.

          IRVING ROSENFELD
Yeah but you can't just stay in the
house with the fucking sun lamp.
Alright? And I can't-- I mean,
look, I can't trust you with it
anyway. That fire and everything. I
can't trust to leave you with
Danny.

          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
I put the fire out Irving! There is
no fire! Maybe if you were here
more, then there wouldn't have been
a fire in the first place.

          IRVING ROSENFELD
Oh, what, there wouldn't have been
a fire if I was here?
                                                          26.


                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Just stop with the whole fire
          thing. God it was a mistake. I'm
          sure a million people do that all
          the time. Those sun lamps are
          dangerous. Shouldn't even have them
          in the house, really. I bet that
          happens all the time. This was

          We're not happy. Alright?

Rosalyn just stares there for a moment at Irving saying
nothing.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          You know that I could take Danny.
          You know that most of your work is
          illegal. And you know that if you
          tried to divorce me, you know that--
          I'm not saying that I would, but
          I'm saying that I could. And I'm
          saying that that is why I don't
          like divorce, Irving. Women do that
          in divorces. Women get the
          children, and then the fathers
          never see them. My mother never got
          divorced. My grandmother never got
          divorced. There are NO divorces in
          my family. I am not getting a
          divorce.

          Come on. What are we doing here?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          We fight and we fuck and that's
          what we do. That's our thing.

     Mort's eyes go from her knees to her eyes -- His eyes meet
     Sydney's -- he looks soulful, open. She stares at him. Irv

          That's correct.

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
          I really need your help. I'm
          desperate. I've got the Audis for

          forgot to mention that I have a
          little piece of real estate in Long

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          No, you didn't mention that. Two

          The hat.

     Dim cell, lit only from small high barred window, no lights

          you, Edith, to protect himself. To
          protect his son and his wife in
          Long Island. No? Yes. He put a
          ring on her finger, he adopted her
          son. They have huge house, they
          have two cars. What does she do all
          day? I'll tell you what she does --
          she plays with her nails, she
          watches T.V., and she spends your

          you. All the razzle-dazzle that he
          does, it's not good. It's not real.
          It's fake. It's not real. Who you

          God. You and your soul. That's what
          matters. That's what counts.

          what I see in you. Tell me you
          didn't feel it the first time we
          saw each other. Am I crazy? I don't

67   INT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY            67

     Irv stands alone on the other side of the glass staring at
     Sydney.

     Richard Dimaso walks in.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               Been in there three days. Hasn't
               been so good for her.

     Irv continues to stare at Sydney.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
               How does that make you feel her in
               there? That check was for you,
               right? But you knew somethin' was
               off. That's 'cause you're good.
               You're, like, the best at what you
               do in the whole country, aren't
               you?

     Irv looks at him.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
               But you know what? If the country
               were run by people like you, Irving
               Rosenfeld we'd be living in Eastern
               Europe or Guatemala. You ever been
               in Guatemala? You ever been in jail
               in Guatemala? You ever try to get a
               telephone or a permit or anything
               in Guatemala? That's what this
               country would be like if we let
               people, let the liars like you, run
               this country.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Who made you god and judge?

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               My grandmother lived to be ninety-
               three years old. Never lied in her
               life.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Congratulations.
                                                             35.


                         RICHIE DIMASO
               Thank you. I'm proud of that, too.
               Does that make her not a good
               person? Is that not something to
               strive for?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
               Why you breaking my balls? Get to
               the point.

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               I see something in you, Irving. I
               get very excited. I think that we
               have a lot of potential here. Now,
               look. I came up with the idea.
               It's all from me. I want to change
               things. I want to go after white
               collar crime. Irving, you're very
               skilled. And I want you to teach me
               and we can do this. I want four
               people that do what you do.
               Fraudulent investments. Fake
               certificates of deposit. Stolen
               art, fake art. You get me four
               people and you're off the hook.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               Four busts and you'll leave us
               alone? We don't have to testify?

                         RICHIE DIMASO
               You're good, you're done. Anything
               you want. But if you run, then your
               life is over. You'll be hunted, and
               it's gonna be very difficult for
               Rosalyn and your kid to live in
               this country.


68   INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT                         68

     A NICE UPPER EAST SIDE apartment. Sydney has finally changed
     her clothing from when she wore the same dress at the holding
     cell. It is quiet in the apartment - faint street noise from
     3rd Avenue below.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER
               We need to leave. We need to run
               and we need to do it now. We can go
               to Estonia or Romania, I don't
               care, we'll take the cash from the
               bed and get out of here, alright?
               We talked about it a hundred times.
                                                36.


Irv stares at her and struggles.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          What about Danny?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          What about Danny?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I adopted him! I gave him my name!
          I'm not leaving him with Rosalyn,
          she's unstable!

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          That's a manipulation! Rosalyn's
          will never let you go. She'll use
          Danny against you because she's too
          messed up to let you leave.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I can't leave him. I love him.
          Alright? He's my son.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          Richie said you would say that.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Richie? What, the cop? Your on a
          first name basis with him?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          Yes I am. I'm not even on your list
          am I?

                       IRVING ROSENFELD
          What list?

                     SYDNEY PROSSER
          Your list. Your short list. Your
          long list. I'm not even on anyone
          of your fucking lists. I thought
          you loved me. I thought we had
          something.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          We do have something. I love you,
          it's perfect! What are you saying?
          We're gonna go to Romania? We're
          gonna take Danny?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          Yes. Yes, that's what I'm saying.
          You, me, Danny.
                                                        37.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Well you never said that before.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          I'm saying it now. We're us, and we
          can make it an adventure like we
          did. We can make it an adventure
          like we make everything, alright?
          But we have to go now. We have to
          leave right now.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I can't leave Danny. I'll lose
          custody.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          You have to take me away! We have
          to leave!


              (sobbing)
          What are you saying?! Oh my god.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          What are you doing?! Please!

Sydney goes storming out of the room and down the hall of her
apartment. Irving follows.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          I can't believe this is happening.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Don't say I don't love you because
          that's bullshit!

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
              (sobbing)
          This is bullshit. You are bullshit.
          We are bullshit.

She starts sobbing, shaking.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Please don't do this.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          I just never thought you were
          conning me.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I could never con you. I love you.
          Please don't say this.
                                                        38.


Irv walks to her and bends down to join her on the floor as
she sobs.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          No, I'm done.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Don't say that.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
              (cries)
          I'm gonna do these four busts,
          these four cons, to get us out of
          this. Not just me, but us. And
          I'm gonna get really close with
          Richie, the cop, in case we need to
          use him, if we need another move.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          We don't need another move. We need
          four busts, and we're done.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER
          We are going to need another move,
          trust me. And you're going to be
          thanking me. (shifts to British
          accent) The key to people is what
          they believe and what they want to
          believe and I want to believe that
          we were real, and I want to believe
          that a man could want me. And I'm
          gonna take all of that heartbreak,
          and all of that sorrow, and I am
          going to use it. And I'm going to
          make Richie think that I want him,
          and that I like him, and I'm going
          to be very convincing -- And I'm
          pissed at you.

Sydney reaches over and carefully grabs Irving's face
lovingly which quickly turns into a slap as she continues on.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)
          Because I'm pissed at you!

Irving stares at Sydney with confusion. He's never seen her
like this before.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)
          Maybe I do like him -- Maybe I like
          him a lot. From the feet up right --
          baby?

Sydney gets up from the couch and storms back to her room.
                                                             39.

               Quite your belly aching and come up
               with something to get us out of
               this. And you're right -- I'm in no
               state to deal with this so what's

     Richie, in sharp lapeled suit, chain on his neck, walks with
     Irv and Edith and joined by a man who looks like an ARAB
     SHEIK who they trail.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
               How do you think this works,
               stupid?

                         SYDNEY PROSSER
               If you could not call him `stupid'
               which he's isn't, he's smarter than
               you. Last I checked he's in control
               here and we work for him now so be
               nice.

     Richie stares at Edith elated that she just stuck up for him.
     He's really enjoying this position of power she's putting him
     in.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD
                   (stares at her, upset)
               OK, to set this up and bust a con
               artist we have to make the honey
               pot to attract the bees. In order
               to attract the bees, we need to
               offer them a wealthy individual who
               can be taken advantage of, someone
               special, someone new, someone
               amazing. Then those guys will want
               to sell fake bank CDS to THAT guy,
               take the sheik's money, see?

     Richie looks at Irving uncertain.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER
               Only they can't get into his money
               unless you they know someone, and
               that someone is us.
                                                           40.

          Oh that's good.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
          So if you want to get somebody like
          your con artist friend -- Carl
          Elway -- you get him to want to buy-
          -

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Keep your voice down.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          -- or sell fake art or stolen art
          or fake certificates of deposit, he
          needs -- who does he need? -- he
          needs a rich sheik guy, and there
          you go -- we can pinch him!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Right, but I don't tell Elway shit.
          I wait for him to call me. The art
          world is a small world -- and one
          of Elway's acquaintances is
          clocking us right now.

Richie starts to look around.

          Where?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Don't look.

Richie looks anyway and sees ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE, a man
balding, 45 clocking them from the balcony.

Irving, Edith, Richie, and the fake Sheik admire a REMBRANDT
painting on the wall.

          I want to show you something. This

          Yeah, he's good.

          Wait, what're you talking about?
          That's impossible.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          People believe what they want to
          believe. Cause the guy who made
          this was so good that it's real to
          everybody. Now whose the master --
          the painter or the forger?

Richie's continues to stare at the REMBRANDT on the wall.

          That's the way the world works. Not
          black and white as you say.
          Extremely grey.

ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE walks up to Irving and the group and
steps into the conversation.

                What do you mean it ain't for me?
                We gotta do certificates of

Irving looks over at Richie and Edith.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I'll tell them, don't worry. Hey
          you know what Carl just told me? He
          said he could do this whole thing
          with four guys within a week.

                    CARL ELWAY
          Or we could do somethin' much

Richie jumps into the conversation.

"WOW".

               he fell through the ice, he went in
               the water because he was too eager,

               mean this guy loved the idea of

you want to be a big shot and get a
promotion.

No I'm thinking big. This is gonna

          fuckin' kidding me? That's
          gigantic. And the Mayor, he's going

          want to see it in an account, he's
          going to want to see it right now,

Richie stands very close to Edith - between her legs as she
sits on the counter. He puts his hands on her hips, pulls
her into him. He takes her hand -- puts it on his face,
makes her feel his cheek and forehead with her hand. It is
intense. She prepares for him to kiss her but he steps back.
They are both excited. They stare at each other. The air is
thick with tension, Richie exhales and leaves.

We're gonna use Carmine. We're
gonna use Carmine to get other
people, that's what we're gonna do.

What?! Like who?!

          RICHIE DIMASO
Carmine's gonna use the Sheik to
pay off people.

          IRVING ROSENFELD
Are you fuckin' nuts? What are you
say--

          RICHIE DIMASO
We're gonna let Carmine show the
Sheik Atlantic City, how he's gonna
renovate hotels, and see who shows
up. Whoever the Sheik pays off for
licenses and casinos, that's who
we're gonna go after. We're gonna
go after all of 'em!

               Edith and I were so successful for

Irv and Richie step aboard to find FBI AGENT PACO HERNANDEZ

          say as little as possible. You

Irving takes a expensive looking ceremonial knife out of his
jacket pocket and holds it out to Paco.

          Mayor. You've got to present it to

          It's the details. That's what
          makes this guy a genius.

          Yeah, I think the name of this
          operation is offensive.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          Irving's being a mean, boring man
          saying that he doesn't want me to
          come tonight.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          (on phone)Tell him he's crazy!

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Well, I agree. Want to tell him
          yourself?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Gimme the phone, come on.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          It wouldn't be a party without you!

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Can you imagine? Tell him yourself.

She hands the phone to a very exasperated, anxious, Irv.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          (into telephone) Hey, Carmie.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Irving, you're crazy! Your wife is
          coming, you kidding me? She's the
          life of the party! Everybody loves
          her.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I'm the life of the party!

              (confidential into phone)
          Look, you know what she's like.
          She's unpredictable. She's just
          always --

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Hey, don't talk about me like that!
          What's Carmine saying?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I can't hear what he's saying.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Listen, Irving, it's very important
          that she come, you understand?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Carmine loves me.

          This is a really big night for us,
          you understand? Come on, you gotta
          bring your wife. And Dolly's got
          somethin' special for her.

Dolly is getting dressed for the party in the background.

                    DOLLY POLITO
          Tell her I got the nail polish for
          her.

          You see? Somethin' special for
          you. What is it? Tell me. I mean,

          What is it, you got a girlfriend
          coming? Come on, I thought we were
          friends. You're not gonna tell me
          you got a girlfriend? This is
          ridiculous.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          No, it's just Rosalyn's
          unpredictable.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Look, we're gonna handle this like
          men, you understand? You're
          bringing your wife. We're gonna
          have a good time. That's an order
          from the Mayor. Good-bye.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          (to Rosalyn) Alright, you happy?
          Go get ready.

Irv hangs up and exits the kitchen.

          Yes, I am happy.

      toned GRAY AND BLACK TUXEDO, at the center of a haphazard red

      Irv tries to turn Rosalyn away, but she keeps turning back
      giving Edith the hairy eyeball, as Edith gives it right back.

      Rosalyn continue to eyeball each other with Irv uncomfortably
      in the middle as Carmine ENTHUSIASTICALLY CONTINUES HIS
      PRESENTATION FOR THE SHEIK.

                          CARMINE POLITO
                So this is the lobby. Now mind you,
                a week ago this place was a mess,
                but what existed was this
                plasterwork. Look at the detail.

                bat -- I waive the law I helped
                write. It said casino construction
                must be ground up new, we don't do
                new. We renovate.

      THEY ENTER THE LARGE CROWDED YET INTIMATE BEMELMANS STYLE BAR

      The bar -- LIKE THE BEMELMANS BAR AT THE CARLYLE HOTEL IN
      MANHATTAN - IS LARGE YET INTIMATE -- THERE ARE 50 DRESSED UP
      CITIZENS THERE DRINKING -- AND A CROWDED LONG BAR -- AND
      ANOTHER SMALLER BAR ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM ---

      Carmine pauses to stare at the MEN AT THE FAR BAR -- FIVE MEN
      IN SUITS, 40 TO 60, SLIGHTLY MOB-LOOKING.

      AS Irv IS PULLED ASIDE CONFIDENTIALLY BY Carmine -- Richie
      AND Edith WATCH -- Rosalyn STANDS TO THE SIDE -- Carmine
      puts his arm around Irv's shoulders --

                          CARMINE POLITO
                There are some gentlemen over there
                at the bar. That's a hundred and
                thirty years sitting there --
                that's how much time's between
                them. They run the biggest casinos
                in the United States. We have to
                work with them.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD
                Right.
                                                        87.


                    CARMINE POLITO
          The good news is they know how it's
          done. They get it done. You don't
          have to worry. Everyone makes their
          money.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          You mean the Mob?

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Yes, but they're businessmen, okay?
          Now, spend as much or as little
          time with them as you like, but we
          do have to deal with them. All
          we've got to do is go say hello.
          We just gotta say hi, that's all.

Edith looks on, calm, as Richie -- WILD EYED WITH COCAINE AND
ADRENALINE --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Carmine, maybe -- I'm not sure
          that's such a good idea. We gotta
          confer before we talk to these
          guys.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (interrupting, hopped up)
          Confer? What is there to confer
          about? They're casino guys.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          They are businessmen.

                     RICHIE DIMASO
          We came all this way, Irving. We
          should be here. What's everybody
          scared of? There's nothing to be
          scared of.

Richie stares down Irv, Edith pulls Richie back -- Rosalyn is
starting to go down a SPIRAL OF DEPRESSION as she looks
increasingly uncomfortable.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
              (re: the mob guys)
          Those are the guys you're all
          scared of? Those guys over there?
          They don't scare me.

She glares at Edith and Irv and pivots to walk to the bar.

                     IRVING ROSENFELD
          Rosalyn!
                                                        88.


But she's already on her way over to the MAFIA MEN at the bar
who GREET HER WARMLY as Irv, Edith, Richie, and Carmine
watch.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          I love this!

Rosalyn walks up to PETE MUSANE, CHARISMATIC, 30 and sits
down in between all the Mafia guys.. THE OTHER THREE SALT AND
PEPPER MAFIA GUYS LAUGH AND TALK WITH Rosalyn - who gulps a
glass of PROSECCO and IS REFILLED BY PETE MUSANE.

                     ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Hi.   Can I sit here?

Carmine whispers to Irv as he watches Rosalyn talk to the
Mafia guys.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Irving, this is not a good idea.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          How you guys doing? Everybody over
          there is really scared of you guys,
          you know that?

She knocks back the prosecco. She seems relieved.

Dolly ushers her kids to the door.

                    DOLLY POLITO
          Kids, I want you to go up and get
          some pizza and soda, please.

Irving and Edith watch in horror at Rosalyn.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          It's a disaster.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I think they have this room all
          wrong.

                    PETE MUSANE
          Yeah? What would you do?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I would do it in all black and gold
          and I would do this bar like a big,
          warm golden mirror.

                    DICK HELSING
          Sounds beautiful.

                       ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Thank you.

Rosalyn's smitten by the mobsters.

                    PETE MUSANE
          But you expect that from her
          because she's so beautiful --

                       ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Oh stop.

                       DICK HELSING
          Gorgeous.

                    PETE MUSANE
          I love her hair, so I know I'm
          gonna love how she'd do the room --

He touches the front of her huge Farrah overhang bangs.
Richie, Irving, Carmine, and the Sheik walk up to them.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          How do you do?

                    PETE MUSANE
              (to Richie)
          I'm sorry is she your wife?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          No, she's my wife. She's my wife.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Look at these fine gentleman.

                    PETE MUSANE
          Carmine, there you are.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          How you doing?

Irving takes the glass of prosecco out of Rosalyn's hand and
puts it on table.

                    PETE MUSANE AND GUYS
          Ohhhh, heyyyyy! Come onnn!

                    ROSALYN
          It's because he's a party pooper.
          He's so boring.

Irving stares fuming at Rosalyn and the guys, he nods and
forces a smile good naturedly as they put prosecco glass in
his hand. He knows how to fake it.
                                                           90.

THE MADE GUYS LAUGH. SYD ROLLS HER EYES. IRVING, CARMINE
STARE WITH TENSION.

THEY ALL LAUGH. RICHIE GUIDES SHEIK with ONE BODY GUARD.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          May I present Sheik Abdullah,
          gentlemen, from Abu Dhabi. Sheik,
          these men are professionals, they
          run the best casinos in the United
          States.

The Sheik acknowledges them with a nod. Irv is extremely
uncomfortable.

                    PETE MUSANE
          Mr. Sheik, as a sign of our
          seriousness, Mr. Tallegio came from
          Miami to meet you tonight.

HEAVY PAUSE.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Mr. Tallegio? Why didn't you tell
          me Mr. Tallegio was here?

                    PETE MUSANE
          He's in the back room.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          It's a sign of disrespect to do
          business on the first meeting.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          That's not true. I don't know what
          your talking about. (to Musane)
          He's got it all wrong.

                    DICK HELSING
          Well, don't leave him back there in
          the back room waiting. Come on,
          let's go.

Rosalyn reaches to have her glass refilled by Dick Helsing
when one of the other guys NUDGES her hip in her tight dress
and she drops into Pete Musane's lap.
                                                               91.


                           ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                 Hey Irving, I'm going to be having
                 fun. Maybe it will be contagious.


       Irving turns and heads with dread towards the back door with
       Carmine, Richie, and the Sheik. Sydney, worried about Rosalyn
       with Musane, decides to hang back.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
                 Victor Tellegio was from Miami. He
                 was Meyer Lansky's right-hand man.
                 In his prior reputation as an
                 enforcer from twenty years ago, he
                 was known to never bury a body
                 because he felt it sent a stronger
                 message to leave it in the street.

       RESUME PUSH IN ON TELLEGIO AS A COUPLE OF BUSBOYS SET UP AN
       IMPROMPTU TABLE AND CHAIRS. Carmine greets him.
                                                        92.


                    CARMINE POLITO
          You sure you don't want to go into
          the Ocean Bar? It's really, it's
          beautiful in there.

                    VICTOR   TELLEGIO
          I'm very happy I   don't have to go
          there. I like it   here. There's an
          exit. I'm like a   ghost. Nobody
          knows I'm here.

Busboys whip open a white table cloth for the table.

Everyone sits down. Tellegio looks at the Sheik, then over to
Richie.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
          Tell him I speak for our friends in
          Florida. We're very excited. It's
          been our lifelong dream to build
          casino resorts on the East Coast.

Richie pretends to translate in the Sheik's ear.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
          You told him that? They didn't want
          the Jews to make money, they didn't
          want the Italians to make money,
          definitely don't want the blacks to
          make money. After the oil embargo --
          the gasoline crisis -- the
          hijackings, the Olympics, they
          don't want to see Arabs make money,
          trust me, not on our soil. You can
          tell him this in your own way: I've
          been in the casino business forty
          years. It's scrutinized more
          carefully than any other business.
          Carmine made this legal, but we
          must be careful or they'll take it
          away.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          So, Mister Tellegio, how do you
          think we should approach this? What
          do you want to do?

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          If you want to get the gaming
          license and keep it we have to make
          our principal investor here, the
          Sheik, an American citizen.
                                                           93.


Irving and Richie both look at Victor intensely not sure
where this is going.

                     CARMINE POLITO
          To expedite citizenship -- well,
          that requires very special
          treatment.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          You would know the right people to
          do that, Carmine.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Carmine knows everybody.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          What are we talking about?

                    CARMINE POLITO
          U.S. Senators. Congressmen.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Wow, that's fantastic.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I say stay away from that. That's
          bad. That's trouble. No, that's not
          good.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Irving please.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          That's trouble.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          Who is this guy? (to Irving) What
          are you, a farmer?

Richie and Tellegio both laugh.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Mr. Tellegio, I'm sorry, this is
          Irving. New York businessman.
          Irving Rosenfeld.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          Irving, Irving. What's the matter,
          Irving? What's the problem?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Nothing. No problem.
                                                        94.


                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          Don't get your balls in an uproar.
          Everything's fine, everything's
          good. It's all good. It's all good.
          I just hope the other part of this
          is all good. And real. Because
          we're real. You know that. You deal
          with us. We're a real organization.
          We deal with you, we don't know
          what we're dealing with.

Everyone stares increasingly tense at Tellegio in silence.
This could go wrong at any minute. Tellegio looks over to
Richie and points to the Sheik.

Irving watches in horror as --

                    VICTOR TALLEGIO
          Where's he from?

                     RICHIE DIMASO
              (winging it)
          Abu Dhabi.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          Oh, he's from the Emirates.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Yeah.

                     VICTOR TELLEGIO
              (in subtitled Arabic)
          (Can I count on you? You gotta be
          honest about this. Do you
          understand me? Good means good. No
          bullshit.)

PUSH IN ON IRV AND CARMINE FEELING THIS IMMENSE PRESSURE.
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?

                     VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
          (to Sheik)
          (Did you hear what I said? Do you
          want me to repeat it?)

Irving looks ill, as does everyone else at the table.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
          (What do you think now? Tell me.
          Tell me.)

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Uh, I think, I think what he's --
                                                        95.


                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          No, let him speak for himself.

Sheik swallows hard and looks to Richie. It's a very tense
moment for everyone at the table.

Tellegio stares. Everyone hangs on this. Irving and Richie
share a look -- what is he doing?

A DRUNK, AL KOWALSKI, a working man, friend of the Mayor
BARRELS INTO INTO THE TABLE, spilling drinks. Tellegio's guys
jump in and grab him and start to pull him away.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          No, I know him.

                    AL KOWALSKI
          You guys are way too serious for a
          party!(to Tellegio) Hey, what are
          you drinking? You got a drink?

TELLEGIO GLARES BACK AT THE INTRUSION.


                    CARMINE
              (to Al)
          We're in a very serious meeting.
          (to Tellegio) I apologize.

TELLEGIO DOES NOT LOOK AMUSED.

                    AL KALOWSKI
          I understand, you're in conference.
          You gotta come with me now. You got
          a speech to give. Everyone's
          waiting for you.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Al, I'll be right behind you, okay?
          Trust me.

Paco Hernandez/Sheik stands up and reaches over to Tellegio
to shake his hand. Irving panics. THE MENACING DEEP BASS
INTRO OF "WHITE RABBIT" FADES UP ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

                    SHEIK ABDULLAH
              (In Arabic)
          It is great doing business with
          you. The investment is real. It was
          a pleasure to meet you.

Irving exhales in relief that Paco managed to say anything
passable in Arabic.
                                                        96.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
          What are the odds of an Italian guy
          from Miami knowing Arabic? But it
          turns out he's got casino
          investments in the Mideast and he
          spent two years learning it to keep
          the upper hand.

Victor leans over to talk to Carmine.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
          Listen to me carefully. If you're
          real, you put ten million in the
          bank of our choice in the next two
          weeks.

Carmine nods.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
          Carmine, listen to me carefully, if
          you're real, you put ten million in
          the bank of our choice in the next
          two weeks or not only will the
          Sheik feel insulted, but our
          friends in Florida will feel deeply
          disrespected and so will I.

Irving looks at Victor, who stares back at him. This is bad.

AT THE BAR --

"WHITE RABBIT" CONTINUES. ROSALYN CONTINUES TO FLIRT WITH
PETE MUSANE --

SYDNEY WATCHES OUT OF CONTROL ROSALYN, STANDS AND WALKS OVER

Rosalyn takes her wrist out of Sydney's grasp.

Dolly escorts Edith over to one side of the room away from
Rosalyn.

          You stay over here with me.
          Everybody just calm down. I don't

Pete looks over to Rosalyn.

          You alright? Take it easy. These
          things happen. Whatever's meant to

Rosalyn smiles at Pete.

          That's what I always say.

      Rosalyn holds her hand, with wedding ring to Sydney's face.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                I got a ring on my finger. We have

                He doesn't love you Rosalyn he
                loves me. And you know it and I
                know it and he knows it. And it

          Well, he must like it on some
          level. He must want it because he
          keeps coming back for it. It's like
          that perfume that you love that you
          can't stop smelling, even when
          there's something sour in it. You
          can't get enough of it. But guess
          what, he's never gonna leave me.
          He's always going to want me, and I
          will make you so sorry, Edith. I
          will make you so sorry for what
          you've done to my family, mark my

          anybody, but you do because you're
          gross inside, you're so fucked up

          Yeah.

          Maybe you're gross inside, with
          robbing people and all that shit
          that you do? Maybe we're both gross
          inside, that's what Irving loves
          about us. At least he's consistent

                me and I told him this was
                inappropriate. I told him
                procedures exist for reasons we
                must respect. This is the third
                such call I received from Agent

                night of the 5th and he threatened
                to kill me. Subsequently he
                demanded that I allow him to use
                the Sherman Suite at the Plaza
                hotel for purposes of bribing

      sadness and hope. She holds a closed bottle of her favorite
      nail finish and smells it nostalgically.

      A BLACK SEDAN PULLS INTO THE FRAME, SHE OPENS THE DOOR AND
      GETS IN. IT IS PETE MUSANE, TELLEGIO'S MOBSTER SHE FLIRTED
      WITH AT THE CASINO.

                    PETE MUSANE
          I don't like your husband. You're
          no good together. He doesn't
          appreciate you. Hey, it happens.
          It happened in my marriage. That's
          why I went to Miami. Sometimes you
          just gotta be tough. You gotta
          stand up and you gotta leave, you
          know?

Rosalyn looks at Pete smitten.

                    PETE MUSANE (CONT'D)
          Sometimes you gotta let something
          die to let something live. You're
          too beautiful to be unhappy.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I know. I mean, I don't want to
          badmouth my husband, but let me
          badmouth my husband for a second.
          He just thinks that he knows
          everything and he's so full of
          shit. He's such a liar. He thinks
          that I'm stupid, but I'm not
          stupid. I hear him on the phone
          arguing. He loves Carmine, but he
          hates that other guy, that curly-
          headed I.R.S. guy, or whatever
          who's carting around my husband's
          ex-lover, that redheaded whore.

          IRS?

                     ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Anyway. You can see that it drives
          him crazy.

                    PETE MUSANE
          You said IRS. What IRS guy? What
          are you talking bout?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I hear them on the phone. I think
          that he's got Irv in some sort of
          bind or something and he's making
          him do all of this stuff and so Irv
          and Carmine right now are at the
          Plaza Hotel throwing away all this
          money at like Congress or whatever.
          They're giving money to congress or
          something. I don't really know but
          I overheard it on the phone.

                but I have to go talk to your
                husband. My boss is already angry.
                You stay here I'm going to give you
                some money for a taxi home.

      He puts cash in her hands.

                You stay here. Get yourself some
                dessert. Finish the bottle of
                prosecco. I'm sorry.

      Rosalyn and Pete hold hands as Rosalyn stares into his eyes.
      Very emotional.

      He kisses her.

                          PETE MUSANE
                It's gonna be okay. You're gonna

          I can save all of us, and we can
          save money. I can take care of you
          and Danny. OK? But you gotta close
          your mouth.

Rosalyn looks satisfied and points her finger at Irving.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I knew it. I have always said,
          Irving, that you are very, very
          hard to motivate properly. And I
          knew that Pete was gonna go over
          there and knock some sense into
          you. I've been reading this book,
          Irving. It's by Wayne Dyer, about
          the power of intention.

Irving can't believe what he's hearing right now.

Rosalyn, very satisfied, reaches over the bed and grabs a
book.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          And my intention in sending Pete
          over to you was so that you could
          come up with this plan. So, you're
          welcome.

Irving incredulous, thinks to himself how to respond. Forces
himself to say gently --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          OK. Thank you, Rosalyn. Thank you
          for the plan.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          You're welcome.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I appreciate that. So, I think that
          we should be partners on this.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I'm a good partner. Almost better
          than Edith. You ever think about
          that? You ever think about how you
          might have underestimated me?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          So what is our plan? Tell me the
          plan. What are you gonna do?
                                                         132.


                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I'm going to keep my mouth shut and
          I'm not going to say anything but
          what do I do if Pete calls me? What
          am I supposed to say?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          You gotta stop talking about your
          government agencies and your I.R.S.
          and your tax and your conspiracies
          and all of that. You're gonna say
          how you were wrong, you were wrong
          about that.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          I'll tell Pete that I was wrong but
          you know that in real life, I was
          right for saying all that stuff
          because then that spurred on the
          actions that made you come up with
          this plan. So I will tell Pete.

                      IRVING ROSENFELD
                (holding his head)
          OK.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
              (pointing with cigarette
               between fingers)
          The power of intention Irving. The
          power of intention.

Irv is doing everything he can to hold it together.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          OK. You were right.

Rosalyn gets up from the bed and walks over to Irving.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
          You're so smart. Good job, peaches.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
          Irving, I've been doing a lot of
          thinking and -- you need to grow
          up. And you need to face the
          facts. And I think that both of us
          will be a lot happier if we get a
          divorce.

As he listens to words he has been saying himself for months,
now spoken as Rosalyn's idea.
                                                              133.


                            IRVING ROSENFELD
                 OK.

                           ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                 Just think about it. (kisses him)
                 These things are never easy.

       Irving starts walking away towards the door.

                            IRVING ROSENFELD
                 Alright.

                           ROSALYN ROSENFELD
                 Irving. Good luck with your plan.


       EXT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY

       The spare rhythmic intro of Jeff Lynne's "Long Black Road"
       plays as Richie looks back over his shoulder and walks
       towards the building with intensity.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
                 Necessity truly is the mother of
                 invention. The F.B.I. was willing
                 to wire the two million dollars if
                 it meant taking down Tellegio and
                 his entire organization.

       Irving walks with Richie and Sydney up to an office building.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
                 A mobster like Tellegio would never
                 meet at the Plaza Hotel, but only
                 at the office of his attorney,
                 Alfonse Simone.

       THE CONTENTS OF SYDNEY'S PURSE ARE EMPTIED AND EXAMINED ALONG

       Alfonse Simone rises from behind his desk. A silent secretary
       sitting at his side in a white dress stares at our heros as
       Simone steps forward to introduce himself.

                 Alfonse Simone.

       Edith walks up to him to shake hands. He shakes hands with
       Irving and Richie as well. Man in the suit closes the door

                 Good afternoon.

                           ALFONSE SIMONE
                 Please, be seated.
                                                       135.


They sit in three chairs facing Simone's desk: Sydney/Edith,
Richie, Irving.

Simone sits behind his desk, the silent secretary sits just
behind him slightly to the side, stares at Edith, Richie,
Irving.

                    ALFONSE SIMONE (CONT'D)
          I appreciate the fact that you all
          came in person, but the trip was
          really unnecessary because this
          whole thing could have been done
          with a simple wire transfer. As a
          matter of fact this is the number
          of our wire right here.

Simone slides a small pink piece of paper across the desk to
them. Richie stares at the paper, but doesn't touch it.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Where is Mr. Tellegio?

                    ALFONSE SIMONE
          Mr. Tellegio unfortunately was
          called out of town on business.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          That's not good. We were willing to
          come here today, in person, to see
          Mr. Tellegio, as a sign of respect
          to give two million dollars --

                    ALFONSE SIMONE
          I can assure you that I have the
          power of attorney --

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          Excuse me. If you'll let me finish,
          we are willing to give two million
          dollars today of the ten. But
          without Mr. Tellegio here --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
              (to Simone)
          We can't, we can't make that
          decision. It's not the right thing.
          It's not the right time. It's just
          not good.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
              (to Irving across Richie)
          You don't have the authorization to
          make this kind of choice so don't
          be hasty, alright?
                                                        136.


                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I'm not being hasty. It's just,
          let's be smart about it. This is
          not how we do business. (to Simone)
          I'm sorry. I apologize.

Richie motions with his hand to Edith that he agrees with
Irving.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          He's right, we can't.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          I think you should hang in there.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          For what? The guy's not here.

                       IRVING ROSENFELD
          He isn't.

                       RICHIE DIMASO
          That's it.

He stands, goes to the door.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          This is a surprise. The Sheik
          doesn't like surprises.

Edith turns in her chair to face them in the doorway.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          Don't leave.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
              (in doorway with Richie)
          Edith, this is not your decision to
          make.

                    EDITH GREENSLY
          I understand but maybe we can call
          the Sheik. Let's call the Sheik.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          That's not the plan. That's not
          the --

Edith locks eyes with Richie. Richie stares at Edith, waves
Irving off with his hand.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          No, let's -- I'll call the Sheik.
          (to Simone) Can I use your phone?
                                                       137.


                       ALFONSE SIMONE
          Please do.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
              (to Alfonse Simone)
          I don't know if he's in, I'll call
          the Sheik. But before I do, I'd
          like to go over specifically what
          this money will be used for.

                    ALFONSE SIMONE
          What we will do is we guarantee all
          proper licenses and construction
          permits for any hotel casino that
          plans to open before the end of the
          year.

Richie glances down at Edith and her handbag. PUSH IN ON A
TINY MICROPHONE WE NOW SEE CLEVERLY BUILT INTO THE HANDLE OF
EDITH'S GUCCI BAG.

                    ALFONSE SIMONE (CONT'D)
          And we'll throw in the customary
          privileges and protection.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          What if there are obstacles, what
          will you do?

                    ALFONSE SIMONE
          Obstacles? We are prepared to
          overcome any obstacles.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          This is a big enterprise.

                    ALFONSE SIMONE
          If we have to pay somebody off,
          we'll pay somebody off. If we have
          to lean on somebody, intimidate
          somebody, we'll intimidate
          somebody. We're experienced. This
          is our business.

          At the end of this we'll teach you
          how to skim and how to cut it up
          and make some money on the side.

          been doing it for thirty years.

A smile creeps across Richie's face.

                 Nice meeting you.

       Richie, Edith, and Irving walk down the hall after leaving
       his office. Richie smiles as the opening of Bowie's "The Jean
       Genie" momentously starts. Edith smiles as she walks down the
       hall followed by Irving. Richie puts his hand on the door
       knob to exit the hallway.

      and quiets the room, the music momentarily stops as we hear
      Alfonse Simone on the surveillance tape.

                I've been doing this for a long
                time, for twenty years. Do you

          right.

Irving is in tears. Very upset.

                    CARMINE POLITO
          Look at my face. You tell me that
          I'm lying to you when I say that
          everything I do is for the good of
          the people of New Jersey.

          This is all shit. It's all
          bullshit.

          Look at this thing. Look at this.
          Ceremonial fucking knife. What is
          this bullshit? Some toy?

He drops it on the table. Irving stares at his friend,
removes his glasses.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Carmine, Syd and I got a plan for
          you. We can help you out.

          Please get out of my house, Irving.
          Will you please leave? I'm asking
          you nicely, please leave.

Irving gets up to go and is pushed towards the door by
Carmine. Dolly joins Carmine in tears. Carmine's kids stand
on the stairs.

183   Carmine lunges at Irving and punches him in the face. Irving    183
      goes down to the ground and his glasses fly off his face.

      CARMINE kicks him one last time.

      Irving staggers out of the house in an emotional daze, one
      hand to his heart, falls to sidewalk with bloody nose and
      broken glasses --

      Sydney struggles to help Irving to his feet and together, an
      embattled but surviving couple, they cross the street arm and
      arm. She opens the door and helps him into the car.

          That's interesting that you said

          that in exchange for immunity for
          the two of you and a reduced
          sentence for Carmine Polito we get
          our two million dollars back.

head. She doesn't know either.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Well that doesn't sound so good,

          what you're talking about, but --
          let's just assume you want to go
          with that story. Really? That's the
          story you want to go with? That's
          what you want the New York Times to
          hear? That you got conned by the
          very con men who you forced to
          entrap the members of Congress in
          the first place. That's what you

          ones that you round up. And why?

          real bullshit artists? You didn't
          even come close to the big leagues.
          Those big guys. The money men.

                Carmine got the reduced sentence.
                18 months. The loss of his
