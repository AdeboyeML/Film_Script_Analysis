           Darkness. That's the first thing I
           remember. It was dark, and it was
           cold. And I was scared.

          The moonlight intensifies almost magically, and the ice above
          begins to spider-web and crack.

          Snow-covered trees in every direction. The ice in the pond
          continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open. A
          young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense
          moonlight. This is JACK FROST - thin, pale, barefoot, his
          tousled hair frosted white.
                         
           JACK (V.O.)
           But then...then I saw the moon. It
           was so big and it was so bright,
           and it seemed to chase the darkness
           away. And when it did...I wasn't
           scared anymore.
                         
          Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up
          underneath him.
           JACK (V.O.)
           Why I was there, and what I was
           meant to do - that I've never
           known. And a part of me wonders if
           I ever will.
                         
          Jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight
          as it dims a bit.
                         
          Jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something
          with his feet. He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden
          staff. Curious, he picks it up. Almost immediately the
          staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. Odd.

          Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in
          contact with the ground. Frost shoots out and spreads across
          the ice. Jack is visibly confused.
                         
          He touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their
          trunks. Then he swings the staff again, more confident, as
          he begins to run across the frozen pond.
                         
          Another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the
          air. Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to
          earth and into the trees. Jack grabs hold of a tree branch
          and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance.

          Jack comes in for a landing, and it's a rocky one. He stands
          up, still elated, and brushes himself off.
                         
          As Jack makes his way into town, settlers are warming their
          hands by campfire. Jack doesn't recognize anyone.

          The settlers walk past Jack, not noticing him. Jack crouches
          down as a YOUNG BOY runs toward him.

          The boy runs right through Jack, as if he were a ghost. Jack
          staggers back in shock. He's speechless, as if the wind had
          been knocked out him. His emotions causing it to snow.

          presence. Shaken, Jack turns and retreats into the forest.

          around the room.

          Jack and North ride an elevator, bearing the resemblance of a
          Christmas ornament, down to the factory floor.
                         
                          JACK
           It's nothing personal, North. What
           you all do, it's just, it's not my
           thing.

          North storms through factory floor, Jack trying to keep up.
          An amazing place.

           the yetis.
                         
          Jack looks over his shoulder; an angry yeti pounds his fist
          into his palm.

          North charges ahead.
                         
          North's factory is bustling with activity: Yeti's are
          building toys, moving packages, while Elves are test piloting
          the various flying toys.
                         
          As Jack walks behind North, surveying the factory, a duck toy
          suddenly flies over Jack's head. Jack ducks just in time and
          continues after North.

          Jack looks over to see a group of elves eating Christmas
          ornaments and another electrocuting himself with Christmas
          lights. North smiles and calls to them.
                         
                          NORTH
           Very nice! Keep up good work!
                         
          North continues through the factory floor. He passes a yeti
          putting the finishing touches on a blue toy robot.

          blue robots.

           Step it up, everybody.
                         
          As North and Jack move to the opposite end of the chamber, we
          finally glimpse the orchestrated chaos of the entire
          workshop, in all it's magic and splendor.
                         
                         
          INT. NORTH'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER
                         
          Jack follows North into his office. There are shelves filled
          with toys. Sketches and prototypes everywhere.
                         
          North dusts his hands and turns to Jack. His sleeves are
          rolled. Jack notices that on one of North's forearms is
          tattooed the word NAUGHTY, and on the other, NICE. North
          grabs a plate from a nearby elf.

          North hurls it - crash! A pause as North looks at Jack.

           Tacks of brass?
                         
          As North cracks his knuckles, Jack stands silent. The wind
          suddenly slams North's office door behind them. Jack looks
          to the door, it locks itself, and he turns back. North moves
          in close to Jack, backing him up against the door.
                         
                          NORTH

           your center?
                         
          North pokes Jack in the chest.

           If Man in Moon chose you to be a
           Guardian, you must have something
           very special inside.
                         
          North stands up straight and begins to stroke his beard as he
          gives Jack a curious look.
                         
                          NORTH
           Hmmmm?
                         
          North is standing in front of a shelf of Russian nesting
          dolls. One is carved to look like North himself.
                         
                          NORTH (CONT'D)

           (hands the doll to Jack)
           Well, go on.
                         
          Jack gives North a curious look, then sets down his staff.
          He twists the doll in half, and inside is another carved
          North doll, this one is a more typical Santa Claus - red
          cheeked and cheery.
                         
                          JACK
           You are downright jolly.

          The dolls get progressively smaller as he twists them open,
          all versions of North, but all slightly different.

           And caring. And at my center...
                         
          Twist. As North approaches, Jack looks down and drops the
          final Russian doll into the palm of North's hand. It's the
          size of a jelly bean.
                         
                          JACK
           There's a tiny wooden baby?

           Look closer. What do you see?
                         
          Jack holds it up to examine it.

           Yes! Big eyes. Very big. Because
           they are full! Of wonder! That is
           my center. It is what I was born
           with. Eyes that have always seen
           the wonder in everything!
                         
          North raises his hands, and the toys on the shelves suddenly
          spring to life. Jack-in-the-boxes pop, toy trains speed
          around the room, soldiers march about, toy planes fly
          overhead. An elf gets carried aloft by a balloon.
                         
          A flying toy plane glides by and we follow it as it makes its
          way around the room. A Christmas tree is ablaze with bright
          lights. Two double doors suddenly open as the flying car
          enters the factory floor.
                         
                          NORTH

          As it crosses the frame, dozens of other toys are now flying
          around the massive chamber. It's a truly magical moment.
          North now stands outside his office, with Jack at his side.
                         
                          NORTH
           This wonder is what I put into the
