     EXT.  STREET IN GEORGETOWN -- MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

     Fog hangs above the street, amongst the streetlamps.  Apartment
     buildings line the curb, it is very quiet.  In one building, six floors
     up, a bedroom light is on.  WE SEE the silhouette of Norman's WIFE
     looking out the window.

                         WIFE (O.S.)
               What kind of a crash was it?

                         NORMAN (O.S.)
               You seen my suitcase?

                         WIFE (O.S.)
               There's nothing on the news about a
               crash.  Did he say what airline?

                         NORMAN (O.S.)
               He didn't say much at all.  Honey --

                         WIFE (O.S.)
               In the closet.  I don't understand,
               Norman -- why would they call you?

                         NORMAN (O.S.)
               Don't be so supportive, honey.

                         WIFE (O.S.)
               Well, I can't imagine five years of
               unemployment --

                         NORMAN (O.S.)
               Four.  Four years --

                         WIFE (O.S.)
               Four years of unemployment would
               look too good on a resume.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)
               Keep watching the news.  Are you
               watching the news?

                         WIFE (O.S.)
               How are you getting to the airport?
               You need money for the bus?

     A tinted-window black SEDAN travels down the street, pulls up in front
     of the apartment building.  A U.S.  NAVY decal is on the door.

                         WIFE (O.S.)
               There's a U.S.  Navy car outside,
               Norman.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)
               What?

                         WIFE (O.S.)
               Was it a military crash?

                         NORMAN (O.S.)
               I don't know.

                         WIFE (O.S.)
               They never used to send a Navy car.

                                                            CUT TO:

     THE LOUD, HARD CHOPPING OF A HELICOPTER PROPELLER

     EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY

     Blinding sunlight, as the helicopter WHIPS by, speeding above the
     Pacific Ocean.

     INT.  HELICOPTER -- DAY

     Norman, 53, disheveled, unshaven, sits in the back.  He studies a
     pamphlet in his hand: "AIRCRASH SURVIVAL: HOW TO COPE".  The PILOT, in
     the cockpit, turns to him.

                         PILOT
               What kinda work you in, Dr. Johnson?

     Norman quickly stuffs the pamphlet into his dufflebag.

                         NORMAN
               I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am
               really, just been a while.
                    (beat)
               I treat aircrash survivors.

                         PILOT
               Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.

                         NORMAN
               You've heard of me?

                         PILOT
               Well, everybody's been talking about
               that report you wrote.

                         NORMAN
               What report?

                         PILOT
               Huh?

                         NORMAN
               What report?

                         PILOT
               You mean you don't know?

                         NORMAN
               Know what?

     The pilot glances back at him again.

                         PILOT
               Must be another Johnson then.  Been
               flying so many scientists out here
               -- can't keep everyone straight.

                         NORMAN
               Who's everyone?

                         PILOT
               Physicists, mathematicians,
               geologists, you name it.

                         NORMAN
               Geologists?  At a plane crash?

                         PILOT
               Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of
               the ocean no less.

                         NORMAN
               What the hell would a geologist be
               doing at a plane crash?

     Norman looks out the window and sees a group of ships circling in the
     water.

     EXT.  SHIP DECK -- DAY

     The helicopter descends down onto the helipad, wind gusting about.  A
     young, female OFFICER -- holding her hat to her head -- rushes to
     greet Norman, as he climbs out of the helicopter.

     She looks down crudely at his shotty, nylon dufflebag.

                         OFFICER
               Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?

                         NORMAN
               Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.

     She lugs it over her shoulder, no problem.

                         OFFICER
               No other equipment?  Scientific
               instruments?

                         NORMAN
               No, they didn't say --

                         OFFICER
               This way, sir.

     Norman follows the officer away from the helipad.

     INT.  SHIP

     She leads Norman down a flight of stairs.

                         OFFICER
               Captain Barnes wants to see you
               right away, sir.

                         NORMAN
               Captain who?

                         OFFICER
               Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you.
               Been calling us every half hour to
               see if you're arrived.

                         NORMAN
               Really?

     As they march down a hallway, Norman looks down at his wrinkled suit,
     tries to smooth it out.

                         OFFICER
               By the way sir, I've read your
               report.  I think it's brilliant.

                         NORMAN
               What report?

                         OFFICER
               You mean they haven't told you yet?

                         NORMAN
               Told me what?

     She staightens up, like she might have said too much.

                         OFFICER
               This way, sir.

     INT.  BARNES' OFFICE

     CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES, 60s, immaculate, proud of who he is, talks on
     the phone.

                         BARNES
               How's he look?...  Well, we can't all
               be officers, can we?
                    (laughs)
               They tell me he's brilliant.

     EXT.  BARNES' OFFICE

     Norman stands in front of the door.  The doorplate reads: PROJECT
     COMMANDER -- CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES.  Norman straightens his big-knotted
     tie.  Deep breath.

     INT.  BARNES' OFFICE

     As the door opens, Barnes is putting down the phone, rises from his
     desk, as Norman steps inside.

                         BARNES
               Dr. Norman Johnson.  Welcome aboard.

     They shake hands.

                         NORMAN
               Thank you, Colonel.

                         BARNES
               Captain.

                         NORMAN
               Captain.  Right, forgive me.

     Barnes looks at Norman, sizing him up.  An akward silence.

                         NORMAN
               Well, thanks for the opportuninty
               here -- my wife appreciates it.

                         BARNES
               Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You
               weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made
               me take you.

                         NORMAN
                    (smiling)
               The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had
               friends in Washington.

     Norman tries to laugh as Barnes ushers him to the door...

                         BARNES
               Come with me.  The team's already
               waiting.

                         NORMAN
               What team?

     INT.  HALLWAY

     Barnes leads Norman down the corridor, lined with OFFICERS and GUARDS.

                         BARNES
               What have you been told so far?

                         NORMAN
               The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers
               unknown.  Routine stuff really.

                         BARNES
               Anything else?

                         NORMAN
               Nothing else.

     A GUARD unlocks a large, steel door.

                         GUARD
               Captain Barnes.  Dr. Johnson.

                         NORMAN
               Hello.

     Norman looks at the guard as they proceed through the doorway,
     wondering how the guard knows his name.

                         BARNES
               You talk to any reporters?  Any
               press?

                         NORMAN
               Press?  No, I haven't.

     The steel door shuts loudly behind them.

                         BARNES
               Good.  Security's been our biggest
               worry.  Now that you're here we can
               shut this thing down tight.

                         NORMAN
               From what?  What's with all the
               security?

                         BARNES
               Well, we don't have all the facts
               yet.

     Another GUARD opens up another large steel door...

     INT.  TECH ROOM

     Barnes leads Norman through the room, crammed with video monitors,
     screens, and grids.  Officers talk into radios.  Technicians work on
     computers.

                         BARNES
               We're moving fast considering the
               storm.

                         NORMAN
               Storm?  What storm?

                         BARNES
               A cyclone's on it's way in.  I
               thought they would have told you on
               the phone.

                         NORMAN
               They didn't tell me anything.

     Norman tries to keep pace...

                         BARNES
               We've had divers working around the
               clock.  Take a look at this...

     ANGLE ON a large VIDEO SCREEN -- shows a diver walking on the ocean
     floor, holding a bright artificial flashlight.

                         NORMAN
               How deep is he?

                         BARNES
               A thousand feet.

                         NORMAN
               A thousand?  An airplane crashes into
               a thousand feet of water -- I don't
               want to sound pessimistic here, but
               I assume there are no survivors.

                         BARNES
               Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.

                         NORMAN
               Then why am I here?

                         BARNES
               What?

                         NORMAN
               What do you need me for?

     ON THE VIDEO SCREEN -- the diver shines his light on a large, metallic
     OBJECT.

                         BARNES
               What crashed wasn't an airplane, Dr.
               Johnson.  It's a bit larger than
               that.

     Barnes walks toward a TECHNICIAN, sitting at a keyboard.

                         BARNES
                    (to technician)
               Bring up the grid, would you?

     ANGLE ON THE MONITOR as an IMAGE OF THE CRAFT begins to form.

                         NORMAN
               What is it?  A military spacecraft?
               Like a shuttle or satellite?

                         BARNES
               Something like that.
                    (beat)
               That doesn't surprise you?

                         NORMAN
               Not really, no.  Something of the
               military crashes in the ocean -- it
               explains why there was nothing on
               the news, why you've kept everything
               a secret...  When did it crash?

                         BARNES
               As best we can estimate, it crashed
               four hundred years ago.

     A beat.

                         NORMAN
               Four hundred?  You're kidding, right?

     ANGLE ON THE MONITOR -- showing a grid depicting an image of the craft
     and a small layer of ROCK above it.

                         BARNES
               See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured
               the coral growth on top of the craft
               to be over five meters thick.

                         NORMAN
               Geologists?

                         BARNES
               Coral grows at a rate of two and a
               half centimeters a year --

                         NORMAN
               -- Wait a second --

                         BARNES
               -- dating the crash at least that
               old.

                         NORMAN
               Hold on --

                         BARNES
               Maybe older --

                         NORMAN
               -- there's got to be some mistake
               here -- a four hundred year old
               military spacecraft?  There's no such
               thing... our space program isn't even
               forty years old.

                         BARNES
               Extraordinary, isn't it?

                         NORMAN
               It's impossible.

                         BARNES
               I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson...
               because it's sitting on the bottom
               of our ocean floor.

     INT.  STAIRWELL

     Barnes and Norman shuffle down the stairs.

                         BARNES
               Off the record, I don't mind telling
               you, this thing scares the shit out
               of me.

                         NORMAN
               It doesn't make any sense.

                         BARNES
               We think it might.  That's why we
               brought you here.  We've assembled
               your team -- they're waiting for us
               now.

                         NORMAN
               What team?

                         BARNES
               The one you recommended.  In the ULF
               report you wrote for the Bush
               administration.

                         NORMAN
               ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that
               in years.  You mean someone actually
               read it?

     As they head down a hallway, Barnes pulls the ULF REPORT out from
     under his arm, hands it to Norman.

     Norman looks at it, almost embarrassed to be holding it.

                         BARNES
               Your report's become our bible down
               here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been
               carrying out each of your
               recommendations -- one by one -- to
               the smallest detail.

                         NORMAN
               But sir, I don't understand.  This
               report -- these recommendations...
               they're for an encounter with extra-
               terrestrial life.

     INT.  BRIEFING ROOM

     ON A VIDEO SCREEN -- sonar video of the spacecraft.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               How big is this spacecraft?

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               Of what we're able to measure,
               roughly twenty-six hundred feet.

                         TED (O.S.)
               A half a mile long?

                         BARNES
               The wing dimension alone is larger
               that any aircraft we've seen.

     The team members sit around the conference table:

     TED FIELDING, 41, geologist, boyish and happy to be here.  BETH
     HALPERIN, 36, biochemist, mother of three who's never worn an apron.
     ARTHUR LEVINE, 54, marine biologist, pudgy and quiet.  HARRY ADAMS, 32,
     mathamatician, African-American, wire-glasses, no bullshit.

                         HARRY
               How much damage?

                         BARNES
               To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.

                         HARRY
               Right.  So you're saying it survived
               a high speed impact with water
               without a scratch?

                         BARNES
               I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm
               just stating the facts.
                    (continuing)
               The outer metal is made of a
               titanium alloy, built into an epoxy-
               resin honeycomb.  The necessary
               technology to bond this type of
               metal has never been invented.

                         TED
               Never invented?

     ON NORMAN, watching the team...

                         BETH
               In basic English, what does all this
               mean?

                         BARNES
               Basic English?  There's no way this
               spacecraft was constructed on our
               planet.

     A LOUD MECHANICAL WHIRR

     INT.  TESTING ROOM -- LATER

     A large, X-Ray APPARATUS moves to the side, revealing Norman's FACE.

     ON BETH -- standing next to him.

                         BETH
               Five years.  No phone calls.  What am
               I -- a leper?

     Norman sits up...

                         NORMAN
               Beth, look, can I trust you with a
               little secret?

                         BETH
               I love secrets.

                         NORMAN
               That ULF report everybody's patting
               me on the back about?

                         BETH
               I've read it twice, Norman.  It's
               brilliant.

                         NORMAN
               It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.

                         BETH
                    (beat)
               That's quite a secret.

                         NORMAN
               I spent a week reading Sagan and
               watching re-runs of the Twilight
               Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying
               to pay the mortgage on my house -- I
               had no idea --

     ANGLE ON TWO NAVY CORPSMEN, standing behind glass in the next room,
     monitoring Beth and Norman.

                         BETH
               Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you
               listening?  Don't tell anyone what
               you just told me.

                         NORMAN
               C'mon, Beth -- that report's like
               the blind leading the blind.

                         BETH
               Because when we get down there --

                         NORMAN
               Wait -- down where?

                         BETH
               To the spacecraft.  To investigate.

                         NORMAN
               Underwater?

                         BETH
               What do you expect?  For them to
               bring it up here?

                         NORMAN
               We can't go down there.  We're not
               prepared.  That deep?  That takes
               years of training, Beth.  We're just
               scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear
               ties and lab coats to work -- not
               oxygen tanks.

                         BETH
               Well, you must have realized the
               chances an encounter like this would
               happen here.  In the ocean.
                    (off his look)
               70 percent of the earth's surface is
               water, Norman.  That's first grade
               geography.

                         NORMAN
               It never occurred to me.

                         BETH
               Well, let's pray that's the only
               mistake you made.  Have you said
               anything to Barnes about this?

                         NORMAN
               The timing has never seemed quite
               right.

                         BETH
               Just keep your mouth shut, alright?
               This could mean everything to our
               careers, you know that?  Don't
               jeopardize this.

                         NORMAN
                    (nervous laughter)
               What -- are you threatening me?

     EXT.  SHIP -- LATE AT NIGHT

     THE SKY -- clouds looming on the horizon.

     ANGLE ON ARTHUR LEVINE, leaning against the railing, looking out at
     the water.

     ON NORMAN, approaching him.  Arthur never looks at Norman, he just
     stares out at the water.

                         ARTHUR
               I don't know you, but I'll be honest
               with you.  I don't like this.  I don't
               like any of this.  Especially, the
               water.

                         NORMAN
               Seasick?  A marine biologist?

                         ARTHUR
               I don't belong here.  None of us
               belong here.  Look at that.

     ANGLE ON THE WATER, an ocean of seemingly endless, choppy waves.

                         NORMAN
               Makes you feel pretty small, doesn't
               it?

                         ARTHUR
               It scares the shit out of me.

                                                            CUT TO:

     CLOSE ON NORMAN, lying on a cot.  It is dark.  His eyes are open.  He
     stares at the ceiling.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  DESCENT PLATFORM

     A porthole hatch to the DESCENT SUB unlatches loudly.  A SUB-OFFICER
     help Norman lower himself through the hatch.

     INT.  DESCENT SUB

     Norman steps down the ladder into the sub compartment.  Seated in a
     circle area: Ted, Beth, Harry, and Arthur.  Ahead of them, Captain
     Barnes sits with the pilot in the sub's cockpit, separated by a wall
     of plexiglass.

     Norman takes a seat between Beth and Ted.

                         BARNES (O.S.)
                    (through the intercom)
               Our descent will take 13 minutes.
               Descending at a speed of 80 feet per
               minute.

     Across from Norman, Harry is WHISPERING something quietly into
     Arthur's ear.

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               Pressure adjustments will cause the
               sub to lurch at times, but don't be
               alarmed.  It's perfectly normal...

     Arthur's face drips with sweat, as Harry continues to whisper into his
     ear.

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               The sub's interior atmosphere will
               experience moisture as we descend,
               and the temperature will drop
               rapidly.  Just relax and remain
               seated during the descent.

     Norman watches Arthur, dripping with sweat.

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               We have clearing from the base.

     Red interior lights flicker on in the compartment, and WE HEAR the sub
     make a HISSING sound.  The sub lurches, and begins to lower in the
     water.

                         NORMAN
               Arthur?

     Harry has gotten to Arthur.  Arthur is on the verge of panic.

                         NORMAN
               Arthur?  You alright?

                         ARTHUR
               Open the hatch door, please.

     Harry continues to whisper in his ear.

                         ARTHUR
               Captain, open the hatch door, please
               ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it,
               please.

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               Calm down, Dr. Levine.

                         ARTHUR
               Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               Please, Dr. Levine.

     Arthur leaps violently out of his seat, scrambles to the plexiglass
     wall.

                         BARNES
                    (through the plexiglass)
               Sit down, Dr. Levine!  You're in a
               military operation now --

     Arthur bangs on the plexiglass wall with his fists.

                         BARNES
               ... Your civil rights have been
               overridden!

                         ARTHUR
               Open it, Captain!

                         BARNES
               Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your
               seat!

     Arthur VOMITS, violently, heaving, splattering the plexiglass wall.

                         ARTHUR
               Open the fucking door!

     The sub LURCHES again, coming to a stop.  The compartment is totally
     silent, as they begin ascending to the surface.

     ON HARRY smiling a sly, evil grin directed right at Norman.

     The sub lurches again, and WE HEAR clanking metal.  The hatch door
     opens.

     And Arthur, wiping the vomit from his mouth, climbs up the ladder and
     out the hatch door.

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               Anybody else?

     Silence.

     The hatch door LOCKS, loudly.  The sub lurches, and begins descending.

                         TED
               Pussy.

                         BETH
               What's that -- mistake number two,
               Norman?

                         NORMAN
               He wasn't feeling well.

                         TED
               He's a pussy.

     Harry is still staring at Norman...

                         HARRY
               How are you feeling, Norman?

                         NORMAN
               What?

                         HARRY
               You holding up alright?

                         NORMAN
               Fine.  I'm fine.

                         HARRY
               Don't be defensive.

                         NORMAN
               I'm not being defensive.

                         HARRY
               You sound defensive.

                         NORMAN
               I'm fine.

                         TED
                    (to Harry)
               What'd you say to him?

                         HARRY
               To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing
               that Norman doesn't already know.

                         TED
               What does Norman already know?

                         HARRY
               Norman thinks we shouldn't be going
               down.  Thinks it's a mistake.

     Norman looks over at Beth.

                         HARRY
               She told me what you said, Norman.

                         TED
               What is it, Harry?

                         HARRY
               Just one of Norman's many secrets.

     ON NORMAN, saying nothing.

     EXT.  OCEAN

     WE SEE the sub descending into darker waters.

     EXT.  DH-8 HABITAT -- ARRIVING DOCK

     The SUB descends into the AIRLOCK, metal clanks against metal.  Around
     it, the DH-8: interwoven cylinders lit up with lights.

     INT.  AIRLOCK -- PRESSURIZING ROOM

     CLOSE ON THE HATCH DOOR closing tightly, locking.

                         OFFICER (O.S.)
               One moment for pressurizing.

     A SOFT WHIRR.

     ANGLE ON -- Barnes and the four remaining team members standing in the
     small, claustrophobic pressurizing room.  Like sardines.  Nobody says
     anything.  A long beat.

     THE DOOR

     in front of them, opens.  TEENY FLETCHER, 30s, a big-boned female
     officer, stands before them.  She wears a black plastic PAD, a
     "talker", around her neck.

     She hands each member their own "talker".  Norman takes his.

     INT.  DH-8 HALLWAY

     Fletcher leads Barnes and the team members down the hallway.  Each of
     them wears the "talkers" around their necks.

                         BARNES
               They pressurize us with helium.

                         NORMAN
               What's wrong with oxygen?

                         BARNES
               It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it
               makes a half-eaten apple turn brown
               and puts the ugly, iron rust on an
               Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low,
               oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it
               down here, and it'll do to your dick
               what it does to the Oldsmobile.

                         TED
               Important safety tip.  Thanks
               Captain.

     Fletcher listens through her radio earpiece, turns to Barnes...

                         FLETCHER
               Captain, the divers have the airlock
               mounted at the door.  The robot is
               now in position to enter the
               spacecraft.

                         TED
               Robot?  What robot?

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     CLOSE ON A MONITOR -- showing the robot in front of the curved gray

               feed.

     JANE EDMUNDS, 32, the unit archivist, works the control panel.  Another
     MONITOR clicks on -- showing the robot's POV of the door.

               Captain, you know, I really
               appreciate you hauling us a thousand
               feet below sea level so we can watch
               this historical event on television.

                         BARNES
               Nobody goes inside, until we know
               what's inside.

     ON THE MONITOR -- THE ROBOT CAMERA scans the spacecraft hull, stops on
     a rectangular panel mounted to the left of the door.

                         BARNES
               Can you open that panel?

                         EDMUNDS
               Working on it now, sir.

     ON THE MONITOR -- a robotic CLAW extends out to the panel.  Trying to
     pry the panel open.

                         TED
               I'd like it noted in the report that
               I think we should be doing this
               ourselves.  Making a manned entry...

     The claw is clumsy, and keeps banging into the metal.

                         TED
               I'd also like it noted --

                         BARNES
               Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using
               suction.

     ON THE MONITOR -- another robotic arm extends out, with a rubber
     sucker.  It pushes against the panel, but doesn't suck.

                         EDMUNDS
               It's not sucking, sir.

                         BARNES
               Thank you, I can see that.  Try
               something else.

                         EDMUNDS
               We don't have anything else to try,
               Sir.

                         BARNES
               Well, shit -- find something, do
               something... make something up --

                         TED
               What about a crowbar?

     Barnes straightens up, looks at Ted...

                         BARNES
               What about a crowbar?

                         TED
               What if we go out there, you know --
               wedge a crowbar in the door and pry
               the thing open.

                         HARRY
               Pry the thing open?  What are we --
               neanderthals?

                         BETH
               All that banging and pounding.  I
               don't know.  We should think about
               making a good first impression.

                         HARRY
               For who?  The fish?

                         BETH
               For whoever's in that thing.

                         BARNES
               Or whatever's in that thing.

     ON THE MONITOR -- the spacecraft, sitting there silently, staring back
     at them.

                         BARNES
               Norman, what do you think?

     Norman, quiet in the corner, perks up...

                         NORMAN
               Me?  Well -- I don't really...  I
               mean, you could... you know, you
               could make a real solid case... a
               crowbar?

     All eyes on Norman.

                         NORMAN
               I don't know.

     A beat as they all stare at him.

                         TED
               I'm secure enough with that.

     INT.  CHANGING ROOM

     ANGLE ON A LOCKER door opening.  Inside is an elaborate JUMPSUIT and
     HELMET with the name: "JOHNSON", stenciled above the faceplate.

                         NORMAN
               Are we all -- I mean, is it
               necessary for all of us to go... out
               there?

     The other team members take their suits out of their lockers.

                         BARNES
               Nothing to be nervous about.  These
               suits are wired and electrically
               heated.  Each equipped with an alarm
               that triggers automatically if life-
               support sustems go below optimum.

     Norman holds his jumpsuit out and away from him, like it's something
     nuclear.

                         TED
               It's just like swimming, Norman...
               You know how to swim, don't you?

                         HARRY
               You're not afraid of the water, are
               you, Norman?

     They all look over at him.

                         BETH
                    (half smiling)
               Isn't there a psychological term for
               that, Dr. Johnson?

                         NORMAN
                    (under his breath)
               Yeah.  Drowning.

     INT.  AIRLOCK ROOM -- (A CYLINDER)

     Dressed in jumpsuits and helmets -- Barnes jumps into a POOL of ocean
     water, cut out from the floor, leading to the ocean.  It looks like a
     tiny swimming pool.  Ted jumps in next.  Beth, Harry, and Norman are
     left...

                         BETH
               You're next, Norman.

                         NORMAN
                    (nervous as hell)
               No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.

                         BETH
               Such a gentlemen when you're scared
               shitless.

     She hops in.  Norman watches, looks up at Harry, next to him.

                         HARRY
               Go ahead.  Ladies first.

                         NORMAN
               No, why don't --

     Harry nudges him forward.

                         HARRY
               C'mon.

                         NORMAN
               Wait a second, I --

     Harry pushes him again.  Norman catches himself.

                         NORMAN
               Geez, c'mon, alright.  Gimme a
               minute.  Let me get my bearings --

     Harry pushes him again.

                         HARRY
               C'mon, Norman.

                         NORMAN
               Look, would you --

     And Harry just pushes him in.  Norman slips and falls awkwardly... into
     the ocean depths.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BLACK.

     Quiet.  Only THE SOUND OF NORMAN -- BREATHING.

     For a couple beats.

     Now... NORMAN'S POV -- from inside his helmet -- a light SHINES from
     behind him -- casting his SHADOW onto the murky ocean floor.

     Norman's head turns, and he's BLINDED by a light -- it's Harry, the
     light SHINING from the top of Harry's helmet.

     WE HEAR Harry's voice, static, through Norman's helmet.

                         HARRY (O.S.)
               The switch is on your waist.

     ON NORMAN -- his GLOVE -- fumbling at his waist.

     HIS HELMET LIGHT -- FLICKERS on.

     ON NORMAN -- slowly, beginning to walk on the ocean floor.

     HIS FEET -- squashing gently, lightly into the muddy ground.

     NORMAN'S POV -- can barely make out the others in front of him, their
     helmet lights STROBING the dark water, crossing each other, like
     searchlights on a foggy night.

     CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE -- eyes cold, BREATHING.  Couple beats.  And
     HEARS:

                         TED (O.S.)
               Look at that thing.

     Norman's eyes look up... WE PULL BACK...

     LONG, HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the team -- their little helmet lights tiny
     and insignificant almost as...

     IN FRONT OF THEM -- the SPACECRAFT.  Dwarfing them in size, looming
     large, majestic, like nothing we've ever seen.  The enormous tail fin,
     in the distance, extends high out of the coral.

     In the huge MOUND OF CORAL covering the spacecraft, WE SEE a tunnel --
     cut out like a cave -- lined with tiny, dim lightbulbs.

     INT.  TUNNEL

     About 60 feet deep.  Narrower than they'd like.  Norman descends,
     clumsily, awkwardly -- pushing off the bulky, iron handles fastened to
     the coral walls.

     THE LOUD HISSING OF AIR

     INT.  SPACECRAFT AIRLOCK

     CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE as he watches the water recede, down past his
     faceplate.

     THE LOUD BANGING OF METAL

     Ted has wedged a crowbar into the door and BANGS at it with a
     sledgehammer.

                         HARRY
               Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.

                         TED
               Gimme some room here, will you?  Back
               off.  Gimme some space.

     They all back away, cramming into the far corner of the airlock as Ted
     keeps swinging.

                         BETH
               Looks alot like an airplane door,
               doesn't it?

     Ted stops and looks at the door.

                         TED
               Alot like.  You know, I noticed it
               before, but I didn't...

                         HARRY
               Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit.
               Keep hammering.

                         NORMAN
               You want me to try?

                         TED
               You're a 53 year old shrink, what
               are you gonna do?

                         BARNES
               Give him the hammer, Ted.

     Norman takes the hammer.  Walks up to the wedge.  Gets his bearings.
     Rears back... then stops.

                         TED
               What is it, your back give out?

     Something has caught Norman's eye.  He looks down at the wedge.

                         BARNES
               What is it, Norman?

                         NORMAN
               Take a look.

     Barnes comes toward him.  The others follow.  Barnes bends down, looks
     closely down at the wedge in the door.

                         BARNES
               It's chipped.

                         HARRY
               Chipped?  The door?  How can it be
               chipped?

                         BARNES
               I don't know how it can be chipped,
               but it's chipped.

                         HARRY
               I thought you said there wasn't any
               damage done in the crash?

                         BARNES
               I did.

                         HARRY
               Then how can it be chipped?

     ON BETH -- she touches the door with her palms, feels around.

                         BETH
               There's heat coming the door.

                         BARNES
               Back away then.

                         BETH
               Wait a minute --

                         BARNES
               I said back away.

                         BETH
               Would you wait a minute?

     THE DOOR STARTS TO RUMBLE

     Barnes unstraps a GUN -- nearly the size of an uzzi -- from his
     buckle.

                         BARNES
               Ted, get her away from the door.

                         TED
               What are you going to do -- shoot
               her?

     The RUMBLING louder...

                         BARNES
               Get her away!

     THE DOOR begins to slide open.

     Beth backs away.

     THE DOOR, sliding, is revealing COMPLETE BLACKNESS inside.  The door
     stops, it's open, it's quiet.  They all stand there, looking at
     BLACKNESS.  A long beat.

     INT.  SPACECRAFT

     ON NORMAN -- cautiously stepping inside.  His helmet light SHINES on the
     others ahead of him, walking along a 5 foot wide CATWALK, suspended
     high in the air.

     Metallic BEAMS and RAFTERS criss-cross above them.

     Norman looks over the railing -- his light STROBES through 40 feet of
     darkness, dimly lighting the LOWER HULL, a dense network of STRUTS and
     GIRDERS.

                         TED
               Look at this.

                         BARNES
               What is it?

     Ted SPOTLIGHTS the OUTER HULL.

                         TED
               Some sort of lead or something.

                         BARNES
               Radiation shield, you think?

                         TED
               A foot and a half thick?  That'd
               withstand a helluva lot of
               radiation.

     Beth's light SHINES down onto the CATWALK.  WE SEE FOOTPRINTS outlined
     on the dusty floor.

                         BETH
               Hold on --

                         BARNES
               What is it?

                         BETH
               Any of you get ahead of me -- walk
               this far up?

                         TED
               No.  I don't think so.

                         BETH
               Well, think.  Because there's
               footprints here that aren't mine.

                         TED
               Well, they're not mine.

     ON THE FOOTPRINTS -- large, like the boots they're wearing.

                         BARNES
               Calm down, alright?  They gotta be
               somebody's here.  Let's stay
               together, please.

                                                            CUT TO:

     LONG SHOT -- seeing them suspended high in the air on the catwalk,
     walking.  Their tiny streams of LIGHT moving about.  WE SEE just how
     ominous this spacecraft really is.

                         BETH
               It's empty.  Why would someone build a
               ship like this?

                         HARRY
               You'd have to ask them.

     They approach a DOOR, at the end of the catwalk.

                         BARNES
               Alright, Beth, do that thing you did
               before.

                         BETH
               How about I just press the button?

     She presses a button near the door.  The door SLIDES open.

                         BARNES
               Or just... press the button.

     Barnes holds out his gun, and enters.  The others behind him.

                         TED
               Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how
               it would have a button.

                         NORMAN
               Earth doesn't have a patent on
               buttons, Ted.

                         TED
               Still, make a note I recognized that.

     ON BARNES -- leading them through a small hall.  It seems to be opening
     up into some sort of room -- when Barnes stops.  Dead in his tracks.

                         TED
               What's wrong?

                         BARNES
                    (serious)
               What do you make of this?

     ON NORMAN -- as he steps around Barnes, his light BRIGHTENING on: A
     SIGN that reads: "Trash."

                         TED
                    (softly)
               What the hell?

     Very softly, Harry begins to laugh.

                         TED
               English?

                         HARRY
               That's right.

     Norman looks up and SEES more of the room as his light SHINES
     throughout it: TABLES, COUCHES and CHAIRS -- made of leather, very
     comfortable looking.

     They begin to slowly wander about... 

                         BETH
               I don't get it.

                         TED
               It doesn't make any sense.

                         HARRY
               You don't think it does?  I think
               it's rather obvious.

                         TED
               Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of
               those hoaxes?

                         HARRY
               A spacecraft half a mile long --
               with 500 tonnes of coral on top of
               it?  Someone went to a lot of
               trouble.  Try again.

                         TED
               But it's impossible.

                         HARRY
               Is it?

     Beth touches the table, it's metal, but it's soft and rubbery.

                         TED
               Why would this ship carry
               instructions in English?

                         HARRY
               Think about it.

                         TED
               Unless, this alien spacecraft was --
               you know -- somehow presenting
               itself to Americans in a way that
               would make us feel comfortable.

                         NORMAN
               400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher
               Columbus would've loved these
               accomodations.

                         BETH
               Good theory, Ted.

                         TED
               Well, what's your theory?

                         BETH
               I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I
               only deal with facts.

                         HARRY
               All the facts you need are right in
               front of you.

                         TED
               Gimme a minute here... I think I've
               got it.

                         HARRY
               Do you?

                         TED
               If it is an alien spacecraft --

                         HARRY
               Save your breath.  It's not an alien
               spacecraft.

                         BETH
               Then what is it?

                         HARRY
                    (beat)
               It's an American spacecraft.

                         TED
               An American spacecraft?  Half a mile
               long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah,
               good theory, Harry.

                         HARRY
               It's been obvious from the start,
               hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all
               the secrecy, why no one was told
               about it?

                         BARNES
               We had considered it.

                         TED
               Considered what?  That it's American?
               How would you think it's American?

                         HARRY
               The chip in the door.

     ON NORMAN -- glancing up at Harry... 

                         HARRY
               We take a weeny little wedge, bang
               on it a couple of times, and bust
               off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any
               spacecraft -- even at a low
               velocity, say 200 miles an hour --
               crashes into the water -- it's gonna
               be like hitting concrete, it would
               crumple like paper.  But there isn't
               a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even
               a scratch.

                         TED
               Meaning?

                         HARRY
               Meaning it didn't land in the water.

                         TED
               Please.  It must have flown here --

                         HARRY
               It didn't fly here.  It arrived here.

                         TED
               Arrived?  From where?

                         HARRY
               Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From
               our future.

     A quiet moment as they take this in.

     INT.  SPACECRAFT -- DEEPER INSIDE

     Ted and Barnes trek through a vast cargo bay, like two ants wlth
     flashlights.

                         TED
               Time travel.  I always thought it was
               one of those myths... like Santa's
               reindeer.

                         BARNES
               What would we be working on in the
               future that would make us want to
               come back?

                         TED
               Maybe we didn't want to come back.

     BACK IN -- THE ROOM

     Norman, Harry, and Beth... 

                         BETH
               What are you looking for?

                         HARRY
               A light switch.  A button opened that
               door -- the craft runs on some sort
               of power.

     ON NORMAN -- as he sits down in one of the CHAIRS.

                         BETH
               What's that noise?

     They LISTEN to a GIRGLING NOISE.

                         NORMAN
               Sounds a little like water --

     SUDDENLY -- the chair Norman's in -- wraps around him, squeezing him
     inside, padding sliding around his head, his shoulders enveloping him
     -- sucking him inside... 

                         BETH
               Norman!

                         NORMAN
               Get this thing off me.

     Beth bends down, presses a button, the CHAIR releases Norman... 

                         BETH
               I think the chair thinks you want to
               fly this thing.

     ON BETH's FACEPLATE -- as she's looking down -- WE BEGIN TO SEE --
     reflected in her faceplate: yellow digital lettering sputtering
     across... 

     "RV-LHOOQ... DCOM1... "

     Her EYES look up slowly... as we

                                                            CUT TO:

     THE BLACK SCREEN in front of the chairs, lit up with bright yellow
     lettering:

     "RV -- LHOOQ -- DCOMl -- U.S.S STAR VOYAGER"

     "ASSIMILATING DATABASE" as a series of numbers race upwards in
     count... 

     And the desk in front of them LIGHTS UP, a control panel coming to
     life.  

                         HARRY
               Nice work, Norman.

                         NORMAN
               Whatever I can do to help.

     ON THE SCREEN as it changes, now filled with columns:

     SHIP SYSTEMS
     DATA SYSTEMS
     QUARTER MASTER
     FLIGHT RECORDS

     Harry punches some keys on the control panel.

                         HARRY
               A flight recorder.  Our future is
               about to be seen in our present.

     ON THE SCREEN as it changes:

     FLIGHT DATA SUMMARIES
     FDS 01/01/47-12/31/49
     FDS 01/01/50-12/31/52
     FDS 01/01/53-12/31/55
     FDS 01/01/56-12/31/56
     FDS 01/01/56-02/01/56
     FDS 02/02/56-UNKNOWN ENTRY EVENT

                         NORMAN
               01-01-47.  Two thousand-forty seven.
               50 years in our future.

                         HARRY
               Unknown Entry Event.

     Harry pauses, looks down, and punches more keys... 

     ON THE SCREEN -- as it expands in size, widens around them, curving... 
     WE SEE a galaxy of stars, planets coming OFF THE SCREEN, into the
     room, becoming three dimensional, suspended in air, giving the
     illusion of depth.

     The IMAGE begins streaking outward, TOWARD US, moving rapidly, like
     we're flying through it.

     The stars and other space matter streaking by.

                         BETH
               What's that cluster of stars there?
               In the center?

     Harry stares, walking around the desk, moving into the 3-D image... 

                         HARRY
               Our answer.

                         NORMAN
               To what?

                         HARRY
               Time travel.  A black hole.

     The CLUSTER of stars grows brighter and brighter, as it comes closer
     and closer, brightening.

     The FIELD twists and turns as the SCREEN and FIELD become BLINDING as
     WE ENTER the cluster, the black hole.

     ON NORMAN -- his face, bright, FRIGHTENED as he HEARS:

                         HARRY (O.S.)
               Ted?  Captain?

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               Yes, Harry.

                         HARRY (O.S.)
               We know how this craft got here.
               Where it's been.

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               So do we.  And it seems to have
               picked up something on it's travels.

     STILL ON NORMAN -- frightened... 

                         NORMAN
               Picked up something?  What is it?

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               I don't know.  But it's something
               alien.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  CARGO BAY

     ANGLE ON our six team members' BOOTS, in the distance.  AS WE PAN UP
     and AROUND WE SEE a curved surface appear: a surface of slowly
     swirling green and blue fluids.  Like mercury.  Mesmerizlng.

     AS WE COME AROUND, the team stands looking at the SPHERE, 30 feet in
     dlameter, held by a GIANT CLAW gripping it from the top.

     They walk around it, circling it, looking up at it.

                         HARRY	
               This answers one of our questions.

                         NORMAN
               Which one?  Let me get the list out.

                         HARRY
               This spacecraft was designed to pick
               things up.  They see things they want
               -- these claws go out and bring it
               in.  They come across this.  This... 
               sphere.  Find it interesting,
               curious.  They draw it inside to take
               back home.

                         NORMAN
               But on the way home, they miss their
               turn, go too far, into the past.

                         HARRY
               Our present.

                         BARNES
               But what does it do?  This... sphere.

                         TED
               Maybe it's a message of some sort,
               you know?  See this red here.

     ANGLE ON THE SPHERE -- some dark red MARKINGS on it's surface... 

                         TED
                    (continuing)
               Looks like a design, some writing,
               maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the
               spacecraft with a message.

                         HARRY
               Look closely.  That isn't writing.
               Those are grooves.

     ON THE RED GROOVES -- engraved into the surface.

                         HARRY
               No.  They don't represent a message.
               They aren't decorative at all.  They
               have another purpose entirely.

                         BARNES
               What?

                         HARRY
               To conceal a small break in the
               surface of the sphere.

                         BARNES
               A break for what?

     INT.  HABITAT -- HALLWAY

     DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR -- WE SEE Barnes, through a half-closed door,
     pacing, talking on the phone... 

                         BARNES
               ... it's definitely something alien
               ... another civilization, yes, sir... 
               Well, we don't know yet, but we
               think we've found a door... 

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Edmunds, Barnes, and the team members (minus Ted) look at the monitor.

                         BARNES
               So how do we get it open?

                         HARRY
               Ted seems to have some ideas.

     ON THE MONITOR -- Ted pushing on the SPHERE door.  Banging into it with
     his shoulder.

                         NORMAN
               Maybe we shouldn't.

                         BARNES
               What?

                         NORMAN
               If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't
               try to open it at all.

                         HARRY
                    (nodding to Norman)
               Man is man, all he knows is man, and
               all he can think of is what he
               knows.  The anthropomorphic problem.
               Good, Norman.

                         BARNES
               The what?

                         NORMAN
               I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't
               you read the report?

                         HARRY
               Everything ever written about extra-
               terrestial life imagines that life
               is essentially human.  If it doesn't
               look human, it's a reptile or a big
               insect or something, having human
               values, human understanding.

                         BARNES
               So?  What's the problem?

                         HARRY
               It's nonsense.  There's enough
               difference between our own species
               to prove that.

                         BETH
               Take politics, our views on
               abortion, the death penalty... 

                         HARRY
               Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now
               we're talking about a new life form.
               Their values and ethics may be
               incomprehensible.

                         BARNES
               Like "Thou shall not kill"?

                         NORMAN
               Or maybe, it can't be killed.

                         BARNES
               You mean, what's in that thing is
               immortal?

                         NORMAN
               I don't know.  That's the point.

                         BARNES
               Everything can be killed.

                         BETH
               Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take
               ... yeasts.

                         BARNES
               Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't
               think we're gonna open it up and
               find a loaf of bread.

                         HARRY
               And we're just talking about three-
               dimensional creatures.  What if it's
               five or six or seven-dimensional?  So
               dimensional that we couldn't even
               see it to kill it.

                         NORMAN
               Good point.  I don't know what you're
               talking about, but good point.

                         BARNES
               Or it could contain some great
               benefit to us, some astonishing new
               idea or technology to help mankind.

                         HARRY
               It could.  But the odds of it being

                         BARNES
               You don't know that.

               Let's say whoever made this thing is
               a thousand years ahead of us, just
               like we are to, say, medieval
               Europe.  Suppose you went back to
               medieval Europe with a TV set.  There
               wouldn't be any place to plug it in.

                         BARNES

     Empty, sterile.  WE HEAR the repeating sound: THWAP.  Almost like a

     INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

     Harry on his bunk, staring at the wall, flicking his middle finger at
     his cheek: THWAP... THWAP.

                         HARRY
               You realize, Norman, that we are all
               going to die.

     Norman is lying in his own bunk, below Harry.

                         NORMAN
               Don't be so optomistic, Harry.

                         HARRY
               I'm completely serious.  There is
               something very important missing
               from that spacecraft.  You know what
               that is?

                         NORMAN
               Not a clue.

                         HARRY
               A sign that the builders knew time
               travel through a black hole was
               possible.

                         NORMAN
               I don't follow you.

                         HARRY
               On that flight recorder, they called
               the black hole an "Unknown Entry
               Event." They didn't know what a
               black hole was.  Fifty years from
               now, men are going to build that
               ship in a very tentative,
               experimental way, with no knowledge
               that time travel through a black
               hole is possible.

                         NORMAN
               So what?

     Harry leans his head over his bunk.

                         HARRY
               So, we know.
                    (beat)
               We know it went through a black
               hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd
               get to the surface, we'd tell
               someone about the black hole,
               wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report
               like some big discovery.  So in fifty
               years when they build that ship,
               they'd make precautions for a black
               hole.
                    (beat)
               But they didn't.  The called it an
               Unknown Entry Event.

                         NORMAN
               Meaning we're never gonna get the
               chance to tell anyone.

                         HARRY
               Meaning we're never gonna get to the
               surface alive... to tell anyone.

     Norman gets out of his bed.

                         NORMAN
               I can't believe that, Harry.

                         HARRY
               Gimme another explanation.

     Norman pacing.

                         NORMAN
               I can't.  If I had a minute to think,
               maybe, but I know you're wrong.

                         HARRY
               Am I?

                         NORMAN
               Look -- we're under a lot of
               pressure, we're tired, you're not
               thinking straight.

                         HARRY
               You mean, you think I'm cracking?

                         NORMAN
               No.  I didn't say that.

                         HARRY
               Then what, Norman?

     Norman stops pacing, a beat.

                         NORMAN
               It's what's in that sphere, isn't
               it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in
               that thing -- you think it's going
               to kill you.

                         HARRY
               Curious, isn't it?  What's inside?
               Before I die, I'd sure like to open
               it and see.

               Where is he?  Damn it!  Can you see

     A still moment and then Harry tumbles out the sphere, and falls to the

     Harry lies motionless.

     Checks Harry's LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.  Still blinking -- he's still alive.
     Norman, pauses, looks up, staring at...

     Mesmerizing.  He can see himself, reflected in the swirling mass,

     CLOSE ON HARRY'S FACE

     Harry lies on his bunk.  He begins to slowly awake.

     WE BEGIN TO HEAR A SCRATCHING NOISE, like nails on a chalkboard.  It
     gets LOUDER as Harry comes to.  He puts his fingers to his temples.

     Norman stands beside, him writing in his notebook.

                         HARRY
               What is that?  That noise?

                         NORMAN
               What noise?

                         HARRY
               It's like... 

     ANGLE ON Norman's pen -- as he stops writing, the NOISE stops.

     Harry sighs.  Norman looks down at his pen.

                         NORMAN
               Harry, can you tell me about the
               sphere?

                         HARRY
               What are you still doing here?

                         NORMAN
               You remember opening the door?

                         HARRY
               You were all supposed to leave.  You
               weren't supposed to stay down here.

                         NORMAN
               Tell me about the door.  Do you
               remember how you opened the door to
               the sphere?... Harry?

                         HARRY
               You don't understand about the
               sphere.

                         NORMAN
               Then explain it to me.

     Harry pauses, staring almost like a frightened little boy.

                         HARRY
               Norman?

                         NORMAN
               What is it, Harry?

                         HARRY
               What happens on page 87?  Have you
               ever read page 87?

                         NORMAN
               Page 87 of what, Harry?

                         HARRY
               I could never read that far.  I never
               wanted to.

                         NORMAN
               That far in what, Harry?

     Harry doesn't say anything.  Norman waiting... 

                         HARRY
               You shouldn't be here, Norman.  It's
               too dangerous for you and the others
               to be down here.

                         BETH
               Yeah.  I heard you.

                         BARNES
               There are procedures, Beth, that I
               want followed.  My procedures.  And
               considering what's going on, I want
               you to follow them very closely.

     He walks to the door, then turns.

                         BARNES

               Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you
               from getting impotent.

                         TED

               ... there was a whole flock of them
               out there earlier.  It's strange.
               It's dead down here, and then all of
               a sudden --

     Harry drops his fork.  He begins COUGHING.  HACKING.  CHOKING loudly.
     GAGGING.  He HACKS out the squid from his mouth...

               No idea.  We have no surface support.
               It transmitted too fast to be coming

               Harry thinks it's some sort of
               discharge from our own system, but
               I've seen it discharge before -- and
               it didn't look anything like this.

               Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze
               me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like
               you hate jellyfish.

                         NORMAN
               You said something to me, before --
               about how we were all going to die.

                         HARRY

               but I can't taste any of it.  Funny,
               my senses are much keener though.
               Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling.
               Like, I can smell your sheets,
               Norman.  You tried to wash it out
               earlier, But I can still smell the

               Don't worry, I'm not going to tell

     BACK IN -- LIVING QUARTERS

     Norman sitting on the table... 

                         NORMAN
               What happened to you inside that
               sphere, Harry?

     A long beat.  Harry becomes concerned... 

                         HARRY
               Why?  Does someone else want to go
               inside?

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     ON THE MONITOR -- Fletcher, the jellyfish clinging to her facemask, her
     suit... 

                         FLETCHER (O.S.)
               I can't see, they're smearing the
               faceplate.  My arms... the fabric... 

     Fletcher's suit tears... 

                         BARNES
               Fletcher, get away from there... 

                         FLETCHER (O.S.)
               It's burning... 

                         BARNES
               Get out of there!

                         FLETCHER (O.S.)
               I can't see... 

                         BARNES
               Fletcher!  Now!

                         FLETCHER (O.S.)
               I can't... 

     ON BETH -- bolting out of the room.  Barnes turning to her... 

                         BARNES
               Nobody move.

                         BETH
               But she's --

                         BARNES
               Nobody move!

                         FLETCHER (O.S.)
               They're eating through... 
               Somebody --

     ON FLETCHER -- UNDERWATER -- jellyfish eating into her plastic
     faceplate... she's COUGHING, GASPING.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     They watch... 

     ON THE MONITOR -- Her body twisting, contorting.  Her suit, ripping
     apart.  SCREAMING.  She convulses.  Her body falling.

     HER HORRIFYING SCREAM FADING INTO... 

     INT.  DECONTAMINATION LAB

     CLOSE ON -- Fletcher's face.  Cold, dead.  Eyes open.  Jellyfish rooted in
     her skin.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  LABRATORY

     CLOSE ON A MICROSCOPIC IMAGE of a jellyfish.

     ON NORMAN -- in the corner of the lab, inspecting a MEDICAL KIT.

                         NORMAN
               What is this, Beth?  You taking
               valium?

     Beth, looking into the microscope.

                         BETH
               Sedatives.  Whatever my mood calls
               for.

     Norman picks up a book, next to the kit: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

                         NORMAN
               Where'd this come from?

                         BETH
               The library.

                         NORMAN
               We have a library?

                         BETH
               A bad one.  It was the only book in
               there.  Norman, come here, look at
               this.

                         NORMAN
               No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.

     Walking toward her... 

                         NORMAN
               ... when I was six, my younger
               brother and I -- we went swimming in
               the Pacific.  At my mother's beach
               house.  We both felt stinging, and
               when we came out of the water, he
               was wearing jellyfish head to toe.
               Killed him.

                         BETH
               My gosh, Norman.

                         NORMAN
               Yeah, it was awful.

                         BETH
               What about you?  What happened to
               you?

                         NORMAN
               Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed.
               It itched for a while, but I
               survived.
                    (beat)
               Beth, do you find it... curious that
               we're seeing all this life down
               here.  Nothing, and then these
               enormous flocks of squid.  Then
               jellyfish?

                         BETH
               Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's
               quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no
               electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's
               curious is -- these aren't normal
               jellyfish.

                         NORMAN
               What do you mean -- not normal?

                         BETH
               They have six tentacles.  A new
               species.  And the squid too.  They had
               no stomach.

                         NORMAN
               Wait a minute.

                         BETH
               What?

                         NORMAN
               You knew about the squid not being
               normal.  Before Fletcher went out
               there?

                         BETH
               Yeah, why?

                         NORMAN
               And you didn't tell anyone?

     Beth, nervous... 

                         BETH
               What?  Why... 

                         NORMAN
               Beth --

                         BETH
               I mean, I'm not... I wasn't
               absolutely sure if... they --

                         NORMAN
               They are or they aren't.  Which is
               it?

                         BETH
               What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are
               you --

                         NORMAN
               Beth.

                         BETH
               Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why
               are you looking at me like that?

                         NORMAN
               Beth --

     She backs away from Norman, knocking off a speciman jar, it SHATTERS
     on the floor.  She starts breaking down.

     Norman watching her, falling to the ground, picking up the glass,
     hurriedly... 

                         BETH
               I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't
               mean... 

                         NORMAN
               Beth.

     She's crying, glass in her hands.  She looks up at Norman, frightened,
     nervous... 

                         BETH
               You wouldn't go and tell the others,
               would you?

     Norman hesitates, goes to her, tries to hold her, but she pushes him
     away.

                         BETH
               I hate this place, Norman.  I want
               out.

     stands there now, hand on the knob.

     CLOSES it shut.

     INT.  ROOM

     Barnes sits, Norman in front of him, worked up... 

                         NORMAN
               I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She
               can be drastic.

                         BARNES
               How drastic?

                         NORMAN
               You don't want to know.

                         BARNES
               I think I do.

                         NORMAN
               A while back, Beth and I -- we
               worked at the same university.  She
               was assisting a chemist there -- I
               forget his name -- doing research,
               experiments.  She was also living
               with him.
                    (off Barnes' look)
               Yeah, I know.  And when she finished
               her work, he kicked her out, broke
               off the relationship, and published
               five papers -- all her work --
               without any thank you or
               acknowledgement.

                         BARNES
               She should've known better.

                         NORMAN
               She put a razor to her wrists a day
               later.

                         BARNES
                    (a beat)
               When was this?

                         NORMAN
               '81, I think.  She tried again five
               years ago.
                    (beat)
               I thought you should know.

                         BARNES
               So you knew this when you wrote your
               report?

                         NORMAN
               At the time, I don't know, I thought
               putting her on the list -- it might
               help her career -- catch her a
               break.

                         BARNES
               You knowingly recommended a woman
               with suicidal tendencies for a
               government operation --

                         NORMAN
               Wait a second --

                         BARNES
               -- and then brought her down here --

                         NORMAN
               -- I didn't know it would come to
               this --

                         BARNES
               -- without a cautionary word to
               anyone.
                    (beat)
               You know, Ted said something to me
               earlier.  I think he's right.  He
               said, "When you got a guy who -- if
               he wasn't here -- he'd be standing
               in the unemployment line, you gotta
               question if you got the right guy."

     ON NORMAN -- sweating.

               It's the same as before, but the

     Harry sitting at the monitor, shows Ted, Barnes, Norman, and Edmunds a
     PRINTOUT of the screan -- indicating a pattern.

                         HARRY
               It's a single sequence repeated over
               and over.

                         BARNES
               We're all very proud of you, Harry,
               but what the hell is it?

                         TED
               Maybe it's a message?

                         EDMUNDS
               From what?

                         TED
               The sphere.  Maybe the sphere --

                         EDMUNDS
               We're not hooked up to the sphere.

                         HARRY
               Well, if it's a discharge --

                         TED
               It's not a discharge.  Right,
               Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So
               it's gotta be a message.

                         BARNES
               From the sphere?

                         TED
               What's inside the sphere.

                         HARRY
               If it is a message, it's probably a
               substitution code.  I'll work on it.

                         TED
               Yeah, I'll work on it, too.

                         BARNES

               You do that.

               He's manic, Norman.  You know that?
               This reliance on Harry is misplaced.
               You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's
               overlooking things.  Obvious things.

                         NORMAN
               Like what?

     Ted hands him a printout... 

                         TED
               It's not some fucking substitution
               code, it's a direct visual
               representation.

                         NORMAN
               You mean a picture?

                         TED
               Take a look.  I rearranged the

               Go ahead.  Squint at it.

                         NORMAN

               This is like nursery school.

                         TED
               Don't you see it?  It's a picture of
               the creature.

                         NORMAN
               The creature?

                         TED
               Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the
               vertical torso, three legs, two
               arms.  There's no head, so I'm
               guessing the creature's head is
               located within the torso itself, you
               know?

     ON NORMAN -- Ted's lost it.

                         NORMAN
               Well, how about we wait and see what
               Harry comes up with?

                         TED
               Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy.
               That pretentious son of a bitch.  You
               heard him, Norman.  All that "someone
               went to a lot of trouble, try again"
               bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does
               he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's
               a fucking self-righteous, little
               prick.

     CLOSE ON MONITOR -- spirals now.

                         HARRY
               ... I asked myself, why would the
               sphere be using a code?  If you're
               trying to communicate, why use a
               code?

                         TED
                    (to Norman)
               See?  No code.  What'd I say?

                         HARRY
               Codes are for hiding information.  So
               it's making a mistake.  It's making a
               code without intending to.  I figured
               it's probably substituting numbers
               for letters...  Then I began to wonder
               what an alien intelligence would
               make of our keyboard.  And since
               we're getting spirals, I imagined
               the keyboard as a spiral.  So I
               translated it... 

                         NORMAN
               That's brilliant.

     Ted grimaces at Norman.

                         HARRY
               ... spiralling out of the center, you
               see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is
               three, and so on... when I got the
               message.

                         BARNES
               What's the message?

                         HARRY
               I have to tell you.  It's strange.

                         BARNES
               How do you mean, strange?

     Harry picks up his yellow pad of paper and reads:

                         HARRY
               "Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What
               is your name?  My name is Jerry."

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  HALLWAY

     Barnes walks briskly down the hall, Norman with him... 

                         BARNES
               He translated it wrong.  "My name is
               Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."

                         NORMAN
               The message doesn't show a lack of
               intelligence.  It's smart.  It's
               approaching us in a simple way.  Like
               you would a dog.  Holding out your
               hand, letting it sniff, get used to
               you.

                         BARNES
               What am I -- a dog, now?

     Barnes ducks his head into the Video Feed room... 

                         BARNES
               Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for
               this.

               In a minute, sir.

     Barnes storming through the room, the others (minus Edmunds) around
     the monitor.

                         BARNES
               I want a name.  A real name.  This
               thing's full name, rank and serial
               number.

                         TED
               Captain, I personally feel we should
               ask much more substantive
               questions --

                         BARNES
               I am not gonna explain in some damn
               report that one person died in a
               deepsat expedition so we could meet
               an alien named Jerry.

                    (on the keyboard,
                    typing)
               First, we have to see if he'll talk
               at all.

     The monitor BLINKS, reply:

                         HARRY

                         TED
               Give him a chance.  He's speaking our
               language, not the other way around.

               It's not ignorant.

                         TED

               Mexico?  Where'd he get Mexico?

               He's saying, "Take me to your

               I'm in charge.

                         NORMAN
               That's smart.  Let's talk about guns
               and violence.

                         BARNES

               important?

                         NORMAN
               I think we should be careful.
               Consider his emotional response.

                         TED
               You want to put him on your couch,
               Norman.  Grill him about his
               childhood?

                         NORMAN
               When he uses a phrase like "I am
               Happy", I think we should think
               twice about what we ask him.

     "Do Not Be Afraid"

                         NORMAN
               We would like to talk alone.

     "I do not agree.  That is not possible.  I enjoy to talk with you."

                         NORMAN
               And we enjoy talking with you.

     "Let us talk now"

                         NORMAN
               We'd like to talk with you more.  We
               admire your talents and your great
               power and understanding.

     "Thank you"

                         NORMAN
               And in your great understanding, you
               know that we are entities who must
               talk in private -- with each other.

     "Do Not Be Afraid"

                         NORMAN
               We're not afraid, we are
               uncomfortable.

     "Am I offended you?"

                         NORMAN
               Not at all, we enjoy you very much,
               but we need to talk alone, without
               you listening.

     "I shall oblige"

                         NORMAN
               Thank you.

               Edmunds?

                         NORMAN
               Because if Jerry is powerful and
               also emotional... 

                         BARNES
               Damn it, Edmunds?

                         NORMAN
               ... it raises a very serious
               question: What happens if Jerry
               gets mad?

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               Edmunds?  Can you copy?

     An empty chair.  Edmunds is not here.  WE HEAR a repeating THUMP.  THUMP.
     THUMP.

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               Edmunds?

     ON A MONITOR -- WE SEE her body, wedged in a light stand bracket,
     floating in the water, lifeless.  Her helmet THUMPING against the wall
     of the habitat.

     INT.  UNDERWATER -- OUTSIDE THE HABITAT

     Norman and Beth, in jumpsuits and helmets, walk out from under the
     habitat.  Still HEARING the THUMPING.  They pause, looking around.

                         BETH
               Coast is clear.

     They go to the south end of the habitat.  The THUMPING louder.

     Norman climbs up the grid-like STANCHION, the support beam holding up
     the habitat.  The BODY above him -- flapping in the current.  THUMPING
     against the wall.

     He climbs, reaching the body.  A BOOT swings, catches the LOOP in his
     air hose.  BUBBLES shoot out.

                         BETH
               Norman, your suit -- it's leaking.

     The BOOT comes off in Norman's hand -- and the NAKED FOOT, gray flesh,
     purple toenails, KICKS his faceplate.  Startles him.

                         BETH
               Norman.  Look at this.

     ON EDMUNDS' SUIT -- a long TEAR in the fabric, revealing red, mangled
     FLESH.  Droplets of BLOOD float past Norman's faceplate.

                         BETH
               Her flesh has been macerated.
               Chewed.  I've never seen a bite like
               this before.

     Norman pulls her body out.

     Edmunds' FACEPLATE whips around -- and Norman SEES her staring eyes,
     mouth open in horror.

                         NORMAN
               I can't feel her bones.  She's like a
               sponge.

                         BETH
               She was crushed.  Feel her skin --
               it's like sandpaper.

                         NORMAN
               What could have done this?

     WE HEAR A SENSOR: PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Barnes at the monitors, Ted with him.

     PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

                         TED
               What is that?

                         BARNES
               The sensors are picking up something
               outside.

                         TED
               What?

     Barnes flips a switch... 

                         BARNES
               It won't register.  It's too big to
               image.

                         TED
               Too big?

     EXT.  UNDERWATER

     WHITE EGGS, the size of golf balls descend from above.  Hundreds of
     them.  Beth catches one, inspects it... 

                         BETH
               Norman.

                         NORMAN

                         BETH
               Eggs.

     From inside their helmets... 

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               You people need to hurry back.  The
               sensors have activated.  I don't
               think you're alone out there.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Ted walks with Norman and Beth... 

                         NORMAN
               What was it?

                         TED
               Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a
               reading.

                         NORMAN
               Has Harry spoken with Jerry?

                         TED
               Not that I know of.  Why?

     INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

     Norman and Ted at the console... 

                         NORMAN
               Jerry?

     No reply.

                         NORMAN
               Jerry, are you there?

     No reply.

                         TED
               You think Jerry has something to do
               with what killed Edmunds?  With
               what's out there?

                         NORMAN
               I'm not sure.

     INT.  LABRATORY

     CLOSE ON AN EGG

     Beth, scalpel in hand, is making an incision into the shell.

                         BETH
               Looking at the coating here, it's
               definitely marine invertebrate.

     Barnes, Norman, Harry and Ted stand around the table.

                         BARNES
               Well, until we know exactly what it
               is, nobody goes outside, understood?

                         TED
               What was Edmunds doing outside?

                         BARNES
               Resetting the sub.

                         TED
               What sub?

                         BARNES
               In the dome hanger.  All our tapes
               are transferred to the sub.  It's on
               a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't
               reset the "delay" button, the sub
               ascends to the surface with the
               tapes.

                         NORMAN
               What for?

                         BARNES
               If something should happen to us,
               the Navy will at least have partial
               records of what happened.

                         NORMAN
               At least our obituaries will be
               accurate.  That's reassuring.

     ON THE EGG -- splitting open.  A slimy pinkish-brown FLUID oozes out.  A
     FETUS underneath.

     They cover their mouths from the smell.

                         BARNES
               What is it?

     Beth picks at it with forceps... 

                         BETH
               I'm not sure.  I've never seen
               anything like it.

                         BARNES
               You're a fucking biochemist, aren't
               you?  Can't you tell us something.

     Beth glares at Barnes... 

     INT.  CLOSET AREA -- DARK

     Beth, holding a piece of paper in her hand, pulls Norman inside,
     pressing on him... 

                         BETH
               ... He lied to us.  He left us down
               here.

                         NORMAN
               C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this
               personal.  He told me himself they
               were taking us back.

                         BETH
               Yeah, he told you.  Think.  What was
               Barnes doing before they cut that
               cable loose?  He was on the phone.
               Except that cable is a thousand feet
               long, Norman.  They would've broken
               off communication with us four, five
               minutes before they cleared out.

                         NORMAN
               So what?

                         BETH
               So who was Barnes talking to at the
               last minute?  Nobody.

                         NORMAN
               You're jumping to conclusions, Beth.
               Don't get worked up --

                         BETH
               Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here... 

     She shows him the printout in her hand, putting a flashlight on the
     words, reads... 

                         BETH
               "Although advised of risks, all
               personnel elect to remain down for

                         NORMAN
               Where did you get this?

                         BETH
               In Edmunds' things.

                         NORMAN
               You went through Edmunds' things?

                         BETH
               He's not just a Navy captain -- he
               works for the fucking Pentagon.

                         NORMAN
               Calm down, Beth.  Alright?

                         BETH
               Don't tell me to calm down!

                         NORMAN
               It's done, alright?  It's over!  And
               there's not a damn thing we can do
               about it now, okay?

     He turns to leave... 

                         BETH
               You said something to him, didn't
               you?

                         NORMAN
               What?

                         BETH
               You told him about me?

     ON NORMAN -- pausing, staring at her... 

                         NORMAN
               Beth --

                         BETH
               You did, didn't you?

                         NORMAN
               Don't do this.

                         BETH
               You bastard.

                         NORMAN
               Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together.
               Alright?

     She looks at him, piercing into his eyes... 

                         BETH
               Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.

                         NORMAN
               Beth --

                         BETH
               No, I should stay calm.  Like you
               say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.

     Norman looks at her, concerned, knowing she doesn't believe him... 

                         BETH
               Fletcher and Edmunds are dead,
               Norman.  And the only one we can
               trust to run this place is a fucking
               liar.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Barnes, Norman, Beth, and Ted are gathered around the monitors.  Barnes
     addresses Norman... 

                         BARNES
               I don't want you talking to Jerry.

                         NORMAN
               But sir, I think it's imperative.  I
               think the messages, the animals
               we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the
               reading you got earlier -- I think
               they're all related.

                         TED
               Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said
               earlier -- we were his friends --

                         NORMAN
               Of course he did.  He's been isloated
               for 400 years.  He wants someone to
               talk to.  Look, you put a human being
               in isolation for four days, they can
               become neurotic, sometimes
               psychotic.  We're talking about 400
               years here.  An alien that shows
               emotional responses.  I think we need
               to address him, before he reacts
               further.

                         BARNES
               You think he killed Edmunds?

                         NORMAN
               Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I
               think is his response to us refusing
               to talk to him earlier.

                         BARNES
               Bullshit.  What's out there isn't
               alien.  It's an animal.

                         NORMAN
               Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask
               Jerry about it.

                         BARNES
               No.  I think we should shut down the
               communication lines inside the
               habitat.  He might be listening now.

                         BETH
               I think he already is.

     They turn to the monitors:

     ON THE MONITOR: "DO NOT IGNORE ME"

               Nice work, Captain sir.

                         BARNES
               Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear
               it.

                         NORMAN
               Jerry, we don't want to ignore you.

     "Don't underestimate my power"

                         NORMAN

                         BARNES
               We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The
               only defense we have is High
               Voltage.

                         BETH
               High Voltage?

                         BARNES
               It sends 200 volts throughout the
               cylinder surface.  But we've never
               used it underwater before.

     PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

                         BARNES
               Forty yards.

                         BETH
               But you've tested it?

                         BARNES
               Sure.  Each time it started fires
               inside the habitat.

     PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

                         BARNES
               Thirty yards.

                         BETH
               What are you saying -- we can't stop
               what's out there?

     THE MONITORS blink: "I AM COMING".  The monitor blinks to BLANK.

                         BARNES
               What the hell?
                    (bangs on the monitors)
               It shut us down.

                         NORMAN
               Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.

                         BARNES
               Ted, go into the control room.
               Listen for my instructions.

     Ted goes out the door.

     ALL THE MONITORS -- blank.

                         BETH
               Where is it?

                         BARNES
               Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is
               going on here?

     They HEAR a metallic CLANKING.

                         BETH
               What was that?

                         BARNES
               He's right beneath us.

     THE MONITORS blink: "I AM HERE".

     INT.  LABRATORY

     Harry looking at the FETUS on the table.  It suddenly SLIDES down the
     table.

     The room is rocked.

     ON SHELVES -- Jars, petry dishes, test tubes SLIDE off shattering to
     the floor.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     BANG!

     TED is thrown ruthlessly against the wall.  His HEAD striking metal,
     splitting open his forehead.

     THE WALLS -- CRACKING and GROANING.

     WATER breaks through a crack, spreading out onto the floor.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Blood dripping from his forehead.

               That's our reserve air.

                         BARNES
               It's either that or we grow gills.

     BANG!  They grip onto the console... 

     INT.  CONTROL ROOM

     Ted, drousy, BLOOD gushing from his head, keeping balance, searches
     for the PRESSURE GAGE.

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               Ted?  Ted, are you with me?

     Finds the GAGE.  Turns it.

                         TED
               Increasing positive pressure.

     EXT.  HABITAT -- UNDERWATER

     AIR BUBBLES burst out of the walls.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     ON THE FLOOR -- the WATER scurrying back through the leaks in the wall.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Barnes, watching the monitors.

                         BARNES
               That's enough Ted.

               Shut it off!

     INT.  CONTROL RROM

     THE PRESSURE GAGE -- the needle RISING... 

     ON THE HEADSET -- in the air, dangling from it's cord.

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               Ted?  Ted!

     ON TED -- passed out on the floor.  Blood covering his face.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Beth and Norman BOLT out the door

     INTO THE HALLWAY

     Running.  BANG!  They're thrown against the wall.

     INT.  CONTROL ROOM

     THE PRESSURE GAUGE -- rising, higher, higher.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     THUMP!  Norman and Beth, losing their balance, stumbling to their
     feet, running... 

     ON TED -- SLIDING out of the Control Room, down the corridor, taken by
     the water.

     Beth grabs him, as Norman stumbles

     INTO THE CONTROL ROOM

     finds the PRESSURE GAGE, shuts it off.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     BANG!  Barnes grips his headset as he's thrown to the floor.

                         BARNES
               Norman!  Norman can you hear me?

     INT.  CONTROL ROOM

     Norman grabs the headset, slips it on... 

                         NORMAN
               Yes, sir.  I'm here.

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               You see the lever on the green box?
               Upper right hand corner?

     Norman sees it, reads it:

                         NORMAN
               High Voltage Defense System.

     ON BETH -- in the hall, tending to Ted, looks up at Norman.

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               Do you see it?

     ON NORMAN -- turning from Beth, to the lever.

                         NORMAN
               I see it.

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               Pull it.

                         BETH
               Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a
               fire we can't stop.  Norman?

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               Do it, Norman, it's the only choice
               we have.  This thing is gonna crush
               us.

                         BETH
               Norman, don't do it!

     BANG!  The WALLS CREAKING and SCREECHING.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Barnes on the floor, a MONITOR crashes alongside him, SPITTING SPARKS,

               Norman!

     He PULLS the lever.

     INT.  HABITAT

     DOWN THE CORRIDORS -- a loud HUM from the generators.  The lights
     DIMMING.

     BANG!  WE HEAR what seems to be a SQUEAL, as the metal RENDS and
     CREAKS.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     An ALARM SOUNDS.

     Barnes looks up... 

     THE WARNING BOARD lights up.

                         BARNES
               Fire in Communications Room!

     INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

     FIRE ROARS out from the walls... 

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     CLOSE ON FIRE EXTINGUISHER CASE -- Beth whips it open, grabs it.

     ON NORMAN -- picking up Ted, lugging him awkwardly over his shoulder.

     ON BARNES -- running down the corridor towards them.

     BANG!  Barnes falls to the floor, taken away by the water.

                                                            CUT TO:

     ANOTHER CASE ON THE WALL -- whips open -- Beth grabs GAS MASKS.  She
     hears... 

                         BARNES (O.S.)
               Help!

     She looks DOWN THE CORRIDOR at... 

     BARNES -- on the floor, flailing in the water, SCREAMING, as his legs
     are caught in a CRACK in the wall.  Desperate... 

                         BARNES
               Beth!  Help, I can't -- !

     ON BETH -- staring at him.  Just watching him.  Not moving.

                         BARNES
               Beth!

     BARNES -- his body falling through the crack, his HEAD BANGS into the
     wall, stuck in the crack, water choking him... 

                         BARNES
               Be--

     ... trying to SCREAM, his NECK RIPPING, SNAPS, and his body vanishes
     into the ocean.

     ON BETH -- cold, turns away.

     INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

     FIRE blasts out from the wall... 

     BETH and NORMAN (still with Ted) wearing GAS MASKS, RUSH into the
     room... 

                         BETH
               Stay low!

     Beth sprays WHITE FOAM on the fierce FLAMES, licking up the side
     padding, smoke boils to the cieling.

     BANG!  The room is rocked.

                         NORMAN
               It won't stop.

     Norman falls to the floor, losing Ted.

     TED -- SLIDES away and UNDER the computer CONSOLE.

     BANG!  The computer CONSOLE breaks -- COMPUTERS, MONITORS, fall,
     CRUSHING on Ted's legs.  He SCREAMS out in agony.

     NORMAN scrambles towards him through the smoke when... 

     THE CONSOLE catches fire, erupts in flame.  Ted underneath it.

     BETH -- her extinguisher out of foam.

     NORMAN -- runs to a wall, finds an EXTINGUISHER CASING, it's been bent,
     can't get it open.

     TED -- reaches out in desperation as his LEGS catch fire.

                         TED
               Norman!

     NORMAN -- BASHES the casing in with his shoulder, grabs the
     extinguisher, turns... 

     TED -- his entire body on fire.

     BANG!  Norman falls, dropping the extinguisher -- it rolls across the
     floor.  He reaches out -- can't get it.

     CLOSE ON TED -- his face burning... 

                         TED
               Norman!  Nor--

     BANG!  The lights go out.

     DARKNESS

     NORMAN -- watches in horror as he watches TED, lit in flame, burning to
     death.

     NORMAN -- reaches for the wall for balance, grabs METAL, and he's
     ELECTRICUTED.  Falls backward, head first, and EVERYTHING GOES... 

     BLACK

     A long beat.

                         NAVY SEAMAN (O.S.)
               Dr. Johnson?  Dr. Johnson?

     INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

     WE FOCUS in on Norman, as he awakens.  NAVY SEAMAN, 40s, African-
     American, standing above him.

                         NAVY SEAMAN
               Norman Johnson.

                         NORMAN
               Does this mean what I think it
               means?

                         NAVY SEAMAN
               It's over, sir, The storm has
               cleared.

                         NORMAN
               The ships?

                         NAVY SEAMAN (O.S.)
               They're topside.  We're ready to take
               you home, sir.

     The Navy Seaman helps Norman to his feet.  Norman is smiling, it's
     over.

     INT.  HALLWAY

     Norman and the Navy Seaman walk down the hall.

                         NORMAN
               How are the others?

                         NAVY SEAMAN
               The others, sir?

                         NORMAN
               Beth and Harry?

                         NAVY SEAMAN
               They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.

     Norman sighs, smiling.  The relief, the jubilation.

                         NORMAN
               That whole time -- I couldn't stop
               thinking of what Harry was saying
               earlier... 

                         NAVY SEAMAN
               What was that, sir?

                         NORMAN
               About the time paradox.
                    (the Seaman nodding)
               How we were all going to die --
               that there was no way we would make
               it out of here alive --

     As Norman looks up, the Navy Seaman, still walking and nodding, begins
     to slowly DISAPPEAR.  Disintigrating.  VANISHING before his eyes.

     Norman stops, looks around him.  He's gone.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Norman watches on a monitor -- the VIDEO of him walking down the hall,
     the Navy Seaman walking next to him.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)
               ... how we were all going to die --
               that there was no way we would make
               it out of here alive --

     ON THE MONITOR -- the Seaman disappers.

     Norman stops tape.  Looks over at the MONITOR showing the SPHERE.  It is
     closed.

     THE SCREEN goes BLACK.  Flashes up: "Hello Norman"

                         NORMAN
               Jerry?

     "Yes Norman"

                         NORMAN
               Jerry, did you create that man?

     "The entity Navy Seaman was a Manifestation.  Did you have a Happy
     talk?"

                         NORMAN
               Jerry, are you manifesting what's
               destroying our habitat?

     "Did you have a Happy talk?"

                         NORMAN
               Jerry, answer me.

     "No."

                         NORMAN
               Jerry?

     A beat.

     "Stop calling me Jerry"

     The MONITOR shuts off.

     Norman looks over at ANOTHER MONITOR labled "AIRLOCK FEED".

     ON THE SCREEN -- Beth is putting on her jumpsuit.

     INT.  AIRLOCK

     REFLECTED IN THE POOL OF WATER -- WE SEE Beth, slipping on her boots.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)
               Where are you going in such a hurry?

                         BETH
               I have to reset the sub.

     Norman stands in the doorway... 

                         NORMAN
               Forget the sub.

                         BETH
               Don't bother me, Norman.

                         NORMAN
               It's not worth the risk.

                         BETH
               It's also our only way out of here!
               It holds three people.  And there's
               only three of us left now.

                         NORMAN
               You, me and Harry?

                         BETH
               You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.

                         NORMAN
               Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get
               outta --

                         BETH
               We can't.  The storm.  The waves would
               toss us around worse than we got
               down here.  And we have four days of
               decompression when we get up top.

                         NORMAN
               Four days?

                         BETH
               Get the helium out of our
               bloodstream.  We go to the surface
               now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.

     She begins to put on her helmet, when she stops.

                         BETH
               Maybe you should go.  To the sub.

                         NORMAN
               Why should I go?

                         BETH
               You should know how it works.  Just
               in case.

                         NORMAN
               In case you die, too?

                         BETH
               I don't trust Harry to do it.

                         NORMAN
               I would.  But my suit --

                         BETH
               I fixed your suit.

     She goes to it.  Brings it to him.

                         NORMAN
                    (watching her closely)
               You fixed my suit?

                         BETH
               You don't trust me?

                         NORMAN
               But I don't know how --

                         BETH
               You press a button, Norman.  It's not
               brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You
               only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go
               on, Norman... 

     She hands him a BRIEFCASE, the tapes inside.

                         BETH
               ... I'll watch the sensors for you.

     EXT.  UNDERWATER

     Norman drops to the bottom with the BRIEFCASE.  Lands on the ground.
     BREATHING.  Checks his LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.  She must've fixed it.

                         BETH
               You're clear, Norman.

     He walks along, out from under the habitat.  Carefully, looking around.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               The sub's a 100 feet in front of
               you.  You see it?

                         NORMAN
               I can't see anything.  How does it
               look?  Still clear?

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Still clear.

     Norman, hesitantly, ventures out.  The DARK WATER.  Looking around.
     Anything could be out here.  Walking.  WE HEAR him BREATHING.  His
     BREATHING gets shorter.  He looks at his LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               What's the matter?

                         NORMAN
               You fixed this suit?
                    (no reply)
               Beth?

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just
               nervous.

                         NORMAN
               My air isn't... I'm coming back.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes.
               You don't have time.

     His BREATHING is short, but managable.  He continues on.

     AHEAD OF HIM -- the DOME HANGER attached to a large, gray cylinder,
     forty feet high.

                         NORMAN
               Still clear?

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Still clear.

     UNDERNEATH THE DOME HANGER -- Norman climbs up to the hatch DOOR.  Looks
     below him.  Nothing around him.  He SPINS the wheel, and pushes the
     HATCH OPEN.  Lifts himself up, awkwardly.  Grabs HANDHOLDS, and PULLS
     himself up into the POCKET OF AIR trapped inside the dome.

     THE SUB -- in front of him.  He finds the hatch, opens it, climbs inside
     the sub.

     INT.  SUB

     Norman sits in the small seat.

                         NORMAN
               I'm in.
                    (beat)
               Hello?

     No answer.  He bangs at his helmet... 

                         NORMAN
               Beth?

     He searches the sub's CONTROL PANEL.  Gadgets, switches, buttons.  Up
     top -- a flashing red-lit BUTTON: "TIMER HOLD".  Punches it.  It stops
     flashing, and a small screen glows: "TIMER RESET -- COUNT: 12:00:00".
     It begins counting backwards.

                         NORMAN
               Beth?  Hello?

     No answer.  He looks at the Control Panel:

     A VIDEO SCREEN with the choices: "DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE,
     SHUTDOWN... "

     THUMP!

     The sub slightly SWAYS.

     Norman sits still, nervous.

     THUMP!  Harder this time.

     Norman looks through the GLASS WINDSHIELD.  Sweating.  Can't see
     anything in here.

     BANG!  It SWAYS faster, harder, back and forth.  He grips the seat.

                         NORMAN
               Beth!  Beth!  There's something -- !

     THUMP!  BANG!  He's thrown around in the sub.  He can't see anything,
     tosses around.  He reaches for the doorhandle.

     BANG!  He looses grip, his legs fly up in the air.  The Sub almost turns
     over on it's side.

                         NORMAN
               Beth!  Shit!

     His HELMET BANGS into the glass, WE SEE his look of terror.  Water
     SPLASHING up from below.

     Then, EVERYTHING stops.

     The sub SWAYS to a still.  He sits quietly.  Waiting.  Listening.

     Reaches for the doorhandle, cautiously climbs out.

     Stands on top of the sub.  Keeping balance.  He looks around, finds a
     DOOR inside the dome.  Tries to open it.  Locked.

     Looks around.  Nothing else.  Looks down at the water.  Can he risk it?
     His BREATHING short.

                         NORMAN
               Beth?  Can you hear me?

     No reply.  He dips his leg slowly, quietly into the water.  Grimacing.
     Then, cautiously slips down into the water... 

     EXT.  UNDERWATER

     CLOSE ON HIS FACE -- terrified.  Looking everywhere.  Searching.  Doesn't
     see anything.  Lands on the bottom.

     His LIFE SUPPORT BADGE beeping.  Shortness of BREATH.

     He walks, trying to run, out from under the dome hanger.  The DARK
     WATER.  Can't see anything.  Scared to death.

                         NORMAN
               Beth?  Beth?  Shit.

     THE HABITAT -- ahead of him.

     Norman goes to a STANCHION.  Grips onto it.  Twists around.  Looking.
     Searching.  Doesn't see anything.  LIFE SUPPORT BADGE bleeping faster.
     Barely BREATHING.

                         HARRY (O.S.)
               ... you there?  Norman?

                         NORMAN
               Harry?

                         HARRY (O.S.)
               Norman, where are you?

                         NORMAN
               I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?

                         HARRY (O.S.)
               You're clear.  You see the airlock?

     Norman, twists around, and as he does... 

     A SEA SNAKE

     HISSES at his faceplate.  Norman SCREAMS.

     ON HIS HAND -- holding the snake, not the girder, lets go.

                         HARRY (O.S.)
               Norman!

     Norman falls... looking up: The SNAKE wrapped around the STANCHION,
     slithering between the grid-like posts.

     THE SNAKE'S HEAD comes at Norman, as he falls to the ocean bottom.
     Backpeddaling on his arms and feet.  THE SNAKE, HISSING, coming at him.
     It's long TONGUE flicking at him, inches from his faceplate.  Norman
     backpeddaling, can't BREATHE, the SNAKE coming down on him, Norman
     falls on his back, the TONGUE WHIPPING across his faceplate, when... 

     NORMAN is whisked up.

     HARRY has him by the collar of his suit.  Taking him up.

     INT.  AIRLOCK

     They burst out of the water.  Harry throws Norman onto the floor.
     Unhooks his helmet -- Norman BREATHES, fast and furious.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Norman, panting, walks with Harry... 

                         NORMAN
               Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she
               fixed it --

                         HARRY
               What happened to her?

                         NORMAN
               What do you mean?  She's not here?

                         HARRY
               When I woke up, nobody was here.

                         NORMAN
               She was supposed to be watching the
               sensor for me.

                         HARRY
               Her suit's gone.

                         NORMAN
               Beth left?

                         HARRY
               I thought she was with you.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Norman and Harry at the mic... 

                         BETH (O.S.)
               ... what do you mean?  I'm in the
               ship.

                         NORMAN
               What are you doing in the ship?
                    (beat)
               Beth?

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Getting food.  We were out of food.
               what's wrong?  You sound mad.

                         NORMAN
               Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm
               facing death and someone deserts me.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take
               over for me.

                         NORMAN
               He what?

     Harry shakes his head: "no way".

                         BETH (O.S.)
               When he woke up, he said we were out
               of food.  He told me to get some from
               the ship.

                         HARRY
               I never said that.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't
               leave you out there.  You know that.

                         HARRY
               We never even had a conversation,
               Norman.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood
               right there --

     Harry covers the mic... 

                         HARRY
               She's cracking, Norman.

                         NORMAN
               You didn't say that about the food?

                         HARRY
               I was just in the cafeteria, there's
               plenty of food in there.  Take a look
               for yourself.

                         NORMAN
               But why would she -- ?

                         HARRY
               She's lying, Norman.  Just like she
               lied about fixing your suit.

     Harry uncovers the mic... 

                         BETH (O.S.)
               You get it straightened out?

                         NORMAN
               I think so, Beth.  Yes.

     INT.  CAFETERIA

     Norman, sitting at a table, eating a couple pieces of cold chicken.

     A salad, some fruit, and boxes of crackers on the table.

     Beth walks in, carrying a bag of food.

                         BETH
               What's Harry doing with your suit in
               there?

                         NORMAN
               Fixing it.

                         BETH
               Fixing it?  But I fixed --
                    (notices the food)
               Where'd you get all that?

                         NORMAN
               The refridgerator.

                         BETH
               The refridgerator.

                         NORMAN	
               It's a pretty common place to look
               for food when you don't think you
               have any.

                         BETH
               That wasn't in there before.

                         NORMAN
               We must've had it delivered then.

                         BETH
               Wait a second --

                         NORMAN
               1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear
               they're good.

                         BETH
               None of this was here before.

                         NORMAN
               Did you look?  It was on the top
               shelf.

                         BETH
               No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this
               was here.  None of it.
                    (beat)
               You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He
               must've hid it.

                         NORMAN
               You think?

                         BETH
               You don't believe me.

                         NORMAN
               All I know is I opened that
               refridgerator --

                         BETH
               Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a
               whole conversation with the man when
               he woke up.

                         NORMAN
               This being after you so carefully
               fixed my suit.

                         BETH
               You think it's me?  You think I'm
               saying there was a conversation when
               there wasn't?

                         NORMAN
               I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.

                         BETH
               Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't
               you get it?  There is something
               seriously fucked up going on here --
               and he's causing it.  Why can't you
               believe me?

     TO HER LEFT -- she looks -- HARRY is standing in a doorway, cold,
     holding Norman's jumpsuit.  He turns away.

     ON BETH -- looking back at Norman, tears rolling down her eyes.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  AIRLOCK

     Harry neatly hangs Norman's jumpsuit under the hook labled: "JOHNSON".
     Smoothens it out for him.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  CAFETERIA

     ON BETH -- sitting at a table, her face in her hands.

     ON NORMAN -- looking at her, as he closes a box of crackers.  Wraps
     cellophane over the chicken.  Walks with it over to the refridgerator.
     Opens it, placing the chicken inside... but he can't.

     INSIDE THE REFRIDGERATOR

     are BOOKS -- neatly lined up on each of the shelves.

     NORMAN -- backs away.  What the hell?

     Norman now looks at the CUPBOARDS.  Goes to them.

     INSIDE THE CUPBOARD

     Books, neatly stacked.

     Norman, panicking, opens each of the cupboards, all of them with
     BOOKS.

     All of the books are the same.  Entitled: "20,000 Leagues Under The Sea
     by Jules Verne."

     Norman looks over at Beth.

                         BETH
               What is it, Norman?  Norman?

     She comes to him.  He stands there, bewildered, scared, mind racing.

                         BETH
               Norman?

     Norman paces, frantic almost, running his hands through his hair,
     trying to think.  Stops.  Turns to Beth.

                         NORMAN
               Page 87.

                         BETH
               What?

                         NORMAN
               Page 87.  "I could never read that
               far."

     Norman quickly plucks a book from a shelf, turns pages, gets to page
     87.  Reads... 

                         NORMAN
               "Our fisherman frequently see some
               that are more than four feet long.
               Some skeletons of squids... 

                         BETH
               Squids?

                         NORMAN
               "... according to calculations of
               some naturalists, one of these
               animals, only six feet long, would
               have tentacles 27 feet long.  That
               would make a formidable monster."

     He looks up from the book, realizing something... 

                         BETH
               Norman?

     SNAPS the book closed.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

     CLOSE ON HARRY'S DUFFLEBAG -- Norman rifles through notebooks.  Turning

     TEARS off the first Jerry transmission.

     Beth, standing at the doorway, keeping watch down the hall.

                         BETH
               Norman, what is it?

     Norman grabs Harry's YELLOW PAD OF PAPER.

                                                            CUT TO:

     THEIR FEET -- scurrying through the water soaked corridor.

     Norman ushers her into the Control Room.  Looks around.  SHUTS the door.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  CONTROL ROOM

     Norman SCRIBBLES on the printout, glancing at the yellow pad of
     paper... 

                         NORMAN
               After the attack, a Navy guy woke me
               up -- I don't know -- I thought he
               was an illusion.  But I checked the
               tape, and Jerry said he manifested
               him.

                         BETH
               Manifested?

                         NORMAN
               Created.  Brought to life.  I don't
               know.  But at the end, Jerry said,
               "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --

     Norman stops, staring at the pad.

                         NORMAN
               He translated it wrong.

                         BETH
               What?

     Norman picks up the pad of paper, reads... 

                         NORMAN
               Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What
               is your name?...  My name is Harry.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Harry is walking towards the Living Quarters... 

                         NORMAN (O.S.)
               Remember when we first spoke to
               Jerry, Barnes kept asking for
               Jerry's real name?  But Harry never
               would?  He didn't because he was
               afraid the screen would say "Harry",
               instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking
               to an alien intelligence when we
               talked to Jerry, we were talking to
               Harry... or a part of Harry.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               What do you mean, a part of Harry?

     BACK IN -- CONTROL ROOM

                         NORMAN
               When did the messages start?  The
               animals outside start showing up?
               After Harry came out of the sphere.

                         BETH
               You think, in the sphere --

                         NORMAN
               He acquired some sort of power.  A
               power to manifest things.

                         BETH
               But how?

                         NORMAN
               I don't know.

                         BETH
               How can the sphere do that?

                         NORMAN
               I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the
               fucking alien that built the thing.
               But it can.  When Harry came out of
               the sphere, he mumbled something
               about page 87.  How he would never
               read that far -- he was too scared
               to.  Then you found the book,
               remember in your lab.  Then in the
               cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about
               a giant squid... 

                         BETH
               Which I told Barnes was attacking --

                         NORMAN
               It's his fear.  The squid.  He's
               manifesting his fears.  Making them
               real.

                         BETH
               But why is he doing it?

                         NORMAN
               He must not realize he is.  Like the
               Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping
               then.  He must've manifested his
               dream.

                         BETH
               His dream?  You can't control your
               dreams.  And you can't control your
               fears, can you?

                         NORMAN
                    (shaking his head)
               No.  I mean, we've always believed we
               can think anything we want without
               consequences.  You ever read the
               Bible?
                    (off her look)
               It talks about our sinful nature,
               you know?  I mean, we can think, and
               believe, and desire whatever we
               want, but there's a part of us -- a
               shadow side, as Jung called it --
               that can't be controlled.  It's evil.
               It's inside us.  It's what we are.

                                                            CUT TO:

     IN -- THE LIVING QUARTERS

     It's dark.  Harry lies on his bunk, asleep.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               And that's the part of Harry that's
               being manifested.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)
               Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part
               of him not even he can control.

     Harry opens his eyes, stares at us.

     WE BEGIN TO HEAR A LOW INSISTENT BEEPING... 

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     ON SCREEN -- a transmission comes across... 

     "CQX VDX MOP LKI... "

     Beth and Norman watch... 

                         NORMAN
               Looks like some sort of code.

                         BETH
               Why would Harry go back to using a
               code?

                         HARRY (O.S.)
               You mean Jerry, don't you?

     Harry leaning against the doorframe, enters the room.

                         BETH
               Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't
               I?

                         HARRY
               That's a hell of a mistake to make,
               Beth.

                         BETH
               I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.

                         HARRY
               Yeah, I don't know how you could
               make that confusion.

     Norman watching them... 

                         HARRY
               Wisconsin's your answer.

                         NORMAN
               Wisconsin?

                         HARRY
                    (off screen)
               Navy transmission.  They're sent from
               Wisconsin.

                         NORMAN
               How do we decode it?

                         HARRY
               Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it
               for you.

     THE SCREEN -- jumbling it's letters until finally... 

     "SURFACE SUPPORT VESSELS TO YOUR LOCATION ETA: 1600 HOURS.  END."

     Norman and Beth smile... 

                         NORMAN
               The cavalry is on it's way.

     THE SCREEN -- "16:00:00"... it begins decending in count.

                         BETH
               Just in time, too.

                         HARRY
               In time for what?

                         BETH
               What?

                         HARRY
               Just in time for what?

     Beth, nervous, tries to cover... 

                         BETH
               Our habitat, I mean.  This place
               can't handle another attack.

                         HARRY
               Another attack?

     A long beat, as Beth stares at Harry.

                         HARRY
               Why are you looking at me like that?

                         BETH
               Like what?  I'm not --

                         HARRY
               You're staring at me.

                         BETH
               No I'm not.  I'm not star--

                         HARRY
               Yes you are... 

     Harry looks at both of them, suspiciously... 

                         HARRY
               Did I miss something?  You two seemed
               to patch things up awfully fast.

     A tense beat.

                         NORMAN
               We just figured, you know, the three
               of us -- we need to... work together
               through this.

                         HARRY
               The three of us.

                         NORMAN
               That's right.

                         HARRY
                    (beat)
               Is that why the two of you went
               through my dufflebag?

     Norman glances at THE SCREEN behind Harry: "I WILL KILL YOU ALL."

     INT.  LABRATORY

     CLOSE ON THE MEDICAL CABINET -- WHIPPING open.

     Norman quickly digs through the medicines... 

                         NORMAN
               Diphenyl parlene.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Something for burns.

                         NORMAN
               Ephedrine hydrochloride.

     Beth at the computer, looking up the names... 

                         BETH
               It's for motion sickness.

                         NORMAN
               Valdomet.

                         BETH
               Ulcers.

                         NORMAN
               Sintag.

                         BETH
               A synthetic opium analogue.

                         NORMAN
               Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all
               we need.  To get him unconscious --
               put him under.

                         BETH
               Nothing about drowsiness.

                         NORMAN
               Tarazine?

                         BETH
               Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.

                         NORMAN
               Bingo.

                         BETH
               "... and may also cause bizarre
               halucinations".

     Norman throws it on the floor.  Picks another... 

                         NORMAN
               Riordan?

                         BETH
               Antihistamine.  For bites.

                         NORMAN
               Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?

                         BETH
               Antibiotic.

                         NORMAN
               Parasolutrine?

                         BETH
               How do you spell it?

                         NORMAN
               P-a-r-a-s-o... 

                         BETH
               It's a soporific.

                         NORMAN
               What's that?

                         BETH
               Causes sleep.

                         NORMAN
               It's like a sleeping pill?

                         BETH
               "... used as an anesthetic if given
               in combination with paracin
               trichloride... "

     Norman digs, finds paracin trichloride... 

                         NORMAN
               Here we go.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BETH -- mixing the medicines... 

                         NORMAN (O.S.)

                         NORMAN
               Three to six hours.

                         BETH
               I'll just boost the doses.

                         NORMAN
               What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?

                         BETH
               How fast does it take effect?

                         NORMAN
               Doesn't say.

                         BETH
               What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman?
               What if it takes an hour?  And he can
               fight it off?  We can't afford that.

     Beth goes to the cabinet, grabs another medicine.  Norman comes over as
     she adds it to the mix... 

                         NORMAN
               What is that?  What are you doing?
               What do you want to do -- kill him?

     A beat... 

                         BETH
               It's an idea.

                         NORMAN
               Beth --

                         BETH
               To be on the safe side.  I mean --

                         NORMAN
               You want to kill him?

                         BETH
               Look, it's either him or us, Norman.
               Another attack, and we go down with
               this place.

     She fills the LARGE SYRINGE with the clear liquid mix.

                         BETH
               You ever given an injection before.

                         NORMAN
               Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I

                         BETH
               Only lab rats.  Here.

     She hands him the syringe... 

                         BETH
               Give him the whole thing.  Hurry,
               before he wakes up.

     Norman looks at the syringe, like it's an assault rifle.

                         NORMAN
               Where do I stick it?

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

     Harry sleeps on his bunk.  The door to the room is closed.

     INT.  CAFETERIA

     Norman spirals down the stairway from the lab.  Hurrying through the
     dark cafeteria, the syringe at his side.

     INTO THE HALLWAY

     shuffling down the corridor, nervously.  Glancing at the syringe.

     ROUNDS A CORNER

     and SEES in front of the Living Quarters... 

     TWO AFRICAN-AMERICAN NAVY CREWMEN -- standing guard of the door.

     Norman stops, hides behind the wall.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  LABRATORY

     Norman comes in... 

                         NORMAN
               He's got Farrakahn's army standing
               guard.  What's plan B?

     Suddenly, BANG!  The room shakes.  Shelves fall.  Cabinet doors swing
     open.  Norman falls to the floor.

     THE COMPUTER MONITOR -- crashes down in front of his face.  It reads: "I
     WILL KILL YOU ALL"

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Norman and Beth running... 

                         BETH
               Harry!

     BANG!  Water shoots through the wall.  Gushing out onto the floor.  The
     walls CRACKING.

     ON HARRY -- running out of his room... 

                         HARRY
               What is it?

                         NORMAN
               You know what it is, Harry.

     BANG!  They lose their balance, still running... 

                         NORMAN
               It's the squid!  Stop it!

                         HARRY
               Stop what?  What are you -- ?

     BANG!  Another CRACK -- water gushing inside.

                         NORMAN
               You know damn well what.  You're
               doing it!

     Norman grabs Harry, pushes him up against the wall.

                         HARRY
               Doing what?  I'm not doing
               anything -- !

     Beth takes the syringe from her palm, and STABS Harry in the SHOULDER.

     HE SCREAMS IN HORRIFYING PAIN, FADING OVER INTO... 

     INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR

     Quiet now.

     INT.  CAFETERIA

     Norman and Beth sit at a table, sipping coffee.

                         NORMAN
               I'm sorry.

                         BETH
               For what?

                         NORMAN
               Not believing you.

                         BETH
               You're not sorry.  You're scared.
                    (beat)
               You're a psychologist, Norman.  You
               pride yourself on knowing when
               someone's lying to you, not telling
               you the truth.  And now you're scared
               ... because you're not sure you can
               tell anymore.

     ON NORMAN -- watching her, sizing her up.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM -- LATER

     ON HARRY -- lying on a STRETCHER in the corner, propped up with pillows
     and a blanket.  An IV in his arm.

     NORMAN -- at the console, stares at the MONITOR of the SPHERE.  A long
     beat.  His reflection staring back at him.  He slips on the headset... 

                         NORMAN
               Beth?

     INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

     The room is empty.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)
               Beth?

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Empty.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)
               Can you copy?

     INT.  AIRLOCK

     ON THE JUMPSUIT HANGERS -- the jumpsuit under the name "DR. BETH
     HALPERIN" is missing.

                         NORMAN (O.S.)
               Beth?

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Norman at the mic... 

                         BETH (O.S.)
               What is it, Norman?

                         NORMAN
               Where are you?

                         BETH (O.S.)
               In the sub.  Resetting the timer.
               Why?

     ON THE MONITOR -- Beth sitting in the sub.

                         NORMAN
               The sphere looks different.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               What do you mean, different?

                         NORMAN
               The grooves around the door --
               they've shifted.  And the pattern --
               the fluids -- they look darker now.

                         BETH (O.S.)
                    (beat)
               How's Harry?

     ON HARRY -- the IV in his arm.

                         NORMAN
               He's fine.

                                                            CUT TO:

     CLOSE ON A MONITOR: "12:30:00"... descending in count.

     Norman pouring himself more coffee, alone.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  AIRLOCK

     Beth's suit still gone.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Harry lying on the stretcher, still.

     Norman watching him from above, sipping his coffee.

     HEARS A SOFT BEEPING

     Norman goes to the console, sits.  Checks the monitors.  Looks around
     the console, not knowing what it is.

     A FLASHING LIGHT on the Sensor Board.  Norman still doesn't know what
     it means.

     THE MONITORS go blank.

                         NORMAN
               Beth --

     The MONITORS flash up: "I AM COMING."

     Norman spins around, goes to HARRY -- lying still.  Norman grabs
     Harry's wrist.  Checking pulse.

     Norman returns to the console, slips on the headset... 

                         NORMAN
               Beth?  Beth?  Can you hear me?  Get the
               hell out of there.

     THE MONITORS boot up again.  Norman looks at the SUB VIDEO MONITOR --
     the sub is gone from under the dome.

                         NORMAN
               Beth?
                    (beat)
               Beth?  Shit.

     No reply.  MORE BEEPING.  Panicking.  Bangs on the headset.

                         NORMAN
               Beth?  I'm getting some sort of
               reading.  There's something --

     He scans the MONITORS, looking for movement.  Anything.  They are all
     still.

     Norman turns to looks at Harry... 

     CLOSE ON HARRY'S FACE -- still.

     BACK ON -- NORMAN, sweating... 

                         NORMAN
               And whatever it is, it's not coming
               from Harry.

     Norman looks at the monitors:

     ON AN OUTSIDE CAMERA FEED -- a bright LIGHT blinds the SCREEN.  It's
     Beth in the sub, moving along the habitat.

     The Sub's CLAW ARMS carry large RED BOXES.  The lettering on the boxes
     isn't in focus.

     Norman squints at the MONITOR -- can't make it out.

                         NORMAN
               Beth?  What is that?  What are you
               doing?

     The Sub's CLAW ARMS drops one of the BOXES, plumping it softly on the
     muddy floor.

                         NORMAN
               Can you hear me?  Beth?  Can you copy?
               Get inside, there's something out
               there.

     ON ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub moves forward.  Churning up the sediment.
     It stops again, and releases another box.

     Norman BANGS on the headset.

                         NORMAN
               Damn it, Beth, I know you hear me.

     THE MONITORS blink: "I AM COMING FOR YOU"

     ON NORMAN -- breathing heavy.

                         NORMAN
               What the hell?

     ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub in view -- a closer view.  It releases it's
     last box.  Norman can read the lettering now: "CAUTION: TEVAC
     EXPLOSIVES"

                         NORMAN
               Beth?  C'mon.  What are you -- ?

     THE MONITORS flash: "I WILL KILL YOU"

                         NORMAN
               Oh shit.

     Norman WHIPS off his headset, bursts out of his seat, OPENS a CABINET.
     Searching for tapes.  Another cabinet.  Then another.

     A shelf labled: "SPHERE" -- all the tapes are gone.

                         NORMAN
               It's her.

     THE MONITORS flash: "I WILL KILL YOU"

     ON THE HEADSET -- resting on the console.  WE HEAR faintly... 

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Norman?  Norman?

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Norman pushes Harry and his IV down the corridor.  Hurrying.  An inch or
     two of water on the floor.

     INT.  LIVING QUARTERS

     CLOSE ON A METAL CASE -- labled: "Captain Harold Barnes."

     Norman BANGS it against the wall, trying to bust the LOCK.  BANGING.
     BANGING.  Breaks the lock.  Digs inside the case.

     Pulls out a GUN.

     INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR

     Norman pushing Harry and the IV stand.  Wheels him into... 

     BATHROOM/SINK AREA

     Norman stops.  Turns off the main lights.  The room goes dark.  The
     florescent LIGHT above the sinks stay on.

     Norman wheels Harry inside, places him by a wall.  Checks the IV.

     Norman goes to a STALL.  Steps inside.  Keeps the stall door open.  Can
     still see Harry about 10 feet away.

     Norman looks at the GUN.  COCKS it.  Pinches his finger.

                         NORMAN
               Ouch.

     He waits.  Listening.

     A FAINT HIGH-PITCHED HISSING SOUND

     Norman looks over at the sinks.

     A FAUCET is on.  Water HISSING faintly from it.

     Norman ignores it.  Waiting in the dark.  Listening.

     ON THE FAUCET -- the water running.

     ON NORMAN -- looking at it.  Can't ignore it.  Tries.  But can't.

     Norman walks quietly through the inch of water on the floor.

     OVER TO THE SINKS

     The light above them on.  Norman turns the faucet off.  The water stops.

     But the HISSING SOUND remains.

     Norman looks at the faucet, queerly.  Turns it back on.  Then off.

     The HISSING SOUND still there.  It isn't the water.

     Norman looks down at his feet... 

     THE FLOOR -- seems to be moving.  Something swimming in the water.

     CLOSE ON NORMAN'S PANTLEG -- a long, tubular SEA SNAKE slithers up
     inside his pantleg, HISSING.  His pants BULGING as the SNAKE slowly
     slides up past his knee.

     HISSING LOUDER

     As more SNAKES comes through the crack in the wall.

     NORMAN watches with horror in the mirror in front of him as the SNAKE
     slithers up to his groin, and across the inside of his shirt.

     Another SNAKE begins WRAPPING itself around the outside of Norman,
     sliding up around his neck.

     WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COME FROM DOWN THE HALL

     NORMAN, standing still, watches as more SNAKES crawl up his sides,
     slithering around his arms, his shoulders, his neck, under his chin,
     over his face.  Their forked tongues FLICKING and HISSING.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               What time is it, Norman?

     NORMAN looking in the MIRROR -- as Beth comes up behind him in her
     jumpsuit.

                         BETH
               Do you know the time?

     Norman GLARES at her in the mirror.  His body STIFF.

                         BETH
               I have to know the time of day,
               Norman.  Do you know?

     SNAKES covering his eyes, SLITHERING across his mouth.

                         NORMAN
                    (through his teeth)
               Your watch.

     A SNAKE flicking it's tongue at Norman's lips.  Trying to get inside
     his mouth.

                         BETH
               What was that?  I couldn't hear you.

                         NORMAN
               Your watch.

                         BETH
               Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.

     She looks at her watch.

                         BETH
               Splendid.

     She begins grabbing the SNAKES off of him, carefully dropping them to
     the ground.  SNAKES writhing in her hands, twisted around her wrists.
     Shakes them off.  Some drop in the sink.  She bends out of view -- and
     the SNAKE inside Norman's shirt, MOVES back down the way it came.

     Past his stomach, his groin.

     Norman HEAVES from his chest, VOMITS on the mirror... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  CAFETERIA

     CLOSE ON A POT -- pouring a white, milkish DRINK into a cup.

     Beth walks it over to Norman, sitting at a table, looking ill.

                         BETH
               Isotonic glucose supplement.

     Norman looks at the cup.

                         BETH
               Go ahead, drink it.

     Norman places the cup down.

                         BETH
               What's wrong, Norman?

                         NORMAN
               I'm feeling better.

                         BETH
               Are you?

     Beth takes a seat.  Stares at him.  A long beat.

                         BETH
               It's getting cold.

                         NORMAN
               You think I'd really drink that?

                         BETH
               You don't think I put something in
               it, do you?

                         NORMAN
               You put explosives around the
               habitat, I can't imagine what you'd
               put in a drink.

                         BETH
               I did do that, didn't I?

     A beat.  She picks up the drink, and begins sipping it.  Norman watches
     her.

                         NORMAN
               How do you feel about snakes?

                         BETH
               Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?

                         NORMAN
               You know what I mean.

                         BETH
               Am I afraid of them?  Not during the
               day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When
               the sun's out, they don't bite.
               Fortunately for you, I had on my
               watch.
                    (off cup)
               This is quite good.

                         NORMAN
               What are they doing down here?  In
               the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.

                         BETH
               You tell me.

                         NORMAN
               Do you fear them?

                         BETH
               Don't you?

                         NORMAN
               Are you manifesting them?

                         BETH
               If I was, then I would've had to
               have gone in the sphere, wouldn't
               I?

                         NORMAN
               Did you?

                         BETH
               What's the phrase -- "keeping up
               with the Joneses"?

                         NORMAN
               Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?

                         BETH
               Same reason I put explosives around
               the habitat.  For defense.  For the
               power.  To protect myself.

                         NORMAN
               Against what?  Harry's unconscious.
               He's not a threat.

                         BETH
               No, he isn't.

                         NORMAN
               He can't manifest.

                         BETH
               No, he can't.

                         NORMAN
               Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put
               out explosives?  Why manifest the
               snakes?

                         BETH
               You think I manifested the snakes?

                         NORMAN
               Someone did.

                         BETH
               Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me,
               Norman.
                    (beat)
               It was you.  You manifested the
               snakes.

     A long beat between them.

                         NORMAN
               Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.

                         BETH
               C'mon -- what?

                         NORMAN
               You're lying --

                         BETH
               Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you
               absolutely sure I'm lying?
                    (off his look)
               Then explain to me about the
               jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see
               jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear
               jellyfish.  You do.  They're your
               fear, aren't they?

                         NORMAN
               But --

                         BETH
               And the snakes?  You want to know
               about the snakes?  You saw one
               outside earlier, didn't you?  When
               you thought I had deserted you --
               you were terrified.

                         NORMAN
                    (realizing)
               That's when you went in the sphere.

                         BETH
               One lonely, terrifying sea snake.

                         NORMAN
               You manifested that, Beth.

                         BETH
               Did I?  Or was that you?
                    (beat)
               When you were hiding in the bathroom
               -- all conspiratorially like you were
               -- you became frightened, didn't
               you?  Terrified.  Like you were with
               the snake earlier -- and suddenly
               you have snakes slithering all over
               the floor.  You did that, Norman.

                         NORMAN
               You're insane.

                         BETH
               Am I?  Or am I making so much sense
               that you're going insane?

                         NORMAN
               I never went in that sphere.

                         BETH
               You don't remember you did.  But I'm
               sure you remember running like some
               fucking hero to get Harry, don't
               you?  You remember that.

                         NORMAN
               Yes.

                         BETH
               You remember before you picked him
               up -- when you looked up at the
               sphere, you remember that -- when
               the sphere opened?
                    (off his look)
               That's right.  But you can't remember
               going inside, can you?  No, of course
               not.  Harry couldn't either, could
               he?  "Like everything's on the tip of
               my tongue", he said.

                         NORMAN
               That's bullshit.

                         BETH
               Is it?

                         NORMAN
               Beth, the message said Harry.  "My
               name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.

                         BETH
               No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman.
               But your younger brother -- what was
               his name?  The one who was stung when
               you were younger.  The one that died.
               The one you couldn't save.  What was
               his name?
                    (imitating)
               "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean
               -- to go swimming." "But I don't
               want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm
               scared." "C'mon, Harry, it'll be
               fine, it'll be fun."
                    (resuming)
               You heartless fuck.  That's why
               you're so scared of the water, isn't
               it?

                         NORMAN
               Shut up, Beth --

                         BETH
               When you were in that sub -- and
               that squid was attacking you -- are
               you sure it was the squid that was
               attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get
               Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny
               sub on the bottom of the fucking
               ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all
               this water." Was it really the squid
               that was attacking you, Norman -- or
               was it something else -- one of your
               fears?  You never really saw what it
               was, did you?

     Norman stares up at her, frightened.  Is she right?

                         BETH
               I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I
               hope I'm not frightening you.  The
               last thing I want to do is frighten
               you.  You feel okay, don't you?

                         NORMAN
               It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't
               be.

                         BETH
               "It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It
               can't be.  I'm not doing anything."
               Just like Harry said before I
               stabbed him with the needle.

     Norman looks at her palm -- SEES the NEEDLE in her hand.  Norman backs
     up, away.

                         NORMAN
               Don't, Beth.

                         BETH
               But I have to, Norman.

                         NORMAN
               I promise --

                         BETH
               Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!

                         NORMAN
               Beth --

                         BETH
               You think I'd belive you?  Believe
               anything you might say now?  After
               you lied to me about telling Barnes
               about my past.  About my problems.  My
               problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.

                         NORMAN
               Don't, Beth.  Please.

                         BETH
               It's either this... or I kill you.

     The GUN in her other hand.

                         NORMAN
               Beth --

     She comes at him, needle in hand... 

                         BETH
               It's your choice.  Because it's not
               safe for you to be awake.  To be
               walking around.  To be thinking about
               things.

                         NORMAN
               It's not safe for you to be either.

                         BETH
               You think I care?  You think I care
               if I die?
                    (almost laughing)
               Would I put explosives around the
               habitat -- set on vibration sensors
               -- that can trigger automatically,
               if I cared about myself?  Would I?
               I've tried twice before, Norman, why
               wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not
               thinking about myself -- No, Norman,
               I'm thinking about you.  Your safety.
               Protecting you from your own self.

     She lunges at him with the needle, missing.  He RUNS for the SPIRAL
     STAIRCASE leading to the lab.  Norman grabs the handrail, begins
     climbing the stairs.

     Beth's at his feet, grabbing for his ankles.

                         BETH
               Norman!  I'm doing this for you,
               Norman.

     He frantically crawls up the stairs, her grasping at his heels.

                         BETH
               Norman.

     Climbing, climbing -- round and round -- the STAIRS never seem to end.
     He looks up:

     THE STAIRS -- expanding in front of him, strangely increasing in
     number.  He climbs, racing, PANTING.  Beth, right behind him, laughing
     almost.

                         BETH
               Come here, Norman.

     She GRABS his ANKLE.  She raises the NEEDLE.  Norman turns, KICKS her in
     the FACE.

     She WAILS, blood SPITTING from her nose.

     Climbing, climbing.  The STAIRS increasing above.  He LUNGES for the top
     step, GRABS it.  Pulls himself up... 

     INTO THE LAB

     Scrambling.  He stares down at Beth -- the GUN pointing at him.

                         BETH
               Norman --

     He SLAMS the HATCH DOOR, on top of her, BASHING her head down.  He
     holds the DOOR closed.  Trying to regain his breath.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               This is what I'm talking about,
               Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you.
               This vindictiveness.  This rage.

                         NORMAN
               Get away from the door, Beth.

     He slides a heavy FILE CABINET over on top of the door.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Oh, Norman, I don't want to come
               in... 

     The door's METAL PIVOT turns... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     ON BETH -- on the stairs, spinning the door's WHEEL... 

                         BETH
               ... I want to lock you in.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  LABRATORY

     Norman staring at the wheel.  CLICK!  It's locked from the outside.

     Norman falls to his knees.  PANTING.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  LABRATORY -- LATER

     CLOSE ON A SURVEILLANCE VIDEO CAMERA -- in the upper corner of the
     room.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               You're a psychologist, Norman.  You
               of all people, don't want to admit
               to your shadow side... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     ON A MONITOR -- WE SEE Norman -- sitting in a corner of the lab,
     staring up at US.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               ... You have a professional stake in
               believing in your own mental health,
               don't you?  Don't you, Norman?... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  LABRATORY

     Norman, huddled on the floor.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Of course you're going to deny it.
               You want to blame someone else.  You
               want to blame Beth.  Because you
               hate Beth.

                         NORMAN
               Don't fuck with me, Beth.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               I'm not fucking with you, Norman.
               You've fucked yourself.

     Norman JUMPS up, looks at the ground -- WATER on the floor.  Rising in
     level.

                         NORMAN
               Turn off the water, Beth.

     The entire floor is covered in water, rising higher, and rising fast.

                         NORMAN
               Beth!

                         BETH (O.S.)
               You're frightened, aren't you,
               Norman?

     Norman, WADING through the water, searching... 

                         NORMAN
               Where is it coming from, Beth?

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Don't you know?

     Rising higher... 

                         NORMAN
               Beth, stop it!

                         BETH
               Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not
               me.

     Norman frantically checking for a crack, a leak.

                         NORMAN
               Then where's it coming from?

                         BETH (O.S.)
               From you, Norman.  From your mind.
               You're doing it.

     It's up to his waist.  He climbs on top a lab bench.  Puts his hands to
     his temples, straining.  WE HEAR Beth laughing.

     A SPECIMEN BOTTLE -- EXPLODES right next to him.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               There's no ventalation in the room,
               Norman.  The pressure's going to kill
               you.

     Another BOTTLE SHATTERS, shooting fragments of glass across the room.

                         NORMAN
               Stop it!

                         BETH (O.S.)
               It's you, Norman.  Your fear of
               drowning.  You have to face it.

     Microscope lenses CRACK.  Bottles, Test Tubes, Dishes EXPOLDE.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               C'mon, Norman.  Let me put you under.
               Before you kill yourself!

     SHATTER!  CRACK!

     Bottles floating in the water POP!  The water too high -- Norman
     swimming in it now, keeping afloat.  His FACE strains from the
     pressure.  He looks at the CAMERA in the corner... 

                         BETH (O.S.)
               It's over, Norman.

     Next to the CAMERA, he SEES the HATCH DOOR in the ceiling.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Don't even think it.  You don't have
               your suit, Norman.  The water will
               freeze you.

     He reaches up at the door.  Can't get it.  The water rising.  He DIVES
     down in the water... 

     UNDERWATER

     He swims to a cabinet near the floor, OPENS it, searches, THINGS
     floating out -- AN OXYGEN CYLINDER and MASK -- he GRABS it.

                                                            CUT TO:

     NORMAN'S FACE -- bursts above water level, slips on the mask, BREATHES.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               It won't help, Norman.  Your body is
               boyant.  You're gonna shoot right to
               the surface and explode, Norman.
               Don't you get it?  It's over.

     He BREATHES a last breath, reaches up to the ceiling HATCH DOOR, SPINS
     it.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Norman, what are you doing!  You're
               insa--

     The DOOR opens and WATER gushes inside.  He grabs the frame of the
     door, and his body shoots up through the hole... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT.  OCEAN -- UNDERWATER

     His body upside down, his hand holding onto the frame.  He grabs a PIPE
     next to it, pulls himself hand over hand, along the pipe.

     HIS FACE -- straining from the freezing chill.

     MOVING along the pipe, hand over hand.  He loses grip.  His body thrusts
     upwards.

     CLOSE ON HIS RIGHT HAND -- purple, frozen, holding onto the pipe.
     Barely gripping.

     HIS FACE -- his eyes fluttering.  He blows air from his mouth, BUBBLES
     burst from his lips.

     HIS BODY slightly descending.

     HIS LEFT HAND -- grips the pipe.  He continues on.

     HAND OVER HAND.  Pulling himself... 

     UNDER THE HABITAT

     He SEES the airlock in front of him.

     He SCOOTS along, but slower, now.  He stops.  Can't continue.  He clasps
     his hand to his CHEST, it's burning.  He SEES the airlock.  His eyes
     fluttering, he's losing consciousness.  He can't do it.  And he lets go
     of the pipe.

     FLOATING UPWARDS -- is he gone?

     HIS HEAD -- BANGS into the habitat floor.  His body flat underneath it.
     Being sucked upwards against it.

     He pushes forward... trying to grab the floor with his hands.  He's
     inches from the airlock.

     Plants his feet against the wall -- and pushes forward.  His body
     SUCKED UP and away... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  AIRLOCK

     ... His head BURSTS above the water level, BIG BREATH.  GASPING.  He
     flails his arms over to the ladder.  Grips the ladder, but his hands
     are like ice.  Can't hold it.  He slips.

     Flailing in the water.

     He HEAVES his chest over the METAL RIM.  Twists his legs around, out of
     the water, and flops his body onto the deck.

     Shivering.

     Tries to get up.  Falls over.  His body shaking.  His lips purple.  His
     eyes barely open, looking at... 

     HIS JUMPSUIT -- hanging on the wall.

     Norman crawls toward the suit, his body shaking violently.  He reaches
     out for his boots on the floor.  Can't grip them.  Inches his HEAD
     toward his suit, tries to BITE at his suit, but his TEETH chattering.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               I know what you're doing, Norman.
               But you can't save yourself.

     He grips the wall, his hands pulling him up.  He RIPS his suit off the
     hanger.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               It's over, Norman.  It's all over.

     Slipping on his suit, he HEARS a MAN'S voice... 

                         MAN (O.S.)
               Your attention, please.  Your
               attention, please.  All construction
               personnel clear the blast area now.
               Tevac explosives are now activated.
               Countdown beginning.  Mark 15
               minutes, and counting.

     ON NORMAN -- as he slips on his helmet, his teeth -- chattering.

                                                            CUT TO:

     CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK HATCH DOOR -- Norman trying to open it.

                         BETH (O.S.)
                    (through Norman's
                    helmet)
               Locked.  Don't try, Norman.  You can't
               get in.  I won't let you in.

     Norman turns, dives back in the water.

                                                            CUT TO:

     UNDERWATER

     Norman swims out from under the habitat.  Looks around at the
     cylinders, the walls.

     Goes to the outside of a WALL.  Looking for a CRACK, a LEAK, a way in.

     TO HIS LEFT -- Barnes' body, floating, hooked to the wall.

     Norman goes to him.  SEES the CRACK.

     Climbing inside.  Struggling through the CRACK, careful not to rip his
     suit.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Flooded to the top with water.  Completely filled.  Norman emerges
     through the crack.  MOVES down the hall.

     A BOX OF CORN FLAKES

     floats by his faceplate.

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Norman, where are you?  I can't see
               you, Norman.  Tell me where you are.

     Norman pulls at the cylinder's HATCH DOOR.  He HEARS faintly through
     his helmet... 

                         MAN (O.S.)
               Twelve minutes, and counting.

     He OPENS the door.  Slips inside, the water going with him.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     BEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!

     A SCREEN -- flashes: "D CYLINDER HATCH DOOR -- OPEN"

     The CHAIR in front of the console -- spinning, empty.  Beth just left.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Norman closes the door.  Runs.  Down the corridor...

     Norman ducks inside.

     THE STRETCHER, the IV -- empty.  Harry's not there.

                         NORMAN
               Beth?  Can you hear me?
                    (no reply)
               Beth.

     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM

     Norman runs inside... 

     The chair, stopping it's spin.

     BEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!

     THE MONITOR -- flashes: "B CYLINDER -- DOOR OPEN".

     Norman's out the door.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Norman, running.  SEES the B Cylinder door.  Goes to it.  Spins it,
     OPENS.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  B CYLINDER

     Norman climbs inside, takes off his helmet.

     THE CYLINDER -- a maze of pipes and equipment.  Heaters, controls, and
     wires everywhere.  Difficult to see.

     THROUGH PIPES

     WE SEE NORMAN -- walking through the cylinder.  Holding his helmet at
     his hip.

                         NORMAN
               Beth?

                         BETH (O.S.)
               Leave me alone, Norman.

     He goes to her voice in the back.  Past pipes, equipment.

                         NORMAN
               I can't do that.

     ON BETH -- huddled in the back corner, wedged among pipes.  Her eyes
     red.  Holding the GUN in her hand.  Pointing at Norman as he SEES her
     through the pipes.

     ABOVER HER HEAD -- a computer SCREEN, reading: "DETONATION SEQUENCE
     09:32"... descending in count.

     Norman stares up at the SCREEN, concentrating.

                         BETH
               You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't
               fight me.

                         NORMAN
               I know.  You're too strong, Beth.

                         BETH
               Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman.
               Not now.

                         NORMAN
               I --

                         BETH
               Don't tell me about me.  I already
               know too much.

                         NORMAN
               Beth -- gimme the gun.

                         BETH
               Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth
               can get you?  Some more chicken,
               perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.

                         NORMAN
               C'mon --

                         BETH
               Top shelf, is it?

                         NORMAN
               Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's
               go home.

     She sees HER REFLECTION on a PIECE of BROKEN GLASS on the floor.  She
     puts her fingers to her matted hair, tries to comb it.

     Over the intercom... 

                         MAN (O.S.)
               Nine minutes, and counting.

                         NORMAN
               C'mon, Beth.

     ON THE GUN -- WE SEE Beth's wrists.  The two scars.

                         BETH
               It's over, Norman.  Go on, get outta
               here.

     Norman walks toward her.  Beth freaks... 

                         BETH
               What is that?  What are you doing?

                         NORMAN
               What?

                         BETH
               You hear that?

                         NORMAN
               Hear what?

                         BETH
               Get away from me!

                         NORMAN
               Beth --

                         BETH
               Get away --

     BAM!  From behind her -- Harry -- WHACKS Beth across the head with a
     WRENCH, sending her to the ground.

     Norman goes to her, checking her pulse.

                         HARRY
               Did I kill her?

                         NORMAN
               I don't think so.

                         HARRY
               I could hit her a little harder.
               More toward the cranium.

     Norman stares at the NUMBERS on the SCREEN above him.

                         HARRY
               If she's still conscious, you can't
               fight her.  You can't stop the
               numbers.

     Over the intercom... 

                         MAN (O.S.)
               Eight minutes and counting.

                         HARRY
               Killing her's the only way --

                         NORMAN
               Hey!  Look!  We didn't kill you,
               alright?  And believe me Harry, I
               would've found great pleasure in
               bashing your head in.

     Norman RIPS off a piece of her t-shirt, ties it to the wound around
     her head.

                         HARRY
               Fine.

                         NORMAN
               Help me lift her.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Norman, carrying Beth in his arms, races awkwardly down the hall... 

                         HARRY
               We're never gonna make it.

                         NORMAN
               Shut up and open the door.

     Harry does.

     INT.  AIRLOCK

     Harry, in his suit now, helps Norman slip on Beth's boots and
     jumpsuit.

                         HARRY
               How much time you figure to get to
               the surface?

                         NORMAN
               Two and a half minutes.  Once we're
               in the sub.

                         HARRY
               How far away's the sub?

                         MAN (O.S.)
               Six minutes and counting.

                         NORMAN
               A little less than six minutes.

     EXT.  UNDERWATER

     Norman carrying Beth on his back, hurries through the water.

                         MAN (O.S.)
               Five minutes.  I repeat five minutes
               to detonation.

     EXT.  UNDERWATER

     UNDERNEATH THE SUB'S DOME HANGER

     Norman tries to climb up the ladder with Beth on his back.  She falls
     off, deadweight to the ground.

                         NORMAN
               Shit.
                    (picking her up)
               Harry!  I'm gonna have to lift her up
               to you.

     Harry leans down from the Sub's airlock... 

                         HARRY
               Alright.  Hurry.

     Norman pushes her up to him, but she bends at the waist.

                         HARRY
               I can't reach her.

                         NORMAN
               Hold on.

     Norman flops her up in the air, but she bends again at the waist.

                         HARRY
               Push her, c'mon.

                         NORMAN
               I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.

     He flops her up again.

                         HARRY
               Missed.

                         NORMAN
               Are you trying, damn it?  Just --

                         MAN (O.S.)
               Four minutes and counting.

     Norman loses grip, drops her.

                         NORMAN
               Hold on.

                         HARRY
               Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.

                         NORMAN
               I heard!  I heard!

     Picking her up... 

                         HARRY
               Three fifty-six, three fifty-five,
               three --

                         NORMAN
               Shut up and catch.

     Norman flops her up once more, and Harry grabs her AIR HOSE.

                         HARRY
               I got her.  I got her.

     Harry pulls her toward the airlock, Norman climbs up after.

     INT.  SUB AIRLOCK

     The pocket of air around the sub.  The three of them crammed inside.
     Norman opens the door on top of the sub.

                         NORMAN
               Alright, here, I'll... wait, you --
               just give her to me.

     Norman takes Beth and pushes her on top the sub.  The sub sways back
     and forth.

                         HARRY
               Norman, what are you --

     They lose balance, Beth almost falls, Norman catches her.

                         NORMAN
               Shit.  Alright, Harry, get in there.

     Harry jumps on top of the sub.  Slides inside it.  Reaches his arms out,
     catching Beth's legs.

                         MAN (O.S.)
               Three minutes and counting... 

                         NORMAN
               Take her, come on.  Just --

     Beth's LEG swings up and hits Harry in the helmet.

                         HARRY
               C'mon, Norman!

                         NORMAN
               I'm trying to keep balance with --

                         HARRY
               Gimme a second --

                         NORMAN
               Just pull her -- down like inside --
               Harry, work with me here!

                         HARRY
               Her legs are in the way.

                         NORMAN
               You got her?

     Harry pulls Beth down inside, as Norman steps on top of the sub, helps
     push Beth's head inside.

                         NORMAN
               Get her out of the seat, I need room
               to sit.  Harry?

                         HARRY
               I'm trying.  There.

                         MAN (O.S.)
               Two minutes-thirty and counting.

     Norman drops inside.

     INT.  SUB

     Norman in the seat.  Beth's leg hangs over his right shoulder.  Harry
     looks at Norman who assesses the flight controls.

                         HARRY
               You know how to work this thing?

                         NORMAN
               No idea.

                         HARRY
               Well, press something!

                         NORMAN
               Wait!

                         MAN (O.S.)
               Two minutes and counting.

                         HARRY
               How long did you say --

                         NORMAN
               Shut up.  Let me think.

     Norman presses a button.

     THE SCREEN -- blinks: "DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE, SHUTDOWN... "

     Norman hits "ASCEND".  The Sub WHIRRS, RUMBLES and drops down below.

     Norman works the steering wheel, gliding it upwards.

     EXT.  UNDERWATER

     The SUB comes out from under the dome.  Rising above the habitat... 

                         HARRY
               Less than a minute, we're never
               gonna make it.

               Nine hundred feet to surface.

                         HARRY
               It's not fast enough, Norman.
               There's a helluva lot of explosive
               down there.

     The sub ascends past the spacecraft tail fin.

     INT.  SUB

     Harry looking down below him... 

                         MAN (O.S.)
               Thirty seconds to detonation.

                         HARRY
               The shock wave's gonna crush us,
               Norman.

                         NORMAN
               Maybe.  Brace yourself.

     Harry just stares at Norman.  Norman grabs Beth, trying to stablilize
     her.

                         HARRY
                    (off Norman's suit)
               How's that working out, by the way?

                         NORMAN
               Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it
               on.
                    (Harry laughs)
               Why are you laughing?  You don't even
               know what that means.

                         HARRY
               No.  I don't.  But I always said to
               myself, when I die, I want to die
               laughing.

     Harry laughs.

     Ascending... waiting... and then... 

     A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION below them... 

     Rocking the sub, spinning it up and around, surging it upwards to the
     surface.

     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- RACING toward the surface, toward the
     SUNLIGHT -- it's BLINDING -- and the screen GOES WHITE.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT.  DECOMPRESSION ROOM

     A pale, white room.

     ON NORMAN -- sleeping.  His eyes begin to open.  He awakes.

     BETH -- is next to him, looking at him.  There is a long beat.

                         BETH
               Thank you.

     Norman looks up at her... 

                         NORMAN
               You know, I think you really need to
               see a psychologist.

     She stares back at him, and smiles.  Begins laughing with him.

     EXT.  DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER

     TWO NAVY CREWMEN stand outside the door, looking in.

                         CREWMAN #1
               Has anyone spoken to them yet?

                         CREWMAN #2
                    (shakes his head)
               The Admiral's going over the tapes
               they brought up now.

                         CREWMAN #1
               Does he know yet what really
               happened down there?

     Looking INSIDE -- Norman, Harry, and Beth sit at a table.

     INT.  DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER

     At the table... 

                         HARRY
               They're going to want answers and
               they're going to keep asking until
               they get them.

                         BETH
               We can refuse to talk.

                         HARRY
               Won't make any difference.  The tapes
               document everything.

     A long beat.

                         NORMAN
               There is one possibility.

                         HARRY
               We all kill ourselves?
                    (laughing, then)
               Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.

     She smiles.

                         NORMAN
               The power allows us to manifest our
               fears, right?  What if we feared the
               power to go away?

                         HARRY
               You mean forget?

                         NORMAN
               It would erase all our knowledge of
               it.  All of our power.

                         BETH
               Would it work?

                         NORMAN
               Yes.  And I think we already know it
               will.

                         BETH
               How's that?

                         NORMAN
               Down below, Harry said we would all
               have to die.  Since there was no
               evidence on that spacecraft that
               anybody knew time travel through a
               black hole was possible -- and we
               all knew -- then we would all have
               to die before we could tell anyone.
               Death was the only logical
               explanation.  But sitting here, we
               still know.  So how is that possible?
                    (beat)
               Unless we make ourselves forget.

     INT.  SHIP'S HALLWAY -- LATER

     Norman, Harry, and Beth walk with the CREWMEN.

     INT.  ADMIRAL'S OFFICE

     The ADMIRAL, 60s, many stripes on his sleeves, sits behind his desk.
     Harry and Beth sit in front of him.  The TAPES on the desk.

                         ADMIRAL
               There are some questions that we
               need to address here.

                         HARRY
               What about?

                         ADMIRAL
               When you were being transferred to
               decompression, Dr. Adams, you
               mentioned something about a squid.

                         HARRY
               A what?

                         ADMIRAL
               A squid.  However, there doesn't seem
               to be any squid recorded on these
               tapes.

                         BETH
               A squid?  I don't remember anything
               about a squid.
                    (to Harry)
               Did you say something about a squid,
               Harry?

     Harry shakes his head.

     EXT.  SHIP DECK -- DAY

     A bright, sunny day.

     ON THE HELIPAD -- the helicopter's propeller begins whirling.

     INT.  HELICOPTER

     An OFFICER sits in the passenger's seat, glancing at a clipboard.

                         OFFICER
               You all ready to go, Dr... ?

     The PILOT from the opening scene... 

                         PILOT
               Johnson.  The psychologist.  The one
               that wrote the report.

     ON NORMAN -- in the back.

                         NORMAN
               What report?

                                                            CUT TO:

     BLACK.
