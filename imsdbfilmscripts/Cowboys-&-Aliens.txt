          SPACE. Infinite stars. A TITLE:

          1870. THE ARIZONA TERRITORY.
          We descend past DARK CLOUDS. Violent FLASHES ripple within.
          Thunder blends with DRUMS as we reach a BOX CANYON...

          A BONFIRE -- SILHOUETTED BODIES -- APACHE WARRIORS
          Whirling around the fire -- war paint -- masks and headdresses --
          a RELIGIOUS RITE or CELEBRATION. On the periphery, we FIND...
          A BEAUTIFUL APACHE WOMAN. Softly singing to the even more
          beautiful BABY in her arms as we FOLLOW THEM INTO --
          A TEEPEE. The simple melody of the woman's song as she lays the
          baby on a blanket, gently swaddling it, LOVE in her eyes.
          But.
          The wind starts to HOWL. QRAJ. And then... a BURST OF
          LIGHT through the opening of the teepee -- intense ULTRAVIOLET:
          FWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHss!!!

          THE E IRE TENT IS RIPPED UP INTO THE SKY, LEAVING THE WOMAN AND
          HER BABY-EXPOSED!!!! She SCREAMS -- grabs her child and starts
          to RUN -- CHAOS EVERYWHERE as the tribe scatters in TERROR --
          Suddenly -- Apaches are getting YANKED INTO THE AIR by some
          superior force -- PLUCKED savagely into the light, GONE -- as we
          WHIP AROUND the horror show of SCREAMING, DISAPPEARING INDIANS --
          And now -- A DEAFENING SHRIEK AS STRANGE DOMED OBJECTS HURTLE

          DOWN, CRASHING LIKE COMETS TO THE CANYON FLOOR AND CRUSHING

          FLEEING PEOPLE.
          Impossibly, the objects are STEEL MACHINES. BELLY VENTS snap
          open and DRILL CONES drop out -- jagged teeth CHURN TO LIFE --
          faster -- FASTER -- as the drills begin CHEWING INTO THE GROUND.
          THE WOMAN -- staggering back in SHOCK and AWE -- clings to her
          baby for one final SCREAM and -- BLACK. Over which we read:

          EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY

          burning sun FLARES LENS, beating down on... A MAN.
          Lying in the barren DESERT. Out cold. Handsome... but HARD.
          We'll call him THE MAN IN BLACK, the color of his dirty clothes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          A PINK TONGUE LICKS HIM. The man STARTS AWAKE -- to find a
          MONGREL DOG over him. Mangy. But sweet.
          COUGHING, the man stumbles up. How'd he get here? And where
          the hell i.: here? And -- OWWW. A GASH in his side...
          .. part of the wound oddly SEARED. He winces. Trying to solve
          this painful puzzle. Something GLINTS on his wrist:
          A STEEL BRACELET. No clasp to pull it off. He touches the
          surface -- TSSS -- SHIT -- It's HOT!
          And there's a BLACK STETSON on the ground. The Man grabs it to
          shield his eyes... but STOFS:
          A WORN PHOTOGRAPH in the inner brim. A WOMAN. Young,
          beautiful. SMILING.
          The Man stares: does he KNOW this woman? is this even HIS hat?
          The dog BARKS ALERT. The man turns -- QUICK -- his hand reaches
          toward his hip on INSTINCT but there's no holster. NO GUNS.

          THREE RIDERS ON HORSEBACK ARE COMING OVER THE RISE:
          THE CLAIBORNE BROTHERS -- WES, MOSE and LUKE. Dusty and tough.
          Wes gallops right up to our Man, gives him the once over --

                         WES CLAIBORNE
          Howdy.

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          We're riding towards Absolution. You
          know how far west we are?
          The Man's got NO IDEA what he's talking about.

                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
          Maybe he's a dummy.
          Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now --

                         WES CLAIBORNE
          There a reason you don't wanna answer my
          question, friend?
          And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist --

                         MOSE CLAIBORNE
          Wes, he's got iron on his wrist... and
          he's been shot.

                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
          Bet he's a chain jumper.
          Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's SURROUNDED.

          If he escaped, there'll be a bounty.
          Let's bring him with us.
          Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back
          scabbard. COCKS both barrels. The dog GROWLS --

                         WES CLAIBORNE
          Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn
          round and start walking.
          But The Man doesn't move. The Claibornes share glances. Wes
          steps forward -- RAISING HIS RIFLE --

          WES CLAIBORNE (CONT'D)
          Dead or alive, no difference. I said

                         WALK OR--
          THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the rifle
          forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the gun's in THE
          MAN'S HANDS -- BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards, HOLE IN HIS CHEST!
          As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man FLIPS the rifle again --
          SLAM! MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls -- UNDER
          Luke's horse -- GRABBING Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's FLAT on
          his back -- BREATHLESS, staring UP at the double-barrel:

                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
          -- P-please, God -- d-don't --
          -- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK! The rifle's EMPTY.
          Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down,
          knocking him out cold. And ALL of this took about ten seconds.
          This man is a cold-blooded KILLER. But somehow... he didn't
          seem to KNOW that. CONFUSION. Drops the rifle, looks down at
          his hands... covered in BLOOD. And the BODIES in his wake.
          The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket. It DANCES
          on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot. He picks
          it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM --

          "TO FORT STANTON -- STOP -- ABSOLUTION TOWNSHIP BESIEGED BY

          Absolution...

          SLAM TO MOMENTS LATER:
          With a HYA! The Man sends two horses GALLOPING, mounts the
          third, wincing at that gash in his side. Starts to trot off...
          sees the dog following...

          THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
          Get outta here. Leave me alone.
          But the dog keeps following. Like they're FRIENDS now. The man
          turns away dismissively as we BOOM UP to reveal the WIDE OPEN
          VALLEY below... and a SPECK within it that is:

          EXT. TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY

          A CROOKED SIGN: "ABSOLUTION." The town is dismal and forgotten.
          Crumbling buildings blistered by sun. The Man rides in --
          dehydrated, the wound DRAINING him.
          His eyes fall on the first building he sees... A CHURCH.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          BAM! The door flies open and VOTIVE CANDLES FLICKER. The Man
          looks at the dog and says --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Stay.
          The dog sits by the door as The Man enters -- EMPTY -- he's
          moving -- into a small kitchen area -- bottle of whiskey --
          uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the wound --
          then A PISTOL COCKS behind him --
          Meet MEACHAM, town preacher, a tough, wash-foot Baptist:

                         MEACHAM
          Palms to heaven, Friend.
          The Man freezes. Turns up his hands.

          Been shot.

          Which one're you?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          don't know.
          Meacham hears the HONESTY in his voice. Knows a lost soul when
          he sees one. Lowers his gun, softening...

                         MEACHAM
          Got a name, son?

          A CANDLE FLAME -- a NEEDLE passing through it -- it's LATER and
          Meacham's studying The Man's wound:

          Odd wound. Looks... cauterized.
          (off The Man's look)
          Means somethin' burned it half closed.
          The Man just stares. News to him. And now, as Meacham leans
          over the wound, the METAL CROSS around his neck begins to
          twitch... lifting ever so SLIGHTLX off his chest -- towards the
          strange BRACELET on the Man's wrist. Meacham reacts --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Nice trick. That some kinds... magnet?
          The Man looks at him -- "What the hell is a 'magnet'?!?"
          Meacham shrugs it off, readies the needle --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Try'n hold still.
          He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces
          slightly, but bears the pain.

          West. Woke up in the desert.

          your sins if you don't recall 'em. That
          bein' said...

          heaven or hell... it's not God's plan...

          No storm I've ever seen... I say we wait
          'til it passes.
          But Dolar isn't listening. THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS: he sees
          PERCY being carried into the prison wagon. Followed by Jake.

                         DOLARHYDE
          No time, they put him in an iron coach.
          With a HYA! he's OFF, the others FOLLOWING with reluctant looks
          -- still SPOOKED by that incoming STORM:

          EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

          As Jake's loaded into the prison wagon after the still-
          unconscious Percy, he SEES MEACHAM through the barred window.
          The preacher flashes SYMPATHY as Wade takes out the cuff key:

                         DEPUTY WADE
          Gimme your wrist.
          Jake holds out his hands. Wade unlocks one wrist, freeing a
          cuff... then takes that cuff and LOCKS IT to Percy's wrist.

                         JAKE
          What're you --?

                         CHARLIE

          You lovebirds have a nice trip now.
          SLAM: the door CLOSES and LOCKS. Jake SIGHS and tries to sit
          back, but it's hard tethered to Percy's slumped form. Shit.
          Then QWW -- something starts to STING and he looks down:
          HIS BRACELET. Has started PULSING RED. And it's getting WARM.
          Jake stares -- ON EDGE -- what the hell's happening? As --
          OUTSIDE, Taggart mounts the buckboard. EMMETT feeds the horses:

                         EMMETT
          You sure he's a bad guy, Pa? He did give
          Percy a lickin'.

          Because it's my job, Emmett. That's what
          these people pay me to do. And your
          mother would kill me if I brought you.
          Emmett looks off, half sad, half angry --

                         EMMETT
          Good thing she's already dead then.
          And turns without a goodbye. Taggart watches him leave, wishing
          he could connect. Takes the reins and looks up -- REACTS:
          THAT MASSIVE. FRIGHTENING CLOUD IN THE SKY -- roiling faster
          toward town. The scary BLUE FLASHES within grow more INTENSE.
          IN THE COACH -- WITH JAKE, looking at the BRACELET, the pulsing
          growing MORE FREQUENT -- and then, a VOICE:

          ELLA (0.S. )

          HEY!
          Jake turns to see ELLA, pushed up against the coach window:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Tell me where you got that bracelet...

                         JAKE

          And sits back as the coach starts to MOVE, leaving Ella in the
          dust. Some of the gunmen ride atop it; others on horseback
          cover the coach in a protective ring.
          Wade sees something incoming from the NORTH:

          EXHALES a crazy breath, stumbles back... as slowly... people
          converge around the corpse:

          bracelet things too!
          Indeed, there on the creature's wrist is an IDENTICAL BRACELET.
          ON JAKE. Mind tumbling. He meets eyes with ELLA. Her face as
          EAGER as his to understand this and now... BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.
          What's that SOUND? Everyone looks at each other. Colorado

          People look at each other: WHAT NOW? Trying to control the near-
          hysteria they all feel. Finally, Dolarhyde takes a BREATH --
          more BRAVADO than actual courage:

          THUD! The alien corpse is DROPPED onto the bar by Doc and
          Meacham. As Dolarhyde and Colorado follow through the batwings
          -- Doc WHIPS a SHOTGUN from under the bar:

          Doc and Dolar never take eyes off each other. or their GUNS.
          Finally... Dolar LOWERS his. So does Doc. People BREATHE.
          Meacham slips on a pair of GLASSES, studying eerie veins and
          muscles through the creature's viscous outer layers. Doc turns
          his focus to the alien too. Picks up his PUMP-OPERATED BONE
          SAW. Presses his boot on the bellows, it turns with a WHIR...
          SHAKING as he brings the SPINNING BLADE to the alien's CHEST.

          Dolarhyde against the wall! Everyone tries to PRY the claws
          from his neck -- but the second Doc withdraws his hands from the
          alien's chest, its arm goes LIMP. Dolarhyde drops, GASPING...

                         DOC
          Spinal reflex.
          And GRINS at Dolar's pain. But Meacham NOTICES something around
          Dolar's neck where the alien pinned him, like a ring of DUST:

                         MEACHAM
          Something on your neck. Hold still.
          Meacham sweeps a little off Dolar's neck, rubs it between thumb
          and forefinger. The dust GLINTS under the kerosene lamp:

          In MACRO CU, DOC CUTS INTO THE EYE, WET SQUISHY SOUNDS as he
          pulls it from its socket, attached to a STRINGY OPTIC NERVE
          dripping with juice. Clamped to the nerve is a METALLIC ORB:
          -- he takes hold of the blinking orb. It FLARES to life, the
          light coalescing into a 3-D ARROW-LIKE HOLOGRAM. Confusion.

          Whatever that means, it's a deep, painful LONGING in her. She

          And lookin' at you? I'd bet a silver
          dollar... its what you want, too.
          With that, Ella turns and STRIDES OFF as we HOLD ON JAKE, face
          knotted in conflict. As her words RESONATE.

          scared. They form an EXODUS LINE, heading off toward the fort.
          Dolarhyde, Colorado and his REMAINING MEN (6) load the ALIEN
          CORPSE onto the back of a WAGON. Some of them trade glances --
          DAMN WORRIED about staying. Dolarhyde sees it:

          Somebody got something to say?
          His withering GLARE keeps them from speaking up. Doc and

          Yeah -- J'm sure.
          Emmett appears leading a PONY, a BOW and quiver of ARROWS slung
          around his back:

          get to it, Padre.
          And that's the truth. Meacham sighs, no choice... finally:

                         MEACHAM
          Go fill your canteen, dammit.
          He SLAPS the reins and the wagon rides off. Emmett GRINS and
          mounts the pony, then sees... JAKE riding past. ANGRY EYES from
          Ella as she heels her horse and TROTS OFF angrily:

                         ELLA
          C'mon, Happy.
          But HAPPY remains, torn between them, tail wagging and looking
          up at Jake as if to say: PLEASE COME?

                         JAKE
          Oh shut up.
          Suppressing GUILT, he rides on toward the hills -- as Dolarhyde
          VEERS his horse in front of Jake, cutting him off:

                         DOLARHYDE

          Now you owe me y.Q= life. We're square.
          In a DAZZLING TWIRL, Jake slaps it back in his holster. Point
          made, he RIDES ON. Dolarhyde, burning mad at having been out-
          drawn, turns to CULOBAI)U -- speaks LOW:

          Colorado NODS acquiescence, moves off...
          JAKE -- on the OUTSKIRTS of town now -- riding past Meacham and
          Doc on the WAGON:

          That's not what I meant.
          The inference LANDS on Jake. But he's in no mood. GALLOPS off.
          Meacham watches Jake go... MUSIC RISES AS WE DISSOLVE THROUGH:

          JAKE -- RIDING HARD THROUGH THE DESERT:
          A man running from his demons, or maybe toward them... through
          plains and pasturage... until he sees the tilted ROAD SIGN:
          "SAGUARO PASS." Up ahead, he sees DEBRIS...
          Part of a ROOF, lying broken on the ground. Pieces of a STONE
          CHIMNEY. Jake comes over a rise... to REVEAL:

          EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY

          A DESTROYED LOG CABIN. Walls partially TORN AWAY. Something in
          Jake is DEEPLY STIRRED. Dismounts, tentatively... walks up to

          INT. ABANDONED CABIN - CONTINUOUS

          LIGHT BEAMS stream in. Eerie quiet.
          Jake takes it in, HAUNTED. Something CRUNCHES under his boot --
          DRIED FLOWERS. Sticking out from an OVERTURNED CRACKED VASE.
          Jake BLINKS, affected -- Bends over, TOUCHES the VASE AS:
          MEMORY FLASECUT! FRESH FLOWERS in a woman's hand... THE W B&
          FROM JAKE'S PICTURE. She smiles at him --

          CLINK -- He drops a LEATHER POUCH on the table next to the vase.
          A FEW GOLD COINS clink out. The woman turns to him, WORRIED:

                         THE WOMAN
          Where'd you get this?

                         JAKE

          The woman looks to the pouch -- Picks up one of the coins.
          TORN. Jake moves behind her. Close. An INTIMACY here.

          Let 'em come.
          She turns to him, their eyes HOLD... and they KISS. Soft.
          Tender. Soulful.
          But then -- a THUNDERCRACK turns their attention to the window:
          A STORM CLOUD on the horizon. Same kind that consumed the town.
          The cabin starts to VIBRATE like a tuning fork. The pouch
          slides off the table... THE GOLD COINS SPILL OUT and --

          BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE
          REELING. What is this memory? Who the hell is the woman?
          Something GLINTS in the far wall where the chimney used to be:

          ONE OF THE GOLD COINS
          EMBEDDED in the wood. Jake pulls it out of the wall, a thousand
          questions in his eyes. Sunlight SHIMMERS off it and --
          MEMORY FLASHCUT! The spilled coins start SLIDING across the
          floor all by themselves, as if magnetically drawn to THE CHIMNEY

          Holds it UP. " Winfield's Landing... Population 133."
          ON GREAVEY AND THE MEN. Shit. He doesn't mean...?

                         GREAVEY
          You tryin' to tell me those... things
          pulled the whole damn town into the sky?
          And suddenly a weird CRACK shakes the canyon -- like the SOUND
          BARRIER BREAKING -- everyone's look goes UP where:
          SWIRLING, DARK CLOUDS LOOM. The same clouds that dropped the
          tornado on Absolution. And that appeared in Jake's MEMORIES at
          the cabin. But this time, something's SHOT OUT from them --

                         MEACHAM
          That can't be good.
          The plummeting object HITS a distant dune, kicking up a SAND

          PLUME -- ROLLING TOWARD THEM --

                         DOLARHYDE

          -- everyone runs their horses aside as the object BOUNCES over
          rocks -- then SLOWS... to a STOP.
          They STARE. Finally Dolarhyde kicks his horse forward slowly...
          DISMOUNTS, draws his GUN. What he sees is SHOCKING:
          It's an OVAL CAPSULE OF BLUE GOO, the outer layer some kind of
          TRANSLUCENT COCOON. Suspended within the murky Jell-o is a
          GE, DEC SHAPE. Motionless. UH-OH.
          The others draw guns too, converging around it in equal SHOCK
          and FEAR. But the thing doesn't MOVE.

          -- oops --
          -- and now we find Emmett's already POKING it with a stick, a
          Small TEAR in the cocoon's outer embryonic layer -- GOO leaks --
          then it RUPTURES, EXPLODING as the horses REAR away, WHINNYING
          the goo spreads across the desert floor, thinning out.
          BEAT. Everyone wipes blue shit off their clothes as they come
          FACE-TO-FACE with the object inside, lying there on the ground:

          A COW. YES, A COW.
          Motionless. DEAD, in fact. A METAL TUBE jammed in its mouth,
          connected to a VALVE in the now-flaccid bubble's outer shell.
          Greavey notices a BRANDING on the cow's rump -- the letter "D":

                         GREAVEY
          Boss... it's one'a yours.
          Dolarhyde's eyes NARROW. Emmett looks at Doc, SCARED:

                         EMMETT
          Is-- is this what happened to my Pa?
          Doc dismounts. Moves to the cow's mouth and PULLS OUT THAT TUBE
          with a wet SQUISHING sound. Thinking it through:

                         DOC
          This was stuck down its throat... to help
          it breathe. That means they wanted to
          keep it alive, Emmett.
          (forces a small smile)
          I'm sure your father is fine.
          But Doc's eyes aren't sure. Meacham looks back to the sky:

          She does. The others FOLLOW in a chilled daze. The last is
          DOLARHYDE, glancing back at his dead cow with angry eyes...

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - DUSK

          Now our people APPEAR riding up a ridge... Dolarhyde shoots up a
          HAND, bringing the caravan to a STOP. Once again, SHOCK:

                         EMMETT
          Ho-ly shit.
          BOOM UP to reveal a SURREAL SIGHT in the valley below:
          AGAMBLING RIVERBOAT. Nose buried in the sand, paddlewheels
          facing the sky, as if it'd been dropped from the clouds into the
          desert. Just like that cow. Off their LOOKS --

          EXT. DESERT - THE PADDLEBOAT - MINUTES LATER

          TRACKING alongside of the TILTED PADDLEBOAT, our team rides
          around it. Trying to make SENSE. STENCILED on the stern is...

                         DOC
          "Colorado Queen."

                         (THEN)
          The river's two hundred miles from here.
          But Ella doesn't seem as impressed as the rest of them. In
          fact, her attention is drawn BEHIND them, to something coming up
          over the DUNES... the barest flicker of a smile --

                         ELLA
          Son of a bitch.
          IT'S JAKE ON HORSEBACK. Followed by another horse, with
          COLORADO in the saddle. Wrists tied but ALIVE. As Jake rides
          to a stop, he PUSHES Colorado off the horse -- the indian HITS
          the ground with a THUD as Jake levels Dolarhyde with HARD EYES:

                         JAKE
          Your man got it in his head that he was
          s'posed to kill me. I'm holding onto his

          As Colorado stumbles to his feet angrily, humiliated, Dolar
          notices his BLOODY EAR. The LOBE has been SHOT OFF. He looks
          up at Jake, half-angry, half-EMBARRASSED --

                         DOLARHYDE
          Why'd you let him live?

                         JAKE
          Gonna need him.
          He rides past Dolar to Ella. Stops. Says, simply:

          A THUNDERCRACK. On the horizon, sheets of RAIN.

          Nat BURNS. Dolar feels his AUTHORITY being undermined:

          Storm or no storm, I say we keep movin'.
          Colorado finally turns to Uolarhyde. DEFIANT:

          in QUESTION. The tide IS turning against the rancher.

          EXT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - NIGHT - LATER

          RAIN POURS on the overturned boat. Horses tethered. The ALIEN
          CORPSE has been moved onto a slanted deck, covered by a TARP...
          WE TILT TO THE ALIEN'S HAND. Poking out. Motionless. HOLD on
          it, longer than we're comfortable.

          INT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - LATER THAT NIGHT

          A RATTLESNAKE is coiled around a CHANDELIER... except the
          chandelier is on the floor and the floor is the CEILING.
          Upended gambling tables. WOODRATS scurry over FOOD. Every
          window's SMASHED... as if something just TOOK everyone.
          Dolar sits by a FIRE made from furniture parts, drinking from a
          WHISKEY FLASK. Colorado opposite, rubbing his MANGLED EAR.

          a bond that seems to go deeper than just boss and employee. But
          WHAT? Finally Nat just gets up and LEAVES.
          Dolar watches him go, takes a healthy SWIG. Hears a WHIMPER.

          RAIN pours down through an open gash in the roof, splashing the
          floor. Ella enters, glances back toward the door to make sure
          she's alone, then pulls off her shirt and folds it over a stool.
          Upper body NAKED in the moonlight. We catch only a FLASH of
          this, and for a moment it's PURE HOTNESS...
          . until she turns and something ELSE is revealed: criss-
          crossed LASH MARKS on her back.
          She turns away and starts to SPLASH herself with water, erasing
          the blue goo and dirt from her skin and face... then: A MATCH
          ignites behind her. She WHIRLS, startled, covering her breasts
          with her arms -- JAKE is sitting in a chair at the Commodore's
          desk, casually lighting a cheroot in his mouth:

          She throws her shirt on, but her skin's wet and the shirt glues
          to her, celebrating her shape in a way that can't be ignored.
          Jake tosses her his jacket. As she slips it on, she notices a
          bottle of WHISKEY on the table... and the PHOTOGRAPH OF ALICE.

          Nice company you keep.

          OUR ALIEN HANGS UPSIDE DOWN from stalactites by four spindly
          limbs. Mid sleep cycle. And inches below its head...
          EMMETT, still webbed to the wall. Unable to move or speak,
          TERRIFIED. As suddenly... the cube DEACTIVATES. And DROPS --

          A gang of FOUR MORE ALIENS dismounts. The biggest and STRONGEST
          -- their LEADER -- barks GUTTURAL CLICKS at the alien who
          kidnapped Emmett. Kidnapper explaining as it removes another
          STRANGE DEVICE. The device beams a HOLO-PROJECTION...
          OF ELLA'S FACE! The aliens HISS in furious RECOGNITION.
          JESUS... is this some kind of otherworldly WANTED POSTER?
          PLUMES fan out angrily from the Leader's HUGE, ELONGATED SKULL --
          like an indian headdress! The creature TURNS to Emmett --
          It's the alien who killed Jake's woman! We'll come to know it
          as... THE SLAVER.
          It MOVES OMINOUSLY for Emmett, grasping the HANDLE of something
          that UNCOILS with fluid, frightening speed:
          A WHITE-HOT LASER WHIP. This will be The Slaver's SIGNATURE
          WEAPON. It spirals to its full length, FLASHING out at --
          EMMETT -- MUFFLED SCREAM! But... the whip DOESN'T cut him,
          instead it SLICES THROUGH THE WEBBING that pins the boy to the
          wall. As Emmett FALLS, The Slaver SWEEPS HIM UP -- Emmett
          FLAILS, punching, kicking to no avail -- but then:

                         DOLARHYDE'S FLASK
          Tumbles from Emmett's pocket and SPLASHES WHISKEY on The Slaver
          -- IT.. S[iRIEM WILDLI-Aa THE BOOZE CONTACTS FLESH, SKIN SMOKING!
          EMMETT -- tumbles away. Terror turns to REVELATION as he PULLS
          the webbing from his mouth:

                         EMMETT
          Holy SHIT.
          Another alien LUNGES for the kid but Emmett SPLASHES him with
          the flask -- the alien RECOILS, flesh BUBBLING --
          Emmett whirls -- sees the HOVERBIKES -- JUMPS onto one, twisting
           desperately at the controls --- IiON-DO , ï¿½'T THIS TURNS,__
          WO ?!! Another Alien SCUTTLES in FAST -- Emmett's scrambling
          boots slide into the foot supports, which automatically WHIR
          CLOSED as the bike THROTTLES FORWARD... DECAPITATING THE ALIEN!
          The bike SPINS UNCONTROLLABLY, plasma thrusters SCORCHING WALLS
          and setting two more aliens ABLAZE! The speeder KAMIKAZE
          BOUNCES out of the cavern at 90 MPH, Emmett screaming!
          The Slaver SCREECHES FURIOUSLY as the remaining creatures LEAP
          back on their speeders and GIVE CHASE!

          Climbing onto an old desert stump -- BLAM! It's SHOT OFF by a
          couple DRUNK OUTLAWS, swigging booze from STOLEN WHISKEY CRATES
          piled on a WAGON. We're in an OUTLAW CAMP: roughly 40 fast guns
          and saddle tramps. Tents. Horses. Ample weapons. And right
          now, most of them are GEARING UP to ride out for some reason...
          One of them, CREEK JOHNSON, with a chewed up face like swiss
          cheese, slides a RIFLE into his saddle and shouts to the drunks:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Hey --- ï¿½s 4 Lay off that whiskey and
          saddle up. Flyer's on its way and we
          best damn be sober for it.

          HUNT (O.S.)
          Creek turns; sees HUNT and BRONC crest the hill with the other
          OUTLAWS from the cliffs. ANGRILY:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          'Bout time you got back.
          (re: Hunt's bloody nose)
          What the hell happened to you?!?
          Hunt nods over his shoulder --

                         HUNT
          He did.
          The outlaws part to reveal JAKE, riding in with Ella and the
          rest of our people. Creek's eyes NARROW, NOT happy to see him:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          well, shit.
          It gets very, VERY QUIET. Our people tread warily, knowing
          whatever reaction Jake's eliciting, it AIN'T GOOD. He runs the
          gaunt of ACCUSING GLARES. Smart enough to know that CREEK is
          the man in charge. Dismounts:

                         JAKE
          You don't look happy to see me, Creek.
          Creek eyes him. TOUGH. Clearly, HISTORY here:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          We're fixin' to rob us a train in about
          twenty minutes and you come ridin' in

          Well I'm sure you'll get over it.
          Then, pretty much DISMISSING Creek, Jake turns, addresses the
          rest of the men. If he's their boss? Hï¿½ _gQDn&. CT LIR .ï¿½Tâ¢

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Nice to see you, Boys, but we're not
          going after a train -- We're going after
          something else.
          The men seem... . CONFUSED. Not sure what the hell is GOING ON.

                         BRONC
          But Jake... you-- you said you didn't
          wanna be in charge no more.
          And this is a REVELATION. Jake glances at ELLA -- has to keep
          IMPROVISING to hold his ground:

                         JAKE
          Well, I-- changed my mind. So saddle the
          hell up.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          They're not going anywhere with you.
          Creek's heard enough. Strides forward, a direct CHALLENGE:

          CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
          You got some balls on you -- walkin'
          outta here a week ago sayin' what you
          said and doin' what you did and then
          ridin' back in here and givin orders.
          Just who the hell do you think you are?
          The IRONY of the question isn't lost on Jake, as Creek walks
          right up to Ella. CLOSE. Violates her space: studies her with
          a mixture of curiosity and CONTEMPT.

          CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
          So. Are you her?

                         ELLA

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          The whore Jake quit this gang for.
          OH. Another piece of the puzzle falls into place -- Jake's eyes
          SNAP to Ella as they both REALIZE... the men think she's
          " e." Jake does his best to stay cool, meets Creek's stare:

                         JAKE

          jID in charge. You may be fast, but you
          are goddamned outgunned.
          ON JAKE. OUR HEROES. Shit. Jake turns to the men --

                         JAKE
          That a fact, Boys?
          But Creek doesn't wait for them to respond:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Put your guns on the whore. He so much
          as twitches, blow her brains out her ear.
          AT ONCE, 10 GUNS ARE LEVELED AT ELLA'S HEAD. No doubt as to who
           the men are LOYAL to. But Jake locks into Creek, UNFLINCHING:

                         JAKE
          Call her a whore again, that'll be the
          last word you ever say.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          You ain't in no position to make threats,
          asshole. Hunt: take his gun.
          Hunt reluctantly scrambles over to Jake, oh-so-carefully pulls
          the PISTOL from Jake's holster:

                         HUNT
          Sorry, Boss... nothin' personal.
          Creek now turns to BULL MCCADE, roughly the size of a BARN.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Put him down, Bull.
          And Jake barely has time to react as Bull lets fly with a
          JAWBREAKING HAYMAKER that about knocks Jake out of his BOOTSI
          Dolarhyde and Colorado WINCE as Jake hits the dirt with a THUD --

          Suddenly, the ROOF of the steel structure blossoms open like a

          knee... but just when we think this is gonna be a tender moment,
          he GRABS Emmett by the collar, pulls him CLOSE:

                         JAKE
          You told me your daddy's all you got
          left. Want me to save his ass?
          Then park yours right there on the
          ground, you little shit. Got me?
          Emmett's nailed. ANGRY, but knows he's gotta stay.

                         EMMETT
          Yeah. I gotcha.
          Jake releases him. Happy moves to Ella but she TSKS:

                         ELLA
          Stay with the kid, Happy.
          The dog WHINES but complies, moving next to Emmett. Jake climbs
          on his horse. Looks back to the boy -- now he Ia tender:

          I'll get your father back. Bastard still
          owes me fifty dollars.

          you got yourself a sweet side.
          She smiles. But Jake turns to her -- deadly serious:

                         JAKE
          There's nothin' sweet about me. I told
          that kid what he needed to hear so he
          wouldn't get in my damn way. All I care
          about is killin' that thing.
          And Ella reacts to the DARKNESS in his voice. Shakes her head:

          REACHES in... pulling out a CANVAS BAG. A few COINS spill
          out... COLD. He picks them up -- looks at the woman:

          A storm of mixed emotions in his eyes. That stoic Dolarhyde
          veneer starts to CRACK... just a hint... as the woman MOVES to
          him... and TOUCHES his face.
          And he lets her. WHOA. We realize: this woman is COLORADO'S
          MOTHER. Dolarhyde, for all his wicked bluster, LOVES AN APACHE.

          Ella JAMS a lever forward and the shuttle RISES. JAKE grabs
          WEBBING that must be some type of SEATBELT, feeling the
          sensation of ELLQU as:

          Ella pilots the ship UPWARD, thrusters belching a WAKE OF FIRE

          Colorado PULLS Doc up onto the horse's bare back -- no easy task
          with Doc's 300 POUNDS. The remaining Apaches (5) commandeer
          horses and GALLOP HARD down the tunnel --

          The craft keeps spiralling UP UP toward... THE OMINOUS CLOUD.

          The shuttle BLASTS through the upper cloud layer, to reveal...

          -SHIP. ENORMOUS AND THREATENING, like a BLACK METAL CLAW. Cloud banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye
          of a hurricane.
          ON ELLA. Like ice down her spine... as we drift back to JAKE.

          The rest of our heroes GALLOP FAST out the criss-crossing
          tunnels -- KA-CHINNNG! Apaches are CLAMPED WITH STEEL COLLARS
          and YANKED off their horses as the SPEEDERS roar in from behind!
          Colorado VEERS toward a LIGHT as Doc ignites a molotov and they:

          Doc throws another MOLOTOV, clearing a path for Colorado to RIDE
          HARD for the fort's 30 FT. STEEL ENTRY GATES... which start
           SWINGING CLOSED to trap them!
          But at the LAST SECOND, the horse SLIPS THROUGH the narrow
          opening as it THUNDERS CLOSED. Now the aliens are pissed off:

          They start spilling over the fort walls in pursuit. A few mount
          SPEEDERS and launch as our guys ride DOWN THE CANYON TRENCH:

          Colorado and Doc ZIG-ZAG around CURVES -- like mice navigatinga

          That's the point!
          And just when it looks like Doc and Colorado are GONERS...
          BOOM! An EXPLOSION rocks the canyon as something HURTLES DOWN
          from above -- WHISKEY MOLOTOVS fired from the handmade
          CATAPULTS. BOOM! BOOM! Aliens are VAPORIZED, SHRIEKING!
          A cloudburst of FLAMING ARROWS brightens the sky as 20 APACHES
          RISE UP along the canyon rims: A AMBUSH!
          An ASSEMBLY LINE OF SQUAWS works like a drill team, soaking
          WHISKEY RAGS and wrapping arrows. Among them, EMMETT and HAPPY!
          The kid pocks an arrow like a damn EXPERT -- IGNITES it -- lets
          it FLY -- WHOOSH! It SKEWERS a speeder pilot who BURSTS INTO

          The first EXPLOSIVE BOLT shoots off. Ella jams her SHOTGUN into

          tornado when Absolution was attacked? And that CRATER they
          found that used to be "Winfield's Landing"? It-'-s all-HE
          in a junkwle hangar. Building pieces. False front
          facades. Debris piled on top of each other, TILTED AND TWISTED
          AT FUNHOUSE ANGLES. And the desert sand that was sucked up
          along with it all.
          A GLOWING REACTOR casts hellish light on the dormant wreckage.
          Weapon ready, Jake moves past part of A BROTHEL. Jutting

          5 ALIENS emerge. Slowly. Fanning out, taking positions as...
          THE SLAVER steps out of the smoke, squarely facing Jake. aAd_h@--
          is holding ELLA hostage. WRIST BLASTER pressed to her throat.
          Jake and Ella LOCK EYES. She's terrified, but staying STRONG.
          His hand LINGERS at his hip, blaster ready.

          Drop the woman. We both know this ain't
          about her.
          But The Slaver only presses his blaster HARDER into Ella's neck.
          Almost GRINNING. And Jake MEETS the look --

          She says you're as bad as they come.

          Well, you ugly sonofabitch... they say
          the same about me.

          Nat?
          Colorado turns -- it's PERCY. Confused. Like waking from a

          Who's gettin' the ranch?
          ON COLORADO. At first, words that don't compute. Then PURE

          HOLD on them, together, a VICTORIOUS but UNRESOLVED note...
          We RISE UP over the sea of bodies and the CRASHED SHIP, until

          EXT. TOWN OF ABSOLUTION - DAY

          A glorious sight: Absolution in REBIRTH -- FLUSH from all that
          GOLD. Storefronts brightly painted, the streets ALIVE.
          We PICK UP EMMETT running through the hustle and bustle with two
          APACHE KIDS. Suddenly, DOLARHYDE, COLORADO and their gang ride
          in. SHERIFF TAGGART emerges from his office with DEPUTY WADE:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART

          Well, Kyle, considering he saved your
          life, guess you'll just have to grin'n
          bear it.
          Dolar moves up to Taggart, tough as ever. The men HOLD looks:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Woodrow.

          Go_ _on.
          Grudgingly, Percy hands Taggart a SHEAF OF PAPER --

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What's this?

                         DOLARHYDE
          Claims to the land 50 miles west of here.
          I've signed it over to the township of
          Absolution.
          (off Taggart's LOOK)
          Considering I'm a businessman, I figure
          expansion's in both our interests. Needs
          the Sheriff's signature to be official.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Fifty miles west of here is where the
          goldmine is, Woodrow.

                         (A BEAT)
          That so.
          With surprise, Taggart studies the paper. SMILES:

          What's this about twenty percent going to
          the Apaches?
          Dolarhyde glances at Colorado. A moment. But the hardened
          rancher maintains his rock-solid facade:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Figure the only way not to piss 'em off
          is to buy 'em.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART

          Just sign it, Goddamnit.
          With a grin, Taggart gestures for Deputy Wade to turn around and
          flattens the paper on his BACK, using it as a surface to SIGN:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          I'd say you were being generous, Woodrow,
          but I know you'd just be insulted.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Damn right.
          Dolar gives his hat a TIP, then mounts up to go -- and we RISE
          UP to the UPPER FLOOR of the GOLD LEAF SALOON, in the process of
          being rebuilt in grand style -- and MOVE IN on a WINDOW where:

          DOC AND MARIA burst through a door, tearing passionately at each
          other's CLOTHES -- Maria MOANS as Doc kisses her neck:

          SHH! The workers will hear
          us!!! Let them hear!
          As they TUMBLE back onto the bed, Doc LURCHES. Reaches under
          his back to find... a GOLD POCKETWATCH.

                         DOC
          What is this?

                         MARIA
          Look at the inscription.
          He flips it open to find an ENGRAVING: "MI CORAZON... POR
          SIEMPRE." Doc looks up at her, MOVED. Then -- PLAYFULLY:

          This looks like Aldo Mayberry's watch...

          A hand unties a HORSE from its tether bar -- it's JAKE. Saddle
          bags packed. A BARK turns him around... HAPPY. Yipping for

          In a LONG SHOT -- the distant SILHOUETTES of Happy BOUNDING
          through the shallow TWIN RIVERS, Jake following on horseback...

          EXT. RIM OF CANYON - DAY

          As Jake approaches, APACHE SENTRIES emerge from rocks to keep
          outsiders away. Jake TIPS his hat and they nod, let him pass.
          He nears the bluff where ELLA, GREY WOLF, and the rest of the
          Apaches finish laying DYNAMITE DET CORD that trails down into
          the canyon. Ella hears Happy BARKING -- turns to see her dog
          with Jake. She smiles as he rides up, dismounts:

                         ELLA
          Second damn time that dog ran off on me.

                         JAKE
          Second time he brought me to you.
          Happy's tail wags. The look between Jake and Ella HOLDS. And
          it seems freighted with everything. Finally, he breaks it --
          glancing at the Apaches finishing their work with the dynamite,
          and the remnants of the ALIEN SHIP and FORTRESS below.

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Looks like you got everything set.
          Ella eyes Jake's horse, loaded with GEAR. Looks up, clearly

                         DISAPPOINTED:

                         ELLA
          Where you headed?

                         JAKE

          What.
          She walks right up to his horse. Right up to HIM:

          I think you're ridin' off cause you're
          just scared of what'll happen if you
          stay.
          An INFERENCE here. Ella's going BOLD. Jake swings off his
          horse, lands beside her. Now. Almost CURIOUS:

                         JAKE
          And what's gonna happen?

          You know.
          A CHARGE between them. All they wanna do is KISS...
          But that'd be too easy. And those wounds of his, they haven't
          quite healed. He drops his eyes; SOFTLY NOW:

                         JAKE
          If I stay... it's not gonna be good for
          anybody, Ella.
          A beat. She looks off. Nods. They say nothing. And now he
          slowly climbs back on his horse. Ella TOUGHENS:

                         ELLA
          Heard some rumors outta Abilene. Weird
          noises at night. Cattle mutilations.
          Weather phenomena. Figured I'd ride down
          there. Give it a look-see.

                         JAKE
          (his eyes narrow)
          What's 'phenomena'?

                         ELLA
          Big storms in places that don't get big
          storms.
          ON JAKE. Every fighting instinct in him suddenly IGNITED,
          though he plays it down:

                         JAKE
          You goin' down there yourself?

                         ELLA
          Why? You worried about me?
          You bet your ass he is. But, he shakes his head--

                         JAKE
          No, ma'am. You can take care of yourself
          just fine.

          Be seein' you around.

                         ELLA
          goodbye, Jake.
          He gets back on his horse. Starts to ride off. Happy BARKS and
          trots alongside him. BARK BARK BARK. In dog that means "Don't
          be an idiot." Jake glances over --

          (BARK, BARK)
          Go on, GET.
          He heels his horse, leaving Happy behind to WHINE.
          Jake rides off into the sunset. But his heart's KICKING in his
          chest. And this is pretty much where things usually end...
          But. Jake pulls the REINS as he SIGHS. Turns the horse around.
          TROTS back to Ella, whose smile WIDENS as he closes the gap
          between them.
          Finally STOPS right in front of her. And despite his best
          effort to stay TOUGH... he just plain likes her:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Abilene happens to be on my way.
          He reaches out a hand... she takes it... as he PULLS HER UP INTO
          THE SADDLE. Ella grinning ear-to-ear as she folds her arms
          around his waist. Jake -- ever the outlaw -- grumbles:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Stop smiling, Goddammit.
          He KICKS the horse and Happy follows. Ella shoots a goodbye
          look to Grey Wolf, who NODS. Signals his men and FUSES ARE LIT:
          The DYNAMITE FUSES ssssssnake down the mountain -- reaching the
          canyon floor -- INTO those limestone tunnels where CLUSTERS OF
          DYNAMITE have been placed... and as FUSE MEETS EXPLOSIVE:
          ANGLE - JAKE AND ELLA CRESTING A HILL -- B000000000000MI The
          THUNDER of EXPLOSIONS makes them rear. They turn back to see...

          THE TWIN RIVERS GEYSERING UP INTO THE CANYON. COVERING ALL

          Ella folds her arms TIGHTER around Jake, her heart full. With a
          nod of private affirmation, he spurs the horse with a HYAI
          As the canyon behind them fills with rushing water, Jake and
          Ella ride hard into the fiery sunset...
          Away from the past, toward a future full of promise.

          FADE OUT.
