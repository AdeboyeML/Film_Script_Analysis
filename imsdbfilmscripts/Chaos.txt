A1   EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE- NIGHT                               A1

     CLOSE ON...   A BRONZE PLAQUE which reads, "PEARL STREET
     BRIDGE."

     ON THE BRIDGE... RAIN POURS DOWN. An SUV steers out of
     control and CRASHES into a STALLED OUT VEHICLE.

     It's quiet NOW, EXCEPT FOR THE INCESSANT pounding rain.    IN
     THE DISTANCE, police lights approach.

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:

1    EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT                              1

     THROUGH A TELEVISION CAMERA... The image is GRAINY and
     FRENETIC. A HEAVY RAIN POURS DOWN on a MELEE OF ACTIVITY.

     POLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in
     a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on...

     The SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the
     bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand
     holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to
     his body. His left holds a GUN!

     Two DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man.   ONLY SEE THE
     DETECTIVES FROM BEHIND.

     A News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to
     burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the
     camera...

                          KAREN CROSS
                ... Police on scene are approaching
                the suspect. They're at the center of
                the Bridge now.

     The Man waves his gun wildly, screams at the Detectives.     The
     Hostage, tears streaming down her face, SCREAMS OUT!

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.

     SUDDENLY...   THREE GUN SHOTS, almost simultaneously, RING
     OUT!

                We have shots fired. Shots have been
                fired... Both the suspect and his
                hostage are down... Police are moving
                in... Oh my God.

2    INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                 2

     A loft apartment, scarcely furnished, except for BOOKS,
     HUNDREDS OF THEM, fill stacks of shelves. Hearing but not
     watching the television, METICULOUSLY preparing a GIN AND
     TONIC, is...

     DETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His
     charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much
     trouble as it gets him out of. At present a somber mood.
     The shadows from the rain stream down Conners's face.

     IN THE GLASS'S REFLECTION... The TV Report plays. (NOTE:
     most of, if not all, of the TV report will in reflection.)

                          KAREN CROSS (OS)
                After a two month investigation, Det.
                Jason York has been relieved of duty
                for his role in the Pearl Street Bridge
                shooting deaths of Lisa ReAnn and John
                Curtis. Key testimony against York
                came from Det. Bernard Callo, who was
                on scene that night. The Seattle
                Police Department is handing this case
                over to the King County District
                Attorney's office. Criminal charges
                are expected.

3    ON A TELEVISION SCREEN--                                       3

     The IMAGE cuts to an earlier interview with... CAPTAIN
     MARTIN JENKINS, 50's, chronically tired and unsympathetic.

                          JENKINS
                In a civilized society, the men and
                women entrusted with serving and
                protecting the community are to be held
                accountable just like everyone else.
                Simply put... Just because you are a
                cop, doesn't mean laws don't apply to
                you. This is no longer the wild, wild
                west.

3A   EXT.   KING COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY (THROUGH TV CAMERA)      3A

     KAREN CROSS stands on the steps, a PHOTO of Conners appears.

                This same review board last week found
                Quentin Conners, Det. York's partner,
                "not responsible" for the same
                shooting. He remains on suspension
                without pay.

3B   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                    3B

     Conners turns off the TV, lays the remote next to a PHOTO of
     Conners and a YOUNG WOMAN (TEDDY) during happy times. He
     stares at the photo, finishes his drink.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

4    EXT.   SEATTLE - DAY - ESTABLISHING                               4

     A COOL, CRISP Pacific Northwestern day. MOUNT RAINIER looms
     in the distance. The SPACE NEEDLE overlooks downtown. While
     the sun shines now, the OVERCAST SKY on the horizon
     FORESHADOWS AN IMPENDING STORM. In the heart of the city...

5    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                               5

     An IMPRESSIVE STRUCTURE on a BUSY CITY CORNER. TRAFFIC,
     street and pedestrian, go about their business.

     ACROSS THE STREET...   A BLACK TRUCK screeches to a stop.

6    INT.   BLACK TRUCK - DAY                                          6

     LORENZ, 40's, sits behind the steering wheel. His EYES cold,
     merciless. He's joined by FOUR OTHER MEN, ALL BLACK CLAD -
     HEAVILY ARMED with BODY ARMOR!

     Lorenz stares out at the bank, a last moment of peace.
     Simultaneously, ALL FOUR DOORS OPEN and...

7    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                               7

     Lorenz and the Black Clad exit, quickly cross the street,
     heading for the bank! Each carries a LARGE BLACK BAG.

7A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                             7A

     PATRONS in line, wait impatiently. A SECURITY GUARD in the
     corner yawns. TELLERS count out cash, access accounts on
     COMPUTERS.

     GRAINY SECURITY CAMERA IMAGES depict an average, business
     day. THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.

     Lorenz and the Black Clad arrive at the doors.     They RAISE
     THEIR MASKS and...

8    INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                             8

     Off the CROOKED EYEBROW of a BANK TELLER...

     AT THE FRONT DOORS--

     The BLACK CLAD STORM THE BANK! Four of the Black Clad move
     into position. Lorenz stands center stage. Gun in hand, he
     aims at the ceiling, PULLS the trigger... BAM! A GUNSHOT
     RINGS OUT!

                          LOREN
                Drop to the floor! Slowly! No sudden
                moves!
                    (to the Tellers)
                You! Hands on heads, drop to your
                knees. Now! Do it!

     PATRONS and TELLERS HIT THE GROUND, TERRIFIED!     Lorenz is in
     COMPLETE and UTTER CONTROL.

     BLACK CLAD #4 and #3 keep watch on the tellers behind the
     counters! One on one side, one on the other.

     BLACK CLAD #2 ushers people out of side offices, gun-points
     them into the lobby!

     BLACK CLAD #1 races upstairs, gathers people from the 2nd
     level, forces them downstairs.

     From the corner of Lorenz's eye...      The SECURITY GUARD's hand
     creeps toward his gun.

                          LORENZ
                That... you don't want to do.

     The Security Guard reluctantly obeys. BLACK CLAD #1 DISARMS
     the Guard, then GUN BUTTS HIM over the head! The Guard
     drops, unconscious! CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES scream out.

     Black Clad #1 rips keys from the Guard's belt, tosses them to
     Black Clad #2!

                           LORENZ
                Y'all picked the wrong day not to use
                the ATM.
                    (Beat)
                You will not be harmed if you do

                 take your chances if you choose not to
                 listen.

      BLACK CLAD #2, keys in hand, flies across the counter,
      carrying a large duffel bag... Heading to the vaults!

                           LORENZ
                 No one will say I didn't give you a
                 choice.

9     INT.   SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK            9

      Black Clad #2 arrives, drops his bag, unzipping...

                           BLACK CLAD #2
                     (into his headset)
                 I'm in.

10    INT.   THE LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                       10

      Lorenz gets the message, finds THE BANK MANAGER cowering
      behind his desk.

                           LORENZ
                 You, up.
                     (the Bank Manager obeys)
                 You understood what I just said?

                              BANK MANAGER
                 Yes.

                           LORENZ
                 Your security system, you can
                 electronically lock all entrances...

                            BANK MANAGER
                 Yes.   Right-right away.

                           LORENZ
                 With that attitude, you and I are going
                 to get along famously. Now go.

      The Bank Manager nods nervously.

      BLACK CLAD #4 holds open his bag. He strides by the
      CUSTOMERS who deposit CELLPHONES, PAGERS, inside.

10A   INT.   BANK MANAGER'S OFFICE                                10A

      The Bank Manager taps on his computer keyboard.

                              BANK MANAGER
                 It's done.     We're locked down.

10B   INT.   THE LOBBY--                                           10B

      BLACK CLAD #1 flips the "BANK CLOSED" sign around.

11    INT.   MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY                                       11

      Jenkins fastens his cufflinks.   In the bed behind him...

      HEATHER "TEDDY" GALLOWAY, 30's, normally a force to reckon
      with, appears vulnerable with only a sheet wrapped around
      her.

                           JENKINS
                 Have you seen my watch?

      Teddy gestures to the night stand. Jenkins retrieves the
      watch. He also slides his WEDDING RING back on. This ain't
      love, this is a relationship of convenience.

      Jenkins slips on his jacket, secures his tie and, after one
      last check in the mirror...

                           JENKINS
                 This was fun. You should get out of
                 bed. You'll be late for work.

      And with that, Jenkins exits. Teddy waits for the door to
      close, then collapses back onto the bed.

12    INT.   SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK             12

      PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES line the walls, connect all the safety
      deposit boxes together! BLACK CLAD #2, takes cover, readies
      the detonation device and...

                           BLACK CLAD #2
                     (into his headset)
                 Fire in the hole.

      He FLIPS A SWITCH and... KA-BOOM!    AN EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH
      THE VAULT!

13    INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                            13

      A PILLOW OF SMOKE BLOWS into the lobby! Lorenz stands
      UNFLINCHING. The explosion was expected.

      BEHIND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WINDOWS--

      An EAGER TELLER, 30's, seizes the moment.    He reaches up and
      PRESSES THE SILENT ALARM BUTTON!

        SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004         7.


      BLACK CLAD #4 turns just in time to see it, quickly FIRES his
      weapon! The Eager Teller slumps against the wall, BLEEDS
      profusely from his neck, not dead yet.

      Lorenz hustles over to Black Clad #4.

                           LORENZ
                 What do you think you're doing?

                           BLACK CLAD #4
                 Fucker pushed the alarm.

      Lorenz GLARES DISGUSTEDLY at his accomplice.

                            LORENZ
                 It would've made more sense to shoot
                 him before he pushes the fucking alarm.
                 Not after.
                     (looks at the Eager Teller)
                 Jesus.

      Lorenz levels, very calmly, his weapon at the Eager Teller's
      head and...

                           LORENZ
                 And... If you're going to do something.
                     (FIRES his weapon!)
                 Do it right.

      The Eager's Teller's body keels over, dead.    Lorenz checks
      his watch... 9:26 a.m.

                           LORENZ
                     (into microphone)
                 Alarm's tripped. We're on a clock.
                     (to Black Clad #4)
                 Get these people out of the way.

      There's not enough soap on the planet for Teddy to feel
      clean. Doubt and fear present on her face. She turns off
      the water, and steps out... when she does HER PAGER, off
      screen, chimes!

15    INT.   MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY                                      15

      Teddy, a towel wrapped around her, picks up the pager.   The
      number: 911. She picks up the TELEPHONE, dials.

      OFFICERS fly out, shotguns out!

      HELICOPTERS circle. NEWS VANS speed onto the scene as the
      CROWDS builds. Standing in the center of things...

      DETECTIVE BERNIE CALLO, 40's, a stern, by-the-book cop. Not
      a popular member of the force. TWO OFFICERS, 30's, follow

                 I want all points of entry identified

      POV OF LORENZ - Callo approaches the Tech Van.

      Lorenz peeks through the curtains.       A phone pressed between
      his shoulder and ear.

      He places a VOICE MODULATOR over the phone's mouthpiece (this
      will leave his voice sounding LIFELESS and DISTORTED to those
      on the receiving end).

     Callo arrives at the POLICE TECH VAN.    So state-of-the-art
     NASA is green with envy.

     BRENDAN DAX, 30's, the techno-wizard, with headphones on,

                This is Detective Callo, Seattle P.D.
                Who am I speaking with?

                          LORENZ
                No questions. It's time to set the
                rules. I am in complete control of
                this facility. No one gets in or out
                without my say and I will execute every
                last man, woman and child in here if my
                needs are not met. Do not test me.
                Today, I am a man of zero patience.

                          CALLO
                I'm listening.

                          LORENZ
                See if you can't screw this up,
                Detective... I have but one demand.
                One and only demand.

20   INT.   CONNERS APARTMENT - DAY                                   20

     Conners wears a T-shirt and some sweats, opens his
     refrigerator, grabs a bottle of water. When he closes the
     door... He notices Jenkins and a YOUNG DETECTIVE on his
     deck.

     Conners crosses, opens the door for Jenkins and DETECTIVE
     SHANE DEKKER, late-20s. Dekker's all business when it comes
     to being a cop. Green, but eager to prove himself. After a
     long beat...

                          CONNERS
                Do you have a warrant?

                    JENKINS
          I need to speak to you, Quentin.

                    CONNERS
          There's where your shit out of luck
          because I don't need to speak to you.

                    JENKINS
          It's important.

Conners and Jenkins trade serious stares. Conners finally
relents. Jenkins and Dekker enter. Dekker notices - THE
STACKS AND STACKS OF BOOKS.

                    JENKINS
          Quentin, this is Detective Shane Dekker.

                     CONNERS
          Huh? You don't look like much of a
          Detective.

                     DEKKER
          Funny. I was going to say the same
          about you.

                      CONNERS
          Charming.

                    JENKINS
          Shane just transferred in from Tacoma.      His
          father...

                    CONNERS
          Save your breath. I really don't care.

Before Jenkins can respond, from the bedroom, a TALL, BLOND
WOMAN, 20s, emerges, COMPLETELY NUDE.

The men WATCH as the Woman, PAYING THEM NO ATTENTION,
retrieves a bottle of water from the fridge, then returns to
the bedroom. No words spoken at all. After the moment has
passed...

                    CONNERS
          Why don't we can the chit-chat.    Get to
          what's on your mind.

          We've got a hostage situation, American

          they wouldn't talk to anyone but you.

          No shit.   I need you to do this.

                    CONNERS
          Why should I?

                    DEKKER
          Because people's lives are at stake.
          That takes priority over your ego.

                    CONNERS
              (to Jenkins; re: Dekker)
          You may want to put a leash on him.
              (beat; thinks)
          Saying I did want to help... I'm still
          suspended or did that slip your mind?

                    JENKINS
          The commissioner's office has ordered
          me to reinstate you. As of now, you're
          back on the force.

                    CONNERS
          Just like that?

                     JENKINS
          Just like that.
              (beat)
          I won't, however, unleash you alone.

                    CONNERS
          Always a catch.

                    JENKINS
          Shane, here, is your new partner.
          Consider him a younger version of me,
          looking over your shoulder, watching
          every move you make.

The idea of a new partner doesn't sit well with Conners.

                    JENKINS
          Don't think I endorse this. If it were
          my call, you'd be with your partner...

                    CONNERS
          You mean ex-partner.

                    JENKINS
          ... On the unemployment line with him.

                    CONNERS
          For a moment there, I thought you

                made a monumental mistake letting you
                back in.

                and the confidence you have in me. I

     orders her CAMERAMAN to center on him.

     Conners, Dekker and Jenkins climb out of the car, head

                Detective Conners? Detective, can we

Conners, Dekker and Jenkins arrive, FIND Teddy, her hair
still wet, with her partner, DET. VINCENT DURANO, 40's, a
middle of the road, never out on a limb type cop.

Callo looks on, the RAGE boiling inside of him.

                    CONNERS
          Teddy, Vincent...
              (completely ignores Callo)
          ... Nice to see you both.

                    JENKINS
          Conners has been reinstated to full
          active duty. It's his scene.

This info comes as a surprise.   Especially to Callo.

                    CALLO
          The last hostage situation this guy
          headed, an innocent civilian died.

                    CONNERS
          I was not responsible...

                    CALLO
          You never are. That girl would be
          alive today if it weren't for your
          cowboy antics. You destroy lives.

                    CONNERS
          Fuck you. Look who's talking about
          destroying lives.

                    JENKINS
          Decision's been made, Bernie.

                    CALLO
          I was first on scene and I have seniority.
              (pleads)
          Don't do this, Martin.

              (beat)
          Fine. I'll watch this train wreck from

Callo exits.

                circumstances will defer to Conners.
                He's in charge.

                          VINCENT
                First time I've heard SWAT defer to
                anyone.

                          JENKINS
                    (pulls aside Conners)
                Second chances don't come around often.
                Don't blow it.

     Jenkins skeptically eyes Conners before stepping away.     He
     motions for Dekker to walk with him.

                          JENKINS
                Anything questionable happens today,
                you let me know.

                          DEKKER
                Yes, Captain.

     Out of earshot, Conners watches Dekker and Jenkins.

                          TEDDY
                Looks like you got yourself a baby-
                sitter.

     Conners glares at Teddy out the corner of his eye, then
     dismisses the comment.

                Can we get you anything? Food, medical
                supplies. We heard an explosion.

                          LORENZ
                Everyone who matters is fine. Of course,
                I would've preferred not having the
                authorities involved at all. We weren't
                planning to be here this long. But, since

          My fame proceeds me.

                     LORENZ
          Don't be flattered. I needed someone
          who's been through the experience
          before. Hopefully this time it will go
          better for all involved. I plan on
          living a full, long and rich life. I
          didn't, however, expect them to find
          you so quickly. I thought you were
          suspended.

Dekker writes, "In The Know," on his pad.

                    CONNERS
          I was, but I'm back.   You're

          You want to know about the hostages?
          How many and are they okay?

Dekker scribbles, "Pro".

                    CONNERS
          Yes.

                     LORENZ
          Approximately forty, they're fine,
          considering. All except one. We had a
          situation.

                    CONNERS
          Someone's dead?

                    LORENZ
          Theory... put to practice isn't always
          perfect. Can't expect to keep the
          hostages in check if a bad deed goes
          unpunished or they may... randomly
          decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
          order to it.
              (Conners drifts in thought)
          Detective? Are you still with me?

Teddy SNAPS her fingers. That gets Conners attention.
There's a new intensity to his demeanor.

                for you and your colleagues to pack up
                and go home?

                Safe to say.

                Stay by the phone.    I'll contact you

                Don't worry, I have no plans until
                sunrise tomorrow, so hunker down. It's
                going to be a long one.

                Patience, Detective. We don't want
                another Pearl Street Bridge, do we?

     Conners's thrown by the mention of Pearl Street Bridge.
     Lorenz abruptly HANGS UP.

30A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                       30A

      Black Clad #1 and #4 remove from their bag - ropes, pulleys,
      an iron spike and hammer. #1 also removes... a spear-gun.

      #1 connects the rope to a spear. FIRES the spear into the
      wall above the bank's front windows! He snags a 2nd spear,
      repeats.

                 Where's our fearless Captain?

                           DEKKER
                 Went uptown to brief the Commissioner.

                           CONNERS
                 So you're here in his place.

      Conners fumbles with the wrapper, but eventually sticks
      another piece of gum in his mouth. Teddy notices.

                           CONNERS
                 Nicotine gum.

                           TEDDY

                 You quit smoking?

                 Caffeine, too, if you must know.
                     (Another shock)
                 What? A man's capable of change.

                           TEDDY
                 A man, yes. You...     I'm not so sure.

          Don't worry, I still have a vice or two.

                    DAX
          Fifteen rings.    No answer.

                    CONNERS
          Try again in five.

                    TEDDY
          What are they doing in there?

                    VINCENT
          Wasting our time.

Time. The word rings in Conners's head.     He starts to put it
together.

                    CONNERS
          Precisely. He knows police protocol,
          not to mention the shit in our own
          precinct. He's disguising his voice,
          means he's got a record and has done
          this before. He's heavily armed and
          well-connected. He knows he's
          surrounded. He hasn't asked for a
          damned thing. He drops that hint about
          sunrise, prepping us for a long wait.
          He's buying time. Why?

                    VINCENT
              (brainstorming)
          To figure out his next move.    He wasn't
          expecting us.

                    DEKKER
          No, he wasn't expecting you. He said,
          he thought you were still suspended.

                    CONNERS
          Probably thought it would take the
          whole day for you to find me. Giving
          him the time he needs.

                    TEDDY
          He's stalling.

                    DEKKER
          He almost has what he came for.

Conners nods, eyes Dekker as if for the first time.

                    CONNERS
          Or... he's got what he came for and he's
          waiting for his ticket out of here.
              (the decision)
          We're going in.

                    TEDDY
          What?

                     CONNERS
          The bank has three points of entry.
          Teddy and Vincent, take a SWAT Team,
          head to the West side. We'll have the
          SWAT Commander take the East. Dekker,
          you're with me. Where is the SWAT
          Commander?

                    VINCENT
          I'll find him.

Vincent leaves Conners with Dekker and Teddy.

                    TEDDY
              (to Conners; concern)
          That's a big call, Quentin.   Thought
          about what you're doing?

                    CONNERS
          You questioning me, Teddy?

                    TEDDY
          Unfortunately... yeah.

                    CONNERS
          I question how you can fuck that
          asshole and still manage to look in the
          mirror.

                    TEDDY
          I'm not going to get into this now.
          And you're one to talk. I hear...

                    CONNERS
              (interrupting)
          The hostages are in imminent danger.
          They've confessed to killing someone, an
          automatic murder one charge - that's a
          life sentence, maybe a needle for all of
          them. So why keep witnesses around to
          testify? Longer we wait, the greater the
          risk. We need to go in. Now.

      SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004             21.


                          TEDDY
                    (beat; then relents)
                Okay.

     Even Dekker seems to agree with that theory. Vincent arrives
     with the SWAT COMMANDER, 40's, a former Navy SEAL with a
     "Don't FUCK with me" attitude.

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                I got snipers up top and ten soldiers
                on the ground.

                          CONNERS
                What's the best way in?

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                Tear gas, blow the doors...

                           CONNERS
                Hold on. No explosives. I got forty
                civilians in there, too great a chance.    Any
                other way?

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                There's no pussy way in. The doors are
                locked electronically from the inside.
                We ain't getting in without force.

                          CONNERS
                    (beat; thinks)
                What if we cut the power? That will
                disable the system and we can open the
                locks manually, come in that way?

                          SWAT COMMANDER
                    (thinks; concedes)
                That'll work.

                          CONNERS
                So we'll take the pussy way, Commander.
                We cut the power and go in at 11:15
                sharp!

                                                          TIME CUT TO:

     Vincent and the SWAT Commander arrive.

                  The bank's equipped with emergency
                  generators, which once the power's
                  down, will kick back on in
                  approximately 3-6 minutes.

                            CONNERS
                  It will be over before that.
                  Commander, your men in position?

                            SWAT COMMANDER
                  Standing by.

                            CONNERS
                  I will call for the power to be cut.
                  Once down, wait for my signal and
                  enter. No one moves until I give the
                  "go", understood?

       They all nod.    They're ready.

                            CONNERS
                  You have done this before, right?
                  Wait... I don't want to know.

     Conners and Dekker head for the bank, pass two groups of FOUR
     UNIFORMED OFFICERS...

                          DEKKER
                    (to the first group)
                Round up all the hostages, anyone that
                comes out, grab'em!

     Conners glares at Dekker.

                          CONNERS
                    (to the second)
                The rest of you, come with us.

     The OFFICERS rush to protect the HOSTAGES, pull them to
     safety. CAMERA CREWS and REPORTERS pounce on the
     opportunity.

     Conners and Dekker lead the charge inside, guns drawn.

51   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                              51

     EMERGENCY LIGHTS BURN! GLASS CRACKLES UNDER FOOT as Conners,
     Dekker and the Officers move through. Caution with each
     step.

     The lobby's clear.   Conners pulls the Officers close.

                          CONNERS
                    (whispers; to Dekker)
                We split up.
                    (whispers; to the officers)
                You two with him. You two with me.
                    (to Dekker)
                Check the back.

     Dekker nods, leads his group away.      Conner proceeds...

52   BEHIND THE COUNTERS--                                              52

     Nothing. Conners spots a DOOR in the back marked, "Bank
     Employees Only."

53   THE VAULT--                                                        53

     Dekker checks it out, but it's empty. The remnants of the
     explosion remain. Suddenly... THE GENERATORS ROAR TO LIFE!
     THE POWER BLINKS BACK ON!

     Dekker jumps, startled by the sudden blast of lights.

54    EMPLOYEE'S ONLY OFFICE--                                       54

      ALL THE LIGHTS COME UP, as...   Conners KICKS IN THE DOOR,
      but... It's empty.

55    A BANK CORRIDOR--                                              55

      Dekker leads his group. His heart POUNDING THROUGH HIS
      CHEST. His Gun up and ready. Suddenly...

      A NOISE up ahead... He bares down, takes a DEEP BREATH,
      carefully proceeds until... Teddy and Vincent emerge. Teddy
      EXHALES, lowers her weapon. So does Dekker.

55A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                        55A

      Conners strides out from behind the counters...

                           CONNERS
                     (to Vincent)
                 See anyone come your way?

                            VINCENT
                 No.   No one went by me.

      The SWAT COMMANDER approaches holding a couple of the BLACK
      MASKS, some BLACK BODY ARMOR.

                           SWAT COMMANDER
                 Detectives... We found these.

      Conners takes one of the masks in his hands.

                           CONNERS
                 We let them walk right past us.

      Dekker, Teddy, the SWAT Commander, Officers, Vincent and the
      SWAT Team stand in the middle of the lobby, STUNNED.
      Conners, his anger SIMMERS TO A BOIL, until finally...

                            CONNERS
                 SHIT!

                                                         TIME CUT TO:

56    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - 11:48 AM - DAY                 56

      An OFFICER unfurls a FRESH ROLL of "POLICE: CAUTION" TAPE
      around the scene. Still mayhem, but gradually coming under
      control.

      Police interview HOSTAGES, so do REPORTERS. PARAMEDICS
      administer oxygen. Two CORONERS load the EAGER TELLER's body
      into their truck.

57   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                         57

     Vincent, covered in debris, confers with Conners.

                          VINCENT
                We got the one Teller dead, the two
                that were strung up are alive, but in
                critical condition. A few SWAT
                incurred 2nd degree burns, but that's
                the worst of it. Now, depending on who
                you talk to... there was anywhere from
                five to nine perps. And nobody got a
                good look at any of'em, wore their
                masks the whole time. Dax is rounding
                up the security tapes now. That should
                give us a firm number.

                          CONNERS
                I want background checks on every
                hostage. They're all suspects until
                they're not.

                          VINCENT
                You don't think one of them's still
                here?

                          CONNERS
                After this, nothing would surprise me.

58   EXT.   TECH VAN - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                58

     Dax pulls cables, power cords, etc., getting set to go inside
     with them. Dekker approaches.

                          DEKKER
                Excuse me... I need to listen to the
                conversation between Lorenz and Conners
                again?

                          DAX
                It'll have to wait.

                            DEKKER
                How long?

                           DAX
                Hour.   Maybe more.

                          DEKKER
                    (too long)
                Show me how to play it myself?

      SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004        29.


                          DAX
                Look, this isn't how it works. I don't
                take orders from you. I don't know you
                and NO ONE touches my stuff. You're
                going to have to wait.

     Dax gets his shit, starts to go. Dekker waits, then proceeds
     into the van. Dax turns, notices.

59   INT.   TECH VAN                                              59

     Dekker inspects the equipment, when...

                          DAX
                What the hell are you doing?

                          DEKKER
                Along with whatever they stole and this
                war zone they left behind... A man's
                dead, and the killers are running free.
                I don't have time to wait.
                    (looks at the equipment)
                I'll figure it out. Thanks for your
                help.

                          DAX
                    (relents, demonstrates)
                Here. This DAT machine. Play, stop,
                rewind... It's just like using a tape
                player. Headphones are jacked in.
                Tape's already inside.

                             DEKKER
                Thank you.

60   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                          60

     A CAR PULLS UP... Jenkins steps out. Stares out over the
     scene, the mess. He's a volcano ready to erupt.

61   INT.   SECURITY ROOM - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                61

     A SERIES OF EIGHT BLACK AND WHITE VIDEO MONITORS... as we
     rewind. SEVEN of the eight show recorded images of the bank.
     The eighth shows only STATIC. Dax sits in front of the
     monitors. Conners stands nearby.

                          CONNERS
                    (re: the eighth monitor)
                What's with this one?

                          DAX
                That's the camera in the vault.      It
                blew in the first explosion.

      SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004          30.


     The SEVEN DIFFERENT MONITORS all begin in sync.

     ON SCREEN... TIMECODE burns in the corner. The HOSTAGES are
     dragged across the LOBBY, where the Black Clads hook them up
     to the pulleys. The Black Clads get into position.

     Conners CAREFULLY scrutinizes the images.

     ON SCREEN... THE TIMECODE CLOCK:    Hits "11:15:00 AM" and...
     STATIC FILLS THE SCREENS!

                          DAX
                That's when you cut the power.

                          CONNERS
                So we can't ID them.

                          DAX
                There's a four minute, fifty-two second
                gap, before the image returns. But...

                          CONNERS
                They're long gone by then.
                    (beat; thinks)
                Go to the head of the tapes, from when
                they first went in. Document each move
                they've made for the two hours they
                were inside.

                          DAX
                You got it. Hey... Awful lotta news
                cameras outside. Maybe one got a look
                at them coming out?

                          CONNERS
                    (good idea)
                Have Vincent check it out.

     Teddy enters...

                          TEDDY
                Conners, you better come out here.

62   INT.   LOBBY                                                    62

     Conners and Teddy walk in to discover...    Captain Jenkins
     confers with FOUR FBI AGENTS in suits.

                          CONNERS
                    (to Teddy)
                Shit. Feds.

     Jenkins turns to Conners, gestures him over.

                Detective Conners, join us, would you?

63   INT.   TECH VAN                                               63

     Dekker listens through HEADPHONES makes notes as he goes.

                          CONNERS (VO)
                    (beat; stern)
                What does that mean?

                          LORENZ (VO)
                Theory... put to practice isn't always
                perfect. Can't expect to keep the
                hostages in check if a bad deed goes
                unpunished or they may... randomly
                decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
                order to it.

     Dekker, hits STOP, then REWIND.     He checks his...

     IN HIS NOTEBOOK--

     Several words and phrases fill the page. "Lorenz, sunrise,
     Pro Theory, 40 hostages, Theory, Randomly Revolt, and Chaos."

     DEKKER studies the words intently, figuring something out.
     He presses PLAY on the DAT machine.

                          LORENZ (VO)
                Theory... put to practice isn't always
                perfect. Can't expect to keep the
                hostages in check if a bad deed goes
                unpunished or they may... randomly
                decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
                order to it.

     Dekker presses STOP. Dekker finds a pattern, circles the
     words, "Lorenz, Chaos, Theory."

64   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                         64

     Conners, Jenkins and Teddy converse with AGENT VICTOR DOYLE,
     40's, and the BANK MANAGER still a bit rattled.

                          AGENT DOYLE
                Prince Amar Alle Alban is one of the
                wealthiest and least popular Arabs in
                the Middle East. There's been
                countless threats on his life and
                fortune in the past. But for better of
                worse... he is an ally to the United
                States. The Prince keeps a safe
                deposit box in twenty institutions

 SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004     32.

                    AGENT DOYLE (cont'd)
          across the country. Along with this
          bank, he also had a box at Eastern
          Federal Savings in Charlotte, North
          Carolina, which was hit last month.
          Same M.O.

                    TEDDY
          What was in the box?

                    BANK MANAGER
          We don't keep records. The boxes are
          private. Since 9/11, we screen for
          live tissue, viruses or explosives, but
          if it passes those tests, we don't ask.

                    CONNERS
          This is all real fascinating shit, but
          what about the money? Bank robbers
          still like cash, don't they?

                    BANK MANAGER
          The cash drawers don't appear touched.
          Neither does the cash vault.

                    TEDDY
          So they broke into a bank and didn't
          steal any money?

Odd glances all about.

                    AGENT DOYLE
          We believe the Prince's box was the
          target. We're trying to reach him now.

                       JENKINS
          Thank you.

Agent Doyle and the Bank Manager leave.

                     JENKINS
          Helluva come back, Conners. Are you
          familiar with the term franchise-sized
          fuck-up...

                    CONNERS
          Depends, are we talking about your sex
          life? Because I've heard shortcomings.

                    JENKINS
          You got played, Quentin.
          Congratulations, you just topped Pearl
          Street Bridge.

                            TEDDY
                 That's not fair. It was by the book.
                 Everything was according to standard
                 procedure.

      Jenkins ignores Teddy.

                           CONNERS
                 You came to me. I didn't ask for this.

                           JENKINS
                 Commissioner's office is scrambling to
                 cover their ass. They need a
                 scapegoat... And I have zero problems
                 serving you up.

                           CONNERS
                 You wanted this to happen.

                           JENKINS
                 No. But if it had to happen to
                 somebody.

      Jenkins exits.

64A   EXT.   AT THE TECH VAN - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY      64A

      Conners approaches...

                           DEKKER
                 I think this Lorenz was trying to tell
                 us something.

                           CONNERS
                 You don't say.

                           DEKKER
                 The way he spoke... he paused before
                 certain words. Have you ever heard of
                 the Chaos Theory?

                            CONNERS
                 What?

65    INT.   DINER NEAR THE BANK - DAY                               65

      A grade "B" rating, tops.   CUSTOMERS dine, choke down coffee.

      AT A BOOTH--

      Empty plates and crumpled napkins litter the table. Conners
      finishes a cup of coffee, enjoys a slice of pie. Dekker, all
      about work, goes over his notes.

                    DEKKER
          Edward Lorenz invented the Chaos Theory
          in the 1960's. It's the study of
          phenomena that appear random, but in
          fact have an element of regularity
          which can be described mathematically.

                    CONNERS
              (confused)
          Try that again?

                    DEKKER
          Pretty much... initial state of events
          may seem unrelated and random, but
          eventually patterns emerge and in the
          end all the pieces fit together.

The Waitress refills Conners' coffee, lays down the check.

                    WAITRESS
          Anything else, officers?

                    CONNERS
          That'll be all.
              (to Dekker)
          You're a College boy. Which one?
          Someplace I've heard of or one of those
          inbred state schools no one's heard of?

                    DEKKER
          U Dub.

                    CONNERS
          Not exactly Princeton, but not bad.
          How did you end up on the force?

                    DEKKER
          It's kind of the family business.

                    CONNERS
          Family business? What, your Dad, Dad's
          Dad and so on and so back?

Dekker squirms when it comes to revealing personal info.

                    DEKKER
          Do we really need all this "get to know
          you" crap? Couple hours ago you didn't
          give a shit.

                    CONNERS
          You've grown on me. Besides, I am
          entrusting my life to you. I should
          know something about you. I would

                    CONNERS (cont'd)
          think you'd like to know a little
          something about me.

                    DEKKER
          I know about you, Detective.      Everyone
          does.

                    CONNERS
          You don't say that with much
          enthusiasm.

                    DEKKER
          Not much to be enthusiastic about.

Conners reaches his limit.      Time to put him in place.

                    CONNERS
          Listen, my reputation often proceeds me.
          You, however, have no reputation; a fact I
          need to deal with. After you've been
          through the shit I have, then you can judge
          me. Now... we can try to work together,
          make the best of a bad situation or we can
          compare Dick sizes all day... Up to you.
          But since this is your first day here...
          today... mine's bigger.

                    VINCENT (VO)
              (over radio)
          Conners, come in?

Both men hold steely stares on one another.     Until...

                      CONNERS
                (into radio)
          Go.

                    VINCENT (VO)
          Got something you'll want to see.

Conners drops a TEN DOLLAR BILL on the table.

                    CONNERS
          Lastly... I don't like the Pac-10.
          It's overrated. I'm an Ivy League guy.

Conners gets up, heads for the door.

Dekker, humbled, scoops up Conners's ten, puts it in his
wallet and drops a twenty down on the table, slides out of
the booth.

66    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                              66

      Conners, Dekker and Teddy approach a NEWS TRUCK. Vincent
      stands with Karen Cross and her CAMERAMAN who sports TWO
      BLACK EYES AND A BLOODY NOSE.

                           KAREN CROSS
                     (to Conners; w/ a smile)
                 Detective... Can't keep away from me,
                 can you?

      Conners ignores her, but Dekker doesn't.   He gives her the
      ONCE OVER. She notices, smiles.

                            VINCENT
                 Watch.

      He points to a monitor in the van, presses PLAY.

      A SHAGGY BROWN HAIRED MAN, 40's, with a MOUSTACHE and an
      ANGRY EXPRESSION, CHARGES TOWARDS THE CAMERA and BARRELS OVER
      IT! KNOCKS the Camera and the Cameraman DOWN!

                Only thing on file is in Spokane, but I
                recall he did have a girlfriend in
                town. Gina, I believe.

67   EXT.   BIKER BAR - LOWER CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - 1:13 PM - DAY        67

     The streets are quiet. A ROW OF HARLEY DAVIDSONS park in
     front. Above the bar, a small, lower class apartment
     complex.

68   INT.   HALLWAY - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT                             68

     TWO POLICE OFFICERS along with Conners, Dekker, Teddy and
     VINCENT position themselves by the APARTMENT. Vincent knocks
     his fist on the door...

                          VINCENT
                Gina, it's the police.    Open up.

     There's no response.   But SOUNDS can be heard on the opposite
     side of the door.

                          VINCENT
                    (Pounds louder)
                We can hear you.

     Again no response.   It's quiet.    Too quiet.

                    (to Vincent; low)
                Step back. Clear the door.     Now.

     Just as Vincent does...

     BAM! A GUNSHOT BLOWS APART THE DOOR!     Fired from the inside
     of the apartment!

     BAM! BAM! BAM! The BLASTS KEEP COMING!          Everyone's pinned
     down, on the defensive.

     A WOMAN SCREAMS FROM INSIDE THE APARTMENT!

     Dekker gathers himself together.

     Conners TURNS INTO THE OPEN DOORWAY, FIRES A FULL CLIP INTO
     THE APARTMENT!

      Conners reloads.     Everything's quiet.   Conners looks...

69    IN THE APARTMENT--                                                  69

      A THIN LAYER OF SMOKE hovers.     But that's all.    Nobody in
      sight.

70    IN THE APARTMENT HALLWAY--                                          70

      Conners steps inside, just as he reaches the living room...

      BAM!   ANOTHER BLAST!    This one FROM THE BEDROOM!

      Conners DROPS TO THE FLOOR, falls back into the kitchen!

                              TEDDY
                 QUENTIN!

      Dekker enters the apartment.

      Dekker passes the kitchen door, looks in on Conners.

                              DEKKER
                 You hit?

      heads that way.

      Dekker DUCKS BACK into the living room. He aims his gun into
      the bedroom without looking... RAPID FIRES!

      Richards scrambles out.

71B   INT.    BEDROOM/ LIVING ROOM - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT            71B

      Dekker looks inside the bedroom, doesn't see Richards.     He
      takes one step inside when...

      GINA, 20's, Latino, wearing only a pair of red panties with
      NO BRA, runs up behind Dekker and JUMPS ON HIS BACK, FISTS
      FLYING!

      Dekker pushes her down, aims his gun at her.

                               DEKKER
                  Stay down!

      Vincent enters, grabs Gina.

                            DEKKER
                  Control her!

      He does.    Dekker runs to the bedroom window, peeks out

      DEKKER hops onto the fire escape, hoofs down the iron stairs.

      Richards... drops to the pavement.      Heads for the street.

      DEKKER, a flight from the bottom, realizes his disadvantage
      and HURLS himself over the rail! Hits the ground HARD,
      WIPES OUT!

      Jumps up, shaking it off.    STAYS IN PURSUIT!

77    EXT.   BIKER BAR - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT - DAY                       77

      Dekker races around the corner...    A FORD F-350 SPINS the
      corner. Targeting DEKKER!

      Dekker jerks out his Glock.    FIRES!

      BULLETS RICOCHET OFF THE GRILL, SPARKS FLY! Windshield
      spiderwebs. But this train ain't slowing down.

      The F-350 swerves, clips a Harley.

      Dekker JUMPS before impact, bounces off the hood and rolls
      away.

      The truck hits the street, speeds away.

      Dekker, grimacing through the pain, scrapes himself off the
      pavement. Dekker's eyes dance... spot THE HARLEYS.

                  I'm a police officer in pursuit of a

      Richards' Truck speeds around a SLOW MOVING VEHICLE and whips

      The Slow Vehicle skids to a stop! Dekker's hog, cuts inside,
      between the vehicle and the sidewalk, rips into the alley.

      Richards fishtails down the alley. Barely maintaining

      obstacle course. Dekker pursues.

      Richards barrels out of the alley, through the intersection
      and into another alley. Opposing traffic skids out. ANGRY
      DRIVERS let him have it.

      Dekker skids sideways, steers around the blockage.     Catches
      sight of...

      DOWN THE BLOCK...   A PATROL CAR speeds down Hastings Street.

      Dekker revs the engine, maneuvers around the ANGRY DRIVERS
      and follows Richards into the SECOND ALLEY!

      Richards races, checks the rearview mirror...      Dekker's Hog
      closing in.

      UP AHEAD...   The alley exits onto RICHARDS STREET.

      Richards approaches the mouth of the alley, just as A STREET
      CLEANER appears, starts to block the exit.

      Richards STAMPS ON THE ACCELERATOR, speeds through the small
      opening, just past the Street Cleaner!

      Dekker's not so lucky. Sees the Street Cleaner too late...
      Lays out the hog and rolls just as... The Hog slides into
      the Street Cleaner!

78E   I/E   RICHARDS' TRUCK/ STREET INTERSECTION/ PATROL CAR - DAY 78E

      Dekker gets up, looks down the street, SEES...

      Richards getting away, speeds down the street, through
      another intersection, when...

      CRASH! Conners, in a patrol car, plows into the rear of the
      truck, spinning it around.

      Dekker races towards the crash site.

      Conners climbs out of the car.

      Richards shakes his head, clearing it. Blood squirts from
      his mouth. He sees, through the windshield, Conners coming
      for him. He scrambles for his handgun, looks up to see
      Conners, but he's not there. Richards turns as...

      Conners appears in the Driver's side window, grabs the back
      of Richards' head and SLAMS it into the steering wheel!
      Again!

      Conners reaches inside, grabs the handgun.   As Dekker
      arrives...

                           RICHARDS
                 I want... my... lawyer.

                 He's unconscious, with a nice knot on

                       CONNERS
          I'm fine.

Conners and Teddy share a look, when...   Dekker enters.

                    DEKKER
          Girl's name is Gina Lopez, twenty-
          eight. Done some time for possession,
          has two kids... Am I interrupting?

                       CONNERS
          No.

                       TEDDY
          Excuse me.

Teddy exits.

                    DEKKER
          Gina claims she doesn't know anything
          about a bank robbery.

                    CONNERS
          Of course she doesn't.   Vincent!

Vincent trudges out of the kitchen.

                    CONNERS
          Have'em put Ms. Lopez in interrogation
          one and turn the A/C on full. Leave
          her alone and cold. Let me know when
          her nipples can cut glass.

                    VINCENT
          Will do.
              (To Dekker)
          Detective... I didn't realize when we
          first met who you were. I worked with
          your father. It was only for a brief
          time when I first got outta the
          academy, but it was an honor.

                    CONNERS
              (surprised)
          Your father was Harry Dekker?

                    VINCENT
          I wish it could've been for longer.

                       DEKKER
          Thanks.

Vincent exits. Conners looks at Dekker in a new light.
Dekker starts away, until...

                         CONNERS
                   (new subject)
               That was some fancy riding.    You have a
               bike?

                         DEKKER
               Used to, but I sold it.
                   (shows his scrape on his arm)
               They're dangerous.

     MARNIE ROLLINS, 20's, a CSI OFFICER, wears gloves, pokes her
     head in the room.

                         MARNIE
               Detectives. Ready for you.

80   THE BEDROOM--                                                    80

     TWO LARGE SUITCASES rest OPEN on the bed.   Marnie prepares a
     report.

                         CONNERS
               Somebody going on a trip?

                         MARNIE
               Looks like it, don't it?

                         CONNERS
               Marnie, you're looking well.

                         MARNIE
               Heard you were back, Conners... and
               keep dreaming.

     Marnie gives DEKKER an amorous glance, which he returns.

                          MARNIE
                    (to Dekker)
               You, on the other hand... I gotta bike
               myself. Maybe we can go for a ride
               sometime? Or maybe I can just ride
               you.

     Conners looks at both of them.

                         CONNERS
               Can we get back to work?

                         MARNIE
               We got passports, sun tan lotion,
               Bermuda shorts, thong bikini, hopefully
               hers and this...

She opens a LARGE DUFFEL BAG. Conners and Dekker look inside
the bag... It's FULL OF CASH! All denominations.

                    DEKKER
          Must be a fifty large there easy.    His
          cut?

                    MARNIE
          You'd think, right?

                      DEKKER
          It's not?

                    MARNIE
          Don't put words in my mouth, but...
          Two things jump out here. First, each
          bank branch has their own money bands.
          This is not American National's. After
          a little checking, it belongs to
          Pacific Savings of Seattle.

                    DEKKER
          That sounds familiar.

                    MARNIE
          It should. Four months ago, a half
          million dollars was stolen in an armed
          robbery there. Just a smash-n-grab
          job. They caught the guys a day later,
          recovering about $400,000. Those guys
          have been in lock up since and their
          trial's still pending. Which leads us
          to point number two. Do you smell
          that?

                    DEKKER
              (smells the bills; grimaces)
          What is it?

                    MARNIE
          When evidence is taken in, any physical
          contact might affect the ability to
          lift prints, so, to mark it, we now
          spray a scented solution directly on
          the bill.

                    CONNERS
          Is that new?

                    MARNIE
          Wave of the future.   Gotta keep up with
          the times, Conners.

                           DEKKER
                 So this money's not from our bank.

                           MARNIE
                 No. This is the money from the Pacific
                 Savings job and our evidence room.
                     (smiling; to Dekker)
                 Now... For a list of things you can
                 put in my mouth.

81   INT.   HALLWAY - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT - DAY                   81

     Conners and Dekker confer with Teddy and Vincent.

                           CONNERS
                 Do you remember who headed up the
                 Pacific Savings case?

                           TEDDY
                 I think it was Callo.    Why?

                              CONNERS
                 No reason.     Just thinking out loud.

82   I/E    CONNERS'S CAR/ CITY STREETS - DAY                       82

     Conners and Dekker head back to the police station.   It's
     quiet between these two, until...

                           CONNERS
                 When you said it was your "family
                 business" I didn't think... I guess I
                 just didn't connect the dots.

                           DEKKER
                 Don't worry about it.

                           CONNERS
                 Your father was a hero.

                           DEKKER
                 Yes he was.

                           CONNERS
                 At first I thought maybe you were
                 related to the Captain.

                            DEKKER
                 No.   No relation.

                           CONNERS
                 The Captain, he just kind of
                 "discovered" you. Through the academy,
                 to excellent evaluation reports, while

                on the beat, to the high test scores on
                the detective's exam.

                          DEKKER
                Something like that.

                          CONNERS
                That's how he found me.

     This surprises Dekker.

                          CONNERS
                Maybe we're not as different as you
                think.

83   INT.   INTERROGATION ROOM - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT         83

     A small, cold room with a large mirror along the WEST WALL.

     Gina sits at the table, shivering. Her breath visible, so
     are her nipples through a WHITE, SEATTLE P.D. T-SHIRT.
     Conners paces around her like a CIRCLING SHARK. Dekker's in
     the corner, observing.

                          CONNERS
                We found the money.

                          GINA
                That money was Dwayne's...

                          CONNERS
                That money came from our evidence room.

                          GINA
                I told you. I don't know nothing about
                a bank robbery. Whatever Damon was
                into, I didn't know!

                          CONNERS
                So, where were you going?

                            GINA
                Vacation.

                          CONNERS
                This isn't possession or solicitation,
                Gina. This is felony-murder one. You
                could get life.

                           GINA
                Me!?   I didn't do nothing!

 SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004          48.


                    CONNERS
              (frustrated)
          It's "I didn't do anything." "Didn't
          do nothing" is a double negative,
          infers the positive. The grammar in
          this country sucks.

                    GINA
          Then I didn't do ANY-thing!

Conners takes a seat next to Gina.    His EYES BURN through
her.

                    CONNERS
          This isn't going away. You want to
          walk out of here, you tell me
          something... now.

                    GINA
          I swear I don't know. Now I'm done
          talking. I want a lawyer.

Dekker lowers his head.    Disappointed.

                    CONNERS
          You sure that's what you want?

                    GINA
          Yeah.

                    CONNERS
          Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll
          make. The first will be to the public
          defender's office. The second to
          children's services.

                    GINA
          What?

Suddenly Gina's bravado disappears.    Suddenly a scared and
lonely girl.

                    CONNERS
          It's simple... if you insist on a
          lawyer, I take your kids.

                    GINA
          No.

                    CONNERS
          Not like you cared about them anyway.
          You were ready to fly the coop with
          "Shit-for-brains."

                           GINA
                No.   You can't do that.

                          CONNERS
                I can and I will.

                           GINA
                Don't.

                          CONNERS
                Tell me what I want to know!

     Dekker stares incredulously at Conners.

                          GINA
                    (broken)
                I don't know anything.     Please don't
                take my kids. Please.

     Conners stares into Gina's eyes. She's telling the truth.
     Conners wraps his coat around Gina's shoulders.

                          CONNERS
                Get her some coffee...     Something hot.

84   INT.   BULLPEN - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY             84

     Dekker and Conners...

                          DEKKER
                You believe her?

                          CONNERS
                I think for the first time in that
                girl's life she's telling the truth.

                          DEKKER
                You had to know, once she asked for a
                lawyer anything she told us would have
                been inadmissable.

                          CONNERS
                Who would've known? It would've been
                my word against hers. Who do you think
                the jury would've believed?

                Justice by any means.    Even if you
                cross the line.

                The only line around here is the `blue

     STEEL CAGE protects the contents.

     AT THE FRONT COUNTER--

     Conners and Dekker wait. No one's working at present.
     Dekker peers inside, anxiously looking for someone.

     Dekker RINGS the service bell.

     Finally... HARRY HUME, 50's, the cop on watch, limps to the
     desk. Crotchety, with an overgrown belly, Frank's seen
     better days. There's no love loss between Harry and Conners.

                           CONNERS
                    (cold)
                Buzz us in.

                          HARRY
                    (colder)
                You gotta sign first.

     Conners and Dekker scribble their signatures down.

                          HARRY
                I heard you were back. Kinda liked not
                having you around, Conners.

     Harry takes the clipboard, examines it until satisfied.   Then
     reluctantly BUZZES them in.

                          CONNERS
                Have another donut, Frankie.

     Dekker and Conners proceed inside. They walk ALONG THE VAST
     ROWS OF EVIDENCE, scan the shelves, checking the number.

      Finally, finding the right row, they turn in.

                          DEKKER
                You'd have to have some major
                firepower, not to mention an extra
                large set of balls to try and knock off

      box. After a few moments, grabs a clipboard.

                          HARRY
                Here is it. Line seventeen.

                          DEKKER
                Bernie Callo.

                          HARRY
                Like I said... No one takes anything
                out of here, unless they sign for it.

                             CONNERS
                So what...     He showed you a warrant?
                What?

                          HARRY
                He must've.

                          CONNERS
                You don't remember?

                          HARRY
                You know how many times someone signs
                shit in and out? I see the same guys
                all the time. I can't remember one
                instance two weeks ago. But if his
                signature's there, that means he signed
                for it. Take it up with him!

86   INT.   CAPTAIN JENKINS'S OFFICE - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT      86

     Jenkins listens as Conners and crew brief the situation.

                          CONNERS
                The money from Richards's place traced
                back to the Pacific Savings heist a few
                months ago, a case Callo headed up.

                          TEDDY
                Callo signed the money out of evidence
                two weeks ago.

                            JENKINS
                How much?

                            TEDDY
                $433,000.

                          VINCENT
                If it's Callo, it would explain how
                they knew police protocol and how our
                department operates.

                          TEDDY
                Also explains why he was so pissed this
                morning about being replaced by
                Conners. He wanted to be the point so
                everything went according to plan.

                          CONNERS
                He doesn't need another reason to be
                pissed at me.

                          JENKINS
                What about motive?    Do we have one?

                          VINCENT
                Pressure might've been getting to him.
                He's been getting the cold shoulder
                from cops since he testified about
                Pearl Street Bridge.

                           JENKINS
                No.   Don't buy that.

                           TEDDY
                    (beat)
                He was also getting divorced.

     This is news to everyone.

                          TEDDY
                About a month ago, he told me he and
                his wife might be splitting. Asked if
                I knew a lawyer who wouldn't clean him
                out. I didn't think it was this bad.

                          JENKINS
                    (conflicted)
                Bernie Callo is a first rate cop.     A
                boy scout. This doesn't make any
                sense.

                          CONNERS
                They never do, Captain.

                          JENKINS
                Don't act like you're not enjoying
                this, Conners. I know what you think
                of him.

                          CONNERS
                Doesn't matter what I think.      Facts
                here speak for themselves.

                          DEKKER
                No they don't. We haven't asked the
                question... Why, if Callo's involved,
                don't they ask for him at the bank?
                    (points to Conners)
                They asked for you.

     All eyes find Conners.   Then, Jenkins' PHONE RINGS...

                          JENKINS
                    (answering the phone)
                Jenkins.

87   EXT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME - 4:18 PM - DAY                       87

     The small home in a RURAL AREA is now COMPLETELY SURROUNDED
     by COP CARS.

88   INT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME                                       88

     A typical family-themed home. FAMILY PICTURES adorn the
     walls. Everything in its right place. Except for... MRS.
     CALLO, 40's, sits in the kitchen SOBBING. Police encircle
     her.

     In the center of the Living Room... BERNIE CALLO LIES DEAD,
     a bullet wound right between the eyes.

      SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004           54.


     SEVERAL UNIFORMED OFFICERS and CSI OFFICERS muddle through
     every nook and cranny of the tiny home. Conners, Teddy and
     Dekker are led around by a UNIFORMED OFFICER...

                          OFFICER AT CALLO HOUSE
                Wife came home approximately forty-five
                minutes ago. Found him here. None of
                the neighbors heard anything. There's
                no forced entry and no one saw anyone
                fleeing the scene.

     Vincent enters from the basement carrying a LARGE BOX.

                          VINCENT
                Blueprints from the bank, schematics,
                pictures... Also, about a dozen
                internet articles on the Saudi Prince.
                Found it behind the furnace.

     Conners nods.

                          DEKKER
                Well, that's it, right?

     Suddenly... THE HOUSE TELEPHONE RINGS! Everyone peers
     around. After the second ring, the ANSWERING MACHINE PICKS
     UP...

                          CALLO (VO)
                You've reached the Callo residence.   No
                one can get to the phone right now.
                Please leave a message.

     Then...   After the TONE...

                          LORENZ (VO)
                    (from the machine)
                Detective Conners... Are you there?

     Conners and everyone turns, listens.

     INTERCUT WITH:

89   INT.   DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    89

     Lorenz stares ahead, transfixed by something.

                          LORENZ
                Are you connecting the dots? Are you
                putting it together? Is the pattern
                emerging? They wouldn't punish you,
                but I will.

     Conners GRABS the phone...

                Vengeance will be mine, Detective.

                          CONNERS
                Then come and get me you piece of shit.

     Lorenz smiles, hangs up.   He resumes staring at the wall in
     front of him.

90   EXT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME - DAY                                 90

     Dekker leans back against the car, Conners approaches...

                          CONNERS
                What they told Callo was the plan and what
                the plan really was may be two different
                things. Clearly this wasn't part of a plan
                Callo would've agreed with.

                          DEKKER
                You'd think a cop would be smarter.

                          CONNERS
                As cops we come across every temptation
                in the book. Money, drugs, power.
                We'd all like to think we can resist
                any urge, but... We're not saints.

                          DEKKER
                So, Callo was involved and now they're
                dragging you into it. Why?

                          CONNERS
                Man said he wanted vengeance.

                          DEKKER
                Piss anyone off lately?

                           CONNERS
                Me?

     Both can't help but smile.      Jenkins walks up.

                          JENKINS
                I just got off the phone with Agent
                Doyle. After the Charlotte break in,
                the Prince withdrew all his possessions
                from every safe deposit box in this
                country.

        SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004       56.


                            DEKKER
                  Let me get this straight, they didn't
                  touch the cash or the safe deposit
                  boxes. So, they... break into a bank,
                  blow it up, and steal nothing?
                      (to Conners)
                  Still make sense to you?

                            CONNERS
                  Nothing about today makes sense.

       Dekker watches as BERNIE CALLO's body is loaded into the
       Coroner's vehicle. Teddy assists MRS. CALLO into a police
       car. Vincent carries the box of evidence from the home.

       Dekker's mind works overtime, then...

                             DEKKER
                  "Return to the earth now if your mind
                  is troubled and your heart is
                  uncertain. For it is by returning to
                  the beginning that we can clearly see
                  the path."

       Conners and Jenkins share a confused look.

                            CONNERS
                      (to Jenkins)
                  Don't look at me, he's your find.

                            JENKINS
                  Say that again, Detective?

                            DEKKER
                  We go back to where this all started.
                  We go to the bank.

91     EXT.   SEATTLE - 6:08 PM - NIGHT                              91

       The sun SINKS below the horizon.

       As night settles, POLICE and EMT workers are still on site.

92     INT.   SECURITY ROOM - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                 92

       Dekker and Conners watch as Dax operates.

                            DAX
                  The tapes confirm five bad guys, but
                  since the vault cam blew in the
                  explosion what they did in there was a
                  mystery.

 SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004             57.


ON A COMPUTER MONITOR - The EIGHT SECURITY CAMERA ANGLES
appear.

ON THE MULTIPLE SCREENS... Just as in the opening, Lorenz
leads this crew through the bank. Immediately the group
splits up. IN THE VAULT... One of the Black Clads arrives
and radios in.

                    DAX
          I've been through these tapes twenty
          times already and nothing...

                      CONNERS
          Shutup.

MONITOR #5... IN THE VAULT, Black Clad #2 fires the
explosives! The image goes to STATIC.

                    DEKKER
          Wait, hold on a second.   Did you see it?

                      DAX
          See what?

                    DEKKER
          Go back a little.

                      CONNERS
          What?

                    DEKKER
          Notice the camera angles, they're all
          fixed. They don't rotate or pan.

Dax rewinds, to before the explosion...

                    DEKKER
          There. Stop. Play it. Look closely,
          camera five, the vault cam, dominates
          our attention because of the explosion.
          But while that's happening, check out
          Camera two, customer service.

ON SCREEN... Several BANK EMPLOYEES cower to the Black Clad.
Suddenly, another Black Clad DISAPPEARS UNDERNEATH THE
SECURITY CAMERA.

                    DAX
          Where'd he go?

ON SCREEN... As the EXPLOSION GOES OFF, CAMERA #2 PANS AWAY
FROM THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SECTION, TOWARDS THE LOBBY.

                He moved it. Changed the angle.    He
                didn't want us to see something.

                           DEKKER
                What's in that corner they didn't want
                us to see?

     Dax rewinds the tapes again, before the camera was moved and
     FREEZES FRAME ON: a lone COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.

93   INT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                                 93

     AT THE COMPUTER TERMINAL... A FORENSICS TECHNICIAN, 30's,
     carefully dusts the computer keyboard for fingerprints.

     Dekker and Conners look on.

                          DEKKER
                Are you at all concerned that there's
                some whacko out there looking to get
                you?

                          CONNERS
                If I worried about every threat made
                against me, I'd never leave the house.

     The Technician turns on a BLACK LIGHT and... FINGERPRINTS
     APPEAR ALL OVER THE KEYBOARD!

     Conners looks to Dekker, impressed.

                          CONNERS
                    (to the technician)
                Those are priority one. If he's got a

                I'm on my way.

                          CONNERS
                Dax, can you hack in there and find out

     greets Conners and Dekker.

                Detective, where you been? Much too
                long. Sit, sit. I give you best table

                          ITALIAN HOST
                No matter, no matter...     I bring you
                bottle of house wine!

                          DEKKER
                We're still on duty.     No wine.

                          ITALIAN HOST
                    (insulted)
                No wine?

                          CONNERS
                A little wine.

                          ITALIAN HOST
                That's better.

     They get to the table, Conners looks at it.

                          CONNERS
                Last time I was here, you said that
                table in the corner was the "best in
                the house."

                         ITALIAN HOST
               It was. Anywhere you sit becomes best
               table in house. Now relax, I bring you
               food.

95   LATER, STILL AT THE RESTAURANT--                               95

     A PIANO PLAYER recreates the sweet sounds of Italy.   PATRONS
     sing along. Eating, drinking and being merry.

     AT THE DETECTIVE'S TABLE--

     Vincent and Teddy have joined Conners and Dekker. A MOUNTAIN
     OF FOOD still remains. A COUPLE BOTTLES OF WINE have been
     consumed, empty plates and basket rolls spread about. The
     mood is happy, light. Not thinking about their day.

     Conners tells an anecdote, something that Teddy and Vincent
     have heard before, but don't care. Dekker watches the
     Detectives, admires in their closeness.

                         CONNERS
               Shane, what was that thing you said
               back at the house about "returning to
               the beginning path" or something?

                         DEKKER
               It's a Buddhist story.

                         CONNERS
               We're all ears.

                         DEKKER
               One day the Buddha found his heart in
               turmoil. So he retreats to the forest,
               to the earth, to the base of a great
               tree and, I'm paraphrasing, but... this
               elephant comes up and tells Buddha he
               doesn't like seeing him discouraged.

                         TEDDY
               He can talk to an elephant?

                         DEKKER
               He's the Buddha. He's attained the 6th
               level of consciousness. He's capable
               of communicating with plants, trees...
               even rocks.

                            VINCENT
               Rocks?

                            DEKKER
               You asked.

                       CONNERS
          Continue.

                    DEKKER
          The Buddha was troubled so he went back
          to where he came from, the beginning,
          to find the path, the answer. So when
          you hit a dead end, go back to the
          beginning to find your way. Or
          something like that.

                    CONNERS
          We have a genuine philosopher in our
          midst.

                    VINCENT
          You're a Buddhist?

                   DEKKER
          No. Just something I picked up along
          the way.

                    TEDDY
          But you're religious?

                    DEKKER
          Not particularly.

Conners stares curiously at his new partner.   Then excuses
himself to go to the men's room.

                    DEKKER
          You're all pretty tight.

                    TEDDY
          We've been through a lot together.

                    DEKKER
          I guess I just thought... I don't
          know. With all the trouble he's been
          in lately, coming back from suspension,
          everyone would treat him differently.

                    VINCENT
          You can't believe what you read or see
          on TV. If anything, our tie to Conners
          is stronger. He's one of the best.
          Even when things got pretty wild today
          and everyone else panicked, he was in
          control. That doesn't just happen.
          He's just that good.

                       TEDDY
          Excuse me.

     Teddy heads for the ladies room.

                          VINCENT
                What was the Buddha looking for?

                          DEKKER
                The divine in himself.

     Art's confused.    Dekker's cellphone rings.

                          DEKKER
                How long does it usually take to for
                fingerprints to be ID'd?

                          VINCENT
                Hours, maybe days.    We could be waiting
                a while.

                          DEKKER
                    (answering)
                Dekker./ Okay.
                    (Snapping the phone shut...)
                They got a match.

96   INT.   BY THE RESTROOMS - ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT             96

     LONG CURTAINS divide the rooms.

     Conners exits the men's room, Teddy appears and before a word
     can be spoken... SHE KISSES HIM HARD, PASSIONATELY ON THE
     LIPS. Conners gives in for just a moment. He breaks the
     embrace.

                          CONNERS
                What are you doing?

                          TEDDY
                I realized something today. Being
                around you, all that's happened...       I
                can't... I think I made a mistake.

                          CONNERS
                It's too late. You've made your
                choice. Live with it.

     This jab hurts Teddy and Conners knows it.     Dekker parts the
     curtains...

                          DEKKER
                We got a match.

     Teddy separates from Conners.

                You got a name?

                             DEKKER

97   INT.   CONNERS'S CAR - NIGHT                                 97

     Conners drives, Dekker reads Chris Lei's file. On top of the
     file is a MUGSHOT PHOTO of, "Lei, CHRIS". He's an early-30's
     Chinese-American with a "weasel factor" off the charts.

                          CONNERS
                Prick used to work for some big-time
                software company until they caught him
                dipping into the company's slush fund.
                They didn't want the publicity so they
                didn't press charges. Couple years
                later, he was busted for looting the
                pension plans of retired cops. For a
                genius... he's a fucking moron.

                          DEKKER
                This was your case. You and York. You
                made the bust. Why didn't it stick?

                          CONNERS
                His lawyer put us on trial. Said we
                were crooked, abusive, that we planted
                evidence... We were in the midst of
                the Pearl Street Bridge fallout. Jury
                bought it. They let him walk and we
                were the scapegoats.

                          DEKKER
                Was it true?

                           CONNERS
                The guy was guilty. He was scum. That

      The design is MODERN, FLAWLESS and COLD. Every room is
      equipped with VIDEO CAMERAS and MONITORS.

      ON THE MONITOR... The screen is divided into 16 small boxes
      showing the actions simultaneously throughout the house. Our
      concentration settles on BOX #7...

100   INT.   BEDROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                         100

      CHRIS LEI, live and in the flesh, quickly stuffs belongings
      into a suitcase. He's nervous, tense. From the top drawer
      of his dresser, he grabs an armful of underwear, socks, dumps
      them into the suitcase.

      What Chris doesn't see...

      IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRROR ON THE DRESSER...   LORENZ!

101   EXT.   CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   101

                 Shit.

      Chris turns, FINDS HIMSELF STARING DOWN A BARREL!

                           LORENZ
                 Fare thee well, Chris.

      Chris swallows, Lorenz pulls the trigger and...

      their weapons, quickly descend on the house!

      THE FRONT DOOR KICKS IN! Dekker and Conners cautiously
      enter. They move the way veteran partners would. No
      indications that these two just met today.

      The House is almost PITCH BLACK.

      Conners motions that he's going up, signals for Dekker to
      take the back of the house.

      LORENZ STEPS FROM THE DARKNESS.

108   INT.   COMPUTER ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                  108

      Conners moves from the hall, into the bedroom where he
      finds... Chris's dead Body. He checks for a pulse when he
      notices...

      ON THE MONITOR... Conners sees A SHADOWY FIGURE BEHIND
      Dekker!

109   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                    109

      Dekker, oblivious to Lorenz's presence, continues on.    Heads
      for the front hallway.

      Lorenz raises his gun, narrows his sites on Dekker.

      Simultaneously... CONNERS DIVES, TACKLES DEKKER BEHIND the

      An EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN, 30's, attends to Dekker's

      HANDCUFFS lock Richards to his bed. Richards is hooked up to
      an IV and a tube's up his nose. A HEART RATE MONITOR chimes
      rhythmically.

      Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS look on as Conners and Dekker enter.

                     (to the officers)
                 Take five, guys.

      The officers exit. Conners LOCKS the door, walks to the bed,
      leans over Richards.

                           CONNERS
                 Hiya, Damon. How you feeling?

                           DEKKER
                     (taps Conners)
                 May I?

      Conners concedes the floor.     Dekker addresses Richards.

                           DEKKER
                 You remember me, don't you?
                     (Damon gives an EVIL GLARE)
                 Thought so.

      Dekker turns his attention to Richards' IV, the tubes which
      carry medication into his body.

        SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004            68.


       From a nearby medicine cabinet, Dekker rummages around.

                            DEKKER
                  I was skiing about three years ago.
                  Aspen. Beautiful country. Ever been?
                  Never mind. I hit a mogul, landed on a
                  sheet of ice and slammed into a tree.
                  Broke myself up pretty bad. Kinda like
                  you did today. I was in a hospital bed
                  for three months. Had it not been
                  for... Here it is.
                      (he finds)
                  Morphine. Without this stuff, I
                  wouldn't have made it.

       Dekker fills a syringe with the entire bottle.

                            DEKKER
                  Now this IV drip administers a small
                  dosage every minute. Makes you feel
                  relaxed and calm. No pain. But...

       Dekker sticks the syringe needle tip into the IV bag.

                            DEKKER
                  If I were to inject this whole thing...
                  That would be all she wrote for Damon.

                            RICHARDS
                  You don't have the balls.

       Dekker PRESSES down on the syringe, just a little, but enough
       to go into the bag. Richards can't believe it.

                            DEKKER
                  This equipment malfunctions all the
                  time. Overdoses are quite common.
                  Besides, I don't think the DA's going
                  to launch a full-scale investigation
                  over a scum like you.

       Richards attempts to signal for a nurse, but Dekker pulls the
       call button away.

                            DEKKER
                  You don't have to tell us a damn thing.
                  Plead the fifth... roll the dice.

       Dekker SQUEEZES in some more, until...   Richards gives in,
       signals that he'll talk.

                  You fuckin' hypocrite. You give me
                  shit for my interrogating skills...
                  least I don't threaten them with a
                  lethal overdose.

       Dekker holds the empty vile up, hands it to Conners.

                            DEKKER
                  There's never been a single case in
                  recorded medical history of someone
                  overdosing on 200 milliliters of
                  saline.

       Conners checks the label, smiles.

                            DEKKER
                  Bend, not break. That's what you said,
                  right?

       Lorenz, AKA SCOTT CURTIS, enters his car.

                            JENKINS (VO)
                  Lorenz's true identity is Scott Curtis.
                  He's wanted in connection to three
                  other bank robberies, extorsion and
                  kidnapping.

121    INT.   BULLPEN - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT        121

       Jenkins stands before Conners, Dekker, Teddy, Vincent and two
       new Detectives - DET. TOMMY BRANCH, 40's and DET. JEROME
       KNIGHT, 50's.

                             JENKINS
                  He's also the brother of John Curtis,
                  the perp Conners shot at Pearl Street
                  Bridge.
                      (Moving on)
                  Richards testifies that he was hired by
                  Curtis to pull the bank job with a
                  dirty cop on the inside, Bernie Callo.
                  Curtis hoped that Conners would take
                  the fall for American National turning
                  ugly, disgracing him even further. We
                  also have the names of two more
                  accomplices, Lamar Galt and Xander
                  Harrington. Everyone was set to meet
                  tonight at ten and we have that

                  it doesn't take a rocket scientist to
                  know Curtis is eliminating his
                  accomplices. Doesn't matter what
                  Curtis told Galt and Harrington, he's
                  going to finish them off tonight.

      normal.

                  My father died when I was twelve. He

                   Because he died on the job, he's a

                   still would've died. She had a chance

128   IN CONNERS'S CAR--                                          128

129   AROUND THE HOUSE--                                          129

      Conners, Dekker, Vincent, Teddy converge on the house.

                           CONNERS
                 We take them alive!

      Conners and Dekker make their way up the stairs...

131   DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY--                                        131

      Teddy and Vincent head down the hall...

132   UPSTAIRS HALLWAY--                                          132

      Conners and Dekker move carefully. Conners points for Dekker
      to go in the other direction. Dekker obeys, slides down the
      other side of the hall.

133   IN THE KITCHEN--                                            133

      Teddy's on her toes.   She smells something, but keeps moving.

       ON THE FLOOR...    A trail of BLOOD leads to the DINING ROOM.

       Teddy signals to Vincent.   "That way."

134    FIRST BEDROOM--                                               134

       Conners enters, checks it out.

135    SECOND BEDROOM--                                              135

       Dekker stands outside the closet. He opens it quickly, but
       it's empty. Except for... On the far wall -- HUNDREDS OF
       PICTURES of Conners. The same shrine we saw Lorenz in front
       of earlier.

135A   DINING ROOM--                                                135A

       Vincent swings in from one entrance, Teddy the other.   She
       takes a cautious step out, when...

       BAM! A BULLET ZINGS PAST TEDDY - HITS THE WALL BESIDE HER
       HEAD!

       HARRINGTON, from the corner, takes aim again!

       VINCENT drops to the floor, aims through the dining room
       table legs and FIRES!

       THE BULLET TEARS INTO HARRINGTON'S SHIN!   He SCREAMS IN PAIN,
       DROPS TO THE FLOOR!

135B   FIRST BEDROOM--                                              135B

       Conners HEARS THE SHOTS, runs out of the room.

136    SECOND BEDROOM--                                              136

       So does Dekker.

136A   DINING ROOM--                                                136A

       Teddy moves in on Harrington.

                           TEDDY
                 Drop the gun!

       Harrington holds his gun UP AND OUT towards Teddy.   Is he
       aiming or surrendering?

                           TEDDY
                 Drop it now. Last warning.

       But he doesn't.

       Conners and Dekker meet by the top of the stairs.

                              CONNERS
                 Teddy!?     What's happening?

       Vincent appears at the bottom of the stairs.

                           VINCENT
                 We got one down. He's dead.

138    UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/ STAIRCASE--                                    138

       Dekker and Conners share a look, disappointed.      But then
       something catches Conners's eye.

       BEHIND DEKKER...     a door OPENS...   LAMAR GALT AIMS HIS
       WEAPON!

                              CONNERS
                 GUN!

       GALT FIRES!

       Conners PUSHES DEKKER OUT OF THE WAY, just in the nick of
       time!

       DEKKER TUMBLES DOWN THE STAIRS!    Vincent breaks his fall.

       GALT FIRES AT CONNERS, until he's out of bullets.      He ducks
       back behind a door.

       Conners FIRES!   But did he hit anyone?     Conners pursues...

138A   AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS--                                   138A

       Dekker grabs his head, in pain, but okay.

138B   DINING ROOM--                                                   138B

       Teddy leans against the wall, spots A VENT...       A FLASH GOES
       BY!

139    UPSTAIRS BATHROOM--                                              139

       Conners creeps inside the partially open doorway. It's
       quiet, until... LAMAR GALT lunges, tackles Conners! His gun
       flies from his hands.

      Teddy's EYES fall to...

      ON THE FLOOR... next to the base of the door is a FUSE.         It
      runs from the wall into the vent.

      She follows it into THE KITCHEN.

      Vincent and Dekker get up.        Dekker looks upstairs...

      Conners and Galt struggle. Conners PUNCHES Galt, sends him
      back! He then SLAMS Galt against the wall, Galt KNEES
      Conners in the gut.

      Galt goes for the gun, Conners KICKS out his legs from
      underneath him! But before Conners can get the upper hand,
      Galt fights back! The two continue...

       Conners HITS THE FLOOR HARD! Galt's head slams against the

       Conners leans over Galt, a giant GASH across his forehead,
       feels for a pulse. He's dead. Conners looks into the
       hallway, SEES THE FIRE!

                  Where's Conners?

       Dekker and Teddy look to the house, when...

      FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES surround the
      house. The LIGHTS FLASH AN EERIE RED across the scene.
      FIREMEN try to extinguish the flames.

      Several NEWS TRUCKS have arrived, always after the story.

      A CORONER, 40's, zips shut a body bag. Inside the BADLY
      BURNT BODY of Detective Conners. The BADGE ON HIS BELT still
      visible. They load him into the truck.

      TEDDY, her face drained of life, stares at the truck. A
      Fireman walks behind them, back towards the fire truck.

                 Conners was right. We should've never
                 gone in. How many more mistakes can we
                 make in one day? He was eliminating
                 his accomplices. We thought he was

      Quiet, mostly dark.     A few fluorescent lights and a desk
      lamp...

      Dekker sits at Conners' desk. A somber moment, reflecting on

          I know what they were doing inside the
          bank.

DEKKER AND DAX--

Dax flips through the huge document.

                    DAX
          These are today's transaction records
          from the bank. An average day produces
          about 400 pages, give or take. Today,
          there were over 3,000 pages.

          Meaning?

                    DAX
          We've just witnessed the largest heist

          neighborhood of a billion dollars.

          Come again?

                    DAX
          It's a computer virus. "The Computer
          Virus." It randomly withdraws money
          from all the accounts and deposits it
          into the bad guys' account. If you
          check the transactions, no two
          withdrawal amounts are the same and
          none of'em are over $100. Most
          security systems work on the size of
          the money, not number of transactions.
          Wire out one million from a handful of
          accounts and red flags go up. Wire out
          a less than a hundred from ten million
          accounts, no flags.

          Where's the money now?

          I tried following one of the
          transactions. It took me an hour and
          when I finally had it... It went away.

                    DEKKER
          How is that possible?

                 temporarily, then transfers to another

                           DEKKER
                 It's still moving the money around?

                           DAX
                 Yeah. Any deposit or withdrawal from
                 any bank doesn't usually go into affect
                 until the next business day. So it's

                 break in? If they're just wiring
                 money? Couldn't they do that from
                 anywhere?

                 So they weren't trying to make   it look
                 like they were robbing a bank,   to rip
                 off a Saudi Prince? They were    making

      Dekker shuffles to his car, his cellphone rings.
      Answering...

       SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004           83.


                            DEKKER
                 Dekker.

                           DISPATCH OFFICER (VO)
                 Detective Dekker, there's a call for
                 you. Says it's urgent.

                           DEKKER
                 Put it through.

                           LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
                 Good evening Detective. I just wanted
                 to compliment you on a fine day. You
                 were an unexpected adversary that was
                 most challenging.

                           DEKKER
                 It's not over yet.

                           LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
                 Wishful thinking.

                           DEKKER
                 No. My wish is to catch you. You're a
                 murderer. A cop killer at that.

                           LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
                 I didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve
                 it. Callo was insignificant and
                 Conners crossed me. In years to come
                 you'll thank me for getting rid of him
                 before he corrupted you.

                           DEKKER
                 I know about the money. You steal a
                 billion dollars... They will find you.

                           LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
                 A risk I'm willing to take. It's
                 almost sunrise. Fare thee well.

      Lorenz hangs up. Dekker surprisingly calm, hangs up the
      phone, heads back inside the station.

153   INT.   BULLPEN - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT          153

      Dekker at his desk, piles through mounds of paperwork.   Not
      sure what to look for, he goes through everything.

      His notes from the bank. The file on Galt, Harrington, Chris
      Lei. He even digs through Conners and finally... Callo's
      file.

      Jenkins heads for the exit.

                           JENKINS
                 You're still here?

                           DEKKER
                     (in complete work mode)
                 Callo's insignificant.

                             JENKINS
                 What?

                           DEKKER
                 That's what he said, Callo's
                 insignificant. But he wasn't.

                           JENKINS
                 What are you talking about?

                             DEKKER
                 Lorenz...    Curtis...   Called me.

                           JENKINS
                 He called you?

                           DEKKER
                 He said he didn't kill anyone who
                 didn't deserve it. He said Callo was
                 insignificant. But without Callo he
                 wouldn't have had the knowledge of our
                 department and...
                     (grabs a clipboard)
                 ... He wouldn't have had the front
                 money to hire the crew.

                           JENKINS
                 He was screwing with your head. Go
                 home, Shane. You did good today. Your
                 Dad would be proud. Get some sleep.
                 There will be more bad guys tomorrow.

      Jenkins exits.

      Dekker falls back into his chair. Then... discovers...
      Callo's file... The Property Room Sign-Out Sheet. The
      signatures.

154   INT.   INTERROGATION ROOM - SEATTLE P. D. - 1:43 AM        154

      Harry Hume, the evidence room cop, out of uniform, walks
      inside, sits across from... Dekker, already here, with two
      DIFFERENT FILES available to him.

                           HARRY
                 I was in bed already.     This couldn't
                 wait til morning.

 SHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004          85.


                     DEKKER
              (cold)
          How did he come at you, Harry? It's
          the only thing that doesn't make sense.

                    HARRY
          What are you talking about?

                    DEKKER
          All day long we thought Callo was the
          dirty cop. All day long we were wrong.

Dekker slides some papers in front of Harry.

                     DEKKER
          That's the sign-out sheet from the
          evidence room. Here's one of Callo's
          reports. Here's another one... and
          another --

The SIGNATURES ARE DIFFERENT, but Harry doesn't even examine
them. He knows.

                    DEKKER
          They're not the same signature, Harry.
          They're not even close.

                    HARRY
              (shrugs it off)
          Maybe he had a cramp in his hand.    I
          don't know.

                    DEKKER
              (re: file #1)
          This is your file... You were
          reprimanded, a month ago after you
          confronted Callo at the courthouse.
          You punched him. That ring a bell?

                    HARRY
          And I'd do it again. Cops who testify
          against cops shouldn't be breathing the
          same air I do. There's a line you
          don't cross!

                    DEKKER
          So you set him up! You forged Callo's
          signature, you gave him the money and
          you helped him with his plan because
          you thought he got a raw deal at Pearl
          Street Bridge! Don't deny it, Harry
          cause I know.

                 OF COURSE HE GOT A RAW DEAL AT PEARL

157   EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK                157

      Images FLASH before our eyes...

      The RAIN POURS DOWN!   An SUV CRASHES into a STALLED-OUT
      VEHICLE.

      JOHN CURTIS (THE KIDNAPPER) crawls out of the SUV! He sees
      cop's lights approaching. He drags LISA REANN (THE VICTIM)
      out of the truck. A BRIGHT LIGHT (from a helicopter) strikes
      John in the eyes!

      LIGHTS!   EVERYWHERE BRIGHT!   It's all very BLINDING!

      COPS block both sides of the bridge!   TV REPORTERS AT EITHER
      END OF THE BRIDGE!

      John holds the gun up to Lisa's head as... OVER JOHN'S
      SHOULDER... CONNERS APPROACHES, GUN DRAWN!

      Lisa struggles, tears streaming down her face.

      A FLASH OF LIGHT ENVELOPS CONNERS!

      CLOSE ON... A GUN FIRES!

      John DROPS lifeless to the pavement.

                                                               BACK TO:

      Harry pounds the table...

                           DEKKER
                 You're helping a cop killer, Harry.
                 You're a year from pension. This is
                 how you want to go out?

                           HARRY
                 My conscience is clean.

                           DEKKER
                 This has been a very long, trying day.

                 phantom. Just when we have him... he
                 disappears. He's been two steps ahead
                 of Conners and me all day.

                           HARRY
                 Of course he has.   Who knows Conners
                 better than him?

                           DEKKER
                     (what?)
                 How the hell does Curtis know Conners
                 better than anyone?

      Harry goes silent.   Realizes he just let the cat out of the
      bag.

                           DEKKER
                     (realizes)
                 We're not talking about Curtis, are we,
                 Harry?
                     (still no response)
                 Who would know Conners better than
                 anyone? Who would you protect? And
                 who in your mind got the raw deal at

      IN REVERSE MOTION - JOHN CURTIS GETS UP... THE BULLET RE-

      REVEAL THE ENTIRE SCENE: LORENZ/ CURTIS STANDS NEXT TO
      CONNERS ON THE BRIDGE HOLDING A GUN.

      LORENZ/CURTIS IS YORK!

      NOW RESUME ACTION... Conners and York aim their guns at...
      John holds Lisa tight.

                           CONNERS
                 Drop the weapon. Let the girl go.

      John PUSHES the barrel of the gun TIGHTER into Lisa's temple.

                           YORK
                 That, you don't want to do.

      York narrows his aim on John Curtis.

                           JOHN CURTIS
                 One step closer and the girl dies.

      SIMULTANEOUSLY... YORK FIRES just as Lisa STRUGGLES, MOVES!
      The Bullet intended for John Curtis, HITS Lisa, kills her
      instantly.

      Lisa's body crumples to the ground.

      Conners and York look on in horror, knowing York's bullet
      felled an innocent.

      John turns to fire on the detectives...      Conners fires -
      KILLS John Curtis!

      John's body hits pavement.      RAIN POURS DOWN!

                           DEKKER
                 It was York who was the bad cop. He

                 York plays his old partner, knowing all
                 his moves, frames his enemy for the
                 crime, kills him too and pulls off the
                 biggest robbery in history.

                 Do what you want to me. He called to

                 It's not a request.

165   EXT.   HARBOR NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                       165

      A BEAUTIFUL, BRIGHT FULL MOON hangs in the dark sky. Dozens
      of COMMERCIAL LINERS, CARGO SHIPS and SEAPLANES line the
      piers.

166   EXT.   DINER NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                        166

      Open twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year. A handful of

167   INT.   DINER NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                        167

      A scattering of PATRONS, some at the counter, some in booths.
      A PRETTY WAITRESS, 20's, rings up a bill.

                           PRETTY WAITRESS
                 That'll be $8.48, please.

      YORK AKA LORENZ/CURTIS hands the Cashier a twenty.

                           YORK
                 Keep the change.

                           PRETTY WAITRESS
                 Thanks, mister.

      A BUS BOY, 19, carries some garbage out the back.

      York heads for the exits, opens the door and... STEPS
      OUTSIDE!

168   EXT.   DINER NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                        168

      York hoofs two steps outside when...

      A BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT STRIKES YORK'S FACE!   He shields his
      eyes...

      BEHIND THE LIGHTS... Dekker and Teddy aim their pistols.

                           DEKKER
                 Jason York... this is the police. Put
                 your hands in the air and slowly get on
                 your knees. Do it. Now!

                           YORK
                 Don't shoot. You win.

      York RAISES HIS HANDS HIGH, takes a small step backwards.

                    I'm cooperating.   You win.

      York takes another tiny back-step.

                              DEKKER

      York bends down to ONE KNEE, DRAWS A 9 MM... FIRES!

      DEKKER AND TEDDY DUCK FOR COVER!

      YORK RUSHES BACK INTO THE RESTAURANT!

      DEKKER AND TEDDY RETURN FIRE!

      THE GLASS WINDOW DOORS EXPLODE!

      CUSTOMERS SCREAM AS...

      Dekker enters, surveys the restaurant.

      A LOUD BANGING FROM THE KITCHEN!

      Dekker approaches the kitchen door, pushes it open and...

      BAM!   BAM!    BAM!   BULLETS RIP APART THE KITCHEN DOOR!

      Dekker spins out of the way. As gunfire stops, Dekker KICKS
      through the door! Leans in gun first...

170   THE KITCHEN --                                                170

      In the center of the room... York neck-holds the Pretty
      Waitress, gun to her head.

      Dekker moves in...

                              YORK
                    Was it Harry? It was Harry, right?

                    DEKKER
          Let the girl go. It's over.

York's EYES BLAZE WITH ACTIVITY!    Something brewing.

                    YORK
          Easy for you to say. I'm a plane ride
          away from a King's Ransom.

THROUGH A SIDE DOOR... Teddy slides in, unnoticed.

                    DEKKER
          Drop the weapon, let the girl go.

                     YORK
          And spend the rest of my days in a
          cage? Let me ponder...
              (beat)
          Don't think so. If you're going to
          stop me... I'm gonna make you earn it.

                    DEKKER
          That you don't want to do.

                     YORK
              (realizes)
          That's exactly what I said to him. Do
          you see the irony here? Am I the only
          one? Two months ago I was in your
          shoes. Some punk holding a gun to an
          innocent girl. What should you do?
              (beat)
          YOU'D DO EXACTLY WHAT I DID!

A GLINT sparkles in his eyes.   His teeth grind.    His gun GRIP
TIGHTENS!

Teddy moves into position from the side!    Then...

The BUS BOY enters from the same door Teddy came in.     The
door BANGS closed behind him.

York spins, FIRES in that direction!

Teddy's HIT!   The Bus Boy retreats out the side door!

YORK TURNS ON DEKKER, FIRES!

Dekker DUCKS away safely.

York drags the Pretty Waitress to the back!

Dekker runs over, checks on Teddy.

                  Shit.

                              TEDDY
                  I'm fine.    Go get him.

      Dekker looks her in the eyes, then darts away.

171   EXT.   DINER NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                          171

      Dekker exits the back.     Finds the Pretty Waitress.    Shook up.

                            DEKKER
                  Which way did he go?

                              PRETTY WAITRESS
                  That way.    Down towards the pier.

172   EXT.   HARBOR NEAR PUGET SOUND - NIGHT                         172

      York sprints across the street.        Dekker follows.

173   I/E    STEEL CONTAINER YARD - NIGHT                            173

      HUNDREDS OF GIANT STEEL CARGO CONTAINERS litter the yard...
      makes the place look and feel like a GIANT MAZE.

      York disappears into the steel maze.

      Dekker enters, slows to a walk. Carefully proceeds forward.
      Gun drawn. Second guessing each turn.

                            YORK (OS)
                  You've really screwed yourself...
                  Jenkins is going to expect these kind
                  of results from you everyday.

                  technicians figuring out Lei's virus.
                  They'll break it.

      Dekker rounds a corner...

                            YORK
                  Your conviction would be admirable, if
                  it wasn't just so sad.

      At the far end of the container, York FIRES!

      Dekker ducks back.

      York takes a look out, doesn't see Dekker.

                           YORK
                 Get it through your head... The
                 calvary ain't coming. No heroes are
                 coming to save the day. The bad guy
                 gets away at the end of this story.

      Dekker peers around the corner... York's gone.

                           YORK (OS)
                 But I'll give you credit... You turned
                 out to be quite the little thorn,
                 didn't you?

      Dekker speed-walks, continuing the search.

                           YORK (OS)
                 I think Conners would be sorry that you
                 died. But not me.

      Dekker stops, eyes a full 360. The containers all look
      alike. Dekker wonders if he's just going around in circles.
      Until...

      BAM! BAM! BAM! BULLETS RICOCHET ALL AROUND DEKKER!         He
      dive-rolls for cover as...

      ON TOP OF A CONTAINER... York UNLEASHES, until... CLICK!        Out
      of ammo.

      Dekker, hearing this, pops up, RETURNS FIRE!

      York leaps off the backside of the container!

      Dekker gives chase. As he circles the container... no York.
      Instead, he finds a DOCK.

174   EXT.   DOCK - NIGHT                                             174

      A narrow wooden dock. There's a few small boats, A TUG BOAT
      and at the end... A SEAPLANE.

      Dekker approaches the tug. Each step slow and deliberate.
      EYES TRANSFIXED on the seaplane.

      As he nears the Seaplane... A SHADOW RISES from BEHIND HIM.
      From on top of the TUG BOAT!

      Dekker turns just as...

      York throws a fishing net on top of Dekker.    As Dekker
      struggles in the net, HIS GUN DISCHARGES!

      York with a PIKE POLE in hand, leaps down, CLUBBING Dekker
      over the head with the weapon. Dekker goes down!

       SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004              95.


      Dekker's gun SLIDES off the dock, into the water.

      York charges Dekker with the PIKE POLE, ready to stab,
      when...

      At the last second... DEKKER ROLLS AWAY! THE PIKE POLE
      BREAKS A WOODEN PLANK TO PIECES, sticks into the ground
      beneath the water.

      Dekker, still tangled in the net, KICKS OUT York's legs.        He
      falls to the planks.

      York quickly rebounds. He POUNCES on Dekker, from behind he
      wraps his arm around Dekker's throat, CHOKING HIM.

      Dekker struggles to breathe.    York SQUEEZES harder.

                           YORK
                 I have come this far...      I will not be
                 denied.

      Dekker fights, arms flailing. He REACHES blindly behind
      York, grabs a hold of the PIKE POLE. The pole SNAPS in two!

      Dekker wildly SWINGS at York who dodges easily.

      York SLAMS Dekker into the side of the TUG.       Still choking.

      Dekker, on his last gasp, PUSHES OFF THE TUG!

      York stumbles backwards, GETS HIS FOOT CAUGHT IN THE HOLE!
      He twists, spinning around, falling down onto...

      ... THE REMAINING PIKE SPEAR!    The Pike punches through his
      chest... POPS out his back!

      York, blood and life escaping him, his eyes find Dekker.
      Then go dead.

      Dekker steps close.   Holds a cold, remorseless stare at
      York's body.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

                    TEDDY
          We used to spend all day   Sunday just
          reading in bed. I would    read the paper
          and he would read one of   his billion
          books. I didn't deserve    him. I knew
          that. But I still loved    him.

Teddy stares out the window...

POV OF TEDDY - Jenkins speaks to Karen Cross.

                     TEDDY
          He's the only man I ever loved.
              (beat)
          Did we all get shot today?

They can't help but laugh.

                    DEKKER
          They said in the city I'd be busy.
          Every day like this?

                    TEDDY
          Pretty much.

                      DEKKER
          Great.    I wonder what's next?

                      TEDDY
          For me...    a long vacation.

Teddy excuses herself to the bathroom.      Dekker goes to pay
the check.

AT THE CASHIER...   Dekker reaches for his wallet, opens it.

                      DEKKER
          How much?

                    PRETTY WAITRESS
          Do you think I'm going to charge you
          after all that? Go on.

                      DEKKER
          Thanks.

Dekker notices the tip jar by the register. He removes a TEN
DOLLAR BILL, about to stuff it in the jar...

That's when THE SMELL hits him. A strange, but familiar ODOR
comes from Dekker's wallet or more accurately... The TEN
DOLLAR BILL! But what is it?

                 Do you smell that?

                 What is it?

                           MARNIE
                 When evidence is taken in, any physical
                 mark might effect the ability to lift
                 prints, so, to mark it, we spray it
                 with a scented solution.

181    INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                     181

       PAPERS and BOOKS litter the floor.

       Dekker trashes the place, looking for a clue of any kind. He
       rifles through the bookshelves, cabinets. All to no avail.

       That's when he finds... a medium-sized paperback, dog-eared
       and worn. The title of the book... "CHAOS" by James Gleick.

       Dekker flips through the book. Pages are marked, high-
       lighted. Key words we find include, "EDWARD LORENZ, CHAOS
       THEORY, BIRTH OF A NEW SCIENCE."

                                                                 TIME CUT TO:

                      (into phone)
                  You tried them all?/ Nothing for
                  Conners or Lorenz?/ I don't know.        No,
                  maybe he's not on a flight.

       Dekker then notices - the book.     The author's name.

                               DEKKER
                  Try again.     But try Gleick.   James

       A MAN, 40's, in DISGUISE (Brown Wig), SPIES Dekker.          He picks
       up a CELLPHONE, DIALS... DEKKER'S CELLPHONE RINGS.           He
       quickly picks it up.

                  There's a passage in the Surangama
                  Sutra which, roughly translated means:
                  "Things are not what they appear to be:
                  nor are they otherwise."

      Dekker again scans the line -- he's not there.         He scans all
      the faces AGAIN, but still nothing.

                 At the diner. That's right...       Well,
                 to err is human.

      Dekker SPOTS A MAN ON A CELLPHONE, he runs up to him, SPINS
      HIM AROUND, BUT... It's not Conners.

                 Harry and the phone call. He called
                 me, said Callo was insignificant.
                 Threw up a red flag.

                 That wasn't him. That was my mistake.
                 I called you.

                  York always thought "the plan" was
                  flawless. He was cocky. I told him
                  you have to leave room for error. You
                  can't always predict how it's all going
                  to play out. A random camera catches
                  an image of Richards, the scent on the
                  money... you. You were the biggest
                  wrench of the day. The Chaos Theory...

      time!

      DEKKER TUMBLES DOWN THE STAIRS!      Vincent breaks his fall.

      Conners FIRES TOWARDS THE DOOR!      After...

      Conners takes out a small remote detonator.     Pushes the FIRST

      ON THE FLOOR... next to the base of the door is a FUSE. It

      Conners leans over Galt, a giant GASH across his head, feels
      for a pulse. He's dead. Conners looks into the hallway,
      SEES THE FIRE!

      Conners gets up, and reaches INTO THE BATHTUB, drags out... a
      CORPSE, HOOKS HIS BADGE ONTO THE CORPSE'S BELT and lays him
      on the floor.

      Conners QUICKLY opens a LAUNDRY SHOOT, SHIMMIES INSIDE AND
