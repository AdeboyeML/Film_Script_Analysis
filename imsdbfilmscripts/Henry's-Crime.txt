          INT. TOLL BOOTH - DAWN

          A LONE TOLL BOOTH ATTENDANT sits inside his glass box on
          an empty stretch of interstate.
          This is HENRY.
          He looks out at the horizon. It's starting to get light
          out. There's snow on the ground.
          He's neither asleep nor awake.

                         

          INT. TOLL BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

          HENRY'S PLASTIC GLOVES unscrew a THERMOS, pour coffee
          into a Styrofoam cup. There are only a few drops left.

                         A CAR
          Approaches. Henry straightens, slides open his window.
          But the CAR veers over to the automated EZ-PASS LANE...
          Henry closes the window, watches the car disappear. He
          downs the last of his coffee, looks back out at the
          horizon again.
          It's cloudy out there.

                         A CLOCK
          flips to 6:00.

                         

          INT. TOLL BOOTH - LATER

          Henry packs up his thermos, puts on his coat and steps
          out into the icy morning.
          He walks toward his truck. The traffic is beginning to
          build.

                         

          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING

          Henry's old FORD PICK-UP drives past the enormous,
          abandoned CENTRAL TRAIN TERMINAL.

                         

          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING

          The pick-up turns down toward a neighborhood of modest
          salt-box houses.

                         

          EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MORNING

          Henry's truck rolls into his driveway.

          INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Henry enters. Hangs up his down jacket on a row of hooks.
          It's clean and ordinary in here.
          His wife, DEBBIE, is in the kitchen. She's wearing a
          NURSES uniform. Henry notices the dining room table set
          for one for breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage. He's a
          little surprised. Debbie appears. Lays down the toast.

                          HENRY
           Smells good.

                          DEBBIE
           Sit down.
          He sits. She smiles. Starts buttering the toast.

                          HENRY
           Wow. Thanks.
          He digs in.

                          DEBBIE
           How was your night?

                          HENRY
           Good. How was yours?
          She's still buttering the toast. Carefully.

                          DEBBIE
           Good.
          She sets it down.

                          HENRY
           This is great.
          She sits down next to him. Watches him eat.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Your shift's at eight thirty?
          She nods.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           You not eating?

                          DEBBIE
           I already did.
          He takes another bite.

                          HENRY
           You okay?

           3.

                         

                         
          Pause.

                          DEBBIE
           Are you coming with me to Cindy and
           Bill's on Saturday?

                          HENRY
           Sure. What time?
          Pause.

                          DEBBIE
           For the baby shower.

                          HENRY
           Right.
          She just stares at him...

                          DEBBIE
           Well, I don't want to go to Cindy and
           Bill's.

                          HENRY
           What?

                          DEBBIE
           I mean I want Cindy and Bill to come
           here.

                          HENRY
           Cindy and Bill are welcome here anytime.
          Pause.

                          DEBBIE
           Henry. Isn't it time...isn't it time for us?
          Henry stops eating.

                          HENRY
           You're talking about kids.

                          DEBBIE
           Of course I am.

                          HENRY
           Okay.

                          DEBBIE
           'Okay' you want kids?
          Pause.

                          HENRY
           I love kids.
          He looks down, resumes eating. A beat.

           4.

                         

                         

                          DEBBIE
           Henry?
          He looks up again.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           Do you still love me?
          He's still as a stone.

                          HENRY
           Of course I do.
          She looks at him.

                          DEBBIE
           Because I know you did once.
          A very long pause. Henry doesn't do anything now.
          She's crestfallen.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           What happened, Henry?
          He just sits.

          THE FRONT DOORBELL RINGS
          Henry gets up, heads to the door.
          Debbie watches him go...

                         

          EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Outside on the step there are TWO MEN in SOFTBALL
          UNIFORMS. One of them is puking. Behind them TWO more
          GUYS sit in the back of the car.
          Henry recognizes the smiling, pock-marked face of EDDIE
          VIBES. Two parts charm, one part menace. His puking
          friend is JOE.

                          EDDIE
           Henry Torne.

                          HENRY
           Eddie Vibes.

                          EDDIE
           So how you doin', man?

                          HENRY
           I'm okay. What's going on?

                          EDDIE
           Listen, I got a man down here.

           5.

                         

                         
          Eddie glances up and down the street.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Mind if we come in for a second?

                         

          INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Eddie and Henry watch while Debbie attends to the sick
          JOE, bits of puke still clinging to his softball uniform.
          She touches his forehead.

                          DEBBIE
           He's hot.
          He starts to retch.

                          JOE
           (holding it in)
           I'm sorry.

                          DEBBIE
           You better come with me.
          Eddie glances at Henry as Debbie leads him expertly
          toward the bathroom.

                          EDDIE
           Goddamn sausage at Pinwheels.

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          EDDIE
           So we're in a little bind, Henry. Got
           league playoffs in a half-hour and Joe's
           our first baseman. And he's not exactly
           game-ready as you can see...

                          HENRY
           Yeah.
          Eddie stares at him. Smiles.

                          EDDIE
           So, what do you say?

                          HENRY
           What do I say what?

                          EDDIE
           You feel like playing a little ball?
           Filling in for Joe?

                          HENRY
           It's November.

           6.

                         

                         

                          EDDIE
           Yeah. They keep the field in perfect
           shape.

                          HENRY
           Oh.
          Beat.

                          EDDIE
           So what do you say?
          Henry looks around the room. For a moment he watches
          Debbie with Joe in the bathroom, the door half open.
          She's tending to him, caring for him...
          Debbie looks up. Sees Henry staring at her.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Henry?

                         

          INT. IMPALA - LATER

          Henry drives. He wears Joe's too small softball uniform.
          Eddie rides shotgun, the other two in the back. They
          grimly stare out the windows.

                          EDDIE
           Appreciate you driving, man.

                          HENRY
           So where's this game?

                          EDDIE
           Near Kaisertown. Like fifteen minutes.

          EXT. MAIN ST - DAY

          The car turns a corner on to Main Street.

                          EDDIE
           Pull up right over here. We gotta grab
           some beer money at that ATM.
          The car pulls up to a row of stores including the FIRST

          BUFFALO BANK.
          Eddie pats Henry's shoulder.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Just hang tight. We'll be right back.
          Eddie and the guys get out. Henry notes this is strange.

           7.

                         

                         
          After a moment Henry realizes something stinks. He sniffs
          his sleeve.

                         BEHIND HIM
          In the rearview, Henry doesn't notice Eddie and the two
          guys slipping on SKI MASKS...

                         HENRY'S POV
          A PET STORE OWNER rolls up the security gates of his
          store and enters. He says good morning to all the
          animals. It's a strange one man show.

          LOUD ALARMS BLARE --
          Henry startles, looks back to where the sound's coming

                         FROM :

          THREE GUYS IN SKI MASKS
          Fly out of the bank on the corner and scatter in various
          directions. They're all wearing softball uniforms. A BANK
          GUARD chases them.
          ON HENRY, confused.
          A second bank guard FRANK (50s, African-American) is
          crossing the street toward the bank with two coffees. He
          sees what's going on, drops the coffees, and pulls his gun :

           FRANK (O.S.)
           You!
          Henry turns forward again.

                         A GUN
          Is pointing at him through the windshield.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           Freeze!
          Henry slowly raises his hands off the wheel.
          Frank sucks his teeth, his gun trained on Henry as the
          distant sound of BLARING SIRENS grows louder.
          Holding on Henry's stunned expression...

                         

          INT. POLICE STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          Henry sits at a small table as a DETECTIVE, whose face we
          never see, paces back and forth.

                          DETECTIVE
           Henry, we know this wasn't your deal.

           8.

                         

                         
          Henry just listens.

                          DETECTIVE (CONT'D)
           All you have to do is give me those
           names. And you can go home. It's that
           simple.
          Henry's still silent.

                          DETECTIVE (CONT'D)
           Come on. Why are you sticking up for
           these people? They're not your friends.
           You've got a wife. You've got a job...
           don't you care?

                          (THEN)
           All you have to do is say something.
          Henry looks up at him, making eye contact for the first
          time.

           JUDGE (V.O.)
           ...in light of the fact that this is a

          INT. BUFFALO COURTROOM - DAY

          Henry stands in a suit, flanked by his state-appointed
          ATTORNEY. Debbie sits in the gallery.
          A JUDGE stares at Henry.

                          JUDGE
           ...the court sentences Henry Torne to
           four years in prison for the crime of
           Felony 1st Degree Armed Robbery.

          WHACK!
          The gavel goes down.
          Henry blinks. He looks at his lawyer who is pleased with
          the sentence. He pats Henry, well done.
          Henry looks back at Debbie. She's just staring at him...

          CLANK!
          A CELL DOOR is SLAMMED SHUT...

                         

          INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

          Henry, wearing a prison jumpsuit, watches as the guard
          locks the door in front of him.

           MAX (O.S.)
           So. What're you in for?

          Henry turns.

           Huh.

                          MAX
           I said what are you in for?
          A beat.

          MAX (60s) pulls up his pants, flushes the TOILET.

           I'll tell you how. Because we committed
           crimes. But we committed to the wrong
           thing. You see that was our mistake. We

           Sure! It's easier to live in here. You
           don't have to do anything. You just show
           up. In fact they even do that for you.

          It's early morning. Henry's clean shaven, dressed in
          street clothes. He packs the last of his things into a
          sports bag, zips it up.
          Looks over at Max whose eyes are closed. Max looks
          vulnerable, like a child, the coverlet pulled right up to
          his neck.

           The only thing I've ever missed in twenty
           three years is a hot bath. And that ain't
           worth walking out of here for.

           your truth.

          Henry sits on a chair by the bed, the box between his
          legs, its contents spread out over the bed.
          Photographs of a long-forgotten vacation in Puerto Rico
          with Debbie. A Baseball glove.
          A high-school year book. Inside, a page of senior photos.
          He finds his own picture smiling at the thresh-hold of
          adulthood. Underneath his name it reads : "MOST NICEST

                         GUY"
          He studies the image a moment, flips to the inner cover,
          graffitied with hand-written messages from classmates
          including : "Henry don't be such a fag, Eddie Vibes"
          Henry puts the yearbook back in the box. Next to it are a
          pile of photographs spread out...images from Henry's
          childhood...of him and Debbie...of different times. He
          finishes putting everything back.

          Henry drinks. We still don't see her face.

                          HENRY
           Thanks.
          She sits down at her desk.

           FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER
           Seems like yesterday you walked through
           that door.

                          HENRY
           It does?

           FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER
           Henry, You've done your time. You are now
           a free free man.

           How does it feel?
          Henry takes a breath.

           So, What's next?

          HENRY looks up : we travel around him, see what he sees :

          THE FIRST BUFFALO BANK
          Directly across the street. Holding on Henry as he
          contemplates the place...
          Henry takes a deep breath. Focuses in.
          There's something happening, he's not sure what it
          is...an idea perhaps, an instinct that somehow with each
          passing moment becomes more like a knowing....
          A moment of revelation.
          He starts across the street toward the bank, moving now,
          heading right toward the front door, transfixed, as the
          SOUND DROPS out and he begins to smile --

          SCREEEECH!
          A car HITS Henry in the side. He's knocked down.
          A GIRL (30s)
          Rushes out of the car.

                          JULIE

           doing? Are you okay?

           You idiot, you weren't even looking where
           you were going! Are you okay?
          Henry's a little delirious.

                          HENRY
           I think I'm okay.
          He grabs his thigh. Winces with pain. Tries to get up.

                          JULIE
           No. Stay on the ground.
          The bank Guard FRANK rushes over.

           Is he alright? Don't get up. I'll call an
           ambulance.

                          JULIE
           He just walked right out into the street.
           He came out of nowhere.

                          FRANK
           I saw the whole thing. You were on the
           phone. You weren't even paying attention.

                          JULIE
           Yes. I was. I know how to drive.
          Cars are honking now as Henry limps his way over to the
          sidewalk.

          She jumps back in her car and pulls it over to the side.
          Frank comes over to Henry, takes his arm.

          including JULIE IVANOVA, the girl who ran Henry over, as
          Madame Ranevsky.
          A black and white American flag wrapped around the trunk
          of the cherry tree with bloody roots.

           Good afternoon, Mr. Saltzman. Take a
           seat.
          The OFFICER gestures to the chair. The other members of
          the Board stare at Max.
          The head Parole officer leafs through page after page of
          denied applications. Max watches the pages turning, the
          years of his life going by, taking it in...

           Mr. Saltzman. Could you please tell the
           board why you believe we should grant you
           parole?
          They all wait for Max's answer. He's silent.

          EXT. PRISON GATE - DAY

          The gigantic PRISON GATES clank open. Max emerges, a tiny
          figure against the imposing facade. He's holding a small
          black valise. Looks like it was made in the 40s.

           42.

                         

                         
          Max looks a little less sure of himself.

          Appears. Smiling.

                          HENRY
           I knew you could do it.
          Max looks around nervously.

           Where's the car?

                          HENRY
           I don't have a car.

                          MAX
           You don't have a car? What's wrong with
           you? You came to pick me up without a
           car. That's not picking a person up.

                          HENRY
           Yes, it is. I'm here. I'm picking you up.

                          MAX
           I don't know about this. Maybe this is a
           mistake.
          Max turns....walks back towards the gates. Starts to
          POUND on them.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Dave! Carl!

                          MAX
           Open up! DAVE!
          No response.
          Henry approaches. Takes Max's bag.

                          HENRY
           Come on, Max.

                          MAX
           I don't like this.

                          HENRY
           Take it easy. There's nothing to be
           frightened of. I promise. You're okay.
           The bus station's just a short walk.
          Max starts to hyperventilate :

          Henry and Max sit up front right next to the driver. Max

          He opens his bag and pulls out a sandwich. Offers it to
          him.
          Max doesn't say anything.

           Here we are.
          Henry indicates the tiny bed in the corner of the living
          room. There are some second hand books on the bedside
          table like `Future Shock' by Alvin Toffler and
          Dostoyevsky.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)

          Max reclines in the steaming TUB, luxuriating in the warm
          water. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and
          relaxes.
          After a moment he notices a fancy-looking bottle on the side.

                          MAX

           Ah. The land of milk and honey.

           What is this obsession with coffee,
           Henry? When did that happen?

                          HENRY
           I'm not sure, Max. But it seems to give
           people a lot of purpose.
          They walk into the Cafe Orpheum.

           Oh my God. Are you kidding? This was
           eighty years ago. It's ridiculous. Oh my
           God. That tunnel's probably not even
           there anymore! Are you dreaming, Henry?

           It's an article.

                          MAX
           Whatever, Henry. Why don't we just go in
           with guns and do it the old-fashioned
           way?

           pretend to be someone else. I find some
           part of me, and reveal it in a new

          burying Joe who struggles to get out.
          Above, from where the dirt once was, is the smooth
          surface of concrete. The bottom of the vault.

           I may be all those things but one thing
           I'm not...is a rat.
