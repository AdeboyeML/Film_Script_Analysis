    EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - DAY                                    1
    Peace.

    Fresh snow glistens in the sunlight and reflects off of the
    giant pine trees covering the serene mountain side.

    It's quiet.

    So quiet.

2   EXT. THE CHAIR LIFT - DAY                                     2
    Tight on a gloved hand as a lever is released.

    Tight on the cables at the top of a rickety chair lift as
    they kick into motion.

    Wider as an empty chair swivels around and beneath the asses
    of a threesome of SKIERS.

    Even wider to reveal a long line of Skiers and SNOWBOARDERS
    awaiting their moment to step up to the chair.



    The camera finds a group of three standing off to the side of
    the line, decked out in their winter gear.



3   EXT. SNOW BANK OVERLOOKING THE CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS        3

    Angle on DAN WALKER (college age, shaggy hair, holding a
    snowboard and a helmet in one hand) as he studies the
    situation. Next to him stands an impatient JOE LYNCH
    (college age, goggles on his head and a face full of fresh
    stubble, standing on skis).

                          LYNCH
                I don't see her.

                          DAN
                The shift change is late.   Just
                wait.

    PARKER O'NEIL (college age, red hair, holding a snowboard)
    sighs and stares back at the lift lane.
                                                          2.



                    PARKER
          Are you sure about this?

                    DAN
          We've been doing this forever.
          Trust me. This lady loves Lynch.
          She always goes for it.



Lynch smiles at Parker.

                      LYNCH
          I'm cute.


Just then, JASON (a ski mountain employee) approaches the
front of the line and excuses the employee working the chair.

                    PARKER
          Is um... is that her?

                      DAN
          Shit.

                      LYNCH
          Dude.

                    DAN
          It's cool, it's cool.
              (to Parker)
          Look, all you have to do is smile
          real pretty and tell him-


                     PARKER
          -What?   Me? No way.    This is your
          thing.

                    DAN

         Parker, listen, listen. It's so
          easy. All you do is tell the guy
          that you and your friends-

                    LYNCH
          -GIRLfriends. Say "girlfriends".

                    DAN
          -you and your girlfriends forgot
          your credit card and you can't pick
          up your lift tickets.


He grabs a wad of cash out of Lynch's glove and shoves it in
Parker's hand.
                                                                 3.



                        DAN (cont'd)
              Start at $50. That's what we
              usually give the other lady. He'll
              take it. Trust me.

                         PARKER
              Dan, no.   You do it.    I feel
              stupid.

                        DAN
              You've got this.    You can totally
              do this.


                        LYNCH
              Parker, you've so got this.

                        DAN
              The worst thing that happens is he
              says no. He won't say no. No one
              ever says no.

                         PARKER
              Why me?

                        LYNCH
              `Cause you're a girl.

                         DAN
              A very beautiful girl with a very
              charming smile.
                  (then)

              Just...

    He unzips her jacket a little bit, showing some more of her
    body.


                         DAN (cont'd)
              There.

                        PARKER
              My charming smile?

    Dan and Lynch smile back at her.    She exits reluctantly
    towards the lift line.


4   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - CONTINUOUS                                4
    Parker pushes her snowboard forward and moves up the side of
    the line, passing all of the skiers who are waiting.

    She approaches Jason who is now running the lift.    He lights
    a cigarette.
                                                           4.



                      PARKER
          Hey.

Jason looks up at her.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          Could I bum a smoke?



She flashes an adorable but forced smile and he quickly
obliges with a cigarette.

                      PARKER (cont'd)
          Thanks.

He lights her cigarette.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          I'm Parker.

He looks around, not all that sure why a cute girl is talking
to him for more than just to get a smoke.

                      JASON
          Jason.

                      PARKER
          Oh, cool.    My brother's name is
          Jason.

                      JASON
          OK.

                    PARKER
          Yeah, so I don't want to waste your
          time and bullshit you cause you
          seem like a wicked busy guy and
          everything...but..this is gonna
          sound so stupid...

Jason is all ears.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          My girlfriends and I drove all the
          way up here from Salem State, and I
          was sort of the dumbass who told
          everyone that I could cover the
          lift tickets on my Mom's credit
          card...but then I left her credit
          card at the gas station...and so...

Jason totally sees where this is going.
                                                              5.



                          JASON
              Right.

                        PARKER
              No- but I mean, we totally have
              some cash and stuff. We just don't
              have enough to cover all 3 lift
              tickets, you know?

    Jason exhales two lungs full of smoke as the next group gets
    onto the lift.


                          JASON
              How much?

                        PARKER
              Like...fifty?

    Jason scoffs and starts the lift.

                        JASON
              I could lose my job.

    He looks around.


5   EXT. SNOW BANK OVERLOOKING THE CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS        5
    Lynch and Dan watch Parker at work.

                        LYNCH
              He's not going for it.

                        DAN
              Will you shut up? He's gonna go
              for it. It's either stand there
              and do the job for minimal...
              minimal, what is it?

                          LYNCH
              Minimum.

              -Minimum wage or do it for minimum
              wage plus a little bit more.

    Lynch sighs, then changes the subject.

                        LYNCH
              She had to come skiing with us?

    Dan looks back at him, offended.

          at all.

          For ten minutes, Dan. Football
          games are more than ten minutes.

          No, no it's fine. I'm just saying,
          the Mount Holliston day trips were
          our thing, you know? She doesn't

          Now I feel like a dick. You should
          have said something if it was a
          problem.

          It's not a problem. It's not.
          Forget I ever said anything.

They see Parker hand Jason something. He pockets it and she
glides her way back to the end of the line.

She looks up at the guys waiting on the hill and then
excitedly waves. Proud of herself.
                                                              7.

              I would have asked for change.

              It's still way cheaper than paying
              for tickets, right?

    Dan is disappointed.

                        LYNCH
              I would have definitely asked him

              doing this every weekend. In fact,

hand on Parker's shoulder and another on the back post of the

creak. It bends slightly, but seems to hold firm.

     glance down.

     She sees Dan's untimely death approaching and instantly
     starts to scream and cry.

     Lynch holds her head in a vice grip. He presses his forehead

     Lynch continues to hold his hands over Parker's ears and keep
     her eyes pointed at his as the sounds of Dan's demise echo
     through the night.

           The poor thing. She's just a
           puppy. She won't understand that I
           died. She's gonna think I left
           her. That I forgot about her. All
           she wants is for me to come home.
           She's probably waiting by the door
           for me right now. Every sound she
           hears in the hallway she's probably
           cocking her little head to the
           side, waiting to see if I'm going
           to walk in. But I won't. I won't
           ever walk in. And Shayna's going
           to starve to death. The poor thing
           is gonna wither away and die
           waiting by the door for me and it's
           all my fault.

     Dawn is breaking over the trees.

     Lynch and Parker are still. Their bodies are huddled




                            M
     together, but neither is moving.

     In fact, at a first glance, one might think they are both
     human popcycles.

     The dark splotches of frost-bite on Parker's nose and cheeks
     have now grown to what almost looks like patches of black
     fungus on her skin.




       D
     Lynch has the start of his own frost-bite on his ears and
     nose.

     Slowly, Parker's eyes flutter and she awakens.




     E
     Her eyes search around as the realization that this was not
     all just a bad dream sinks in.

     She adjusts in her seat and feels something pull. She winces
     and looks down. Slowly the camera follows her stare down to
     reveal her bare hand, gripping the icy safety bar.

     She pulls...but her skin is stuck to the frozen metal.

     Beginning to panic, she jerks her hand hard, taking the bar
     up about half an inch with it.

                         PARKER
               Uhh...
                                                           76.



Painstakingly slow, she begins to peel her hand off of the
bar.

A sound that resembles `jeans slowly tearing' can be softly
heard as she moves her arm forward and separates her hand
from the skin that is attached to the metal.




                                                  X
After what feels like an eternity, she gives her hand one
last jerk, freeing it from the safety bar.

Her movement startles Lynch awake, and he bolts upright as if
from a `falling nightmare'.

Discombobulated, Lynch turns back and forth frantically

Lynch, bug-eyed, takes in the world around him.

A fresh coat of snow has covered everything in several inches
of peaceful white bliss.

Below them, the snow has completely covered Dan's remains.
There is nothing left to show that there was ever even a

Parker hides her bloody hand back inside of her coat, away
from Lynch's eyes.

not jolt back in horror at how bad her face looks.

He looks around, front to back.   In daylight it's easier to
see the other chairs.

His breath blows out of his body in huge plumes of mist.

Lynch doesn't respond. The look on his face says that "no

a little while longer.

Lynch tries to yell for help again, though his soar throat is

     Lynch is sleeping. His head is leaned to one side in a
     position that is sure to give him the worst stiff neck he's
     ever had.

     Parker is ancy.    She looks all around.   Thinking.

     Finally she squeezes her eyes shut...embarrassed.

     Her snow pants turn dark around her bottom. Slowly a puddle
     of urine forms on the chair between her and Lynch.

     Below them, the urine falls into the snow and disappears.

     Parker's eyes swell as she begins to cry what's left of her
     tears. She is emotionally degraded and devastated.

     breathing.

     It appears she is not.

     He notices her skinned cheek.    Her ear tips are now
     completely blackened.

                What's wrong?

                           LYNCH
                Nothing.

     She studies his eyes.    Clearly something is very wrong.

     few seconds, he returns his feet to the chair back.

               I feel like I gained about 100

               Then don't do this.

     Lynch tries again. He hoists himself up, but bails
     instantly...like a trainer giving up on his 100th pull up.

     He settles back down into the assumed position on the chair.

                         PARKER
               Maybe later.

                         LYNCH
               What? Like I'm gonna feel better
               if I wait a little longer? I
               should have done it last night
               while I still had some strength.

               There's more snow fall on the
               ground and it's all fresh. Maybe
               the jump won't be as bad now.

               have just climbed across last

     She reaches into her pocket and removes her cigarettes.     The

     pick up.

     Again, they speak without emotion. It's conversation just to
     let themselves know that they are still alive.

 This girl Annie. I met her at
 orientation. We emailed all summer
 and when we started school, it was
 like we were already going out. I




              M
 totally just felt it with her, you
 know? We were into a lot of the
 same stuff, which was cool. She
 was way into Aerosmith. I had seen
 them fifteen times, she had seen
 them twenty. How cool is that?

           PARKER

 What happened?

 She um... same favorite movie as
 me. E.T. It was like soul mates

 and that stuff you read about.

 So then... what happened?

            LYNCH
 Same old shit.
     (then)
 No. You know what happened? She
 liked another guy. This fucking
 fraternity douchebag named Dean who
 kept sending her flowers and stuff.
 I don't know who it was exactly,
 but every time I'd go to her room
 some guy named "Dean" had left her
 notes and shit.

           PARKER
 Why did she keep it? Was she
 trying to make you jealous?

 I don't know. I think she just
 liked getting attention.

                                      R
 No. I dumped her. We were in the
 cafeteria, right? And I was
 sitting facing her, facing the
 wall...and she was facing everyone
 in the cafeteria behind me. And I




                          A
 kept seeing her smiling at someone
 behind me and like, almost
 laughing. So I was like, "who are
 you laughing at?" You know? Like
 "what the hell is going on?" And
 she's like, "Dean's making fun of




              M
 you."
      (beat)
 So I turn around, and I'm like
 ready to kick the shit out of this
 guy. And all I see is a sea of
 fucking random people. Just all of
 these faces. This guy could see me
 and was making eyes with my

 girlfriend...but I couldn't see
 him.

                    LYNCH
          Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have
          been so quick to walk out. Maybe I
          needed to have a thicker skin and
          not be such a sensitive bitch, I
          don't know. Sometimes I think I
          was just insecure and maybe I

After a few seconds, her laughs turn to tears.

          No, you didn't. We didn't let him

          try and save us, OK?

          Funny story. First grade, we all

     weight.

     The camera swivels up to reveal his shaky feet trying to find
     footing on the chair back and the ground far below him.

                         LYNCH
               Rrruh!

     He pushes off hard and grabs on to the cabling.
                                                             88.



As his foot pushes fast on the chair, it swings at an
impossible angle.

TIGHT ON the connecting bolts as one of them SNAPS!

                         PARKER
          Oh my god!




                                                   X
The chair leans hard to the right side, forcing Parker to
slide down into what is now the bottom corner of the chair.

The chair is still in place, but it is now hanging by one




                                                 R
bolt and at a severe angle.

                         PARKER (cont'd)
          Joe!    JOE!




                                           A
Joe tries to look back over his shoulder, struggling to keep
himself on the cable against his own body weight and wet
clothing.

                      LYNCH
          Shit!    Hold on, just hold on!




                            M
Another grunt and Lynch makes another big move forward.

The camera booms up above him, shooting straight down at the
distance between his dangling body and the frozen ground.

Tight on his gloved hands as they slowly slide forward on the
metal cable.




  D
Lynch squeezes his eyes shut and takes another reach forward.

Behind him, Parker looks on in agony.      She is holding her
breath and whispering...




E
                    PARKER
              (whispered)
          Please God...please God....please
          God...

The metal arm above her groans under the pressure that the
one remaining bolt is under. Looking at the arm in this
state, it is especially eerie to imagine how these metal
chairs even stay attached to the cables in the first place.

Lynch takes another move forward.

                         LYNCH
          Rrrugh!
                                                         89.



                    PARKER
          You can do it. Please do it.

Lynch reaches forward again...and his hand slips on the icy
cable. He momentarily hangs by one arm.

                      LYNCH




                                               X

                                             R
He reaches up and grabs hold again...his strength is weaning.

                    LYNCH
              (through gritted teeth)
          Got it.




                                     A
Another few quick reaches forward and he is more than halfway
across to the next chair.

From Lynch's point of view we can see his feet floating above
the earth and hear the sound of his own heart beat. His own




                         M
pained breathing fills his ears.

It's only now that he sees two of the wolves watching him
from the bushes.

                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          Motherfucker.




  D
The wind blows hard against him, swaying his body back and
forth as he momentarily rests.

                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          I've got an audience.




E
Parker looks down, just in time to see one of the wolves duck
back into the bushes.

Her movement makes the chair groan harder. The cable twangs
loudly between Lynch's shaky movements and the twisted metal
that holds the arm in place.

                    PARKER
          The chair is gonna fall!

                      LYNCH
          No.    No it's not.

Slowly he makes his way the remaining distance and positions
himself over the other chair.
                                                          90.



He drops down onto it, sending shards of ice cascading down
into the snow below.

He quickly sits down, breathing heavy and clutching the sides
of the chair.

                       LYNCH (cont'd)




                                                    X

                        LYNCH
             Not yet.   Halfway.

He looks behind him at the next chair. Just a few feet back
from it is the giant green lift pole... and a ladder!




                                         A
                        LYNCH (cont'd)
             Please.

He stands up on the chair and reaches up to the cable.   He is
weak.




                           M
Very weak.

                       LYNCH (cont'd)
             Parker. I want you to throw my
             extra pole as far as you can this
             way.




  D
She can't quite hear him.

                        PARKER
             What?




E
                       LYNCH
             I said THROW MY POLE AS FAR AS YOU
             CAN THIS WAY. When I get on the
             ground I'll need some defense.

Parker nods.

She takes Lynch's ski pole and tries to throw it as far as
she can back at him.

The action forces another terrifying metallic groan from the
arm above her, and her chair swings back and forth from the
motion.

                        PARKER
             Oh shit.
                                                           91.



The pole lands under the second chair, splitting the distance
between where she is and where the tree is.

                     PARKER (cont'd)
          Sorry.

                    LYNCH

          up there with you, right?
              (to himself)
          Shit.




                                              R
He starts to pull himself up again, but turns back to Parker
one more time.

The chair has settled down.




                                       A
                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          Stay perfectly still. I'm gonna
          get you home, OK?

He pulls himself up, straining hard.




                        M
                     LYNCH (cont'd)
          Rrrrugh!

This gets the wolves attention.

In the bushes their ears and eyes perk up to the sky,
watching their potential next meal grapple with the high wire
cable.




  D
With reserved strength, Lynch shimmies across the cable as
quickly as he can.

Back at Parker's chair, she eyes the bending metal bolt that




E
is keeping her from plunging to the ground.

Tears stream down her face again.

                    PARKER
              (whispered)
          Please god, don't let me fall.
          Don't let me fall.

He stops once to catch his breath, but begins moving as
quickly as possible.

Finally, he reaches the second chair behind them and drops
down into it.

Looking at the lift pole from this position, he can clearly
see that it wasn't as close to the chair as it looked.
                                                          92.



But it's possible.

                      LYNCH
          Shit.

Parker needs to yell to hear him now.

                                                 R
He assesses the situation.

It's going to take a big leap to try and get near the ladder
and he is winded beyond belief.




                                       A
                    PARKER

                (to himself)
          OK.




  D
The two stare at each other from the distance.   Both of their
weather beaten faces are a mess.

Parker is buried in the corner of the chair closest to the
ground, holding on to the back of it to keep herself steady.




E
Stoically, Lynch turns away from her and takes a deep breath.

He climbs up onto the chair back and looks down.

Parker closes her eyes and prays.

The wolves below do not break their stare.   Their hungry eyes
are willing Lynch to fall from the chair.

It's now or never.

                      LYNCH (cont'd)
          Yaaaaugh!

He throws himself off of the chair and towards the ladder!
                                                                 93.



     He lands and hooks his arm around a rung. With a SNAP his
     arm dislocates from it's socket, but he is hooked on to the
     ladder!

                           LYNCH (cont'd)

               YOU DID IT! YOU DID IT!

     With his bad arm dangling by his side, Lynch works his way
     down the icy metal ladder.




                                                     R
     Finally he reaches the ground and his body falls with a THUD
     into the snow.

               Oooof!

     The wolves' ears are at attention.     They watch carefully from
     the safety of the bushes.

     One, the LEADER, takes a cautious single step forward and




                              M

                   (then)

     The wolf leader begins a dangerously slow and cautious walk




       D
     towards Lynch's body.

     One step at a time.

     As the camera tracks away from the approaching wolf and
     towards Lynch...it is revealed that he is only winded.

     He feels his body for damage, wincing at what can only be a
     broken rib or two. His right arm is twisted at an odd angle
     and by the look on Lynch's face, it must be either broken or
     fractured in addition to being dislocated.

     He moves as fast as he can towards the area under Parker's
     chair, swinging his weapon like a madman all the while.

     The wolves only stare.
                                                                   96.



     Finally, he reaches the area and grabs Dan's snowboard, still
     sticking up in the snow.

     The morning sun hits Parker's pale face.   Is she dead?

     Parker opens her eyes. She must have drifted off for the
     night. She looks to the tree-line around her.

     The sun is coming up.

     She tries to move her body to look back in Lynch's direction
     and the chair argues back at her with another loud groan and
     cable noise.

               Lynch.

     There is no sign of anyone or anything in the direction down
     the hill behind her.

     Slowly a look of great determination comes over her face.




       D
     She raises the safety bar.

     There is no more time to think.




     E
     She is going to die one way or another.

     Slowly, Parker turns her body around towards the seat of the
     chair.

     Holding on to the metal beams that make up the chair, she
     beings to lower herself, inch by inch, off of the side.

     CREEEEE-EEK! The lone metal bolt protests the movement and
     makes metallic threats to snap.

     Parker keeps lowering herself until her entire lower body is
     dangling below the chair.

     RRRRRUUUUUURRR! A gust of wind pushes against the chair,
     straining the arm.
                                                            98.



Parker concentrates and slowly tries to hold up her weight as
she inches her body even lower.

Smoothly, slowly, almost there- SNAP!   The bolt gives way!

The chair lurches down at an even greater angle, sending
Parker off of the side!

only by the one weak thread of cabling that was used to
initially wire it to the main line.

Parker's hands catch at the base of the chair, and she is




                                      A
dangling fully beneath it.

feet closer to the ground, if not more.

All sound cuts out except for her quick breathing and her
heartbeat.

wind.

Slowly she looks down and prepares herself to fall.

The camera inches closer in to her face from below.

Her heartbeat and breathing are all we hear until finally...

She let's go.

As her body falls from the chair, the flimsy wire finally
gives way and the rickety metal seat plummets straight down
to the ground after her.

     years.

     She looks around for her snow board, but with all of the
     fresh snowfall it is buried and gone.

     Parker lays her body down flat on her jacket and begins to

     As she makes her way she spots a tree... with bright red
     blood splayed out in the snow around it.

     From Parker's POV, the camera slowly reveals what is just
     beyond the bloody tree...

     But the look on Parker's face tells us everything we need to
     know first.

     There, in the brush on the side of the trail beyond the tree,
     is the pack of wolves.

     Some still feeding.   Others resting attentively.

     They are circled around Lynch's bloody, half-eaten remains.
                                                              100.



     Quick shots of his jacket, his boots, and his gloved hand all
     flash before Parker's devastated eyes.

     She slows herself to a complete stop now.   Not knowing what
     to do.

     One of the feeding wolves hears this and looks back to see


     Parker just a few feet away. It is the pack leader.

     Lynch's blood pools from it's jaws.

     It's ears go back and it growls loudly at Parker.

     almost daring her to try and take it's treasure.

     Others from the pack look up, distracted briefly, but then go
     back to feeding.

     Parker and the pack leader lock eyes.

     Finally, the leader turns away from Parker, back to his food.

     Back to his family.

     Though her face is emotionless, Parker's eyes are swollen
     with tears as she continues on her way down the mountain
     side.

     around her.

     from her awkward coat/sled...but she pulls herself back on
     and continues to make her way down the hill stoically.

     belly and begins to drag herself towards the parking lot.
