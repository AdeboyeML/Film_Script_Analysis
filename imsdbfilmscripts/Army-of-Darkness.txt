------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1	  GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE - CLOSE-UP - A MAN'S DESPERATE FACE	 1
	   This is Ash, mid twenties, square jaw firmly set and a pair of
	   haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear. Ash speaks to
	   the CAMERA with urgency:
					   ASH
			   Why would you say that I am
			   insane?  I wouldn't say that I've
			   lost my mind simply because I've
			   heard the voices and seen the
			   godless things moving in the
			   woods. If anything, I think more
			   clearly now than ever before. I
			   know now that there is such a
			   thing as a living Evil. A dark
			   and shapeless thing that lives
			   not in the spaces we know, but
			   between them. In the Dark. In the
			   night. And it wants the exact same
			   thing as you and I: a chance at
			   warm life on this Earth. It
			   doesn't care that is already had
			   that chance ...once. Now listen
			   closely because there isn't much
			   time. Listen and believe, because
			   it's all true.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
2	  EXT. A LOG CABIN - NIGHT								2
	   nestled in a dark forest. Through the window, we see the tiny
	   figure of Ash picking up a book from a desk.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I first saw the damn thing at that
			   blasted cabin. The Necronomicon.
			   An ancient Sumarrian text, bound
			   in human flesh and inked in human
			   blood. It contained bizarre burial
			   rites, prophesies...and
			   instruction for demon
			   resurrection. It was never meant
			   for the world of the living.

									   DISSOLVE TO:
3	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 3
	   Ash flips through the pages from the BOOK OF THE DEAD.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   The book awoke something dark in
			   the woods.
									   SUPERIMPOSE:
4	  BOOK OF THE DEAD - CAMERA PANNING STRANGE SCRIPT			 4
	   inscribed on the pages.  Illustrations of demonic faces with
	   white eyes.
5	  EXT. WOODS - NIGHT									 5
	   We take the point of view of a wind-like demon, swooping low
	   through the woods toward the cabin.  CAMERA rips through the
	   cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   It got into my hand and it went
			   bad.
6	  CLOSE ON ASH'S POSSESSED HAND							6
	   twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   So I lopped it off at the wrist.
7	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 7
	   ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.
8	  BLOOD RED CLOUDS									   8
	   sweep past the moon.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   In order to rid myself of the foul
			   thing, I read from a passage in
			   the book that was supposed to open
			   a hole.  A hole in Time that would
			   send the Evil back. And it worked.
9	  A BANDAGED, ONE HANDED ASH							   9
	   recites the incantation from the Necronomicon.
10	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 10
	   The Time vortex is created.  Trees and a 1973 Delta 88
	   Oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   ...I just didn't plan on coming
			   along.
11	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 11
	   Ash, now armed with shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the
	   funnel-cloud of the Time vortex.
12	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   12
	   Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds.  He is
	   swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of
	   Time.
13	 ANIMATION - A TENDRIL OF SMOKE						    13
	   swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build
	   to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM.  The smoke
	   swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the
	   words:
					   "BRUCE CAMPBELL"
					   "Vs"
	   The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as...
					   "THE ARMY OF DARKNESS"
	   The title billows past CAMERA REVEALING...
14	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   14
	   A GRANDFATHER CLOCK
	   its hands winding backwards at an insane rate, spins angrily
	   past, revealing other debris that has been swept up into this
	   funnel cloud. Tumbling weightless through this void we find...
15	 ASH												 15
	   He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady
	   BEATING of his heart.
16	 ANGLE ON ASH FRONT SCREEN PROJECTION					   16
	   He shields his eyes from a sudden bright light.  The funnel
	   cloud electrifies.
17	 ASH'S BODY										    17
	   RIPS at the fabric of Time.
18	 EXT. CLOUDY SKY - DAY								   18
	   All is quiet.  Then, an electrical disturbance in the shape of
	   a human body flashes briefly and is gone.  A moment latter, Ash
	   appears and tumbles from the sky, falling past CAMERA.
19	 EXT. BARREN WASTELAND - DAY							  19
	   ASH falls to the dust.  His double barrelled shotgun lands
	   beside him.  The '73 Oldsmobile comes CRASHING to the ground
	   a moment later.
20	 ASH												 20
	   looks up from the dust to behold...
21	 TWENTY-FIVE MOUNTED HORSEMEN							 21
	   in 12th century armor ride up over a hill.  They halt before
	   Ash.
22	 WARRIOR #1										    22
	   thrusts his longsword into the air, shouting:
					   WARRIOR #1
			   Hail to him who has come from the
			   sky to deliver us from the terror
			   of the Deadites!  Hail!
23	 ASH												 23
	   stares in confusion at the strange medieval figures.
24	 TWENTY-FIVE WARRIOR									24
	   join in the chant and hail Ash, but suddenly stop as...
25	 ARTHUR											   25
	   the muscular commander of the group, gallops his horse into
	   frame, followed by FOUR HORSEMEN who are his lieutenants. Arthur
	   lifts his iron visor and evaluates Ash.
26	 ARTHUR'S P.O.V.									    26
	   The Delta 88 Oldsmobile. The chainsaw, strapped to Ash's back.
	   The handless stump of Ash's right arm.  The Shotgun.
27	 A FRIGHTENED ASH									   27
	   waves a shaky hand.
					   ASH
			   Take is easy now chief. I don't
			   know how I got here and I'm not
			   lookin' for any trouble.
28	 WISEMAN JOHN										  28
	   An elderly man, in a long black cloak, steps forward.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   My Lord Arthur, I believe he is
			   the promised one, written of in
			   the Necronomicon.
29	 ARTHUR											   29
	   Brings his sword down across Ash's chest. Ash cries out in pain
	   as...
30	 ASH'S CHEST										   30
	   is cut. A thin red gash.
					   ARTHUR
			   He bleeds.  As a man bleeds.  The
			   one written of in the Book would
			   not bleed.
31	 ARTHUR GESTURES									    31
	   and CAMERA PANS to four prisoners bound in iron shackles.
					   ARTHUR
			   Likely, he is one of Henry's men.
			   I say to the pit with him!  If he
			   is truly the promised one... he
			   will emerge.
					   WARRIOR #2 AND #3
			   Aye!  The pit's a fair test!
					   GOLD TOOTHED WARRIOR
			   To the pit with the blackard!
32	 GOLD TOOTH										    32
	   charges his horse at Ash. But he is met with the wooden stock
	   of Ash's shotgun as it swings into frame, cracking against his
	   jaw.
33	 WIDE SHOT - GOLD TOOTH - STUNTMAN						 33
	   He tumbles from the horse.
34	 ASH												 34
	   leaps atop Gold Tooth's horse and jerks the reigns.
35	 LONG SHOT - ASH'S HORSE								 35
	   rears up, kicking it's hooves into the air.
36	 ASH												 36
	   gallops off as Warrior #2 runs at him. Ash kicks him in the face
	   as he gallops past.  The Warrior is sent reeling.
37	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH									37
	   galloping over a hill.  He is almost thrown by the horse, but
	   manages to hang on for dear life.
					   ASH
			   Where the hell they put the
			   stirrups on this thing!!??
38	 CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S FEET								 38
	   grasping at the side of the horse, hoping to find some purchase.
39	 LONG SHOT - ASH - STUNTMAN							   39
	   he rides past CAMERA, almost falling from the horse.
40	 ANGLE ON ARTHUR									    40
					   ARTHUR
			   LIEUTENANTS!  Fetch me the blackard.
41	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S ARMORED HORSEMEN						  41
	   unsheathe their broadswords and gallop after Ash. The remaining
	   Warriors watch for sport.
42	 HIGH SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN								42
	   They are gaining an Ash.
43	 ASH												 43
	   glances behind him.
44	 ASH'S P.O.V. - TRUCKING SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN IN PURSUIT		44
	   They diverge to either side of CAMERA.
45	 ASH												 45
	   whips his horse.
					   ASH
			   GIDDYPU!
46	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 46
	   rides up alongside Ash and swings his Broadsword.
	   WHOOSH!!!
47	 ASH												 47
	   ducks the blade.
48	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									48
	   rides up alongside Ash's other flank.  He swings and lands the
	   flat part of his blade along Ash's back.
	   THUNK!
49	 ASH												 49
	   ducks as the first horseman swings his blade again.
	   WHOOSH!
	   ASH looks left...
50	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									50
	   winds up for another blow.
51	 ASH												 51
	   yanks back upon his horse's reigns.
52	 THE THREE HORSES									   52
	   running side by side. Ash's horse drops back suddenly.
53	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									53
	   swings.
54	 HIS BROADSWORD										54
	   slams the First Horseman across the face.
55	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 55
	   is knocked from his steed.
56	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE FIRST HORSEMAN						56
	   is moving fast when he hits the ground. His armored form tumbles
	   end over end in the dust, clanging to a halt against a rock.
57	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									57
	   turns around and gallops back toward Ash.
58	 WIDE SHOT - ASH AND THE SECOND HORSEMAN					58
	   ride at one another.
59	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND SWORDMAN AS HE RIDES			  59
	   swinging his Broadsword.
60	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH AS HE RIDES						   60
	   He inserts the stump of his right arm into the female end of
	   his chainsaw arm bracket.
	   FOOMP!  He twists his stump and the chainsaw bracket locks into
	   place.  CLINK!
	   He thrusts his chainsaw arm outward, pulling on the starter
	   cord; PUTT-PUTT-PUTT... The engine won't turn over.  He curses
	   and yanks again.
61	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									61
	   draws close. He leans from his horse and swings his Broadsword
	   mightily.  The flat portion of the blade connects. THUNK!
62	 ASH												 62
	   is knocked from his steed.  He tumbles to the dust, narrowly
	   escaping his own horse's hooves.
63	 ASH												 63
	   rolls to his feet and spins to the sound of approaching hooves!
64	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									64
	   charges and swings his broadsword.
65	 ASH												 65
	   raises his chainsaw.  CLINK!  He deflects the blow. Ash swings

	   the chainsaw in a roundhouse motion, clipping the Second
	   Horseman as he rides past.
66	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					    66
	   is knocked from his horse.
67	 LOW TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					67
	   bounces along the rocky ground, kicking up dust.
68	 A SWORD HANDLE										68
	   slams against the back of Ash's skull.
69	 ASH												 69
	   crumples.  He looks up in pain to...
70	 ARTHUR											   70
	   above him. The sun over his shoulder.
71	 EIGHT MOUNTED WARRIORS								  71
	   gallop up, dismount and surround Ash with swords drawn.
					   ARTHUR
			   Bring the prisoner!
	   The warriors surge upon Ash. His sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw
	   are taken from him.
					   ASH
			   No!
72	 GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER WARRIORS							72
	   secure Ash to a set of iron shackles that painfully extend his
	   arms. A collar forces his neck upward.
					   ARTHUR
			   To the castle!
73	 WARRIOR #2 ON HORSEBACK								 73
	   prods Ash along with a rod attached to his spiked iron collar.
	   The Warriors gallop off, forcing Ash and the other prisoners
	   to run alongside them.
74	 WISEMAN JOHN										  74
	   Picks up the chainsaw and sawed off shotgun from the dust.  He
	   is troubled by the strange objects. Sunlight glints off the
	   blade of the chainsaw, blinding the CAMERA.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
75	 THE HOT ORB OF THE SUN								  75
	   blazing in the sky above the wasteland.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
76	 EXT. PARCHED LAND - DAY - A WEARY ASH					  76
	   bound in his iron shackles, whipped by Gold Tooth, who rides
	   alongside him.
					   GOLD TOOTH
			   Move along now!
									   DISSOLVE TO:
77	 LONGSHOT - A WIND SWEPT LANDSCAPE OF CRAGGY ROCK			 77
	   CAMERA PANS along the line of Arthur and his horsemen, to find
	   a 12TH CENTURY BATTLE CASTLE built on the edge of a great cliff.
	   A drawbridge is lowered.  Arthur's warriors ride over it.

78	 CAMERA TRACKING WITH ASH								78
	   shackled alongside other prisoners, is prodded inside the castle
	   walls.
79	 INT. CASTLE COURTYARD								   79
	   SHEILA
	   a striking, blonde haired maiden, rushes into frame. She
	   searches the faces of Arthur's warriors and grows concerned.
	   She pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to Arthur
	   atop his horse.
					   SHEILA
			   M'Lord Arthur!  Where is my brother?
			   Did he not ride with you?
					   ARTHUR
			   Eye.  And fought valiantly.  But
			   last night fell in battle to Duke
			   Henry's men.
	   SHEILA
	   Her face does not immediately register the grief.  She attempts
	   to step forward but stumbles.  She steadies herself against the
	   stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the
	   shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash.
	   She flushes with anger and races up to him. She spits and kicks
	   at him as he's dragged along.
					   SHEILA
			   Foul thing!  A pox on your throat!
			   Thou art a Murderer!  A black
			   Murderer!
80	 VILLAGE WOMEN										 80
	   restrain her.
	   SHEILA
	   cries as the Village Women attempt to soothe her.
					   VILLAGE WOMAN #1
			   May you be consoled by their
			   suffering in the pit.
81	 THE PROCESSION, ASH AND THE FOUR OTHER PRISONERS			 81
	   halt. Iron keys rattle. The shackles are unlocked. Ash and the
	   prisoners rub their reddened wrists. They are pushed at
	   swordpoint towards a circular iron grate that sits atop the
	   ground. This is THE PIT.
82	 ASH												 82
	   looks to the jeering villagers that surround the pit, wondering
	   what they have in store for him.
83	 SHEILA											   83
	   stares at him in hatred.
84	 THE PRISONER NEXT TO ASH								84
	   eyes Ash curiously.  This is Duke Henry the Red.
					   DUKE HENRY
			   You sir, are not one of my
			   vassals.  Who are you?
					   ASH
			   Who wants to know?
					   DUKE HENRY
			   I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale.
			   Lord of the Northlands and leader
			   of its people.
					   ASH
			   You ain't leadin' but two things
			   now, pal. Jack and shit.  And Jack
			   left town.
85	 A STERN FACED ARTHUR AND HIS FOUR LIEUTENANTS			    85
	   address the doomed men:
					   ARTHUR
			   There is an Evil that has awakened
			   in this land.  And whilst my
			   people fight for their very souls
			   against it, you, Duke Henry the
			   Red, wage war on us. Your people
			   are no better than the foul
			   corruption that lies in the bowels
			   of that pit!  May God have mercy
			   on your souls.
86	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S MEN									86
	   crank a massive wench.  Chains tighten and the heavy iron lid
	   slides back, revealing a dark hole.  The Pit.
87	 FROM THE BOWELS OF THE IRON GRATED PIT					 87
	   a echoed wailing rises up.
88	 ASH, HENRY AND THE OTHER PRISONERS						88
	   stiffen in fear.
89	 AN OLD WOMAN AMONGST THE JEERING CROWD					 89
					   OLD WOMAN
			   Aye. Into the pit with the
			   bloodthirsty sons of whores!
	   She jams a meat pie into her mouth and cheers excitedly as
	   CAMERA PANS TO...
90	 HENRY'S WARRIOR #1									 90
	   as he's thrown down into the pit.  He disappears into the
	   blackness.
91	 CAMERA PANS AND HALTS CLOSE ON ASH						91
	   watching with disbelief.  We hear the warrior's echoed cry of
	   terror, then a SPLASH as he hits bottom.
92	 CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PIT							 92
	   looking down into the blackness we hear:
					   HENRY'S WARRIOR #1 (O.S.)
			   I beg of you... by all that's
			   holy!  Lower a rope!  Lower... Oh,
			   for the love of god!  no!  NO!!!
			   AIIIIIiiieee!
	   The sound of ripping and scratching.  The SHRIEK of terror is
	   cut short as...
	   A GEYSER OF BLOOD
	   erupts upward from the pit. Then silence.
93	 ASH												 93
	   is frozen in fear.
					   TOWER GUARD (O.S.)
			   There!  He's escaping!
	   ASH'S TERRIFIED GAZE
	   jerks from the pit to...
94	 TRACKING SHOT - HENRY'S WARRIOR #2						94
	   making a break for it!  He's past the guards, heading for the open
	   drawbridge.
95	 THE TOWER ARCHERS									  95
	   spot him and fire arrows.
96	 ANGLE ON											 96
	   PING!  PING!
	   They bounce off the Warrior's armor.  He's makes it to the open
	   drawbridge when...
97	 ARTHUR											   97
	   pulls back a iron arrow in his crossbow.  ZING!  He lets it fly.
	   CAMERA SWISH PANS with arrow...
98	 PAN HALTS ON HENRY'S WARRIOR #2						   98
	   The iron arrow punctures the Warrior's armor, pegging him to
	   a wooden post.  He dies standing.
99	 THE CROWD											99
	   Cheers.  They turn their attention to the remaining prisoners:
	   CAMERA PANS from their bloodthirsty faces to the next prisoner
	   in line...
100	ASH												 100
	   turns to Arthur and in a desperate, cowardly plea:
					   ASH
			   Hey, I never even saw these
			   assholes before..
	   He spins to Duke Henry the Red.
			   You gotta tell 'em you don't know
			   me. We never met. Tell him.
					   HENRY
			   I do not believe that he shall
			   listen.
101	THE WARRIORS										  101
	   grab Ash and shove him into the pit.
102	ASH												 102
	   tumbles down into the pit.  He lands in a STEAMING pool of foul
	   water at the pit's bottom.  He stands and coughs out a mouthful

	   of the rancid water. He looks about.
103	INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V.								 103
	   UNDERGROUND CAVERNS disappear into the blackness.
104	ASH												 104
	   spins to a small sound.
105	INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V.								 105
	   Nothing.  Just the mist rising from the water.
106	ASH												 106
	   shifts his glance again.
107	A SHADOW											 107
	   rounds a corner and disappears from sight.
108	ASH												 108
	   doesn't notice the misty water behind him beginning to stir.
	   Bubbles. A hand emerges. Silently, a pair of bone white eyes
	   break the surface.
109	ASH												 109
	   spins... but there's nothing there.  As he turns back around,
	   he is confronted by...
	   A FEMALE EVIL DEAD
	   It's rotted corpse rockets up from the water inches from Ash's
	   face!
110	CLOSER											   110
	   Putrid water drains from it's empty eye sockets and mouth. It
	   jerks like a marionette as it advances.
111	ASH SCREAM										    111
	   and backs against the steep rock wall of the pit.  He tries to
	   scale the steep face. He gets one foot up.
112	THE DEADITE'S HAND									 112
	   clutches Ash's ankle and yanks him back down.
113	DOWN ANGLE ON ASH									  113
	   He falls away from the wall, his arms flailing.
114	ABOVE THE PIT - GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER VILLAGERS			   114
	   hoot and cheer for Ash to be devoured.
115	THE PIT - THE DEADITE								   115
	   grabs Ash, and begins hammering him with her rotted fists.
116	ABOVE THE PIT - SHEILA								  116
	   shouts for Ash's death.
117	THE PIT - ASH'S FACE								    117
	   The Deadite's fist enters frame, slugging Ash.
118	LONG SHOT - ASH									    118
	   is knocked back into a shallow pool of steaming water.
119	THE DEADITE										   119
	   races toward Ash, leaps into the air and comes down with a
	   kneedrop onto Ash's stomach.
120	ASH												 120
	   cries out in pain.
121	ASH'S LEGS										    121
	   cross to form a scissor lock around the Deadite's throat.  He
	   flips the beast.
122	ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN							 122
	   rides into the castle, dismounts and pushes through the crowd
	   with a bundle wrapped in cloth.
123	THE DEADITE										   123
	   grabs Ash by the throat.
124	THE PIT - A BLOODIED ASH								124
	   is thrown against the rock wall of the pit.
125	THE DEADITE										   125
	   advances.
126	ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN							 126
	   shouts down at Ash.
127	THE PIT - ASH										 127
	   trying to hear what the Wiseman is saying. His head jolts
	   backward, barely avoiding the beast's wild swing. Ash squints
	   to discern Wiseman John throwing something down to him: an
	   object falling at him through the glare above.
128	THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION							   128
	   tumbling downward.  Blinding beams of sunlight bouncing off its
	   blade of steel.  Ash's Excalibur!
129	ASH - SLOW MOTION									  129
	   summons his strength and leaps upward.
130	LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP - THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION		   130
	   Tumbling downward...
131	HIGH ANGLE- ASH									    131
	   ascending, his teeth gritted, every muscle straining, he soars
	   past CAMERA.
132	LONG SHOT - SLOW MOTION								 132
	   Ash rising up through frame to meet the falling saw.
133	ASH'S STUMP										   133
	   snags the chainsaw, locking in onto his wrist bracket.CLICK!
134	ASH WITH HIS CHAINSAW								   134
	   He lands on his feet, in the path of the approaching beast.
					   ASH
			   Come on, you blasted piece of--
	   He thrusts out his chainsaw arm, yanking the starter cord and...
	   VERRROOOOOOM!!
135	ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIOR AND VILLAGERS				   135
	   gasp at the ROAR of the chainsaw.  Blue exhaust billows up from
	   the pit.
136	THE PIT - LOW ANGLE - THE DEADITE						 136
	   lunges at Ash.
137	DEADITE HAND MEETS SAW								  137
	   Buzzzzz!!
138	ASH												 138
	   is splattered with black bile.
139	THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND							   139
	   flies upward, past the face of the bewildered beast.
140	CAMERA MOUNTED TO THE HAND							   140
	   as it ascends, Ash and the Deadite grow smaller below.
141	ABOVE THE PIT - THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND				  141
	   flies up into frame and latches onto the face of a drunken
	   spectator. It's fingers dig into the eyes and nose. He shrieks
	   and flails about, into the screaming crowd. A Warrior tears the
	   hand free from his face, tossing it back down into the pit.
142	THE PIT - ASH										 142
	   raises the chainsaw blade and neatly bisects the falling deadite
	   hand.  He spins and with a roundhouse blow...
143	CAMERA MOUNTED ON ASH								   143
	   Ash decapitates the beast.
144	ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIORS AND VILLAGERS				  144
	   stop cheering from the Deadite. They're starting to like this
	   guy's guts and style.
145	THE LAST REMNANTS									  145
	   of the beast sink beneath the murky waters of the pit.
146	ASH												 146
	   climbs the steep wall of the pit when a SECOND DEADITE emerges
	   from the earthen wall before him.
147	ASH												 147
	   slams the butt end of the chainsaw into the beast, knocking it
	   back into the water.
148	ABOVE THE PIT - THE VILLAGERS							148
	   gasp as...
	   THUMP!
149	ASH'S CHAINSAW ARM									 149
	   comes up, over the edge of the pit.  Followed by... THUMP!  Ash's
	   bloody hand.  Then his bruised face.  Covered in the black blood
	   of the Deadites. He crawls to his feet.
	   Ash tuns to the crowd, his list clenched.
					   ASH
			   All right now. Who wants to be
			   next?  Who wants some.
150	GOLD TOOTH										    150
	   look at Ash stupidly. Ash shoves him.
					   ASH
			   You want some more?  Huh?!
	   Gold Tooth and the others give him a wide berth. Ash calls out
	   to Henry.
					   ASH
			   Now climb on those horses and get
			   out of here.
151	HENRY AND HIS TWO WARRIORS							   151
	   quickly mount horses.
					   ARTHUR
			   Nay. Henry is my prisoners. He--
152	ASH												 152
	   slaps Henry's horse.
					   ASH
			   GIDDYUP NOW!!  HYAAAH!
153	THE STUNNED CROWD									  153
	   parts allowing...
154	HENRY AND HIS WARRIORS								  154
	   to gallop off toward the open drawbridge and freedom.
155	ARTHUR											   155
	   stares at Ash with hatred.
					   ARTHUR
			   For that, I shall see you dead.
156	ASH												 156
	   removes his sawed off shotgun from Wiseman John's horse and
	   turns to Arthur, then the crowd.
					   ASH
			   This is my boomstick. It's a
			   twelve gauge, double barreled
			   Remington pump. Next one of you
			   primitives touch me...
157	ASH SPINS,										    157
	   pointing the barrel just past Arthur. He, but no one else, has
	   spotted the surviving Second Deadite crawling up from the pit
	   on the forgotten chain.
	   The crowds gasp is cut short by....BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The shotgun belches flame. The blast cuts the chain, leaving
	   the Deadite teetering at the pit's edge.
158	ANGLE ON											 158
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The second shot blows the beast into a backflip, sending it
	   summersaulting down into the pit.
159	THE SOUND OF THE GUNBLAST							    159
	   echoes off the mountains like distant thunder.
160	SHEILA, THE WISEMAN, ARTHUR AND THE CROWD				   160
	   look to Ash in reverence.

161	ASH												 161
	   twirls the shotgun about western style: WHOOSH, WHOOSH,
	   WHOOSH...  and holsters it.
					   ASH
			   Bring me your hoo do man.
162	EXT. BLACKBIRDS									    162
	   fly from a barren tree.
163	SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS						   163
	   It prowls, skimming the surface of the ground, moving swiftly
	   past rocks and over the crest of a hill revealing...
164	EXT. TEMPLE RUINS - LONG SHOT - NIGHT					  164
	   A massive grouping of freestanding rectangular stones, each
	   twenty feet tall.  The remains of an ancient temple.  In the
	   center of the ruins there burns a roaring bonfire.  As old Woman
	   stirs a cauldron atop the flames.  Nearby, Arthur converses with
	   his four Lieutenants.
165	EXT. WITHIN THE RUINS - NIGHT							165
	   CLOSE UP - ASH
	   opens his mouth to allow a spoonful of food to enter.  No sooner
	   has he swallowed then a piece of fruit is offered.  He waves
	   it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from a goblet
	   on wine, brought to his lips by a female hand.
166	ASH AND SHEILA										166
	   sits across the flames from Arthur and his men.  She bandages
	   Ash's wounds.
167	SHEILA											   167
	   is dresses in a revealing tunic. She looks good.
					   SHEILA
			   I pray thee to forgive me.  I
			   believed thee one of Henry's men.
	   She touches Ash's hand. Ash turns away
					   ASH
			   First you wanta kill me, now ya
			   wanna kiss me.
	   He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds.
					   ASH
			   Lady, just leave me alone.
					   SHEILA
			   I'm sorry m'lord. Please
			   understand... T'is a cruel time
			   for us. The Wisemen say you are
			   the promised one. Our only hope
			   against the darkness that has
			   descended on this land.
					   ASH
			   They're mistaken.
	   She stares deeply into his eyes.
					   SHEILA
			   I think not.  I feel that there
			   is reason for your being here.
			   It is no accident.
166	WISEMAN JOHN AND TWO OTHER CLOAKED WISEMEN				  167
	   approach.  They sit in tall stone chairs across the fire from
	   Ash.
					   ASH
			   Well what is it?  Can you send me
			   back or not?
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Only the Necronomicon has the
			   power.  A power which we both
			   require. It contains passages that
			   can dispel the Evil from this
			   place and return you to your time.
					   ASH
			   The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's
			   the thing that got me here.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   It is in a place far from here.
			   It can only be retrieved by the
			   Promised one. Other Warriors have
			   tried.  Their widows grieve still.
			   We have waited long years for you.
			   Out only hope is the Necronomicon.
			   Thou must undertake to quest for
			   it.  Alone must thou travel to
			   a distant cemetery. There thou
			   shalt find it.
					   ASH
			   Me?  Now way, no day. Only place I'm
			   goin' is home.
	   A sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire.
169	DOGS												169
	   around the fire begin to snarl and fight.
170	ASH AND SHEILA										170
	   turn to see...
171	THE OLD WOMAN										 171
	   now standing too close to the fire.  Her robes ignites.  She does
	   not respond as flames sweep up her body. She continues to stir
	   the caldron.
172	ASH												 172
	   His haw drops.  He slowly stands as...
173	THE BURNING WOMAN									  173
	   spins sharply to him.  Her voice changes as she SHRIEKS;
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   YOU SHALL DIE!
	   Her eyes are bone white.  She is POSSESSED by the dark spirit.
	   Her burning body is violently jerked about in the air by
	   invisible hands. Her blackened lips pull back in a wild animal
	   snarl. With two voice at once;
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   YOU SHALL NEVER WIN THE
			   NECRONOMICON.  WE SHALL FEAST UPON
			   YOUR SOUL, AND THEN THE SOUL OF
			   MAN!
174	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									174
	   collapses. Her face turned away from the Wisemen as it lays in
	   the dust.
175	CLOSE ON POSSESSED WOMAN'S FACE - GROUND LEVEL CAMERA		 175
	   Unseen by all, her bone white eyes flare open!  A nasty grin forms
	   on her face as she lies in the dust. Behind her, the Wisemen
	   approach.
176	WISEMAN JOHN										  176
	   kneels and reaches for her.
177	ASH'S HAND										    177
	   clutches Wiseman John, not allowing him to touch her.
					   ASH
			   It's a trick.  Get an axe.

178	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									178
	   awakens from her false slumber with a terrible BARK.  In a
	   frenzy she hurls WISEMAN JOHN into the bonfire. He SCREAMS and
	   rolls in the dust, extinguishing the flames.
179	PAPER MACHE STONE ARCHWAY							    179
	   With her great strength, the Possessed Woman pushes upon one
	   of the giant stone archways. It topples over, crushing two
	   warriors beneath it.
180	A GIGANTIC STONE									   180
	   topples the next stone.
	   BOOM!
	   Which topples the next, which sets off a chain reaction.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!
	   Like giant dominoes, they fall.
181	ASH												 181
	   watches the spectacle in horror as he sees...
182	ANGLE ON											 182
	   The gigantic falling stones coming right at SHEILA!
183	THE FALLING STONE'S P.O.V. - SHEILA					    183
	   She SCREAMS!
184	SHEILA'S P.O.V. - THE FALLING STONES					   184
	   coming toward CAMERA.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!
185	ASH												 185
	   does a flying leap and tackles SHEILA, knocking her out of the
	   stone's deadly path.
186	ASH AND SHEILA										186
	   rolls across the dusty stone courtyard.
187	CLOSE SHOT - ASH									   187
	   rolls into frame and glances up to see...
188	THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN						   188
	   rushing through the air at him with a SHRIEK!
189	WIDE SHOT - THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN				 189
	   latches onto Ash like an iron trap, knocking them both to the
	   ground.
190	ASH												 190
	   rolls the Possessed Woman over, and into the path of...
191	ANGLE ON											 191
	   The falling, gigantic domino-like stones.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!
192	EXT. WITHIN THE TEMPLE RUINS - PAPER MACHE STONE			 192
	   THE POSSESSES WOMAN
	   SHRIEKS in agony as... SMASH!  The multi-ton stone crushes her
	   legs to paste.  Her legs are pinned but still she battles on,
	   clutching Ash about his throat!
193	ASH												 193
	   gasps for breath as he reaches behind him, into the flames of
	   the fire, his fingers groping for a weapon.
194	POSSESSED WOMAN - STOP MOTION ANIMATION					194
	   Her blackened lips pull back and her mouth opens to an
	   impossibly large size, like a snake about to eat an egg.
195	ASH												 195
	   grasps a flaming log with his bare hands and rams it down the
	   monster's oversized throat.  She chokes.
196	GOLD TOOTH AND THREE OTHER WARRIORS					    196
	   grab the beast and pull it off of Ash.  Arthur comes to meet
	   them.  He carries a double-bladed battle axe.
197	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									197
	   vomits out the flaming log, taking off a man's head.
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   The Evil lives.  Slay me and ten
			   will rise to take my place.  All
			   will die.  ALL WILL -
	   CHOP!
198	IN SILHOUETTE, THE AXE								  198
	   is brought down upon her throat.  The possessed body flails and
	   spasm beneath the Warrior's grip.
199	THE HEAD											 199
	   rolls, and comes to a halt at Ash's feet.  It's eyes pop open!
					   POSSESSED WOMAN'S HEAD
			   ---DIE!
200	ARTHUR											   200
	   grabs the laughing head and tosses it into the darkness.  The
	   head sails away as the laughter receded.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Now.  Will thou quest for the
			   Necronomicon?
201	CLOSE ON ASH										  201
	   He considers.
202	INT. CASTLE - BLACKSMITH'S WORKSHOP - DAY				   202
	   Ash and the blacksmith step into the shop.
203	ASH												 203
	   points to the hand piece on a hanging suit of battle armor.
204	THE BLACKSMITH										204
	   pounds upon the hand armor, modifying it.
205	SHEILA											   205
	   knits a grey woolen garment as she watches Ash.
206	BLACKSMITH'S WORKSHOP - DAY							  206
	   THE BLACKSMITH
	   attaches the shock absorber spring to the iron hand.
207	ASH												 207
	   tightens the tension on the shock absorber springs with a
	   ratchet like device.
208	ASH												 208
	   extends his arm triggering the tightly wound spring.
	   WHOOSH!  CLANG!
209	SHEILA											   209
	   gasps.
210	ASH'S SPRING-DRIVEN IRON HAND							210
	   SNAPS open with great force.
211	ANGLE ON											 211
	   WHOOSH CLANG!
	   ASH'S SPRING DRIVEN HAND
	   clenches closed with such great power, that it bends a iron
	   goblet.
212	CLOSE ON ASH										  212
	   He studies his new hand. It will do nicely.

									   DISSOLVE TO:
213	EXT. CASTLE TURRET - NIGHT							   213
	   ASH
	   stares over the castle wall to the foreboding wasteland with
	   apprehension.  The wind blows upon his hair. Sheila appears
	   behind him. She drapes a grey garment over Ash. A magnificent
	   cape. Ash draws her body close to his. He wraps the cape around
	   her.  Together they stare off into the night, then turn to one
	   another and kiss.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
214	EXT. LANDSCAPE OF CRACKED GROUND 1500MM LENS - DAY		    214
	   Arthur's castle in the distance.  In the foreground, five men

	   on horseback appear over a ridge, thundering toward us. Their
	   long wool capes billowing up behind them in the wind.
215	CLOSER ON RIDERS - TRUCKING SHOT						  215
	   Arthur and Wiseman John ride, flanked by two of Arthur's
	   Warriors.  CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL...
	   ASH
	   He wears an iron breastplate with the insignia of Arthur's army
	   that compliments his new spring-powered iron hand.  His chainsaw
	   juts from it's saddle holster on the horse's back.  Ash's cape
	   billows as he rides.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
216	EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY									216
	   The Horsemen wind down a trail.  Suddenly the horses rear up.
	   The men gain control of the frightened steeds.
					   ASH
			   What's going on?
	   ARTHUR
	   points to...
217	THE TRAIL THAT LIES BEFORE THEM						   217
	   It disappears abruptly into a swirling wall of mist that emits
	   an eerie whistling.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   This is the edge of the land ruled
			   by the Dark Spirit. This path will
			   lead you to an unholy place. A
			   cemetery. There, the Necronomicon
			   awaits.
218	ASH												 218
	   anxiously eyes the wall of swirling mist.
219	THE TWO WARRIORS									   219
	   finish placing saddlebags of water and food onto...
	   ASH'S HORSE
	   which nervously pounds the earth with it's hooves.
					   WARRIOR #1
			   Lord Arthur, he is supplied.  Now
			   I beg of you, let us leave this
			   foul place.
					   ARTHUR
			   A moment.
220	WISEMAN JOHN										  220
	   moves close to Ash.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   As thou removest the Book from
			   it's cradle, you must recite these
			   words.  Clatoo, verata, Nicto.
					   ASH
			   Clatto Verata Nicto.  Okay.

					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Repeat them.
					   ASH
			   Clatto Verata Nicto.
					   WISEMAN #1
			   Again.
					   ASH
			   I got it.  I got it.  I know your
			   damn words. All right?  Now you get
			   this straight: I get the book,
			   you send me back. That's the deal.
			   After that I'm history.
	   Ash rears up on his horse and gallops into the mist
221	ARTHUR AND WISEMAN JOHN								 221
	   watch as Ash disappears.
222	IN A SEA OF MIST									   222
	   The sound of THUNDEROUS HOOFS.  A form materializes out of the
	   fog:  It is Ash.
223	CLOSER ON ASH										 223
	   He whips the horse.
					   ASH
			   HAAAAAA!
224	ANGLE ON ASH										  224
	   He gallops past.  CAMERA PANS as he disappears into the thick
	   fog.
									   FADE OUT.
225	EXT. TRAIL'S ENTRANCE TO WOODS						    225
	   ASH
	   rides out of the wall of mist. He finds himself on a trail
	   leading into a thick forest.
226	EXT. WOODS										    226
	   LONG SHOT - ASH
	   rides slowly on through the darkening woods.
227	CLOSER ON ASH										 227
	   He hears a sound and look to...
228	A SECTION OF WOODS									 228
	   A branch SCRAPING against the bark of a tree.
229	ASH												 229
	   hears a woman's soft laughter.  He glance to...
230	A BUBBLING BROOK									   230
	   and nothing more.
231	THE EVIL FORCE P.O.V.								   231
	   powers through the woods toward Ash.
232	ASH												 232
	   kick his steed and bolts.
233	THE EVIL FORCE										233
	   sweeps over the forest floor, gaining velocity.
234	ASH												 234
	   frantically weaves his horse around storm felled trees which
	   jut from the ground.
235	THE EVIL FORCE										235
	   rips through the trees, splintering them to toothpicks.  It
	   burrows underground, and resurfaces, always closing upon Ash.
236	ASH												 236
	   jerks upon the reins and his steed leaps a fallen tree.  He
	   gracefully leaps a second tree.  But as he leaps over the third,
	   he is ripped off the horse by a low branch.  He falls hard to
	   the mud as the horse gallops off.
	   He groggily stands and stumbles onward.
237	THE EVIL FORCE										237
	   follows Ash down a wooded trail.
238	ASH												 238

239	EXT. WOODEN SHED									   239
	   a grain storage house in the clearing ahead.

241	INT. SHED - CLOSE ON INTERIOR DOOR						241
	   A log, that serves as the door's bolt, holds fast.
242	THE EVIL FORCE										242
	   emerges from over the ridge.
243	ASH												 243
	   unscrews his iron hand and holsters it.  He slings the chainsaw
	   from his shoulder and snaps it onto his stump bracket.  Click.
	   He threads the chainsaw starter cord through the V-SHAPED SLOT
	   that extends from his breastplate. CLICK.  He thrusts out his
	   arm and the chainsaw ROARS to life!
244	INT. SHED - CLOSE ON INTERIOR DOOR						244

			   Blasted piece of junk!
248	THE EVIL FORCE										248

249	ASH												 249
	   delivers a mighty kick to the door.
250	INT. SHED											250
	   ANGLE ON DOOR
	   The partially cut log gives way.  Ash tumbles into the storage
	   shed. He slams the door shut and slides the remainder of the
	   log across the latch, re-bolting it.
251	THE EVIL FORCE										251
	   Hammers at the door of the Shed.
	   BANG!
252	INT. SHED											252
	   A terrified Ash braces his back against the door.
	   BANG!
	   Earth shaking in its intensity. The planks of the door shudder
	   behind Ash.
253	CLOSE ON LOG BOLT									  253
	   It cracks.
254	ASH												 254
	   presses himself against the door for all he's worth, praying
	   that whatever it out there, won't get in.
	   BANG!  Splinters fly.
255	CLOSE ON LOG BOLT									  255
	   BOOM!  The crack widens.
256	THE DOOR FRAME										256
	   behind Ash begins to buckle beneath the hammering blows.
257	ASH												 257
	   begins to SCREAM.  And the BANGING halts.
258	LONG SHOT - INT. SHED								   258
	   All is quiet.  Ash hugs the door. Shaking in the silence.  And
	   that's when it hits.  LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE!
	   Ash and the door he braces are blasted away from the wall of
	   the Shed as the Evil Force brings it's tremendous power to bare.
259	INT. SHED - SAM-O-CAM - INTERVOLOMETER					 259
	   TRACKING WITH ASH AND THE DOOR
	   as they are swept up at super speed in the grip of the Evil
	   Force.  Ash is seen rocketing through the long hallway of the
	   Shed, spinning head over heels.  Ash rips through other doors,
	   taking them with him. Ash is now sandwiched between two doors
	   as he flies through the air.
260	EXT. SHED - SIDE SHOT								   260
	   The roof of the shed ripples, sending tiles and wood beams
	   flying as the EVIL FORCE surges through the shed like a tidal
	   wave.
261	EXT. REAR DOOR OF SHED								  261
	   It blows out from the place in a flying stack along with the

	   All is quiet.  We hear the sound of a bolt moving. The doorknob
	   turns slightly.  The door swings upward and opens... revealing
	   a somewhat flattened Ash who picks his groggy and bruised self
	   up.

	   He beholds...
264	EXT. ABANDONED MILL									264

	   a gigantic ball of fire as it sets behind the Mill.  The wind
	   kicks up.
269	INT. MILL											269
	   ASH
	   listens as the cabin CREAKS like an old ship beneath the force
	   of the gale.
270	THE WOODEN SHUTTERS									270
	   on the window quietly KNOCK.  Ash shivers and rubs his arms for
	   warmth.
					   ASH
			   Damn this cold.
271	ASH												 271
	   looks about the Mill and spots an iron stove.
272	GASOLINE											 272
	   pours out of Ash's chainsaw over some logs in the stove's belly.
273	ASH												 273
	   lights the fire with his Zippo lighter and huddles near the
	   flame for warmth.
					   ASH
			   'least I won't freeze to death.
	   He turns to a tiny sound.
274	WIDE SHOT - ASH									    274
	   behind him, through the window, a large gnarled hand sweeps
	   past.

275	ASH												 275
	   spins, raises his shotgun and fires.
	   BLAMITY-BLAM!
	   The window is ripped away in a shower of glass.
276	ASH'S P.O.V. - THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOW				    276
	   Only the night woods.  The "gnarled hand" comes back, sweeping
	   down in front of the broken window, but it's revealed to be just
	   a tree branch swaying in the wind.
277	ASH												 277
	   reloads. He moves to the front door and peers out through a
	   crack.
278	ASH'S EYEBALL										 278
	   through the crack in the door.
279	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE WOODS BEYOND						   279
	   CAMERA pushes through the crack to the woods beyond.  There is
	   movement.
280	LONG SHOT - EXT. MILL								   280
	   The tiny figure of Ash steps from the Mill.
281	CLOSE UP - ASH										281
	   He sweeps the barrel of the shotgun toward the sound of sticks
	   breaking.
282	ASH'S TERRIFIED HORSE								   282
	   It rears up on it's hind legs. It's front hoofs come down toward
	   Ash.
283	A STARTLED ASH										283
	   leaps aside just in time.
284	ASH												 284
	   snags the horse's reigns.
					   ASH
			   Easy, boy.
	   The horse calms.  Ash ties it to a tree, patting it's head. A
	   shadow passes behind him. He turns toward the Mill.
285	ASH'S P.O.V.  THROUGH THE MILL'S OPEN DOOR				  285
	   He sees am image of himself inside the Mill. Peering out.
286	EXT. MILL											286
	   ASH
	   stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the
	   Mill, halting Ash's view. Ash races for the Mill.
287	INT. MILL											287
	   ASH
	   races through the door and toward CAMERA when...SMASH...Ash's
	   reflection shatters. He's run into a mirror. Shivering, he picks
	   himself up from the pile of broken glass. He moves to the
	   fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO....
288	THE SHATTERED MIRROR PIECES							  288
	   Each piece of mirror reflects an image of Ash.  From the eight
	   pieces of mirror spring...
289	EIGHT TINY ASHES									   289
	   Two inch high versions of himself.  They leap from the mirror
	   fragments and land on the floor.
290	ASH												 290
	   is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire.
291	TINY ASH #1, #2, AND #3								 291
	   grab a discarded dinner fork.  Like men on a battering ram, they
	   race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks.
292	ASH												 292
	   SCREAMS in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the
	   stove pipe.
293	TINY ASH #4, #5, AND #6								 293
	   lift the barrel of the shotgun in Ash's direction.  Another
	   leaps upon the shotgun's trigger. BOOM!
294	ASH												 294
	   barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head
	   off.
295	THE TINY ASHES										295
	   SHRIEK with uncontrollable laughter.  They jump away from the
	   shotgun and scurry off across the floor.
296	ASH												 296
	   pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it.
297	TINY ASH #1										   297
	   is running for his life, as fast as his tiny legs will carry
	   him.
298	TRACKING SHOT - THE FORK								298
	   a giant projectile as it ROARS AT CAMERA. PAN with it as it
	   WHOOSHES past.
	   FA-THONG!
299	THE FORK											 299
	   skewers tiny Ash #1 to the wooden wall of the mill.
300	ASH												 300
	   stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front
	   of him by other tiny ASHES.  His head slams into a stove pipe.
	   He crumples.  He lands with his cheek pressed against the hot
	   stove.  SSSSSSssss.  He pries his face loose with a spatula.
301	A BUCKET OF GREASE									 301
	   is pushed off a high shelf.
	   CLANG!
302	IT LANDS ON ASH'S HEAD								  302
	   and spills slippery grease about the floor.
303	ASH												 303
	   with an upside-down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back
	   and forth on the grease.  He stands and tries to dislodge the
	   bucket.  He trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his
	   path.  He falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting
	   needles jutting from it.
304	BUCKET-HEADED ASH									  304
	   SCREAMS and jerks upward, slamming his bucket head into the
	   stove pipe.  CLANG!  Ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks
	   the needles from his buttocks.  He looks about for the little
	   imps.
305	TINY ASH #2										   305
	   crouching behind a log attempting to hide.  BUT...
306	ASH												 306
	   has seen him.  He "accidentally" elbows the log and Tiny Ash
	   #2 into the stove's fire.
					   ASH
			   Ooops.
307	TINY ASH #2										   307
	   is burned alive.
308	ASH												 308
	   glances downward at the pitter patter sound of tiny feet.
309	TINY ASH #3										   309
	   is dashing across the open expanse of floor.  Ash's gigantic
	   foot comes down to crush the little man.  Tiny Ash #3 raises
	   a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot.
	   RIP!!
310	THE NAIL RIPS										 310
	   through Ash's shoe.
311	ASH												 311
	   jerks his leg upward in pain.  Ash dances about the place
	   hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the greasy area
	   of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in
	   his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost
	   regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls,
	   and hits his head on the stone floor. BLACKNESS.
312	ASH												 312
	   awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with
	   tiny ropes.  Directly above him, on the edge of a table...
313	TINY ASHES #4 AND #5								    313
	   suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs.
314	TINY ASH #7 AND #8									 314
	   stand atop Ash's face.  They push from either side of his
	   nostrils, plugging his nose.  Ash's mouth opens as he gasps for
	   air.  As he inhales...
315	SUSPENDED TINY ASH #6								   315
	   is released.
316	TINY ASH #6 - SLOW MOTION - WIND FAN					   316
	   He free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form
	   a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat.
317	ASH												 317
	   inhales the living beast whole.  He chokes violently.  He breaks
	   his bonds an he hacks for breath.  He puts his finger down his
	   throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no
	   avail.
	   He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but they are
	   gone.  He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles
	   to a chair.  He goes pale.
					   ASH
			   Nasty little thing's inside me.
	   He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain.
			   Well let's see how you like a
			   little hot water!
	   He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding
	   contents painfully down his throat.  He sets down the kettle
	   and waits for a moment.  A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomach
	   ASH
	   emits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his chest.  Then his
	   arm.  He rips back his shirt sleeve.
318	CLOSE ON ASH'S ARM - STOP MOTION ANIMATION				  318
	   We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6's body squirming down
	   Ash's arm, just beneath the skin.
319	ASH												 319
	   watches in horror as...
320	THE TINY FIGURE									    320
	   squirms down his wrist and disappears into his iron hand.  The
	   Iron hand snaps open and closes uncontrollably. The possessed
	   iron hand swings at him.
321	THE IRON HAND										 321
	   connects with an uppercut that knocks Ash out of frame.
322	ASH												 322
	   lands next to an iron vice. He reaches for the EVIL HAND.  But
	   the hand has grabbed a mallet that BONK-BONKS him on the head.
	   Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into
	   the opened vice.
323	THE EVIL IRON HAND									 323
	   cranks the vice's handle.
324	THE VICE											 324
	   tightens around Ash's head.  Trapped, he looks to...
325	THE EVIL HAND										 325
	   rummaging through a wooden toolbox.  It comes upon a crude wooden
	   punch.
326	ANGLE - THE EVIL HAND - UNDERCRANKED					   326
	   stabs rapidly at Ash's good hand.  But Ash expertly dodges each
	   stab with an opening of the fingers or a closing of the thumb
	   is super fast motion.
327	ASH												 327
	   with is head still wedged in the vice.
					   ASH
			   Why you dirty little...AHHHHHH!!
328	A PAIR OF IRON PLIERS								   328
	   has entered frame and clamps down upon Ash's nose.  He emits
	   a nasal SCREAM and shakes the pliers loose.
					   ASH
			   Soon as I get out of this thing
			   I... YIEEEE!!
	   THE PAIR OF IRON PLIERS
	   dip into Ash's mouth and clamps down upon a back molar.
					   ASH
			   No!  Not the teeth!
	   YANK!
329	THE EVIL HAND										 329
	   jerks his rear MOLAR from his head and holds up the tooth for
	   his inspection.  It sets the tooth down nearly in front of him.
	   The Evil hand forms a fist and crushes the tooth to dust.  It
	   scurries from view.
330	ASH'S HEAD										    330
	   struggling in the grip of the vice.
					   ASH
			   Where the hell are ya!?
331	THE EVIL HAND										 331
	   grabs a red hot fireplace poker from the fire.
					   ASH
			   I can't see ya!!
	   HIS EVIL HAND
	   raises a red hot fireplace poker and presses it against the
	   right half of his body.
					   ASH
			   No, no--not the poke--
	   SSSSsssssssss!
332	ASH												 332
	   jerks his head free from the vice with a SCREAM.  He holds up
	   his iron hand.  It's back to normal.  Again under his control.
					   ASH
			   Okay then.
	   But he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: His
	   shoulder itches.  He scratches it.  The Itch grows.  It itches
	   madly.  He rips back his shirt.  Upon his shoulder... THERE
	   BLINKS A THIRD EYEBALL!!!
333	THE CAMERA RACES INTO THIS HIDEOUS SIGHT				    333
	   It is the eyeball of EVIL ASH.  Beneath it, a mouth and nose
	   begin to take shape on the surface of Ash's back.
334	ASH												 334
	   SHRIEKS and SHRIEKS and races out of the mill.  The CAMERA
	   follows him in docu-horror style as he flees into the dark
	   woods.
335	EXT. WOODS - 12MM LENSE - NIGHT						   335
	   ASH
	   staggers about in a frenzy, stumbling over logs and through the

	   brambles.  He races up to the CAMERA and cries out as this
	   protrusion upon his shoulder becomes more pronounced.
					   ASH
			   Dear God, it's growing bigger!
336	THE PROTRUSION SWELLS AND GROWS LARGER.					336
	   It's taking the shape of a twin human head as it emerges from
	   his shoulder. A head that looks similar to his own, but is Evil
	   incarnate.
	   He is now a man with two heads!
337	TWO HEADED ASH										337
	   Staggers through the woods like a drunkard, the two identical
	   heads trading insults, and sharply butting against one another.
338	THE BAD ASH HEAD									   338
	   opens it's mouth and bites the nose of the Good Ash head.
339	THE GOOD ASH HEAD									  339
	   retaliates by gouging the eyes of the Bad Ash head.
340	TWO HEADED ASH										340
	   collapses against a tree.  Under the light of the full moon we
	   see a terrifying sight:
341	TWO ADDITIONAL ARMS									341
	   sprout from Ash's body!
342	A LEG											    342
	   rips out of his stomach.  Another foot POPS out from his back.
343	TWO HEADED ASH										343
	   Like a human spider he scurries about the forest floor,
	   propelled by his four arms and four legs.  Suddenly he stands
	   and SHRIEKS as the EVIL ASH begins to pull away from the first.
	   He literally splits into two.
344	SPLIT SCREEN - WIDE SHOT								344
	   When it's over, there are two ASHES.
	   GOOD ASH and...
345	BAD ASH.											 345
	   They square off beneath the moonlight.
346	HIGH SHOT AS THE TWO ASHES							   346
	   circle one another like wolves.
					   GOOD ASH
			   What... are you?  Are you me?
					   BAD ASH
			   WHAT... ARE GOO?  ARE GOO ME?!!  You
			   sound like a jerk!
					   GOOD ASH
			   Why are you doing this?!
					   BAD ASH
			   Wanna know?  'cause the answers
			   easy. It's cause I'm the bad Ash,
			   and yer...
347	EVIL ASH											 347
	   Dances a funny jig around Ash.  He SMACKS Ash across the face
	   as he sings:
					   EVIL ASH
			   ...Little goody two-
	   SMACK!
			   ...shoes, little goody two-
	   SMACK!
			   ...shoes, little good--
348	EVIL ASH											 348
	   the shotgun barrel is suddenly shoved into his frame, pointing
	   at his nose.
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The blast blows Evil Ash off his feet.
349	WIDE SHOT - EVIL ASH - STUNTMAN						   349
	   blown backwards into a double backflip.
350	EVIL ASH'S BODY									    350
	   slams against a tree, upside-down. Then slides to the ground,
	   quite dead.
351	GOOD ASH											 351
	   clutching the smoldering shotgun.
					   GOOD ASH
			   Good...Bad...I'm the Ash with the
			   gun.
352	LONG SHOT - ASH									    352
	   staring down at the body of his evil self.
					   ASH
			   I know better than to bury you
			   whole.
353	EXT. MILL WHEEL - LONG SHOT - NIGHT					    353
	   The giant blades of the Mill are illuminated with bright flashes
	   of lightning.  The wind kicks up leaves as Ash throws the body
	   of his Evil Twin onto a workbench at the base of the windmill.
	   The giant blades of the mill arc down into frame with a WHOOSH-
	   WHOOSSH-WHOOSH!
354	MONTAGE SEQUENCE:									  354
	   Ash's hand light a torch.
355	FRIGHTENED BATS FLY									355
	   from the base of the windmill.
356	CHAINS ARE PULLED TIGHT								 356
	   across the body of Evil Ash to secure it.
	   CLICK. SNAP. CLINK.
357	THE CHAINSAW										  357
	   is switched on.  It spews a plume of blue exhaust.
358	ASH												 358
	   falters for a moment as he stares down at the form of his Evil
	   twin.  He grits his teeth... and lowers the saw to the grisly
	   task.
359	EXT. NIGHT SKY - BLOOD RED CLOUDS						 359
	   float past the moon.  We hear the distant WHINE of the chainsaw.
360	EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT								  360
	   ASH
	   with shovel in hand, drags a bloody burlap bag from the Mill.
	   Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the base of
	   an old Oak Tree in the graveyard.
	   Ash mumbles nervously to the bloodies burlap bag at his feet
	   as he digs a grave.
					   ASH
			   Now you see what's what.  Man's
			   body is his own personal property.
			   Don't anybody try to take that
			   away from him.
361	ASH												 361
	   finishes digging and lifts the bloody burlap sack.  As he heaves
	   the bag into the grave, the Evil Ash head spills out.
362	INT. GRAVE - THE EVIL ASH HEAD						    362
	   It's eyes pop open!  It peers up at Ash from the grave.  It
	   croaks;
					   EVIL ASH HEAD
			   You'll never get that Book. I will
			   come back for you.
					   ASH
			   Hey, what's that you got on your
			   face?
					   EVIL ASH HEAD
			   Huh?
363	CLOSE SHOT - THE EVIL DEAD							   363
	   It's eyes dart, looking for something on it's face when a
	   shovelful of dirt is heaped atop it.
364	EVIL ASH HEAD - P.O.V. - EYEMO						    364
	   as a shovelful of dirt is heaped atop the CAMERA.
365	ASH												 365
	   buries it deep.  He raises a crude burial marker high above his
	   head;
					   ASH
				   (muttering under his
				    breath)
			   Rest in pieces.
366	ASH												 366
	   backlit by the moon, brings the burial maker swiftly into the
	   grave. A flash of lightning reveals...
367	THE GRAVEYARD										 367
	   in the distance. A burial place of evil. The old mill wheel
	   GROANS in the gale.
					   ASH
			   This must be it. The cemetery.
368	ASH												 368
	   moves toward the cemetery.
369	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE CEMETERY							  369
	   In the center, lies a massive slab of black stone.
370	ASH												 370
	   draws closer, his teeth chattering as the wind blasts at him.
	   He glances down to...
371	ASH'S P.O.V. - TRACKING SHOT - SKULL					   371
	   sitting atop the ground, leering up at CAMERA with empty eye
	   sockets. The wind whistles through the empty skull.  The jaw
	   bone drops open with a squeak.
372	CLOSE ON ASH										  372
	   His hair is whipped up by the wind. He looks to...
373	THE MASSIVE BLACK STONE IN THE CEMETERY'S CENTER			 373
	   backlit by the rising moon, creates eerie beams of light and
	   shadow.
374	ASH												 374
	   arrives at the foot of the massive stone.
375	UNDERCRANKED - THE STONE								375
	   Atop it sits... THE BOOK OF THE DEAD.
376	CAMERA PANS REVEALING...								376
	   A SECOND BOOK OF THE DEAD!
377	CAMERA PANS AGAIN REVEALING...						    377
	   A THIRD!
378	CAMERA RACES BACK AT SUPER SPEED TO REVEAL:				 378
	   THREE BOOK OF THE DEAD!!!
379	A BAFFLED ASH										 379
	   steps close.
					   ASH
			   Wait.  Three books?  Nobody said
			   anything about that. Ha!  That
			   Wiseman was so busy fillin' me
			   fulla his secret words and phrases
			   and, and, his... bullshit, he
			   forgot to mention anything about
			   that.  Like do I take all of 'em
			   of one or 'em, or what?  Well...
	   He reaches for the first book and opens it.
380	ANGLE ON											 380
	   WHOOOOOOSH!!!
	   To reveal a black hole.  SCREAMS ERUPT from the dark abyss of
	   the Book. It begins to suck things into it.
381	CLOSE ON BOOK OF THE DEAD - BACKWARDS MOTION				381
	   dead leaves and mist are sucked into the book.
382	ASH - MAKE-UP APPLIANCE								 382
	   Wind hits Ash's face as he feels the suction of the book growing
	   stronger.
383	ASH'S HAND - PUPPET									383
	   is stretched as it's pulled down into the book.
384	LONG SHOT - ASH PUPPET								  384
	   Ash's arms stretch down into the book's black page.
385	ASH'S PUPPET HEAD									  385
	   stretched and screaming, is also pulled on by the book.
386	ASH PUPPET										    386
	   A taffy stretched version of Ash struggles against the pull of
	   the black hole. He pulls free and snaps the book shut.
387	INTERVOLOMETER SHOT - ASH							    387
	   His face vibrates like jello until it finally snaps back to
	   normal.
					  ASH
			   Woah.  Wrong book.
	   He turns to study...
388	THE TWO REMAINING BOOKS								 388
	   ASH
	   tries to decide between them.  At first he's sure which one it
	   is.  Then, chiding himself for being so easily duped, chooses
	   the other.
389	THE BOOK											 389
	   moves ever so slightly as he reaches for it.
					   ASH
			   Huh.
	   Ash reaches for it again and the book bites him!
390	THE BOOK OF THE DEAD - PUPPET							390
	   Rodent teeth have appeared on the surface of the Book.  The Book
	   flaps it's pages and becomes airborne, flying right at CAMERA
	   like a bat!
391	BATBOOK P.O.V. - CAMERA RIG - UNDERCRANKED				  391
	   Swooping erratically around Ash's head.
392	THE BATBOOK										   392
	   shrieking, chases Ash around, pecking at his neck.
					   ASH
			   Dear God, help me... ahhh!!!
	   The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!
393	ASH												 393
	   pulls it from his face and throws it. It lands back on it's
	   pedestal.
394	ASH												 394
	   faces the remaining book.  He slowly reaches for it as the wind
	   kicks up. Ash gently lifts it and turns it over.
395	CLOSE ON BOOK										 395
	   It's cover is bound in the dried skin of a man's face!  Two empty
	   eye sockets stare out from it.  This is the Book of the Dead...
396	ASH												 396
	   bristles in fear.
					   ASH
			   Okay.   The words.  Say the words.
			   KLATOO!... VERATA...  uh...  Uh...
			   Necta... uh... Nectar...
			   Necktie... uh...
	   He hesitates, then calls out boldly.
					   ASH
			   KLATOO... VERATA...
			   NECTtphhhhhhhhhh...
	   He deliberately muffles the last word that he can't remember.
	   The wind stops.  It seems to have worked.  He looks about with
	   growing confidence.
					   ASH
			   Okay then.
	   But he loses his smile as... a LOW RUMBLE is heard on the
	   soundtrack.
397	LONG SHOT - CEMETARY								    397
	   ASH
	   A tiny figure among the gravestones which tremble and one by
	   one are thrust from the earth.
					   ASH
			   Hey, wait a minute. Everything's

	   A violent storm in the distance.  Lightning flashes.
399	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							399
	   A DOOR
	   blows open revealing Wiseman John.  He looks at the gathering
	   storm with foreboding.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Something is amiss.
400	HORSES IN THE CASTLE GROUNDS							 400
	   WHINNIE in hear. Sheila steps into frame and stare fearfully
	   out at the storm.
401	EXT. CEMETARY - NIGHT								   401
	   ASH runs for his horse, clutching the Necronomicon.
402	A BONEY HAND										  402
	   rips up from a grave and grabs his leg!
403	ASH												 403
	   falls.
404	THE BOOK OF THE DEAD								    404
	   is knocked from Ash's hand.
405	ASH												 405
	   reaches for it when a SECOND skeleton hand rips from the ground
	   and clutches his face.
406	THE FIRST SKELETON HAND								 406
	   digs into Ash's mouth.  It jerks his face sideways to show
	   him...
407	A GROUP OF SIX ROTTED ARMS							   407
	   that rip from the ground!
408	THE SKELETAL HANDS									 408
	   toss Ash to...
409	THE ROTTED ARMS									    409
	   grab Ash's head and bang it on a rock.  Two of the six arms try
	   to shake and slap some sense into him. A rotted fist is waved
	   at him.  Another rotted arm backhands him. The arms thrust his
	   face toward the skeleton hands.
410	THE SKELETON HANDS									 410
	   curl boney fingers, clenching them into fists.
					   ASH
			   No.. no more...
	   The skeletal fists pepper Ash's face with punches.
					   ASH
			   Leave me alone!  Leave me aHUUU!
411	THE SKELETAL FINGERS								    411
	   last out and snag Ash's tongue between their boney pincers,
	   shutting Ash up.  With his tongue held, he tries to speak again,
	   but the other skeletal hand slaps him, shutting him up.  Both
	   hands work double-time at slapping him.
412	UNDERCRANKED - ASH									  412
	   His face has become a punching bag for the skeletal hands.  They
	   pull his ears and gouge his eyes.
413	ASH												 413
	   open his mouth wide with in a SCREAM!
414	SIDE SHOT - COLLAPSIBLE SKELETON ARM					   414
	   The boney fist is thrust into Ash's screaming mouth up to the
	   skeleton's boney elbow.
415	EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S EYES						   415
	   They bulge as he swallow the arm.
416	STOP MOTION ANIMATION								   416
	   A ROTTED ARM
	   rips through the ground, punching Ash in the stomach.
417	SIDE SHOT - COLLAPSIBLE SKELETAL ARM					   417
	   ASH
	   jerks backward, vomiting out the skeletal arm.  He tumbles to
	   the ground.
418	THE ARMS											 418
	   reach for him, but he is too fast.  He stamps on one of the
	   skeletal arms, pinning it to the ground.
					   ASH
				   (in a snarl)
			   Keep you damn filthy bones outta
			   my mouth.
	   SNAP!  He breaks the boney arm in two and runs away from the sea
	   of limbs. A bone arm rips from the grave and reaches for the
	   Book of the Dead but Ash scoops it up first.  He leaps over
	   another set of groping arms that rip from the ground!
419	ASH CLIMBS										    419
	   atop the horse. He glances back in fear to see...
420	EXT. CEMETARY - OLD OAK TREE							 420
	   The burial site of Evil Ash. A bolt of lightning strikes the
	   grave marker.
421	EVIL ASH'S BURIAL MARKER								421
	   is thrust from the ground. A hand breaks the surface of the
	   earth.
422	EVIL ASH'S BODY PARTS								   422
	   fly up from the grave and assemble themselves into a lopsided,
	   decayed version of EVIL ASH!
423	EXT. MILL - NIGHT									  423
	   ASH
	   stares in horror at his evil self. All around, skeletons rip
	   from the earth and shriek as they come back to life!
424	A FEARFUL ASH										 424
	   kicks the horse and rides off.
425	EXT. MILL - LONG SHOT - NIGHT							425
	   ASH ON HORSEBACK
	   galloping back the way he came. In the distance we see the
	   cemetery. More bodies arise from the ground.
426	EXT. WOODS - ASH - NIGHT								426
	   Now far from the danger but still he rides hard.
					   ASH
			   I'm through bein' their garbage
			   boy.  I did my part of the
			   bargain.
	   He pats the saddlebag, where the book is and grins.
			   Now they owe me.  Like in the
			   deal.  I want back.
	   He whips his horse...
			   HA!  GIIDDUP NOW!!
	   ...and rides off into the darkness.

431	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							431
	   TWO WARRIORS

					   VILLAGERS
			   The stranger has returned!  He's

432	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							432
	   ASH
	   is led to the THREE WISEMEN.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   The Necronomicon.  Quickly.
433	ASH												 433
	   pours a bucket of water over his head and begins drinking.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Did you bring the Necronomicon!
434	ASH												 434
	   slurps down more of the water, averting his eyes from the
	   Wiseman.
					   ASH
			   Yes. It's just that...
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Just what?!
					   ASH
			   Nothing. Here
	   Ash produces the Necronomicon.
			   Now send be back. Like in the
			   deal.
435	WISEMAN JOHN										  435
	   takes the book and suddenly goes pale.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   No...I sensed something had gone
			   awry. The book's power. It's gone.
436	THE CROWD											436
	   murmurs at this bad news.
437	ASH												 437
	   suddenly looks very guilty. Wiseman John turns to him.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   When you removed the Necronomicon
			   from it's cradle, did you speak
			   the words?
					   ASH
			   Yeah.  basically.

					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Did you speak the exact words?!
					   ASH
			   Well, maybe not every single
			   syllable, no.  But basically I
			   said them.  Yes.
438	WISEMAN JOHN										  439
	   bows his head, stung by this information.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Dung eating fool!  Thou hast doomed
			   us. When thou misspoke the words
			   the Army of the Dead was awoke.
					   ASH
			   Hey. We had a deal. You told me,
			   you could clean this thing up,
			   once I got you the book. You said
			   there was a passage in there that
			   could get rid of this thing and
			   send me back.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   The passage is useless to us as
			   long as these evil dead walk. They
			   have a terrible desire for this
			   book. And they shall come here
			   to get it. Once in their
			   possession, the Evil shall rule
			   the Earth for one thousand
			   years...Because of you...we are
			   doomed.
					   ASH
			   You wanted the damn book. You got
			   yer book. I did my part of the
			   deal.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   We did strike a bargain. I will
			   return you to your own time as
			   promised.
					   ASH
			   Yeah. Well good. That was the
			   deal.  So uh...when do you think
			   we can...
439	ASH												 439
	   looks about at the condemned faces.
440	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE VILLAGERS							 440
	   CAMERA PANS past the doomed faces in the crowd.
					   ASH
			   I mean...when can you send me...
441	ASH												 441
	   sees Sheila, but looks away, consumed with the guilt that he's
	   doomed her.
					   ARTHUR
			   The Wisemen were fools to believe
			   that you were the Promised one.
			   That one such as you could have
			   saved us!.
442	ASH												 442
	   is solemn.
443	ARTHUR											   443
	   and the others turn away in contempt.
444	SHEILA											   444
	   moves closer.
					   SHEILA
			   I still believe that thou wilt
			   help us.
					   ASH
			   No.. They're right.  I screwed
			   up. I didn't come through for you,
			   and...  I'm sorry for it.
					   SHEILA
			   I still have faith in thee. In
			   my heart I know thou wilt still
			   succeed.
					   ASH
			   Sheila... It's over for me. I
			   don't belong here and I'm going
			   home. I didn't have what it took.
			   It's over.
	   He bows his head and moves off.
	   A high pitched SHRIEK is heard!
445	ALL HEADS											445
	   look to the sky.
446	TWO WINGED DEADITES									446
	   possessed women with bat-like wings, swoop down.
447	TEN VILLAGERS										 447
	   scream as they flee from the winged beasts.
448	WINGED DEADITE #1									  448
	   Like a delta winged F-15, it banks towards Sheila.
					   ASH
			   No!
449	ASH												 449
	   races to intercept.  He plants himself between Sheila and the
	   beast.
450	WINGED DEADITE #1 - POV								 450

451	ASH												 451
	   opens his steel hand, then clamps it closed again on the handle

452	ASKEW ANGLE										   452
	   The immense shadow of the broad winged Deadite falls over Ash.
453	ASH												 453

454	CLOSE SHOT - THE BLADE								  454
	   severs the tip of the Beast's rotted wing.
455	THE FLYING DEADITE									 455
	   shrieks in pain as it soars over Ash. No longer aerodynamically
	   sound, it crashes to the ground.
456	A GROUP OF WARRIORS									456
	   fire their arrows into the beast, pegging it to a tree.  The
	   bone white eyes of the creature darken.
457	ASH AND ARTHUR										457
	   spin to the sound of a woman's SCREAM.
458	SHEILA											   458
	   in the clutches of WINGED DEADITE #2.
					   SHEILA
			   M'Lord Ash!  Help me!
	   The beast flies off with the fair maiden, soaring over the
	   castle wall and into the distance.
459	ASH												 459
	   shakes his fist at the receding beast.
					   ASH
			   Damn you!
460	THREE MOUNTED SCOUTS								    460
	   come riding in through the castle doors.
					   SCOUT
			   An army of the dead!  They have
			   gathered in the wilderness and
			   come this way.
					   ARTHUR
			   How far from here?
					   SCOUT
			   But two days ride.
					   ARTHUR
			   Then these winged ones are only
			   the first of them.
					   WISEMAN
			   Perhaps we should go from this
			   place while we can.
					   GOLD TOOTH
			   We could be safe in the mountains.
					   WARRIORS
			   Yes!  To the mountains!  We must flee!
			   They'll take our souls!
461	ANGLE ON											 461

	   shotgun.
					   ASH
			   Go ahead and run.  Run home and
			   cry to mama.  I'm through runnin'.
			   I stay we stay and fight.
463	ARTHUR											   463
	   takes a challenging step forward.
					   ARTHUR
			   How will we stop an army of the
			   dead at out castle walls?  How will
			   you fight that?!  With more words?
			   Most of out people have already
			   fled.  We are but forty men.
					   ASH
			   We'll get Henry the Red and his
			   men to fight with us.
					   ARTHUR
			   We shall not stand in battle,
			   alongside the likes of him. Our
			   honor will not allow it.
					   ASH
			   Then you'll die.  Honor and all.
			   Now who's with me?
464	THE CROWD											464
	   is silent as they consider Ash's words. Then from the rear, the
	   Village Blacksmith steps forward.
					   BLACKSMITH
			   I'll stand by you.
465	A WARRIOR											465
	   steps forward. Then another.
					   WARRIOR #7
			   You may count on my steel.
					   WARRIOR #8
			   And mine!
466	THE CROWD											466
	   steps forward vowing their allegiance to the cause.

471	CLOSE ON SHEILA									    471
	   looking up to Evil Ash in fear. His boney finger comes down into
	   frame and strokes her lovely cheek.  She pulls away in
	   revulsion.
472	EVIL ASH											 472
	   looks down at her with lust.
					   EVIL ASH
			   Why ain't you a sweet little
			   thing?
	   His boney digit caresses her lips.
					   SHEILA
			   Don't touch me!  You foul thing!
					   EVIL ASH
			   Your gonna learn to live me missy.
					   SHEILA
			   The Promised one will come for
			   you.
	   SKELETAL EVIL ASH

	   yanks her to her feet.
					   EVIL ASH
			   Darlin' I'm gonna save him the
			   trouble.
	   He clutches her squirming body in a boney embrace.
473	EXT. GRAVEYARD - LONG SHOT							   473

			   Slay him!
	   The draw their swords when...
476	HENRY THE RED										 476
	   rides up between his warriors and Ash.
					   HENRY
			   Stay your arms!
	   Henry turns to Ash.
					   HENRY
			   T'is the stranger who spared me
			   from the pit. What brings you?
					   ASH
			   The Army of the Dead.
					   HENRY
			   What of them?
					   ASH
			   They're headed towards Arthur's
			   castle. We need your help. Fight
			   with us.
					   HENRY
			   So you are a vassal of Arthur now?
			   You have taken up sides with him
			   against me.
					   ASH
			   The only side I'm takin' is the
			   one that's gonna stop those
			   things.
	   Henry laughs.
					   HENRY
			   Why should I endanger my people
			   to save my enemy?
					   ASH
			   Because after they finish with
			   Arthur they'll come after you.
			   Together, we've got a chance.
			   Besides, you owe me.

478	EVIL ASH											 478

			   Where are they keeping my book?
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
			   Most likely...there, in the

			   Excellent. Proceed.

			   Fire!
					   ARTHUR
			   Fire!
521	TWELVE ARCHERS										521
	   fire a volley of smoking arrows.
522	SMOKING AND SPUTTERING ARROWS							522
	   rain down from the castle wall.
523	TWO WOODEN BARRICADES								   523
	   are hit with the explosive arrows. They explode.
524	THREE DEADITES										524
	   are pierced by the explosive arrows.  BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  They burst
	   apart in flames.
525	FLAMING DEADITES									   525
	   roll on the ground unable to extinguish themselves.
526	A BURNING SKELETON									 526
	   continues to advance only to collapse into a smoldering heap.
527	THE WARRIORS										  527
	   CHEER Ash in sensurround.
528	A SCOUT											  528
	   races up to Ash.
					   SCOUT
			   M'Lord!  A second division
			   approaching from the South.
529	ASH												 529
	   turns to the South.
530	A SECOND WAVE A DEADITES								530
	   approach.
					   ASH
			   CATAPULTS...SOUTH!
531	INT. COURTYARD										531
	   THREE WOODEN CATAPULTS
	   are wheeled into position.
					   ARTHUR
			   Powder!
532	GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER WARRIORS							532
	   hoist large sacks of black powder onto spoons of the catapults.
	   Their fuses are lit.
533	ASH												 533
	   gestures. Swords slice through lines which send giant sacks of
	   black powder catapulting.
534	LONG SHOT - CASTLE									 534
	   Three flaming projectiles whine as they hurl over the castle
	   walls.
535	THREE FALLING SATCHELS P.O.V.'S						   535
	   CAMERA CRANING DOWN toward the skeletons as they look upward
	   in horror.
	   BOOM!  The first blast takes out a skeleton horse and rider. Bones
	   fly.
	   BOOM!  FOUR DEADITES are obliterated.
536	EVIL ASH											 536
	   turns to the Skeleton Captain #1 who rides alongside him.
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
			   Permission to regroup, m'Lord.
					   EVIL ASH
			   You needn't bother.
537	EVIL ASH											 537
	   slices off the head of Skeleton Captain #1. He turns to the
	   MOUNTED DEADITE next to him.
					   EVIL ASH
			   You are now my captain. I will
			   now allow anything to stop me from
			   possessing the Necronomicon. Get
			   me into that castle.
538	THE NEW DEADITE CAPTAIN								 538
	   gulps and races forward into the ranks shouting:
					   NEW DEADITE CAPTAIN
			   RAM THE GATES!
539	TWO GROUPS OF FOUR SKELETONS							 539
	   use trees as battering rams and batter the large wooden doors
	   of the castle.
	   BOOM!-BOOM!
540	INT. CASTLE - THE CASTLE DOORS						    540
	   begin to buckle beneath the hammering blows.
541	TWO VILLAGE WOMEN									  541
	   scream!
542	TEN WARRIORS										  542
	   wedge logs to buttress the buckling castle doors.
543	EXT. CASTLE										   543
					   EVIL ASH
			   Arrows!
544	A ROW OF SIX SKELETAL ARCHERS							544
	   fire a volley of arrows. As they reload. Behind them...
545	A SECOND LINE OF SIX SKELETAL ARCHERS					  545
	   fire their arrows.
546	A VOLLEY OF DEADITES' ARROWS							 546
	   pierce five Warriors atop the castle wall. They fall.
547	INT. CASTLE										   547
	   TWO DEAD WARRIORS
	   fall to the courtyard. Villagers lift them away on stretchers.
548	ARTHUR											   548
	   shouts to Ash:
					   ARTHUR
			   Where is Henry?!
					   ASH
			   He'll be here.
					   ARTHUR
			   I think he will not. But know
			   this.  No matter how this battle
			   fares, I was wrong to think you
			   a coward.
549	EXT. CASTLE										   549
	   The battering rams rips through the doors and the army of
	   darkness pours into the courtyard.
550	A LEGLESS SKELETON									 550
	   crawls in with a knife in its teeth.
					   ARTHUR
			   They're coming in. What now?!
551	ASH												 551
	   looks terrified. He turns and runs from the castle entrance,
	   dropping his sword, and hides in the blacksmith's shop, pulling
	   the door closed behind him.
552	ARTHUR											   552
	   shocked at Ash's cowardly desertion, turns to his men and
	   shouts:
					   ARTHUR
			   Fall back!  Man the Parapet!  Protect
			   the book or God save us all!
553	THE WARRIORS										  553
	   retreat across the courtyard to rope ladders that scale the
	   parapet.
554	ARTHUR'S MEN CLIMB ATOP THE PARAPET					    554
	   The rope ladders are hastily pulled up, leaving no access.
555	INT. COURTYARD - SIX OF ARTHUR'S WARRIORS				   555
	   are stranded in the courtyard. They fight for their lives but
	   are quickly overcome.
556	EVIL SHEILA										   556
	   takes out the last of the stranded warriors with her sword.
557	EVIL ASH											 557
	   smiles at Sheila. He turns his attention to the guarded tower
	   just beyond the parapet.
					   EVIL ASH
			   The book shall be mine!
	   He raises his rusty sword.
			   LADDERS!
558	TWELVE EVIL DEAD									   558
	   storm the parapet with three crudely built wooden ladders as
	   large rocks rain down upon them from above.
559	TWO WARRIORS										  559
	   push away ladder #1.
560	FOUR SKELETONS ON LADDER #1							  560
	   swing away from the wall and crash to the ground.
561	TWO SKELETONS ON LADDER #2							   561
	   leap onto the parapet and battle the men with swords.
562	WARRIOR #2										    562
	   knocks the deadite off the ledge and shouts back toward Arthur.
					   WARRIOR #2
			   We can't hold this wall much
			   longer!
563	A DEADITE ARROW									    563
	   pierces his armor and he falls to his death.
564	INT. COURTYARD										564
	   A VIKING DEADITE
	   looks up as he hears...
	   CHUG!  CHUG!  CHUG!
565	DEADITE'S P.O.V.									   565
	   THE DOORS OF THE BLACKSMITH'S SHOP BURST OPEN
	   Through the dust and smoke something appears...An iron
	   beast...belching steam...It's angry iron blades whirling.
	   Behold...
566	THE DEATHCOASTER									   566
	   The stripped chaise of the Delta  88 Oldsmobile. A steam engine
	   is mounted to it's center to power the craft. At the front and
	   rear are spinning, helicopter like rotor blades.
567	GOLD TOOTH										    567
	   shovels coal into the Deathcoaster's furnace.
568	ASH												 568
	   is at the helm. He pulls a cord.
569	THE DEATHCOASTER'S STEAM WHISTLE						  569
	   SCREAMS to announce its birth.
570	THE VIKING DEADITE									 570
	   is cut to ribbons by swirling blades.
571	THE VILLAGERS ATOP THE PARAPET						    571
	   cheer!
572	EVIL DEAD											572
	   at the base of the ladders look up in horror to see...
573	THE STEAM DRIVEN ROTOR BLADES							573
	   slicing through two Deadites at once. The cow-catcher in front
	   pushes aside the halved Evil Dead.
574	ASH												 574
	   operates a crude instrument panel with only two levers to steer
	   the craft. It's a bumpy ride.
575	WIDE SHOT - THE DEATHCOASTER							 575
	   Thwop!  Thwop!  Two more skeletons bite the dust.
	   leathery hands pluck a SCREAMING Gold Tooth from the craft.
576	GOLD TOOTH										    576
	   disappears beneath the squirming corpses. A moment later he re-
	   emerges as a skeleton himself, except for the single gold tooth
	   that shines against the white of the bone. He stands and joins
	   the Deadites.
577	EVIL SHEILA										   577
	   leaps onto the moving Deathcoaster to face Ash.
					   EVIL SHEILA
			   Thou didst find me beautiful once.
					   ASH
			   Honey...You got real ugly.
578	EVIL SHEILA										   578
	   attacks with a SHRIEK!
579	ASH												 579
	   spins out his double barreled shot gun and...
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   ...blows her off the craft. She does a back flip into the other
	   Deadites.
580	ASH												 580
	   pulls hard on the steering stick and it tears loose from the
	   craft.
581	THE DEATHCOASTER									   581
	   careens out of control.
582	ASH												 582
	   tumbles from the helm and hits the ground.
583	THE DEATHCOASTER									   583
	   flips, crushes a group of Deadites against a wall, and explodes.
584	ASH												 584
	   picks himself up from the dust. He looks upward to...
585	LADDER #2 - ARTHUR									 585
	   attempts to push the ladder away. A sword comes up into frame,
	   stabbing Arthur. He is yanked to his death with a shriek!  Evil
	   Ash, with his bloody sword, leaps up from the ladder and onto
	   the parapet. He's headed for the Book of the Dead.
586	BELOW IN THE COURTYARD - ASH							 586
	   races to a set of ropes and pulley that ascend the parapet. Two
	   deadites come at him. He grabs the rope with his steel hand and
	   slices one end of it with his sword.
587	ABOVE HIM - A NET OF BOULDERS							587
	   plummet down atop the two deadites, crushing them.
	   Simultaneously, Ash is tanked upward by the rope, to the
	   parapet.
588	ASH												 588
	   looks to...
589	EVIL ASH											 589
	   approaching the Necronomicon.
590	ASH												 590
	   kicks aside a hay bale and removes a mini-crossbow with four
	   flame tipped arrows, loaded and ready. He fires.
591	A FLAME ARROW										 591
	   imbeds in Evil Ash's leg and ignites his body. Another flaming
	   dart hits his shoulder blade. The flames consume his body. He
	   burns and SHRIEKS!
592	ASH												 592
	   watches in horror as...
593	THE FLAMES RECEED									  593
	   revealing a bone white skeleton with mismatched eyes. SKELETAL
	   EVIL ASH!  It races at Ash with a SHRIEK.
594	ASH AND EVIL ASH									   594
	   bring their swords together with such great force that sparks
	   fly.  Ash is forced back against the stone pedestal that holds
	   the Necronomicon.
	   CLANG!
	   With a deft stroke, Ash's sword is flung from his hand.
595	ASH'S SWORD										   595
	   imbeds in a wooden beam.
596	EVIL ASH											 596
	   grabs the Necronomicon, then swings his sword at Ash.
597	ASH												 597
	   grabs a burning iron torch from its mount.
598	ANGLE ON											 598
	   WHOOSH!  KLANG!  WHOOSH!  KLANG!
	   Man and Skeleton battle with flaming torch and sword.
599	ANGLE ON											 599
	   KLANG!
	   The torch is knocked from Ash's hand. It falls over the edge
	   of the wall and lands in the courtyard below. It ignites a fuse.
	   The burning fuse leads to a sack of black powder. The sack sits
	   upon the spoon of a catapult.
600	ABOVE...											 600
	   SKELETON ASH
	   swings his sword. Ash leaps over the blade. The Skeleton swings
	   downward, and Ash side steps it.
601	ASH												 601
	   rabbit punches CAMERA.
602	CLOSE ON SKELETON HEAD								  602
	   Ash's fist bursts out all it's rotted teeth.
603	ASH												 603
	   delivers a right hook, spinning the skeleton's head around in
	   a circle.
604	THE SKELETON										  604
	   gives Ash a backwards roundhouse kick to the face. Ash tumbles
	   over the edge.
605	ASH												 605
	   falls to the courtyard below, alongside the catapult. He glances
	   at the burning fuse.
606	EVIL ASH											 606
	   leaps from the parapet and lands atop the catapult. The Skeleton
	   looks down at Ash with a nasty grin of bone.
607	SKELETON ASH										  607
	   Behold...
	   He gestures to the Evil Dead that overrun the parapet and now
	   battle the last twenty of Arthur's warriors for control of the
	   Keep.
608	ANGLE ON SKELETON ASH								   608
					   SKELETON ASH
			   You're finished.
	   He extends the Necronomicon to taunt Ash.
					   SKELETON ASH
			   I possess the Necronomicon. I've
			   crushed your pathetic army. Now
			   I'll have my vengeance!
	   He raises his sword for the death blow...
609	THE SHRILL CALL OF BATTLE TRUMPETS						609
					   GUARD (O.S.)
			   Duke Henry's men!  They've come!
610	ASH AND THE SKELETON								    610
	   turn...
	   A jubilant CHEER rises from the castle as...
611	DUKE HENRY THE RED AND FIFTY OF HIS MEN					611
	   thunder down the hill, across the drawbridge and into the castle
	   courtyard to attack the Deadites!
612	THE SKELETON - ATOP THE CATAPULT						  612
	   turns back to Ash and raises his sword for the kill.
613	ASH												 613
	   has grabbed a sword from a fallen warrior. With a single motion
	   he slices the hand that holds the Necronomicon from Skeleton
	   Ash.
614	ASH												 614
	   snags the book with one hand and on the backswing, slices
	   through the rope, springing the catapult.
615	THE SKELETON AND BURNING SATCHEL						  615
	   are flung over the castle wall.
616	HIGH SHOT - LOOKING DOWN AT CASTLE						616
	   THE SKELETON PROJECTILE
	   rockets up past camera, waving its boney arms. The burning
	   satchel follows.
	   BOOM!  The skeleton is blown to bits in mid air.
	   A CHEER goes up within the castle courtyard as Henry's Warriors
	   crush the last of the Deadites.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
617	GLORIOUS BEAMS OF MORNING SUNLIGHT						617
	   streak over the horizon. Ash enters frame. He holds the
	   Necronomicon as he looks wearily out over the battlefield.
618	LONG SHOT - THE BATTLEFIELD - MORNING					  618
	   Smoking skeletons lay scattered. Henry and Arthur's Warriors
	   work together. They toss the deadite bones and armor into a
	   bonfire.
619	CLOSE SHOT - TWO DEADITE SKULLS						   619
	   engulfed by flames, crack in the heat.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
620	EXT. SEASHORE - ARROWHEADS - DUSK						 620
	   are dipped into the flame of a bonfire.  They ignite.
621	THE INTEGRATED ARMY OF HENRY AND ARTHUR'S MEN			    621
	   Form a row of archers.
	   They fire their flaming arrows toward the sea.
622	THE ARROWS										    622
	   strike a wooden ship that holds the body of Arthur.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   We said goodbye to Arthur.  Sure
			   we had our problems.  But in the
			   end, he was all right.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
623	EXT. SEASHORE - DUSK								    623
	   ASH AND THE OTHERS
	   watch the funeral pyre sail off.  It's flickering flames play
	   upon their faces.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
624	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							624
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   Peace was made between the two
			   peoples.  And a new nation was
			   formed.  They offered my a chance
			   to stay among them and teach them.
			   A chance to lead them.  To be
			   King.  But Sheila was gone.
			   Besides, I had places to go.
	   FLAMES OF THE FIRE - CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL...
625	THE WISEMEN										   625
	   mix a vat of liquid over a fire as they recite a passage from

	   the Necronomicon.  A flask is dipped into the liquid.
	   WISEMAN JOHN
	   hands the flask of liquid to Ash.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   The Book tells us that each drop
			   allows a man to sleep a century.
			   Swallow six drops, and thou shalt
			   awaken in thine own time.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   Yeah.  Right...
	   Ash takes the flask and studies it.
			   ...but what other choice did I
			   have?
									   DISSOLVE TO:
626	EXT. CASTLE - LONG SHOT - DAY							626
	   ASH
	   rides off.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I had to find a place to crash.
			   For a very long time.
627	EXT. CAVE - DAY									    627
	   ASH
	   with the aid of his horse, drags the Deathcoaster inside the
	   cave.
	   He sets the horse free.
					   ASH
			   YAHH!!
	   It gallops off.
628	INT. CAVE - DAY									    628
	   ASH
	   Places a black powder charge at the mouth of the cave.  He
	   ignites the fuse and climbs into the car.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I locked the door.
629	INT. MOUTH OF THE CAVE								  629
	   BOOM!
	   The powder charge blows.  The cave's entrance is sealed shut
	   with an avalanche of rock.
630	INT. CAVE - DEATHCOASTER								630
	   The car headlights come on, piercing the blackness.
631	INT. DEATHCOASTER									  631
	   ASH
	   uncorks the flask filled with the Wiseman's brew.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I closed my eyes.
	   He lets six drops fall into his mouth.  One for each century
	   he must sleep.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I took a drink.
	   Ash is unaware that an extra drop has fallen into his mouth!  A
	   7th drop!  Ash swallows the liquid.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I didn't know if it was day or
			   night. I started... to get
			   drowsy... And I slept...
632	ASH												 632
	   falls into a deep slumber.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
633	THE DEATHCOASTER'S HEADLIGHTS							633
	   fade.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
634	CLOSER ON ASH'S SLEEPING FACE							634
	   now in a different position. Time has passed. He needs a shave.
					   ASH
			   ...And dreamed.
635	THE HANDS ON ASH'S WRISTWATCH							635
	   wind faster and faster, then halt and rust in time lapse
	   photography. The leather band rots away and the watch falls from
	   Ash's wrist.
636	THE SUN											  636
	   rises then sets.
637	THE MOON											 637
	   follows.
638	A CRACK											  638
	   forms along the surface of the aging rock wall.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   Dreams last lasted centuries.

639	A BARREN TREE										 639
	   sprouts buds, they swell forming leaves which change to the
	   brilliant colors of fall then drop.
640	A FROST											  640
	   covers Ash.
641	ICICLES											  641
	   on the ceiling of the cave melt.  The water drops down onto
	   Ash's face.  He stirs.
642	ASH												 642
	   awakens in a heap of rusted scrap, which was once the
	   Deathcoaster. His clothes and armor having deteriorated, he is
	   buck ass naked as he staggers to the mouth of the cave. He digs
	   at the rocks that block the cave's entrance.  Sunlight streams
	   into the hole he has created.
643	EXT. HILLSIDE										 643
	   ASH
	   climbs from the cave and steps into the sunlight.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   And when I awoke...
644	ASH												 644
	   beholds...
645	A FUTURISTIC CITY -									645
	   after the next Nuclear war: a dead land.
646	ASH'S P.O.V.										  646
	   A FRACTURED CLOCK TOWER
	   lays sprawled on its side.  The time of mankind's death frozen
	   on the cracked face of the clock.
647	A SHATTERED BRIDGE									 647
	   abruptly ends, a third of the way across a river it once
	   spanned.  Upon it, rest heaps of futuristic, yet rusted taxicabs
	   piled eight deep in some places.
	   CAMERA PULLS BACK from a stunned Ash, amidst the atomized pieces
	   of iron and bone.
					   ASH
			   ....I found that I had slept too
			   long.
648	ASH												 648
	   is so small a dot now, and so far away, that we almost can't
	   hear his terrified SCREAM!
									   CUT TO BLACK.
							  THE END.
