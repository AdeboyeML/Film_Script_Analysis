          A BEAUTIFUL COUPLE dance on a giant can of a Red-Bull-like
          drink-- HYPNO! The label morphs to different flavors.
                         
          EXT. A VACANT LOT -- NIGHT
                         
          Colored light from the billboard flickers over a bullet
          riddled sign: ROUTE 85. U.S. BORDER, EL PASO, TEXAS.
                         
          Beneath the sign is a LONG BLACK LIMOUSINE.
                         
          Cars whip past on the highway. Then A VAN passes, blasting
          some future version of Techno Latino Hip Hop. A SQUEAL OF
          TIRES OS. Now the music gets louder as the van returns,
          cruising slowly past the black limo before pulling into the
          lot. Five Bangers bail out and check out the black stretch.
                         
          The limo doors are locked, windows tinted, so they can't see
          what's inside, but they check out the tires and wheels and
          like what they see. With the speed of a pit crew, they open
          the back of the van and out come TOOLS AND A JACK.
                         
          INT. LIMO -- SAME
                         
          We move over the back bench, past empty bottles, fast food
          wrappers as A SLEEPING MAN'S FACE ratchets into frame.
          He opens his red eyes.
                         
          The man is LOGAN aka The Wolverine or more accurately, Drunk
          Wolverine. He blinks, dazed, feeling the car lurching upward.
          Older than we've seen him, he clutches a Tequila bottle.
                         
          EXT. LIMO -- EL PASO HIGHWAY TURNOUT - NIGHT
                         
          As the back door opens, the tequila bottle drops to the dirt
          and A BOOTED LEG STEPS OUT.
                         
          Logan shuffles, stiff, to the other side of the stretch where
          the Bangers work, removing wheels, lit by colored light.

            Now might be a good time to talk about "fights" described in
            the next 100 or so pages. Basically, if you're on the make
            for a hyper choreographed, gravity defying, city-block
            destroying, CG fuckathon, this ain't your movie.
                         
            In this flick, people will get hurt or killed when shit falls
            on them. They will get just as hurt or just as killed if they
            get hit with something big and heavy like, say, a car. Should
            anyone in our story have the misfortune to fall off a roof or
            out a window, they won't bounce. They will die.
                         
            As for our hero with his so-called eternal life and healing.
            Well, he's older now. If you keep reading, you'll discover
            Logan's about to get his ass kicked. But before we get to
            that, we should make it clear his abilities ain't what they
            were. Yes, he's a drunk, but he's also fading on the inside.
            Adamantium implants leeching into his system, causing chronic
            pain and diminished healing, hence booze as painkiller.
                         
            So by all means, go ahead and worry about him.
            Now where were we? Oh, yeah--
                         
            As the smoke settles, a CROWBAR-toting Banger angrily chews
            out Jitters in Spanish for firing. The others resume their
            work... none aware of Logan slowly getting up, till --

            The Bangers react to Logan with bafflement. Ad-lib Spanish
            reactions, nervous chuckles --
                         
            CROWBAR presses down JITTER'S gun as he moves to Logan.
                         
            We hear a familiar SNIKT! as claws slowly extend from one of
            Logan's hands, then mostly extend from the other. Logan is
            still frowning at his bad hand when--
                         
            CROWBAR THWACKS HIS SKULL. A metallic ring.
                         
            Off balance and pissed, Logan swings at them as they
            converge, but he's drunk and soon they are pounding him with
            knives and guns and fists and a torque wrench.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                    3.
                         
                         
            He tries his best to keep them from the limo, catches one
            guy's bat an inch before it would dent the car.
                         
            Another one of them shoots in that direction, but Logan puts
            himself in front of the bullet. The pain from that little
            move stops him long enough for them to resume the pummeling.
                         
            Suddenly, Logan's eyes go yellow, pupils dilating. He lets
            out a long, loud yell. Fury rockets up in him, like cocaine.
                         
            HE STANDS AND RAMS HIS CLAWS INTO CROWBAR and kicks another
            Banger into the back of the open van. Yet another runs at
            Logan only to get gored in the neck and tossed. This is real
            work for Logan, not easy. And it is fueled by rage.
                         
            Jitters again raises his sawed-off, he will nail the car for
            sure, but Logan slices off his arm above the elbow.
                         
            Sadly for Logan, the hand, while disconnected from the body
            it once belonged to, is still holding the gun. So, as it hits
            the dirt, the gun goes off, putting several pellet-sized
            holes in the door of the limo.
                         
            This, more than anything else, doubles Logan anger--

            WHO GETS HIT ONCE MORE --and then goes after the last banger
            who, seeing he had his chance, leaps into the van and spins
            out of the lot, his wounded compadre in back, spilling onto
            the dirt as the van bounces back onto the road.
                         
            Logan picks up his keys, some loose change and a single
            silver bullet. He stands, staring at the holes in his
            otherwise pristine stretch as RAIN BEGINS TO FALL.
                         
            He sucks in deep breaths, forcing himself to regain control.
            His eyes return to normalcy. A PHONE VIBRATES OS. Logan takes
            out his, looks at it (he's got a fare), kicks the jack from
            the under the chassis.
                         
            WE CRANE UP as Logan starts up the stretch and makes a loop
            in the lot, taking care to run over the three remaining
            Bangers before laying rubber onto the highway...

            speed toward them on motorcycles.
                         
            Under massive fire, bullet-riddled, Logan's limo finds
            purchase, and he's backing out at high speed, ripping a long
            section of chain link from its posts and dragging this "tail"
            with him (driving backwards now).

            grabs onto the chain link tail, the limo dragging him.
                         
            The Reaver claws his way along the chain link toward the hood
            of the car, drawing his gun, firing at the windshield.
                         
            Logan ducks and spins the car around. The dragging fence

                   -- when he finally stumbles, peers up to see those Reavers
                   closing in on him, restraints and weapons at the ready when--
                         
                   --SNIKT! Logan appears from nowhere and kills them in an
                   instant. A guerilla warrior, dropped back in the jungle for

                   JONAH uses his ocular mirror connection, making one of the
                   Reavers AIM HIS GUN AT HIS OWN MEN, MOWING THEM DOWN. Then he
                   mimes his "puppet" Reaver into aiming his automatic rifle at
                   himself, shooting himself in the chin.

                   Delilah is caught against a tree. She breathes on her
                   captor's arm, FREEZING IT. Then she shatters his frozen limb,

                   A Reaver brings Logan's backpack to Pierce. He looks at the
                   vial and empty syringe. He signals the troops to keep moving.
                   Concerned, he looks ahead to the convoy.

            in the jeep at the head of the convoy.
                         
            Pierce meets Logan's eyes as Logan starts toward him.

            Logan is blown backward off his feet. Sprayed with shrapnel.
                         
            The convoy continues moving after the children in the
            distance.
                         
            Logan pulls himself up from the smoldering brush to see --

            primal scream and looks up to see--
                         
            LOGAN, sprinting toward her, eyes aflame. He slaughters the
            men surrounding Laura in a swirl of blood--
                         
            And then the father and daughter move on, chasing after the
            convoy, slashing through several more Reavers emerging from
            the woods to ambush them.
                         
            At the end of this father daughter blade Logan stumbles, out
            of breath, motioning for Laura to move on, as she slashes at
            one more Reaver.

            Laura moves surreptitiously through the woods to gain better
            position on her captive friends. She eyes the two Reavers who
            stand on a jeep, watching over the children-- and two other
