    FADE IN:
1   EXT. SLATE QUARRY - DAY                                    1

    FRED FLINTSTONE, archetypical Everyman, sits atop his
    faithful heavy-equipment dinosaur, cranking the winch
    that makes the mighty beast rip and tear into the quarry
    wall.

2   THE QUARRY FOREMAN                                         2
    looks down at his wristwatch. Well... actually, it's a
    wrist sundial. And it's magic time... quittin' time...
    Millerock time!
    Now the foreman turns from his watch to a steam whistle
    bird, and yanks its tail. The BIRD SQUAWKS the end of
    the workday --

                             FRED
               YABBA DABBA DO -- !
    Fred happily discards his hard hat, leaps out of the
    canvas-roofed cab on the dino's back, slides down the
    tail and bounces right into the seat of his stone and
    timber car! He gets up to a running start with the only
    motor (his feet), slows to allow a "time clock" dinosaur
    to punch his stone timecard, and then he's trotting back
    up to speed and out of the gate! MUSIC comes UP and
    OVER --
                             MUSIC (V.O.)
               'Flintstones,
               Meet the Flintstones,
               They're a modern
               Stone age fam-i-ly --'

    -- And so forth, as for the first time in "his-tor-y" we
    see the Flintstones' OPENING CREDITS live!

    reading "FLINTSTONE." We WIDEN as Fred SKIDS to a halt
    in the driveway of his three-bedroom ranch cave. A
    moment later, WILMA and PEBBLES run out -- both looking
    just like they should -- and get into the car. A beat
    behind them are the Flintstone pets, Dino and the
    saber-toothed cat.
    Fred pauses, looks around... HONKS his HORN... BARNEY,
    BETTY and BAM-BAM come out of the neighboring house, hop
    in!

    Fred's feet slap on the street as the car starts
    up --

    Fred and company pull in. He takes a giant sea shell
    "speaker" off of its wooden stand and hooks it to his
    car door. He leans over, puts his arm around Wilma.
    (In the back seat, Dino pops his head up, tearing through
    the canvas top.) Dino picks up Pebbles and Bam-Bam and
    puts them on his head for a better view. CAMERA ZOOMS IN
    ON the drive-in screen and the words that America has
    waited twenty-five years to see in 70mm Dolby(TM) drop-
    your-popcorn reality:
                            THE FLINTSTONES
    And as the MAIN CREDITS ROLL, we --
                                              DISSOLVE TO:
6   AN EERIE CARBONIFEROUS FOREST - DAWN                       6

    Dew drips from strange multi-leafed plants. Giant
    DRAGONFLIES BUZZ AND HUM to and fro. Bubbles rise from
    a still pond, and weird lungfish move onto the land.
    (The third one out carries a little suitcase.)

    CAMERA PANS PAST the lungfish TO a muddy shore. With a
    DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING, we DISCOVER a set of strange,
    hideous clawprints. The CAMERA FOLLOWS these, then
    WIDENS to reveal the make of these footprints: A seven-
    foot tall and fearful beast we will call the Xenosaurus.
    It looks around menacingly. (Oddly, it's carrying a
    canvas sack, but we don't stress this.)

    Suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs
    over the Xenosaurus.

7   NEW ANGLE                                                  7

    Dazed, the Xenosaurus gets up. As it does, we realize
    that we aren't deep in some primeval forest, but on the
    shoulder of a gravel highway. A stone road sign reads
    BEDROCK 1/2 MILE. ROCK VEGAS, BABYLON & EDEN NEXT THREE
    EXITS. Now, the CAMERA CRANES UP ABOVE the sign and
    we see -- Bedrock!
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                           3.

     Nestled incongruously in a savage landscape, the charming
     protosuburbia gleams in the dawn's early Spielberg light.

     The Xenosaurus grabs its sack and some silverware spills
     out. Then it runs off into the bushes and out of sight.

8    WITH THAT GARBAGE TRUCK                                    8

     It reaches the crest of a hill where there's a "WELCOME
     TO BEDROCK" billboard which bears greetings from the
     Rotary Club, the Chamber of Commerce, and (of course)
     The Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes. The garbage truck
     guys drop their feet down through the floorboard and
     trot over the rise, coast down to the street below.
     The driver yanks a wooden brake and the truck stops, and
     the rear guys hop off. One of them waves to --

9    A MILKMAN                                                  9
     who returns the wave, then takes a four-pack of stone
     bottles out of his milk truck, heads towards a doorway.
     As the milkman drops off the milk, he passes a big
     TORTOISE with trash cans on its back. The Tortoise
     nods familiarly to the milkman, then it waddles down the
     curb, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The garbage men take the cans
     off the Tortoise's back, dump them into the truck.
10   REAR OF TRUCK                                              10
     -- revealing   that the back of the truck is actually a
     giant-jawed   CREATURE strapped onto the chassis. The
     garbage men   dump the cans into its maw... it happily
     swallows the   works, licks its lips, BELCHES.
11   BACK TO SCENE                                              11

     The garbagemen slam the cans back on the Tortoise, who
     winces as they drive off.
                                TORTOISE
                         (under his breath)
                  You can forget about a tip for
                  Christmas...

     It waddles back up the lawn... passing by a wooden "lawn
     timer" box which now pops open.
     Inside the box is a "ROOSTERSAURUS" which CROWS and flaps
     its wings. The motion of the wings knocks loose two
     round stones which roll down two long troughs a la Rube
     Goldberg...

                                                          4.

12   FOLLOWING THE ROUND STONES                                12
     They reach the ends of their respective paths, dislodging
     a stick... that releases a coiled rope which in turn
     spins a turntable which holds a little wooly mammoth. As
     it begins to spin around, it squirts water out of its
     snout.

     Elsewhere on the lawn, other spinning MAMMOTHS repeat
     this performance. After a moment, they gradually slow
     their revolutions. The one closest to the house
     scrunches its trunk with a GROAN.

                             LITTLE MAMMOTH
                      (sotto)
               Oh, my aching sinuses...

13   INT. FLINTSTONES' BEDROOM - DAY                           13

     WIDEN FROM the windowsill, where a little sea shell
     hearing aid trumpet AMPLIFIES another ROOSTERSAURUS
     "COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO" into the ear of a "CLOCK RADIO
     WOODPECKER." The Woodpecker yawns, gets out of bed,
     puts a timecard in a little clock. Then it turns
     and begins pecking on a BELL, which RINGS PIERCINGLY.

14   INT. BEDROOM - NEW ANGLE                                  14
     Two shapes are visible under the bedclothes: One is a
     great SNORING bulge, the other is a svelte and lithe
     shape. As the BELL continues RINGING, the larger bulge
     GRUNTS, MOANS, pulls a pillow over its head, and then
     finally gropes under the bed for a slipper. The slipper
     is thrown without aiming --
15   THE WOODPECKER                                            15
     ducks just in time.   It wipes its forehead nervously.

                             RADIO WOODPECKER
                      (sotto)
               I hate this job... There's not
               even a health plan...

     He staggers back up to his perch, and then notices for
     the first time that the dial on the side is pointed not
     to "ALARM" but to "ALARM & RADIO." The WOODPECKER SIGHS,
     looks over at the bed where SNORING is still emanating.
     Then the bird swings a little telescope around to point
     out the window.

     distant stone building marked RADIO STATION B-ROK.

     Perched on top of the wooden radio tower are a monkey
     and an octopus. The monkey holds up cue cards which the
     octopus reads, and then waves nautical semaphore flags.

     Our WOODPECKER squints, CLEARS his THROAT.

                                RADIO WOODPECKER
                         (deeper "on-air" voice)
                  Good morning, Bedrock. This is
                  station B-R-O-K with the morning
                  weather and news...
18   IN THE BED                                                    18

     The big bulge GRUNTS and MUTTERS a bit, then one hand
     gropes around, finds the curvaceous form under the
     neighboring covers... feels it tentatively... then
     the fingers "walk" upwards...
                                RADIO WOODPECKER (O.S.)
                  It will be fair and mild through
                  the weekend, continuing for the
                  next eight hundred years, followed
                  by cooling breezes and a protracted
                  ice age...
     Those walking fingers have reached the top edge of the
     covers... now they pull them down revealing the owner's
     face... the face of Fred, his eyes at half-mast, his
     face covered in fashionable "Bedrock Vice" stubble.
                                FRED
                         (with genuine charm)
                  Wil-ma. Wil-ma? How about a
                  great big good morning kiss for
                  your Freddy-weddy?
     And he pulls the covers down to reveal -- DINO, who is
     immediately "YI-YI-YI-YI-ING," hopping all over the bed
     and showering Fred with sloppy kisses.
                                 FRED
                  Dino!   Dino, cut it out -- !

                  In the news, Bedrock civic and
                  business leaders met yesterday to
                  discuss the growing kibble crisis.

                  Ecological activist Ralph Naderock
                  warned that if new supplies of
                  kibble are not found, our animal-
                  powered civilization itself may be
                  threatened.

     By now Dino's affection   attack has knocked both master
     and pet to the floor in   a jumble of bedclothes, asses
     and elbows. Dino begins    to roll Fred across the room
     like a seal playing with   a ball.

                                FRED
                  Dino, that's enough -- here, look,
                  Daddy has a nice dino bone for
                  you, just please stop it --

     Fred has now backed up to a dresser, where he grabs a
     brightly-colored box labeled "PURINROCK DINO TREATS."
     Fred holds it up -- Dino gets up on two legs, eager for
     the treat -- Fred shakes the box... alas, nothing comes
     out.
     DINO "YI-YI'S" again, propelling Fred into the next room.

     Five-year-old PEBBLES GIGGLES at the table as Fred and
     Dino tumble into the room like Frank Buck and a lion.
     Wilma turns at the noise. One look at her and we under-
     stand Fred's romantic turn.
                                RADIO WOODPECKER (O.S.)
                  In other news, Bedrock police
                  report that the Xenosaurus has
                  struck again! Yes, the fiercesome
                  intruder was sighted in the
                  Bedrock Hills for the third time
                  this month. Outlying shops and
                  residencies report extensive
                  looting and property destruction...

                  Fred, stop playing with Dino and
                  sit down. Your breakfast's
                  getting cold.

     Saying this, Wilma puts   a huge egg at Fred's place.
     Meanwhile, Fred manages   to get to his feet, holds out
     one arm to keep Dino at   bay. Fred does a big "take,"
     looking out the window   --

                  nice big dino bone laying out on
                  the front lawn -- !

     Pause.   Dino gives him a big look as if to say, "Oh,
     yeah?"

                  little female dino --

     "YI-YI-YI-YI," DINO is out the door like a rocket. Fred
     cackles, slams it shut, then sits down at the table.
                                FRED
                  -- That animal's gonna kill me

                  Of course not, baby.

                                FRED
                  That's right, sweetheart. The
                  only thing that's gonna eat you
                  up is -- me!

     And he grabs her and bites her and tickles her.

                         (giggling, calming)
                  I'm still a little scared...
                                FRED
                  Pebbles, don't worry. These
                  stories are very exaggerated.
                  Like, you know, the boogyman?
                  There's no such thing as a huge,
                  inhuman reptile that attacks
                  without warning --
     WHAM! Dino reappears, bounding through the window
     and knocking Fred onto the floor. Once again Dino is
     happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously
     unresponsive owner. Fred struggles to avoid the
     slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill,
     looks out.
                                FRED
                  -- Oh, look, everybody, the mailman
                  is here --

     "YI-YI-YI-YI!" DINO buys it again, runs to the door,
     lets himself out. This time Fred puts a chair against
     the door.

     Meanwhile, Wilma turns at the sound of the TOASTER
     POPPING UP. We see that the "claws" we saw earlier were
     the actual claws of a LOBSTER in a little fireproof suit
     who is tucked inside the toaster. As Wilma takes the
     toast, the Lobster blows on his claws, wincing, then
     looks TOWARDS the CAMERA.
                                LOBSTER
                  Well, it beats working in a
                  seafood restaurant...

                         (taking the toast)
                  Thanks, Wilma...
     Fred slaps jelly on the toast, takes a big bite, and then
     something outside the window catches his eye.

20   HIS POV - STREET                                              20
     A paperboy on a wood-and-stone bicycle is coming rapidly
     towards the house. In the bike's basket is a stack of
     dried, rock-hard clay tablets.
21   BACK TO SCENE                                                 21

     Fred leans out the window, waving his hands.

                                FRED
                  Arnold! Arnold! Don't aim at
                  the house -- please, not at the
                  house --
     WHAM! Fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams
     into the window frame, SMASHING a FLOWERPOT, taking out
     a chunk of wall, and continuing diagonally through the
     kitchen and out another window. Fred follows this
     action in time to see --
22   HIS DRIVEWAY - THROUGH THE OTHER WINDOW                       22
     The rock paper drops like a foul shot, rips through the
     canvas roof of Fred's car, and then bangs a huge dent
     in the hood.

23   BACK TO SCENE                                                 23
     Fred sighs, turns back to his breakfast.

                                WILMA
                  Lucky it wasn't the Sunday paper.

                                 FRED
                          (slight smile)
                  Yeah.   What else can go wrong?

     He slices through the big egg with his knife -- releasing
     a baby PTERODACTYL which SQUAWKS and flaps, knocking Fred
     over as it takes off through the window.

     fix his car.

     In the neighboring driveway, Wilma and Betty pile the
     kids into Betty's car.

                                BETTY
                         (wiping their mouths)
                  Come on, kids. Time for nursery
                  school.

                         (as Wilma clears
                          her throat)
                  'Bye, big sweetheart.

     Fred kisses them both and they drive off. Fred sighs,
     tries to stretch the canvas roof edges close enough to
     stitch. Nearby, Dino struggles to drag the stone news-
     paper inside the house. The twin headlines are, of
     course, KIBBLE CRISIS GROWS and MYSTERIOUS XENOSAURUS
     STRIKES AGAIN.

     Suddenly a pink flamingo appears over the hedge. As its
     mouth opens and closes, it appears to be talking, but
     the voice is that of --
                                BARNEY
                  Nice morning, huh, Fred?
                                FRED
                  What's nice about it?

                                BARNEY
                  Heh, hey. That Arnold's got a
                  real arm on him, don't he?

     Now we see that Barney is holding the flamingo's stiff
     legs which he scissors, making the bird's beak trim the
     hedge.

                                FRED
                  This is the third ragtop this year
                  ... say, shouldn't you be at work?

                  donno, I'm just not a nine to
                  five guy. I got dreams, Fred.
                  Ideas --

                                FRED
                  Yeah, I know, I know, those
                  crazy inventions of yours. Be
                  honest with me, Barn... tell me
                  one thing you invented that
                  really caught on.
                                BARNEY
                  I invented fire.

                                FRED
                         (pause)
                  You invented fire?
                                BARNEY
                  I told you that, Fred. But the
                  coal conglomerate ripped me off.
                  The case is still in court, but
                  meanwhile I got lotsa other
                  ideas --
                                FRED
                  Yeah, but did any one of them
                  ever put bread on the table? How
                  long are you and Betty gonna live
                  on those penny-ante royalties you
                  get?

     Fred pulls his car hood off of its wooden hinges,
     examines it with dismay.

                                FRED
                  If you ask me, pal, you're just
                  blowing smoke up your own
                  volcano...

                                 BARNEY
                  Maybe, Fred.   But first...

     He uses the flamingo's jaws to snatch the car hood
     from Fred's surprised grasp.
                                BARNEY
                  Let me try some of that smoke on
                  your car.

25   INT. BARNEY'S GARAGE/WORKSHOP - DAY                         25
     We can still see Fred's car in the neighboring driveway.
     (We can also see Dino, who drags the newspaper on a
     bit more, then collapses from exhaustion).
     Barney's garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and
     ends, plus various inventions and scale models in
     different stages of completion. (Interestingly, a
     number of these anticipate Leonardo da Vinci's work).
     Many of the models are made of a strange celadon green
     material.

     Fred watches, skeptical, as Barney presses the car hood
     into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone.
                               BARNEY
                        (as he works)
                 -- See, the first step, we make
                 a mold of the old car hood, smooth
                 out the dent in the clay --
     He tosses the original car hood aside with a crash.
     Then, moving rapidly, he starts heaving a variety of
     ingredients into the reverse imprint of the car hood.

                               BARNEY
                 -- Add some lava granules... some
                 woca leaves... juice from two
                 coo-coo berries...

                               FRED
                        (impressed)
                 Two coo-coo berries?   You made of
                 money, Barney?

                               BARNEY
                 Anything for a pal, Fred -- a
                 lump of coal... bamboo sawdust...
                 eucalyptus sap... a touch of the
                 La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila.
     Barney dips a finger in this mess, "tastes" it;
     satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock
     weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out
     of his skin.

26   NEW ANGLE                                                   26

     Fred is caked with dust.   He coughs and spits.
                               FRED
                 Barney, why don't you try inventing
                 a brain for yourself! Look at what
                 you did to --

     proudly lifts out a perfect (though greenish) duplicate
     of the car hood. As Fred examines it, impressed despite
     himself, we...

     The two kids are in the back seat. Somehow both of the
     kids' faces are messy again. Working together with
     beautiful precision, they are carefully dismantling the
     rear armrests and door handles.

                  Wilma. I mean, Barney's sweet, but...
                  well, he's just not cut out to punch
                  a clock. And he's such a dreamer,
                  you think he ever once picked up a
                  hammer and chisel and tried to
                  balance a checkbook?
     They pull up in front of a pleasant-looking simple little
     nursery school. MRS. GRANITE, a pleasant-looking 65, sees
     them from the schoolyard, waves while Wilma and Betty un-
     load the kids.
                                BETTY
                  No, Barney just keeps looking for
                  that coo-coo berry pie in the sky,
                  and I don't want to pop his balloon
                  by talking about the price of
                  mastodon ribs.

     She wipes off Bam-Bam's mouth with a handkerchief. Wilma
     does the same with Pebbles and then they kiss the kids,
     who immediately run into the schoolyard.

                                MRS. GRANITE

                  Mrs. Rubble, Mrs. Flintstone, I

                  You're welcome, Mrs. Granite. But
                  we wipe their mouths every day.

                                MRS. GRANITE
                  No, no, I mean for all your wonderful
                  support the past few years. It's
                  parents like you that make me think
                  twice about retiring.

     From the schoolyard comes the sudden sound of KIDS QUAR-

     Fred and Barney drive along. (Behind them, the same
     houses and palms seem to be going by... duplex, palm...
     split level, two palms... duplex, palm).
     Barney grins, gestures towards the front of the car.

                  Not bad, eh? After it cures for an
                  hour or so, it's solid as a rock.

                  Okay, you fixed a dented hood. But
                  you call that a living? Face it,
                  pal, this is the Stone Age, and it's
                  a dino eat dino world. You want my
                  advice?

                  You stick with me today, cruise on
                  down to the quarry and fill out a
                  job application. I'm a big man
                  there, Barney --

                                BARNEY
                  You're a big man anywhere, Fred --
                                FRED
                  I'm serious, pal. Me and Mr. Slate
                  are just like this --
     He takes his hand off the wheel to hold up two fingers...
     ends up swerving instead.

                                FRED
                  -- just like that. I know, I know
                  -- you're not a clock-punching guy
                  -- but face it, Barney -- it's time
                  to grow up and put your nose to the
                  grindstone, batten down the hatches
                  and join the ratasaurus race with
                  the rest of us.
                         (meaningfully)
                  It's time to retire those dreams.
     Barney looks glum, doesn't say anything.    Suddenly Fred
     pulls over, stops the car.
                                 FRED
                  Barney.   Look.
29   WIDE SHOT                                                   29
     They're at the crest of a high wide hill.

                                 BARNEY
                  Hey.   Lava Lane.
                                FRED
                  Remember the old days, Barn? We
                  used to race our go-carts here to
                  impress the girls.

                                BARNEY
                         (wistful)
                  Yeah, those were the days... we
                  usta dream about coming back here
                  some day with a real car and goin'
                  for the goldrock...!

     A look from one to another, and then down the hill...
     Fred gets a malicious grin on his face.

                  Fred... I thought you said it was
                  time to retire those old dreams.
                               FRED
                  Hey. Since when do I have to be
                  consistent?

     The two pals laugh, and then    with a whoop they begin
     pedalling like mad. They go     over the top, gravity takes
     over and they are flying past    that billboard with all the
     Rotary Club welcomes on it.     But now we see a different
     sort of welcome, as a POLICE    CAR ZOOMS out from behind it.
30   POLICE CAR - CLOSER                                            30

     Inside are SERGEANT FELDSPAR and his rookie partner,
     OFFICER GRAVEL. Cackling with anticipation, Feldspar
     opens a box marked radar detector. Out pops a little
     bird in a police helmet. It has a stopwatch (actually,
     stop-sundial) around its neck. Feldspar points -- the
     bird salutes -- takes off!
31   FRED AND BARNEY                                                31

                        (spotting the cops)
                  Oh-oh! Fred, slow down -- !

     Suddenly both Fred and Barney see the RADAR BIRD flying
     alongside them. It checks its stopwatch, writes a note
     to itself. Fred is so preoccupied he doesn't notice
     as --

32   THE POLICE CAR                                                 32
     cuts in front of Fred. Fred SLAMS on the "BRAKES," sits
     helplessly as Feldspar gets out, walks over, grinning.
                                FELDSPAR
                  Well, Flintstone, looks like today's
                  the day.
                                FRED
                  Sergeant Feldspar, I... I wasn't
                  speeding... honest...

     Fred reaches down to the floorboard as he speaks...
33   ANGLE ON FLOORBOARD                                            33

     There's a box there marked RADAR BUSTER.

                                FELDSPAR (O.S.)
                  Forget it, Flintstone. This time
                  I got you dead to rights --
     Fred opens the box. A scary-looking winged reptile
     sticks out its head, smacks its hungry lips.

34   BACK TO SCENE                                                    34
     Confident, Feldspar jerks a thumb at the Radar Bird,
     turns to his rookie partner.

                                FELDSPAR
                  Gravel. Get me the radar reading
                  and I'll show you how we deal with
                  scofflaws.

     Gravel nods, steps towards the bird. The bird checks
     its stopwatch... and then it notices the flying lizard
     which is hovering nearby, licking its lips.
                                 RADAR BIRD
                  Whoa!   Wings, do your stuff -- !

     The Radar Bird flies away at a hundred miles an hour,
     leaving a cloud of dust and the stopwatch behind.
     Feldspar catches the watch, startled.
                                FRED
                  Well, Sergeant, if you don't have
                  a radar reading, I guess we'll --
                         (quickly)
                  -- justbeonourway -- !

     A new cloud of dust appears as Fred ROARS away.
                                 FELDSPAR
                  Flintstone!   Flintstone, come back
                  here -- !
                                                      CUT TO:

35   EXT. BEDROCK BUTCHER SHOP - DAY                                  35
     Betty and Wilma   have just pulled up. We notice that next
     to their legal   spot, a big limousine is parked in a "no
     parking" zone.    But our law-abiding Betty in the next
     space now drops   a stone coin in a parking meter.

     Inside the window we see a LITTLE BIRD. It "bites" the
     coin to check it, then turns over an egg timer.

     It's absolutely   mobbed. Customers push past each other
     with armloads of   food. Gigantic cuts of meat hang from
     above or are on   display behind the counter. MORRIS THE
     BUTCHER looks up   from the chaos and manages a weak smile
     for the girls.

     REVEALING MRS. SLATE, who stands there, impatient and
     overdressed.

                  Of course, Mrs. Slate.   Just take
                  a number.
     Wilma senses the tension, quickly steps forward to break
     it with a smile.
                                WILMA
                  Ah, hello, Mrs. Slate.

     Morris reacts with relief.    Mrs. Slate reacts with a
     blank look.

                                WILMA

     She turns her back to Wilma, forces her way towards the
     counter again. Wilma burns.

                  Give it to Mrs. Rubble along with
                  this.

     Gino nods, smiling. He picks up a crate, begins to load
     it with giant fryer parts and several manhole-sized meat
     patties.

     Mrs. Slate steps to the counter. Meanwhile, the staff
     begin using a refrigerator dolly to bring out giant ribs,
     steaks and sausages which they pile up in front of Wilma.

                  I want a nice fresh, juicy
                  chickensaurus, Morris. And not
                  one you've had laying around on
                  the shelf. I mean fresh.
                                MORRIS
                  Mrs. Slate, we're kind of busy
                  now --

                  I don't care if you're busy. What
                  I care about is my adorable little
                  grand nephew. He's staying with
                  me for the summer and I intend to
                  make his favorite dish... Southern
                  fried chickensaurus! Now I want
                  a fresh chickensaurus and I want
                  it now!

     with a sigh, they buckle on elbow and knee protectors,
     go to a side door, open it. Inside is another barred
     door. They open it, go inside. Immediately we hear
     loud SQUAWKING and CACKLING... THUDS, BUMPS...

     Suddenly the barred door slams open and a      giant chicken-
     saurus comes bounding out, with Morris's      staff hanging
     all over it like rodeo cowboys. They try       and restrain
     it with ropes but it's enraged and flops      around the

41   EXT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY                                      41
     The huge bird lands with a crunch atop Mrs. Slate's car,
     which is practically squashed flat. Then it disappears
     around the corner. (We hear CAR HORNS and SKIDDING TIRES
     as it goes.)
42   BACK TO SCENE                                                42

     Wilma and Betty try and hide their laughter.

     Clouds of dust rise from behind the fence. We see the
     heads of the heavy equipment dinos rising and falling.
     A two-story office building is at one end of the site
     with a big "Slate Construction Inc." sign on the roof.
     CAMERA ADJUSTS as Fred's car turns into the lot, Barney
     seated beside Fred. The new green hood gleams in the
     morning light.

     Fred digs his feet into the ground, slams to a halt. He
     gets out, surveys the activity. Immediately, the various
     workers shout AD LIB greetings. Fred acknowledges these,
     beaming in the respect he gets here.

     He lovingly dusts off his construction helmet, puts it on,
     knocks an offending speck from his parking sign (F.
     Flintstone - Shop Steward). He leads Barney towards the
     quarry area.

                                FRED
                  Barney, you won't regret this --
                  hiya, Al -- fixing dents in cars
                  is one thing, a career's another.
                  Here, you're getting in on the
                  ground floor of the first footstep
                  of a new leaf -- hi, Wally, how's
                  the old backhand? And with a guy
                  like me ta show you the ropes, you
                  can skip all the red tape, all the
                  malarky, all the dino doo --

     Fred stands near the weight station booth, where a plump
     GIRL in a beehive hairdo sits inside a trailer.

                               GIRL
                        (New York accent)
                 Hi, Mr. Flintstone.

                               FRED
                 Hiya, Shirley. This is my very
                 special neighbor and pal Barney
                 Rubble. He needs an application
                 form, okay?
                               GIRL
                 Anything for you, Mr. Flintstone.

     She slams down two clay tablets and a stylus.
                               GIRL
                 Here you go.
                        (smiling)
                 Thanks again for the football tickets.
                 My boyfriend and I both liked them.

                               FRED
                 My pleasure, Shirl.    Anytime.
                               GIRL
                 Okay. But do you think next time
                 we could go to the same game?
                               FRED
                        (confidently)
                 No problem.
     Fred smiles at her, hands the forms to Barney. Fres steps
     towards the quarry, admires the activity, hands on hips,
     master of all he surveys. He waves to more friends.
                               FRED
                 Well, Barn, what did I tell you?
                 When you're in with Flintstone,
                 you're in like Flint.
                              BARNEY
                 Gee, Fred. I knew you were a big
                 shot. I just didn't know how big.
     Fred beams at that, and then follows Barney's gaze to
     the read-out on the truck scale. Fred is standing on it
     and it's pushing 250. With a scowl, Fred grabs Barney's
     sleeve and they go into the quarry. As they move, the
     CAMERA PANS and CRANES UP TOWARDS the window of the
     Slate Construction Office.

46   INT. OFFICE - PULLBACK FROM WINDOW                        46
     The room here is dominated by a tabletop architectural
     model of a large scale construction project. There's
     acres of little development houses, then some tall office
     buildings, a mall, you name it: There's even little foot-
     powered model cars in the model parking spaces.

     Near this we see MR. SLATE, a giant in the Bedrock con-
     struction business (but not in height). Slate drinks
     coffee from a "Boss" mug, listens with growing impatience
     to JERRY LAVA. Several of Slate's lackeys listen, their
     heads nodding up or down in sympathy with Slate's mer-
     curial moods.
                             LAVA
               Uncle, if you'll look at this unit
               cost projection... it intersects
               here with --
                             SLATE
               -- how'd you like my fist to
               intersect with your nose? I've
               told you a hundred times, don't call
               me uncle in the office! Now, I didn't
               arrange your scholarship to Harvrock
               University so you could waste my time!
               So stop beating around the bushasaurus
               and get to the bottom slime!
                             LAVA
               You'll be bankrupt in six months.
     Slate does a Danny Thomas spit take all over the model.
47   EXT. QUARRY - MOVING SHOT                                 47
     Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers
     and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving.
     Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them,
     we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the
     quarry's sides.

     Hearing a loud SMASH, Fred looks up and sees --

48   FRED'S POV - A WRECKING BALL OPERATOR                     48
     A burly and rough looking guy named PILTDOWN, he grins in-
     side his dino-topping cupola, winds his winch handles and
     then propels his wrecking ball towards the...

49   QUARRY WALL - ABOVE                                          49
     -- where the huge stone BALL SMASHES into some walnuts
     balanced on a boulder.

50   WIDER                                                        50
     Piltdown's compact buddy PYRITE cackles, sweeps  up the
     walnuts. Munching them, he balances a new one   in place.
     (It should be noted here that the relationship  and physi-
     cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors  that of
     our heroes... they're sort of an anti-Fred and  Barney.)

                             PYRITE
               Way ta go, Pilty baby. Five bucks
               says you can't hit one on the fly.

                             PILTDOWN
                      (calling up)
               Yer on, Pyrite --
     Pyrite tosses a walnut, which bounces on the ledge.    The
     wrecking BALL SMASHES into the stone wall.

     Workers near Fred duck as dust and debris fall down.
     People grab for their construction helmets.

               Not again...
     Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to
     the level of Piltdown's cab. Barney hurries to follow.
                             FRED
               All right, Piltdown, that's enough!
               You're endangering your fellow
               workers!

                              PILTDOWN

               us workers a snack break. So...
                      (a nasty grin)
               ... I'm breakin' some snacks.

     He swings the wrecking ball again.

     This time he's overdone it:   The wrecking ball flies past
     the walnuts -- Pyrite ducks  for cover -- and then the
     wrecking ball whips over and  around the handrail which
     runs along here, twisting as  tightly as Indiana Jones'
     whip. The handrail wobbles   dangerously in its
     foundation --

     to CREAK and GROAN with the strain --

     Workers scatter, fearful of the imminent collapse.   Fred
     runs to grab the dino's reins.

                              FRED
                Whoa, whoa, big fella --
     He calms the beast by giving it a carrot.   As it munches,
     Fred quickly ties the reins to a post.
                              FRED
                       (calling up to the cab)
                You're on report, Piltdown! If it's
                up to me you'll be pushing a
                wheelbarrow!

                  I mean -- this ain't over, Piltdown.
                         (turning, shouting)
                  Come on, guys. Let's clean up the
                  mess.
     With much grumbling, ropes and grappling hooks are
     gathered and the crew hops to it...

                  It's all here in hack and slice.
                  When you committed to this housing
                  development the price of dino kibble
                  was a few clams per ton. Since then,
                  it's gone up a hundredfold.
                         (indicating the model)
                  You can't build a project like this
                  without the heavy equipment dinos,
                  and we can't afford to feed those
                  dinos.

     Slate glowers, paces around the model.

                  Sounds like a worker's comp claim

     All rush to the window.       They look out and see --
58   THE QUARRY - WIDE                                               58

     Supervised by   Fred, all    the workers are straining on the
     ropes to haul   the rear    legs of the crane back into their
     sockets on the   back of    the big dino. Only the last
     critical rope   is still    dangling.

                                 FRED
                  Barney!   Grab that line!   Hurry!
     Barney scrambles up Fred's back, shoving a foot in Fred's
     face, but finally snatching the rope. He pulls on it...
     Fred throws his own weight into the effort...

59   THE CRANE                                                       59

     alas, with its cable now twisted shorter, it's become an
     immovable object, and as the shortened CABLE SNAPS, the
     wrecking ball begins to roll down the quarry wall.

64   THE HOOD OF FRED'S CAR                                          64

     -- where, astonishingly, the HOOD sinks in resiliently
     like a trampoline and then with a loud "SPROING" the
     wrecking ball flies straight back up into the air,
     followed a beat behind by the unhinged hood itself.
     Both hurtle TOWARDS the CAMERA --

                                                             28.

     react fearfully as they realize all this is coming
     straight for them. With a howl, they all dive aside --

66   INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - WIDER - DAY                             66
     The wrecking BALL flies through the window, SLAMS onto
     Slate's desk, crushing everything in its path and then
     sails on SMASHING right into --
67   THE MODEL DEVELOPMENT                                         67

     -- where all of the lined up HIGH RISES SMASH ASIDE with
     a sound like falling pins.
68   IN THE QUARRY                                                 68

     The workers pick themselves up and now their eyes follow
     the path taken by the long-gone wrecking ball.
                               FRED
               Oh boy.    Goodbye pension fund --
     They rush for the office building.

69   INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY                                     69
     Dust is still settling. The staff rises from the mess,
     coughing. Lava rummages in the debris, finds a stiff
     body.
                             LAVA
               Uncle, Uncle, speak to me --
     But it's only a statue of a golfer from one of Slate's
     trophies.

               I'm over here, you moron -- and
               don't call me 'Uncle'!

     Slate's eyes fall on Fred's car hood, swinging from a
     bookshelf. He reaches for it -- pulls it -- it stays
     put, and only releases a new deluge of rubble and plaster
     which reburies him. At the same time, the door slams
     open and Fred, Barney and the other workers tumble inside.

     wrecking ball amidst the model buildings. As we watch,
     the last remaining little HIGH RISE FALLS.

     Slate staggers to his feet, seething with fury. He
     finally yanks the car hood free. It bounces and VIBRATES
     in his hands like a hand saw.

     falls on Fred's foot. Fred starts to scream and Piltdown
     shoves a pencil holder into his mouth.

                         (waving a hand)
                  Well, Madame Slate, as you can see,
                  we remain ze creme de la creme in
                  the croissant of life known as
                  Bedrock. Now, your leetle gran'

                  no?

                  Here is ze application for him. An'
                  mais oui, he weel participate in zee
                  annual talent show, naturalment?

     Mrs. Slate takes the parchment application. Meanwhile
     the Headmistress looks appraisingly at Wilma and Betty.
                                HEADMISTRESS
                  An' your friends perhaps would like

                         (amused)
                  Them? Oh, Marie, really, you don't
                  understand --

                                BETTY
                         (suddenly)
                  That's right, you don't understand.
                  My husband's business manager usually
                  handles this sort of thing, but I
                  don't mind.
     And to Wilma's astonishment, Betty takes one of the
     parchments.
                                BETTY
                  I know Bam-Bam --

                  in the talent show. Thank you oh
                  so much.

     She gives Mrs. Slate an even and controlled look, and
     sends some of it over in Wilma's direction as well.
     Wilma makes her choice, smiles tightly.

                                WILMA
                  Let me have one of those, too.   For

74   INT. CAR - FRED AND BARNEY - NIGHT                             74
     They're cruising along. Fred puffs on a cigar. Barney
     flips the pile of legal sized tablets in his lap. In the
     back seat are some boxes and bundles.
                                BARNEY
                  Gee, Fred, I don't believe it.
                  Eight hours ago I didn't have a
                  job and now look -- I got 1/2 of
                  one percent of the after-taxes
                  after-expenses net breakage profits
                  on Fibrerock!
                                FRED
                  Just be thankful I was there to go
                  over the fine print.
                         (full of himself)
                  It's like I told you this morning
                  -- There's something noble about a
                  man digging in with his hands and
                  doing an honest day's work. Once
                  you file those dreams under 'old
                  business' and put your nose to the
                  plow, well, the world is your
                  oyster. And was I right?
                                BARNEY
                  No, Fred, you weren't. I didn't
                  nose any grindstones and you didn't
                  shoulder a wheel. We just hung out
                  together and everything that
                  happened was a total accident.

                                FRED
                         (after a moment)
                  Details, Barney, details...
                         (smiling)
                  I just can't wait to see the girls'
                  faces when we tell 'em the news...
75   INT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT                                  75

     The girls' frowns are a great contrast to their husbands'
     smiles. Wilma's looking at the school enrollment forms.
     Betty paces, looks at the clock.

                  It's not like the boys to be so
                  late.

                  Unless they were forced to go
                  bowling again. Remember that time
                  a burglar pointed a gun at them
                  and said, 'go bowling right now'?

                                WILMA
                  Betty, sometimes you're a little

                  Do you have any idea of what the
                  enrollment fee is? And get this...
                  it's non-refundable --
                                BETTY
                  I know, I know! I just couldn't
                  stand that woman's attitude! But
                  we had to find a new school anyway,
                  and there we were... the next thing
                  I knew, I was in over my head...
                  but why did you jump in, too?

                                WILMA
                  Oh, she was getting to me too with
                  all that mastodon snort about her
                  little nephew... and...
                               BETTY
                  And?

                                WILMA
                  And... if a friend can't help you
                  do something stupid, who can?

     Betty smiles, touched.    Then reality intrudes again.
                                BETTY
                  What do we tell the boys?

                  sticking beside me during the
                  tough times, and well... for
                  making a little guy feel like he

     She closes her eyes, swings the enrollment forms over on
     the table so that Fred and Barney can read them.
     Fred and Barney look at them, look at each other... and

     The members are milling about the main room, schmoozing,
     drinking, kibitzing. All wear the furry and horned
     ceremonial Fez of the Buffalo.

     One wall of the lodge displays a big version of the lodge
     coat of arms (with the motto "Ackus Ackus Adackus" below);
     a trophy case holds a mind boggling display of various
     bowling trophies, balls and pins. At the lectern, the
     HERDMASTER (a mustachioed, inspirational type) bangs
     again for order.

                  Brothers, your attention!

     It quiets a bit. He clears his throat, raises his chin,
     and gives a strange mournful bellow.

                  old business?
     Barney stands, acknowledges his friends and Lodge
     brothers.
                                BARNEY
                  Indeed we do, Brother Herdmaster.
                  Tonight we are to hear speeches
                  from prospective candidates for
                  Lodge offices, such as good old
                  Fred and some other guys.

     Seated across the room with Pyrite and other cronies, he
     immediately leaps to his feet, paws the ground, and gives
     an eerie moan even stranger than the Herdmaster's earlier
     call to order.

     After the CRY ECHOES away:

                                HERDMASTER
                  Brother Piltdown: You have given
                  the Cry of the Gelded Buffalo at
                  the Poisoned Water Hole. Do you
                  wish to file an objection?

                                PILTDOWN
                  You bet I do. How come Flintstone
                  is 'good old Fred' and me and the
                  other candidates are just 'some
                  other guys'?
                                PYRITE
                  Yeah, how come?
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           41.

                         (rising)
                  My apologies, Brother Piltdown.
                  Allow me to rephrase. Tonight we
                  will hear speeches from a whole
                  bunch of good old guys...
                         (pause)
                  ... plus the one and only Fred
                  Flintstone!
     Cheers go up, which drown out Piltdown's renewed cry of
     the poisoned water hole. Fred moves towards the podium
     as the noise dies down.
81   NEW ANGLE                                                   81

     Barney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up
     tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant. He tacks it
     to the wall, yanks a string. It unrolls. It's a big
     "VOTE FOR FRED FLINTSTONE" poster.
     Barney turns, gives Fred a "thumbs up," and as he does,
     Barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his
     pocket. Barney pushes his way through the seats, catches
     up to Fred and hands him the document. Fred takes it,
     continues up to the podium. There, the Herdmaster hands
     Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each
     other like a Pharaoh's badges of office.

     Fred does a Papal-like wave with these, sets them down,
     and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him.

                  Brother Buffaloes, honored
                  Herdmaster, Junior Bucks and
                  Apprentice Antlers, a great good
                  evening to you all. Ahem. As you
                  know, our organization has survived
                  difficult times that have seen the
                  extinction of such other lodges as
                  the Order of Whooping Cranes and
                  Brotherhood of Giant Sloths. But
                  we here have come through the croo
                  ... the crux...

                  the future holds many promises and
                  many problems. As your next
                  Herdmaster, I would bring to you
                  the same determination, courage
                  and -- if I may say so -- bold
                  thinking that I have brought to
                  the workplace. Thank you, and
                  ack ack a-dack.
     Applause follows Fred's return to the floor.

82   PILTDOWN AND PYRITE                                          82

     The only ones in their row not clapping, they scowl as
     Fred passes them...

     WIDEN as Barney propels   a bowling ball (stone, of course)
     rumbling down the alley,   sending pins flying. The
     Buffaloes cheer Barney's   strike. We notice that most (if
     not all) of these Lodge   members also work at the quarry.

84   AUTOMATIC PIN SPOTTER                                        84
     It descends.    It consists of a bent snout creature which
     "cranks" down   a shelf with several monkeys on it. The
     monkeys grab   the pins with their tails, straighten them
     up. Then the    shelf cranks back up.
85   OTHER END OF ALLEY                                           85

     Now it's Fred's turn. He trots up to the line, bowls...
     another strike! More cheers, AD LIB complaints, etc.
     The scorekeeper picks up hammer and chisel and fills out
     the last frame.
                                LODGE MEMBER
                  Congratulations, Fred.

                  Hey, when you're hot you're hot...
                  boys, lemme buy a round of drinks
                  for everyone.

                                BARNEY
                  Thanks, Fred, but here at the
                  lodge drinks are free.

                  But the principle is the same,
                  Barn. Don't forget that.
     Fred leads the group over to the bar. Piltdown and
     Pyrite come along with a shrug... why not, for a brew?
     Fred reaches --

86   UNDER THE COUNTER                                            86
     where he pulls out a hook-beaked little LIZARD --

     Fred uses this creature to open several beers.

                         (during this)

                  Go ahead, laugh. If I had a good
                  orthodontist, my life woulda been
                  different...
     Fred tosses the "Opener" aside --

     The critter bounces into the shelf, slides... when it re-
     covers, it realizes that its overbite has been straightened
     out by the impact. Very happy, it grabs a hat and coat,
     exits.

     It's actually "dots" chipped into a stone. It shows the
     young Fred, Barney and others gathered around soapbox
     racers. A banner reads "Junior Buffalo Day."

               dream of leading.

               Fred, what was all that stuff in
               your speech about the workplace?
               I thought the only decision you
               made there was how many lunches to
               eat --
     Laughter. Fred accepts it good-naturedly, reaches into
     his pocket.
                             FRED
               Well, Harry, it just so happens
               that old Fred is moving up in the
               world... Boys, you're looking at
               Mr. Slate's new partner.

                             PILTDOWN
               You and Slate? Who are you
               kidding, Flintstone? The only
               partner you got is hanging over
               your belt.
     Pyrite laughs, a bit too much.

                             FRED
               Prepare to eat those words,
               Piltdown.

                      (to the others)
               Yes, boys, you see, I went up to
               my pal, Mister Slate and single-
               handedly made him an offer he
               couldn't refuse --

     Fred pulls Barney into a quiet corridor. They stand near
     a trophy case. There's some bowling trophies here with
     a variety of names on them. (There's also trophies for
     "pie-eating contests" and "beer drinking chug-offs";
     these have only Fred's name on them.)

                               BARNEY
                 Fred... what's this single-handed
                 stuff? I distinctly remember at
                 least four hands and two of them
                 were mine.

                               FRED
                        (lowered voice)
                 Barney, we could tell everyone how
                 you invented this Fibrerock stuff,
                 how Slate and Lava found out about
                 it by accident and all, but what
                 would that be?
                              BARNEY
                 The truth?
                               FRED
                 This is big business, Barney. We
                 can't start telling the truth,
                 it'd create the wrong impression.
                 Think about all the really big
                 deals in history -- back to the
                 beginning of recorded time.
     Barney knits his brow in thought for maybe three seconds.
                              BARNEY
                 Okay.
                                FRED
                 What do they all have in common?
                        (as Barney is
                          stumped)
                 I'll tell you. A front man. A
                 guy who's out in the public eye
                 running the point, fighting the
                 crowds... and meanwhile... back
                 in the corner is the silent
                 partner.

                               BARNEY
                 I never knew that.

                               FRED
                 That's because the silent partner
                 is always silent.

                  I'm out here running the guts of
                  the operation but you got a cut.
                  It looks like my mind, but you're

                  I get it. I got the brains, but

     Barney comes out of his front door, heads toward the
     neighboring driveway and Fred's car. Betty comes out,
     calls to her husband.

     He stops, turns. Betty comes over and we see he's wear-
     ing a sports jacket and an abysmally-tied tie. Betty
     fixes the knot.
                                BETTY
                  There. That looks more like a

                  Thanks, Betty. What would I do

                                BETTY
                  Hmm. Probably run off to the

     He returns to her, opens the pail, is surprised to find
     it's empty. Before he can comment, she smilingly
     presents him with a spanking new briefcase. "F.F" is
     embossed on it in gold.

     He opens it.    Inside is a huge drumstick and some ribs.

                   You know, for that Fibrerock
                   stuff of Flintstone and Rubble's.

                Piltdown, this Fibrerock program
                is going to create a lot of
                changes around the plant. I want
                to make one more. You've been a
                wonderful thug and goon for me.
                Now, I'd like to expand your
                duties. I want you to become a
                provocateur.

                you to double-cross your Lodge and
                Union brothers, and make their
                lives a living hell.

                             PILTDOWN
                Oh, okay.

                Good. You and your little pal
                will report directly to me and
                take orders only from me.

      Now, accompanied by heroic "industrial"-type MUSIC, we
      see the Fibrerock assembly line in full operation.

      This cannot be described    now with appropriate justice,
      but it involves a series    of animal-powered conveyor
      belts, Rube Goldberg-like    funnels, spouts and chutes,
      and all sorts of gadgets,    gizmos, bells and whistles,
      to wit:

      At one end of the building, dino-powered dumpsters and
      lifters drop off all the ingredients; these get stomped/
      chewed/bashed and otherwise reduced to powder, which is
      then (courtesy of some squirting Mastodans) mixed with
      water into a foam, which bubbles through a long sawmill-
      type trough and is held back by a gate.

      Meanwhile, we see a sample item (in this case, a stone
      sofa) as it is placed before two "goatasauruses" which
      butt heads and smash the sofa between the two halves of
      a clay mold. When the mold is opened and the sofa tossed
      aside, Barney appears and personally "aims" the foam
      trough at a funnel in the top of the mold. Pausing to
      "taste" the mix, he smiles, then shouts --

      Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough.     "Fibrefoam"
      pours into the mold.
107   THE CLAY MOLD                                                 107
      gets "winched" unpwards by monkeys, and then an alliga-
      torsaurus whaps it with its tail.
108   BELOW                                                         108
      Presto! A Fibrerock copy     of the stone sofa drops neatly
      out of the mold, bounces    lightly on the conveyor belt
      below! It sparkles with     the tell-tale celadon-green
      shimmer of Fibrerock. As     it chugs along, the process
      repeats, and soon a score    of identical sofas is in view.

109   END OF ASSEMBLY LINE                                          109
      as a beaming Fred watches, workers easily stack the
      Fibrerock sofas (often one-handed). Nearby, we see
      Fibrerock window frames, doors, chairs, etc.
110   UP ANGLE - SLATE'S OFFICE BALCONY                             110

      Slate and Lava watch the progress, dollar signs in their
      eyes.

      Fibrerock products are stacked up everywhere, stretching
      away like the inventory in Charles Foster Kane's
      warehouse.
      We see everything from Fibrerock bricks to Fibrerock
      table lamps to Fibrerock toilets. MUSIC OUT.

      Fred and Barney, weary, approach each other, shake hands
      as they view the day's incredible output. Other weary,
      but proud workers gather around them: Mr. Slate is about
      to address them from his office balcony.
                              SLATE
                Men, this is a proud day for Slate
                Construction. You have seen the
                first pieces of Fibrerock roll
                off the assembly line and into
                history... a history you are all
                part of... thanks to your very
                own fellow worker, Fred Flintstone!

                No longer will man and beast bend
                under the backbreaking load of
                stone and rock and timber...
                because Fibrerock is so light
                that even a child can handle it.
                       (pause)
                That's why on Monday we're going
                to hire two dozen children from
                Bedrock Technical Junior High.
                They'll be replacing the 36
                heavy equipment operators, 15
                shaft diggers and 22 laborers
                we're laying off today. Your
                pink slips will be in your final
                pay envelopes along with a ticket
                to the grand opening of Slate
                City. It's non-transferable,
                so hang on to it. Thank you, and
                have a nice weekend.

      anyone.

116   INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY                                    116

      Slate is practicing    hitting golf balls into an automatic
      putting cup. Lava     and some office workers are checking
      a blueprint against    a model of "Slate City" which is made
      out of Fibrerock.     A ball shoots back at Slate, who tees
      up again.
117   INSIDE THE PUTTING CUP                                       117
      A little MOUSE in a complete hockey outfit jumps to catch
      the ball. Stopping it with his little hockey stick, the
      Mouse gasps, raises its hockey mask.
                                  MOUSE
                   Whew.   And it's still pre-season.
      He whaps the ball to Slate again.


118   BACK TO SCENE                                                118
      Slate tees up the ball again. Fred barges in, banging
      the door. Startled, Slate drives the ball instead of
      putting it. It sails across the room and SHATTERS a
      PICTURE of Mrs. Slate.

                          (undeterred)
                   Mr. Slate -- we gotta talk --
                                  SLATE
                   We do, eh?   About what?

                                 FRED
                   About those guys outside, Mr.
                   Slate. Some of 'em, well, they
                   been here for years. And you,
                   well, you can't lay them off just
                   like --
                          (snapping fingers)
                   -- that!

      Slate looks at Lava, who shrugs. Slate looks back at
      Fred, stays surprisingly calm. He toys with the putter,
      balances it on his palm.
                                 SLATE
                   Of course I can, Fred. I can lay
                   them off like --
                          (snapping fingers)
                   -- that, or like --
                          (a different style
                           snap)
                   -- that, or like --

      He does a really nifty snap which combines with a buck-
      and-wing with the putter.
                                 SLATE
                   -- that.
                                 FRED
                          (bravura slipping)
                   Oh, you can, huh?
                                 LAVA
                   Of course he can, Flintstone.
                   It's his quarry.
                                 SLATE
                          (still calm, warm)
                   That's right. Why --
                          (chuckling)
                   I could lock the front door and go
                   fishing if I wanted!

      Lava laughs along with the office staff and Slate.      Fred
      chuckles a little to fit in.

                   Why, I could even fire Lava here

      Lava quivers with mock surprise.     Everyone really laughs,
      now.

                          (wiping away a tear)
                   I could fire you, Fred.

                   Slate, that's --
      Suddenly Fred stops laughing.
                                 SLATE
                   Flintstone, Lava, here,
                   recommended that you be in charge
                   of public relations to get
                   Fibrerock off to a good start.
                   I'm a member of that public,
                   Flintstone, and I have to say...
                   this isn't a good start. I'm
                   getting a bad feeling about
                   Fibrerock. A bad feeling about...
                   you. You want that feeling to go
                   away, don't you?
                                 FRED
                   Uh... well, gee, I... uh, yeah.
                                 SLATE
                   Good. Then turn around and walk
                   out of here and we'll forget all
                   about this.

      Fred swallows, looks at Lava, goes meekly out.

      Pebbles turns, the decision made.

                                PEBBLES
                   Okay. We're gonna sing a song
                   with Dino.
      Instantly, on cue, Dino leaps out of nowhere, holding a
      straw hat and a cane.
      Wilma and Betty look at each other, skeptical. Bam-Bam
      reaches into his shirt and takes out a whistle. He blows
      it --
                                 PEBBLES

      MUSIC comes UP and Dino and his little friends do a dance
      routine we will call "The Dino Dance." It is a spectac-
      ular blend of soft-shoe and the kind of dog-and-pony-show
      gags usually seen in the circus or on the Ed Sullivrock
      show. Most importantly, the routine includes the
      following:

      A)    Dino leaps back and forth through a hoop.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

      B)   The kids tie down a jump rope and Dino does a wire
           walk.

      C)   And finally, Dino uses his tail to flip the kids onto
           his back, culminating in a big "ta-da" after they all
           slide down the rope for a big finish.

                   The Igneous Rock!
      Panting for breath, Pebbles, Bam-Bam and Dino wait for a
      reaction.
                                 BETTY
                          (to Wilma, impressed)

                   I think they're ready for Rock

      Pause as Fred waits for a reply. He turns... SHOT WIDENS
      as he realizes no one is sitting near him. He looks
      around and sees --
126   HIS POV - FRED'S POSTER                                        126

      It's been altered to read "Fred Finkstone." Also added
      to Fred's image are horns, a beard and other choice
      touches.
127   BACK TO SCENE                                                  127

      Fred looks around, sees Barney approaching, having just
      left a group of angry Buffalo.

                                 FRED
                   Barn -- w-what's going on?
                                 BARNEY
                   They're mad at you, Fred... it's
                   understandable, I mean, they all
                   got laid off today --
      Fred crosses to the other guys, puts on a big smile.
                                 FRED
                   Guys, guys, come on now -- what's a
                   quarry fulla layoffs got to do with
                   a lodge fulla Buffaloes?

                   Is that a riddle? Give me a

                   -- You mean used to work for him --
                   until somebody opened their big
                   mouth --

                   Fellas, come on. We're all big
                   boys here --
      He gestures vaguely towards the outside world, then back
      to the little band of brothers here.

                                 FRED
                   Surely we can separate in our minds
                   work, and play... Job, and Lodge...

                   please, one second -- !
      Fred grabs Barney by the shoulder, spins him around,
      pushes him forward like a refrigerator on a dolly, stands
      him up center stage.
                                 FRED
                   Barney, you gotta tell the other
                   guys what really happened. Tell
                   'em the story behind Fibrerock.
                   The true story.
      The room quiets.    Barney clears his throat.     Fred waits,
      hopeful.
                                 BARNEY
                   Well, there's not much to tell.
                          (trying to remember
                           Fred's phraseology)
                   True, I got a cut... but Fred's
                   got a gut.

                                 FRED
                   No, no, the rest --!

                                 BARNEY
                   Oh, yeah, I remember! I got the
                   mind, but Fred's got the behind.
                   Right, Fred?

      Barney turns, gives Fred a big wink.    Fred groans.
                                 HERDMASTER
                   Thank you, Brother Rubble. The

      The room ECHOES with MOOSE-LIKE SNORTS.

                   All for Flintstone, bellow now!

      Fred snorts, sounding like Herb Alpert's lonely bull.
      Even under his furry fez we see him "looking around"
      desperately, hoping to hear one more snort.
      He kind of sneaks in one more forlorn grunt which fades
      away... finally, as Fred squirms miserably, there is one
      more lonely snort...
      ... from Barney, of course.
                                   HERDMASTER
                   Order furs!
      The fezzes come up.
                                 HERDMASTER
                   The snorts have it! Brother
                   Piltdown, it is my privilege to
                   install you as the new Exalted
                   Herdmaster Erect Antler and Big
                   Buck of our Lodge. If you'll come
                   forward, I will present you with
                   the tokens of office.
      Cheers and applause as Piltdown goes to the podium.

128   FAVORING FRED AND BARNEY                                       128
      Fred's a broken man.       Barney moves over, puts his arm
      around him.

                                 BARNEY
                   I voted for you, Fred.

                   Big deal, after you screwed
                   everything up in the first
                   place...!
      Barney reacts, really hurt. He moves away on the bench.
      Fred's so agitated he doesn't even realize it.

      smiles at the group.

                              PILTDOWN
                Thank you, Brother Chairman.
                Fellow Buffaloes, I'm a man of few
                words. It's no secret that most
                of our lodge members are also
                members of Amalgamated Neolithic
                101... which means that most of us
                aren't gonna be able to make our
                cave payments next month. So my
                agenda for tonight... ends right
                now. There's a time to be a
                Buffalo... there's a time ta be a
                brown nosin' double-crossin'
                creep...
      All heads turn and swivel to look at Fred... swivel back.
                              PILTDOWN
                ... and there's a time to stand up
                and be a man! So let's go down
                there and make the Slate shop into
                slate scrap... then we'll see how
                he gets along without the heavy
                equipment operators of Neolithic
                101! Meeting adjourned!

      With angry grumbles and threats, the meeting breaks up.
      Fezzes are thrown into cubby holes and hard hats are
      slapped on. The Buffalo run out.
      When the dust clears, we see that only one member has
      avoided the herding instinct: Barney.
      Now, he turns, runs into --

130   BUFFALO LODGE - RECREATION AREA - NIGHT                    130
      Fred is at the bar, opening a beer. He looks wistfully
      at the old, framed picture on the wall -- reacts as he
      sees --
131   PICTURE                                                    131

      Even his childhood shot has been defaced.
132   BACK TO SCENE                                              132

      He sets his jaw with a "screw 'em" expression, downs his
      beer. Then Barney runs up, shakes him by the shoulders.

                   No, no, not that! Piltdown's got
                   the guys all worked up and they're
                   heading down to the quarry!

                   No, Fred, if they do that they'll
                   be breakin' the law! Our brother
                   Buffalo could go to jail!

      mob. Quickly, they go to the gate, climb up and over it!

      AD LIB angry cheers, and the mob storms into the plant,
      knocking aside equipment and supplies.

134   IN CAR - FRED AND BARNEY - NIGHT                              134
      Both pedaling like mad.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                 FRED
                   I don't believe this... how did
                   things ever get this out of
                   hand -- ?
                                 BARNEY
                   I know. Makes you wish things
                   were back the way they were...
                   before we was big executives.
                                 FRED
                   Well, I wouldn't go that far...
      Suddenly they're interrupted by the sound of a SIREN.
      Fred looks back and sees --

135   FELDSPAR AND GRAVEL                                            135
      Coming up from rear. Feldspar grabs his megaphone as he
      pulls abreast of Fred.
                                  FELDSPAR
                   Flintstone!   Pull over!

                                 FRED
                   Oh, no, not now...
      Feldspar signals Fred onto the shoulder.       Fred smiles,
      nods...
136   CLOSE ON FRED'S FEET                                           136
      He slams them down through the floorboard --

137   WIDER                                                          137
      Fred's CAR SKIDS, spins out, whirling around like a
      record on a turntable. It jerks to a halt 180 degrees
      later, and then ROARS off in the opposite direction.
138   FELDSPAR                                                       138

      So astonished he follows this action with his head... a
      bad move because --

                                  GRAVEL
                   Sarge!   Look out -- !

      The patrol CAR runs off the road, CRASHING into a stone
      fire hydrant. Water squirts into the air. Feldspar and
      Gravel are drenched. They're just coming to their senses
      when the ground heaves -- the car's front wheels rise --

                                                               67.

      As we see that the water spout is actually coming from
      the blowhole of a whale which now sticks a bit of its
      head up from under the broken curb.
                                WHALE
                  I'm gonna sue you for everything
                  you got --

141   SLATE QUARRY - NIGHT                                           141

      Led by Piltdown, the workers have grabbed a big timber
      which they're using like a battering ram on the doors of
      the assembly line building. Suddenly, with a crash, the
      doors go down! Piltdown and Pyrite stand back while the
      angry workers rush past them.
                                PILTDOWN
                         (loudly)
                  Now we'll show 'em who's boss!
                                PYRITE
                  They can't push us around!
      Piltdown and Pyrite smash a few items to get everybody
      juiced up, and then... when no one is looking...
      ... they slip out the back!
142   REAR OF QUARRY - NIGHT                                         142
      Fred pulls into the lot, slams his feet down to stop --
      we hear SKIDDING -- they fishtail all over, slam right
      through a storage area for crates and barrels which
      collapse all around them.

      Finally they slam broadside into the main Quarry build-
      ing, knocking a hole in the wall.
143   NEW ANGLE                                                      143

      Fred and Barney cough in the rising dust. Neither one of
      them sees what we see, which is that visible in the hole
      in the wall is the Slate Company's granite-doored safe...

      ... and right beside it is the Xenosaurus, which now
      jumps up, startled, dropping a crowbar and a big hand
      drill.

      Recovering its composure, the Xenosaurus grabs up the
      tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away,
      vanishing just as our heroes stir.

                          (double-taking)
                   Barn! Did you see that -- ?
                          (peering through
                           the dust)
                   -- Huh, now it's gone... I
                   coulda sworn...

                                   BARNEY
                   Come on Fred.    Time to earn those
                   big bucks.

      They rush into the plant.
144   INT. ASSEMBLY LINE - NIGHT                                  144

      As the workers continue their rampage, Piltdown and
      Pyrite reappear.
                                 PYRITE
                   Darn that Flintstone and Rubble...
                   they're gonna screw everything
                   up...

                                 PILTDOWN
                   Not if we give 'em a nice long
                   vacation... in the hospital.
      Saying this, he grips tightly on a wrench. Then some
      rampaging workers rush by. Piltdown gives them an encour-
      aging cheer, and then he and Pyrite lead them up some
      stairs to the assembly line catwalk. There, Pyrite
      begins SMASHING some LIGHT FIXTURES with a club, while
      Piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams
      which he flings below.
145   CLOSE - PYRITE                                              145

      Winds up for another   baseball-type swing -- but as he
      follows through, the   ball-shaped light fixture jerks up
      on its cable. Unable    to stop in time, Pyrite spins
      around, falls on his   ass.
      Barney drops down INTO VIEW, hanging horizontally from
      the rafters. He's holding the light fixture with his
      free hand.

                                 BARNEY
                   Stee-rike one! Heh-hey.    Ready
                   for a curve ball?

      Pyrite doesn't have a sense of humor; club in hand,
      he jumps up, starts chasing Barney through the rafters.

                                                             69.

146   PILTDOWN                                                     146
      Spits on his hand, grabs another big beam. He pulls down
      on it... but it doesn't snap, it goes right up again.
      Puzzled, he pulls down on it again... there's another
      see-saw motion...
      ... This time Piltdown goes with the flow, pushes up and
      peers under the beam...

      Fred is hanging on the other end.

                                FRED
                  Brother Piltdown... can we talk
                  about this, antler to antler?

      Piltdown roars, begins slamming the girder up and down.
                                 FRED
                  Guess not...
      Fred inches down the shuddering beam, jumps off. Freed
      of Fred's weight, the other end "BOINGS" down on
      Piltdown's head. He groans, recovers in time to chase
      after Fred.
148   BARNEY AND PYRITE                                            148
      Square off in the rafters.
                                BARNEY
                  Give me your best shot.
      Pyrite swings. Barney ducks and Pyrite SMASHES a WINDOW
      pane. Barney dodges again and the same thing happens.
      Getting cocky, Barney does it one more time...

      ... but this time the window is hinged in the center and
      the swivel action after the hit whaps Barney on the back
      and knocks him into Pyrite's next blow.

149   FRED                                                         149
      Is backpedaling away from Piltdown on the upper super-
      structure of the assembly line. Fred scrapes one foot in
      an arc in front of him.

                                FRED
                  Dare you to cross that line.

      Piltdown crosses it.

                                 FRED
                  That line.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                          70.

      Piltdown crosses it. Fred "marks" another one. Piltdown
      doesn't even wait for the challenge, takes a giant step.
      Oops. Bad idea: The last "line" was at the edge of a
      straight drop! Piltdown yelps, "treads air" in the best
      cartoon manner -- and then desperately grabs a handful of
      Fred's clothing! Both men fall -- at the last minute
      Piltdown catches a ladder!

150   BELOW - ASSEMBLY LINE                                      150
      Fred lands with a thud right in the clay mold used to
      form the Fibre products! Worse, the impact arouses the
      goatasauruses out of their sleep. Dutifully, they rise,
      and then ram both sides of the mold just as Fred is
      struggling to his feet! Fred's yell is muffled by the
      clay.

151   OTHER ASSEMBLY LINE ANIMALS                                151
      Aroused by the "start up" of the assembly line, they do
      their job. Fibre foam begins to chug down the trough:
      The alligator crane picks up the mold, shakes it.
152   FRED                                                       152
      is flung to the conveyor belt, stiffly caked in clay.
153   THE FIBRE MOLD                                             153

      shudders -- and shakes out a Fibre statue of... Fred!
154   BELOW                                                      154
      The real Fred, moving stiffly like a robot, is getting
      to his feet when his Fibre doppleganger slams him to the
      mat again! A moment later, another "Fred" drops down
      beside him.

155   PILTDOWN                                                   155
      Has descended the ladder, hopping mad. Now, he sees
      Fred coming toward him... Piltdown breaks a big lever off
      the equipment, swings -- reacts astonished as "FRED"
      SHATTERS.

156   FRED                                                       156

      Back down the line, he's seen this. His clay-caked
      Adam's apple gulps. Quickly, he turns and tries to
      "tip-toe" away -- then, with a CREAK and CRUNCH -- the
      clay and Fibre all over him solidifies! Desperate, he
      tries to move... can't!

                                                             71.

      Watches, confused, as dozens of Fred Flintstones chug
      towards him on the belt. He shrugs, smashes the next
      one in line. Another phoney. He smashes the next one...
                                                   CUT TO:

      Dodging Pyrite's renewed attack. Now, Barney becomes
      aware of the activated assembly line. Getting an idea,
      he moves behind an inspection table, grabs a big rubber
      stamp.
      Pyrite comes around the    corner... Barney's head butts him
      in the gut, dodges under    his legs! Then, as Pyrite
      stumbles, Barney stamps    his ass with the word "REJECT."
      Pyrite looks back, sees    this, reddens... raises his club.
                               PYRITE
                 Reject, huh? Whaddya say we
                 reject your head?
      He raises the club... when an alligator swings down and
      grabs him by the seat of his pants! Pyrite drops the
      club, howls --
159   WIDER                                                        159
      The alligator crane swings him away and over a big bin
      marked REJECTS -- and drops him.
      Howling, Pyrite falls into a big bin of broken and
      defective Fibrerock goods.

160   BARNEY                                                       160
      Chuckles to himself... and then looks down, reacts.
      CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet
      another of the duplicate Freds.
      Worried, Barney looks around, sees that he's just above
      the Fibrefoam chute. Without another thought, he jumps
      into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the
      Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride --

161   BELOW                                                        161

      Piltdown is about to swing at the real Fred -- when
      Barney sails out of the end of the chute and slams into
      him and Fred! All three of them roll across the floor
      towards --

                                                               72.

162   THE END OF THE BUILDING                                        162
      where a squad of policemen has just appeared -- led by a
      dripping wet Feldspar and Gravel!

                               FELDSPAR
                All right!   You're all under arr --

      Wham! Barney, Fred and Piltdown roll right into the
      cops, who go flying like (what else?) tenpins, complete
      with appropriate sound.
                              BARNEY
                       (sitting up)
                Whattya know. Even got the spare
                again...

      Then he gasps as he looks over at Fred, whose head has
      just fallen off!
      Pause. Fred's real head slowly pokes up out of the clay
      and Fibre shoulders. Before he can extricate himself
      further, Feldspar and his men are dragging them out of
      the building.

      Wooden bars delineate the holding cells. "Wanted"
      posters of stone are hanging on the walls.
      As we watch, the contrite buffalos are bailed out by
      friends and relations. Wilma and Betty are just now
      clunking down stone money on the night sergeant's desk.

                   I don't wanna talk about it.
                   Besides, who cares about a bunch
                   of jerks running around with furs
                   on their heads? I'm more of a
                   country club guy myself anyway...

      He goes out, hardly looking at Barney. Wilma and Betty
      look at each other, mystified... then Wilma follows Fred
      out, puzzled.

164   EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT                                   164
      Lava stands in the shadows beside his Porscherock.
      Piltdown and Pyrite are with him. In the b.g., Fred and
      Wilma drive away.

                   A simple little heist -- I gave
                   you everything but the keys and
                   you blew it --

                   break in and create a distraction,
                   didn't we? Who knew Flintstone
                   and Rubble would show up, too?
                                 LAVA
                   The day after Slate City opens
                   there's going to be an audit. If
                   the stuff isn't gone by then we'll
                   all be doing time until the
                   Bronze Age.

                   Don't worry, Mister Lava... we're
                   on top of it.
      They both turn and start down an alley... jamming
      together as they do. Lava sighs... then jumps as Barney
      comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder.
                                 BARNEY

                   Yup. See, ever since I started
                   with Fibrerock -- I mean, since
                   me and Fred started with it, I
                   always take a little taste of the
                   Fibre foam. And tonight's batch,
                   well... I didn't get much of it,
                   but it seems a little off.

                   Can't fool the old taste buds,

                   an ingredient missing. So
                   tomorrow, I'll run a couple of
                   tests and stuff --

      He puts his arm around Barney, leads him towards the

165   INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY                                  165
      Slate and Lava are examining a newer and larger model of
      Slate City. It's even more grandiose than its
      predecessor. Now the housing development has two huge
      office buildings beside it, and then a convention center
      beyond that.

                              LAVA
                ... As you can see, the Fibrerock
                is so light we're using it for
                construction, for furnishings...
                for everything. You can't stack
                a two-bedroom cave this high...
                but the sky's the limit with

                they... they practically scrape
                the sky! We should call them...
                Slate scrapers!

                That's brilliant, Unc... Mister

      Slate's so busy admiring his moment to himself he hardly
      listens to what Lava's saying, just runs his stylus
      through the wet clay of the statements, meanwhile
      "framing" the model city in his hands.

      Lava breaks off.    He's just looked out the window and
      seen --

166   LAVA'S POV - QUARRY BELOW WINDOW                             166
      A small figure appears behind some of the equipment,
      tiptoeing from console to cabinet and thus towards
      the assembly line.
      Wearing sunglasses with attached nose and a hook-on
      beard, it at first appears to be some sort of bizarre
      hermit or bum... and then we realize, hey, this is
      Barney!

      Looks around, spots Piltdown and Pyrite, now resplendent
      in security guard uniforms. Lava whistles softly to get
      their attention, can't. Then he sees one of Slate's
      golf trophies. He shrugs, throws it.

      Reacts as the trophy bounces off his head, then looks up
      to see Lava gesticulating. Piltdown nods, grabs Pyrite
      in tow.

      Looking around carefully, Barney takes out a Thermos
      bottle, unscrews the top, and quickly dunks it into the
      Fibrerock foam. Then he tiptoes O.S., right into the
      massive bulk of --

      drops and SHATTERS, drag him O.S. --

      across each other and ignite.

                You're too kind, Flintstone,
                that's what I like about you.
                But you're a big guy with a big
                decision to make. Are you gonna
                keep covering for Barney, keep
                pulling his acornsauruses out of
                the fire... or are you going to

      Lava throws the door open.        Fred's jaw drops as he
      sees --

                   R-rockin' Leach?
      Indeed, it is he, and he smiles, extends his hands.

      Three big dino-mounted trucks are parked in front. You
      have to read the words on all three: "ROCKSTYLES OF..."
      "THE RICH..." "AND FAMOUS."

      Technicians roll out gear, set up big spotlights, etc.

      Rockin' Leach is surveying the place with an aide. Fred
      and Wilma are with them. Leach makes a "frame" with his
      hands, "pans" the area.

                   Hmm. Lovely little guest 'ouse,
                   Mister Flintstone. So simple,
                   so ordinary, so unexceptional...
                   why, h'it's almost quaint. Let's
                   say we start with the camera 'ere,
                   except...

      Leach breaks off, looks over the fence at the Rubble
      homestead. He shakes his head sadly.

                                 FRED
                   W-what's wrong?
                                 LEACH
                   Well, just look at that yard over
                   there... barbecues and trikes, not
                   exactly the right image...
                                 FRED
                          (pointing)
                   Maybe you could move those plants
                   to block them out...?

                                 LEACH
                   Good idea. Rodney, get 'hoppin'
                   with those greens.
      The aide nods, gathers some workers. They start moving
      the potted plants. Puzzled, Wilma comes over.
                                 WILMA
                   Fred, this was supposed to be a
                   'typical evening' at the
                   Flintstones, and you invited fifty
                   people I don't even know. Now
                   what's going on? Where are they
                   taking my ficus-sauruses?
                                 FRED
                   It's the Rubble yard, Wilma.   It's
                   just not the right image...
      He starts away, suddenly notices his own barbecue and
      trikes... quickly, without missing a stride, he tosses
      a tarp over them, slides a potted plant over for good
      measure.
179   BARNEY AND BETTY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                          179

      Betty, hair and face done, but still in a slip, is
      putting a reluctant Bam-Bam into a cute little blazer.
      In the f.g., Barney finishes tying a black tie, then
      struggles into a dinner jacket.

                   to this thing... after the way
                   Fred's been treating you lately --

                   Fred's in a high-powered
                   executive job, Betty. There's a
                   lot of pressure on him.
                                 BETTY
                   Yeah... and it's all around his
                   belt. If it wasn't for poor Wilma
                   I wouldn't give him the Geological
                   Time --

                                 BARNEY
                   Trust me, Betty. After the
                   Fibrerock debut, he'll be the same
                   old Fred.
      Both react to the sound of HAMMERING and SAWING.
      Curious, they go out the sliding bedroom door into the
      yard and see --
180   THEIR POV - THE FENCE                                          180
      The television crew has just finished nailing boards up
      over the top of the fence. Now the big potted plants
      are dropped into place. With each hammer stroke or thud
      a little more of the late afternoon sun is shut off
      until Barney and Betty are in shadow.
      Finally a canvas tarp is tossed as gracefully as pizza
      dough, sails into the Rubble yard and covers their bird
      bath. One last stray end lands on Barney's head.

      Inside each one, a little BIRD in hardhat and smoked
      visor lights up the arc, gets knocked on his butt when
      it catches.

                                 BIRD
                          (slowly getting up)

      He's squirming uncomfortably under the attentions of two
      crew members who are busy with scissors and combs and
      brushes.

      Finally, they're done and leave him.

      He has been cut and trimmed like a French poodle. He
      gets a glimpse of himself in the swimming pool and freaks
      out. Then he arches his back, shakes out the hairstyle.

      Barney and Betty appear, Bam-Bam in tow. They come out
      into the yard. Betty waves at Wilma, who comes over,
      whispers.
                              WILMA
                Thank heaven. There isn't one

                that some predict will
                revolutionize life in the future.
                Frederick, 'ow does it feel to
                know that you 'ave personally
                brought the Stone Age as we know
                it to a long-deserved end?

                       (very affected accent)
                Well, Rockin', you're right, I
                have affected destiny for all
                mankind, and it's a sobering
                thought. However, if I may add a
                personal note at this time, I
                myself cannot personally take
                all the credit for Fibrerock...

                                                   CUT TO:

192   EXT. SLATE CITY - NIGHT                                      192

      Slate City! In the far future, Manhattan will have New
      Jersey... Philadelphia will have Levittown... L.A. will
      have Burbank... but today Bedrock has... Slate City!
193   CLOSE ON "SLATE NEEDLE" AND FIBRESPHERE                      193
      Both decorated in pennants and bunting, connected to each
      other by a gangway six stories up. Block letters on the
      Fibresphere proclaim "Slate Construction brings you THE
      WONDERFUL WORLD OF FIBRE." A heroic statue of Slate
      himself stands close by the structures. (Sphere and
      needle, of course, are dead on parodies of the Trylon
      and Perisphere, centerpieces of the '39 World's Fair.)
      A limousine pedaled by two chauffeurs pulls up. Mr. and
      Mrs. Slate and Lava, and Lava's son, POINDEXTER, get out.
      It is immediately evident that the little obnoxious acorn
      hasn't fallen far from the tree.
                              POINDEXTER
                Wow! Is this ever keen! Dad, you
                promise I can cut in all the lines?
                              LAVA
                Of course, Poindexter, of course.
      They head for the mastodon    and pully-powered elevator.
      Standing there are Piltdown    and Pyrite, both in security
      guard uniforms. (Piltdown     is carrying a vaguely-familiar
      satchel). Lava gives them     a big look. They nod. As
      the elevator rises, his two    cronies duck into a stairwell
      marked "NO ADMITTANCE."

      We see Pebbles and Bam-Bam squirming uncomfortably in
      their party clothes. They take some canapes off of a
      table, take a bite... spit them out.
195   FRED                                                           195

      Stands beaming, nodding to his guests.

                                 FRED
                   Hello, hello. Bon soir. Good to
                   see ya... glad you could make it...

                                 GUEST
                          (unconvincingly)
                   Hello, Frank...

                                 FRED
                   Fred -- there's the bar, make
                   yourself at home -- mi casa es
                   votre casa, so, when in Rome and

                   Fred, can I talk to you -- ?
                   Fred? Fred?
                          (concerned)
                   We have a serious problem with
                   Betty and Barney.
                                 FRED
                          (alarmed)
                   You mean you can see their
                   house -- ?
                                 WILMA
                          (exasperated)
                   I mean you're treating them
                   horribly! What's come over you,
                   Fred? Does a little money mean so
                   much to you that you just turn
                   your back on the things that
                   really count?
                                 FRED
                   Wilma, I'm shocked. I wouldn't do
                   that. Okay, I admit it: I'm
                   trying to make an impression here,
                   I wanna look good, I wanna be a
                   success...

      He takes her hand, looks into her eyes.       For a moment,
      Wilma's face softens.

      She throws up her hands, stalks away.

                   What'd I say?

      Hangs up the sea shell phone, runs over to Leach.
                                 P.A.
                   That was our location guy at Slate
                   City. They just moved the ribbon
                   cutting up by an hour. Guests are
                   already starting to arrive.
                                 LEACH
                   Fabulous! I've 'ad enough crab meat
                   and crabgrass to last me a year.
                   All right, boys, that's a wrap!
197   FRED                                                           197
      In the middle of a tight little group which is pigging
      out. Fred seems oblivious to the fact that they're
      oblivious to him.

                                 FRED
                   ... Yas, yas, it's a challenging
                   commodity market these days.
                   Personally, I'm considering
                   petrified forests, but they do
                   say that volcano futures are
                   ready to explode, ha, ha...

      Suddenly Fred notices that his "audience" has evaporated.
      He looks around, sees everyone headed for their cars,
      the TV crew packing up, etc.
                                 FRED
                   ... Hey, whoa, what's happening --

                   Fred!
      He stumbles through the thinning crowd, clutching at
      elbows.

                                 FRED
                   Hey, what's the hurry? We got a
                   cake shaped like a piece of
                   Fibrerock... I got it, how about
                   some charades? No, even better,
                   twenty questions: 'Am I animal,
                   mineral, or fossil'...? Oh, I
                   heard a great one the other day
                   ... a guy walks in a bar with a
                   duckasaurus on his head and the
                   bartender says -- this'll kill
                   you, the bartender says --
      Fred stops, running out of steam along with his moment of
      glory. He stands alone on the lawn. Wilma slowly comes
      up to him.

                                 WILMA
                   Fred... I... I'm sorry it's not
                   working out...
      Fred turns, puts on a big smile.
                                 FRED
                   Whaddya mean, not working out?
                   They're goin' party hopping,
                   that's all. That's what ya do in
                   society, Wilma... you cruise
                   around. They'll go over to
                   Slate's shindig for a while,
                   then they'll come back here.

                   Nah, me and some of the guys from
                   the country club, we're gonna play
                   poker, yeah, big stakes poker
                   until everybody comes back. Go on
                   with the others. The kids got
                   their show to put on anyway... and
                   I wouldn't want people to think...
                   to think the Flintstones were
                   party poopers.

      She doesn't know what to say, or what she can say that
      won't shatter his shaky image. She sighs, kisses him,
      then calls out.

                                 WILMA
                   Come on, Pebbles. We're going to
                   another party.
                                 PEBBLES
                   Will there be real food there?
                                 WILMA
                   We'll find out together.
      She takes the girl's hand and goes to the door, where the
      last of Leach's crew is just going out. Suddenly Betty
      catches up to her, Bam-Bam in tow.

                                  BETTY
                   Wilma, wait.   I'm going with you.
                                  WILMA
                   Why?
                                 BETTY
                   If friends can't do something
                   stupid, who can?
      Wilma smiles, touched.

                                 BETTY
                   Besides...
                          (lowering her voice)
                   ... Maybe if we leave the boys
                   alone...?

      Wilma nods, hopeful.
198   EXT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT                                198

      The film crew caravan   is already leaving as Wilma, Betty
      and the kids get into   the Rubble car. The last TV crew-
      man extinguishes the   big spotlight. The house is dark,
      forlorn in the fading   twilight.

                                                            90.

199   REAR OF YARD - NIGHT                                        199
      Fred sits forlorn in the rubble of his party.   Dino comes
      over, nuzzles his leg.

                              FRED
                Just you and me now, Dino. Yeah.
                That's okay. Man and man's best
                friend.

      He gives Dino one of the canapes. Dino tastes it, makes
      a face, spits it out. DINO runs off, going "PTOOIE" all
      the way. We see him run to the corner, jump in Betty's
      car and drive away.
200   FRED                                                        200

      sighs, looks around, down at his blazer and the "FVF"
      patch. He suddenly rips it off in a fury. Then he looks
      at --
201   THE WALL IN FRONT OF BARNEY'S PROPERTY                      201
202   BACK TO SCENE                                               202
      Fred stares at it, his face slowly darkening. Then he
      grabs a lawn chair from the yard, begins to smash it in
      a fury against the divider. The wall cracks, splinters;
      the potted plants go flying.
203   FRED                                                        203
      His anger spent, he stands panting, splattered with
      dirt... then he sees --
204   NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER DIRT-COVERED FIGURE                     204
      -- standing in the ruins of the wall. The figure
      sneezes, whacks dirt off of itself. It's --

                          (wincing, but
                           taking it)
                   Barney... can... can you ever
                   forgive me for being such a jerk?

                                 BARNEY
                          (stepping closer)
                   Sure, Fred.
                          (smiling)
                   I've had lots of practice.
                                 FRED
                          (touched)
                   Aw, Barn...
      And he grabs Barney in a big bear hug. Tears in both
      their eyes, they slap each other on the back, two
      prehistoric sensitive guys.

205   FIBRESPHERE & SLATE NEEDLE - NIGHT                            205

      Little cupola cars are chugging around the upper level
      of the Fibresphere, where they enter a tunnel-like open-
      ing labeled "THE WORLD OF FIBRE."

      Wilma, Betty, the kids and Dino are in one of these.
      Now, we FOLLOW them as they chug into --

      The cupolas rattle along in Disneyland style, passing a
      sign which reads: "FIBREROCK--TRANSFORMING THE HOME."
      Here, mechanical figures in an all-Fibre home move
      klutzily around the room.

      REVEALING that behind the hollow shells of the human

      The CARS CHUG past a display of tree trunks, leaves,
      bubbling gunk... and those iridescent vegetable pearls
      we've come to know... coo-coo berries. Iron bars and
      vault-like doors separate the coo-coo berries from the
      other items.

                But does Fibrerock belong only in
                the kitchen, the garage, the
                workplace? No, no, no, my

      As each girl struts forward, she shrugs off a bulky
      animal fur and tosses it into a garbage can. Underneath
      are all kinds of daring and tantalizing fashions woven
      in the tell-tale fibre colors. The clothes are a blend
      of the future and retro (that is, prehistoric retro).

212   INT. BARNEY'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT                               212
      Fred and Barney are surrounded by books and cartons and
      memorabilia. They have their arms around each other and
      are singing.
                              FRED & BARNEY
                'Now it's time to do or die, grab

                fight, fight, fight for Bedrock
                High!'

      They break up laughing. Fred chuckles, looks at one of
      the many old photographs strewn around.
                              FRED
                Boy, those were the days, Barney.
                Bedrock High winning all those
                games... and you and me right in
                the middle of it.

213   NEW ANGLE - FAVORING PHOTO                                  213
      The photograph (dots in stone) shows the young Fred and
      Barney in their cheerleading costumes. Barney has a
      sweater and megaphone; Fred is in a Godzilla-like
      "mascot" costume. He's holding the hideously-sculpted
      head under his arm.

                              BARNEY
               Yeah.   Too bad we never made the
               team.
                             FRED
               So what? We made the team spirit.
               That's just as important...
               whatever happened to those
               cheerleader costumes?

                             BARNEY
               You know Betty. She never throws
               anything away.
      He hauls out an old footlocker, opens it.    There they
      are.
                               FRED
                        (rummaging in it)
               Boy.    Talk about memories.
      Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney, who grins,
      pulls it on. Fred also starts to get into his old
      "uniform," but has to suck his gut in mightily. Finally,
      he can zip it up, stern to stem.
                             FRED
               Back then, we thought a pop quiz
               was a big problem. We didn't
               know how good we had it. No
               problems, no worries...

      Saying this, Fred attempts to put on the Godzilla-like
      head. He has a hard time sliding it into a hinge rail
      behind his neck, an even harder time swinging it down and
      forward.
                             BARNEY
               Speaking of problems and worries,
               shouldn't we get on over to
               Slate's party?
      Fred has finally "clinked" the monster head down into
      place. Now, when he talks, the monster's mouth moves in
      sync.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                          (echo-y)
                   What for? So him and all his
                   fancy friends can look down their
                   noses at us?

      Completely covered in the ferocious-looking suit, Fred
      steps over to Barney, stabs an angry claw in his
      direction.
                                 FRED
                          (echo-y)
                   All they've been doing is using us,
                   Barney. And meanwhile --

      Now Fred reaches up to take the head off. It sticks for
      a moment. Finally he gets it to flip back on its hinge
      where it hangs behind his neck like a ski parka hood.
                                 FRED
                          (normal voice)
                   -- Meanwhile all the time they
                   were laughing at us.

                                  BARNEY
                   Yeah?   When did you notice that?
                                 FRED
                   About an hour ago.
                                 BARNEY
                   Boy, there's no fooling you, Fred.
      Suddenly, with a GROWING CREAKING, CRACKING and TINKLING,
      a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall
      apart.

      Fred and Barney look at each other, startled, then rush
      over to the model. It's the interim version we saw
      earlier.

      The decomposition continues, walls and supports turning
      into sand and running down before our eyes. In a Rube
      Goldberg-like continuum, the little houses go first,
      falling like dominoes...
                                 FRED
                   Wha... what's happening?

      Barney tries to stop the process, can't.

                   it's... it's decomposing... but
                   this shouldn't happen...

      Indeed, the older models from Barney's tinkering days
      are rock solid.
216   BACK TO SCENE                                                216

                                 BARNEY
                   It should be. There's enough
                   coo-coo berry resin in there to
                   petrify a brontosaurus --
      Suddenly Barney gets it. He looks from the older models
      to the now decomposing little Fibresphere with growing
      awareness.

                                 BARNEY

                                FRED
                   What's it?
                                 BARNEY
                   Remember I said the Fibrefoam
                   tasted funny? It was the coo-coo
                   sap that was missing!

                                 FRED
                   But.. why would --
                                 BARNEY
                   Why? Because coo-coo berries are
                   as valuable as goldrock! And
                   we've had tons of 'em delivered
                   to the plant since we started...
                   somebody musta got greedy --

                   Fred, that sap acts as a fixative

      With a final WHIMPER, the little FIBRESPHERE CAVES IN
      and then the nearby SLATE NEEDLE CRUMBLES, model story
      by model story. Finally the "DISK" on top of the needle
      is all that's left, wobbling around like a spun dinner
      plate. It finally falls... EXPLODES.

                   -- B-barney... what do we do?

      Barney runs to a locker, grabs a big plunger-powered
      flit gun, begins filling it with a red liquid.

                   our only chance -- their only
                   chance!
      Barney gives it a quick test squirt. Fred nods, and they

                   Uh... thank you... I think.

                          (looking into her
                           eyes)
                   Yes. I think so, too.
                          (smiling)
                   Imagine how good you'd look
                   with a senior executive.

                                  WILMA
                   Oh?   Is Fred getting promoted?
      Lava laughs, sure she's kidding... then not so sure. The
      ventriloquist finishes to scattered applause. The kid
      bows, gets up... splashes across puddles of water on the
      stage area. The Headmistress of L'ecole Superior et al
      steps up. Behind her, the picture window displays the
      expanse of Slate City: The twin Slatescrapers framing
      endless rows of little tract houses stretching to the
      distant volcanic ridge.
                                 HEADMISTRESS
                          (as applause dies)

      She gestures into the audience, where Mrs. Slate stands,
      waves a gloved hand like the Queen Mother.

      She steps aside. Curtain rises on little Poindexter.
      He is carrying a leather-and-bone accordion. He begins
      to play:

      Their smiles become fixed. (Up on the spotlights, the
      little birds who operate the lights put earplugs in their
      ears.)
      In the wings with Pebbles and Bam-Bam, DINO MOANS, hides
      his head under his paws.

      On the refreshment table, GLASSES CRACK... a cake falls.

      This one a pocket job. (Like Lava's, it's really a
      little sundial with a built-in burning match above it to
      provide a shadow!) We WIDEN, and see that this watch
      is held in a green, scaley claw.
221   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                221

      It's the xenosaurus, lurking behind the   exhibits! Now,
      the CREATURE GRUNTS confidently, lights   up a cigar.
      Then it picks up a canvas bag and a big   toolbox and
      tiptoes into the deeper recesses of the   Fibre ride.

      Fred and Barney rush along, Fred at the wheel.
                              FRED
                What'll we do when we get there?

                              BARNEY
                We just tell Mister Slate that all
                500 acres of his development are
                going to crumble into dust any
                minute.
                       (holds up the
                        flit gun)
                Then we zap the stairs and
                corridors with some of this
                coo-coo sap. I just hope we have
                enough to get everybody out --
                whoops!

      He's said this last because as he held up the flit gun,
      the handle whacked the back of Fred's monster costume,
      and the head has flipped down with a solid "clink."

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              100.

                           over the road)
                   -- I can't see straight --

      Barney gets up on his knees, grabs the wheel with one
      hand and the monster head with the other.
                                 BARNEY
                   Hang on, hang on --

      Oops. He rotates the head completely around. Fred
      flails around. Barney grabs the wheel with one hand,
      tries to help Fred with the other.

223   EXT. CAR - NIGHT                                               223
      It careens around even more wildly now.      There's several
      near collisions.
                                                    CUT TO:
224   EXT. "ROCKDONALD'S" RESTAURANT - NIGHT                         224
      "Rockdonald's" is, of course, complete with golden arches
      of stone, a drive-up window, etc. It even has the oblig-
      atory cops on a break... in this case, Feldspar and
      Gravel. They're sitting in their patrol car eating from
      little bamboo containers shaped just like McDonald's
      Styrofoam. (Of course, the logo on the building behind
      them proudly reads "OVER 100 SOLD.")
                                 FELDSPAR
                          (mouth full, bitching)
                   Speed traps again! Face it,
                   Gravel. I'm in a rut... and
                   meanwhile, the guys who went
                   through the academy with me,
                   they're all big shots now:
                   Sam Slate... Dirty Harock...
                   Magma, P.I. And you know why?
                   'Cause they got the breaks,
                   that's why!

      Suddenly both officers react to the sound of SKIDDING
      TIRES and HONKING HORNS. They look out their window
      at --
225   FRED AND BARNEY - DRIVING PAST                                 225

      both still battling the wheel and the resistant costume
      head. (By now their gyrations have put Barney's face
      inside the jaws of the monster mask.)

                                                            101.

                              GRAVEL
                S-sarge, d-did you see that? Some
                sorta creature was attacking that
                little guy -- !
                              FELDSPAR
                There's a lesson there, Gravel...
                never pick up hitchhikers.
                Besides --
                       (realizing)
                -- Did you say 'creature'?

      They do a big double-take at the now-vanishing car.
                              FELDSPAR & GRAVEL
                The xenosaurus!

      Excited, Feldspar bangs his dashboard and a DISPATCH
      PARAKEET in a police uniform pops INTO VIEW. Feldspar
      grabs it around the neck, holds it like a microphone.
                              FELDSPAR
                This is a xenosaurus alert.
                Repeat, a xenosaurus alert. The
                creature has been sighted on the
                Slate City exit of the Venturock
                Freeway! It is driving a brown
                late model sedan and eating a
                white male Caucasian. Car twelve
                is in hot pursuit.
      He releases the bird, which doesn't fly away right away,
      but gives him a look.

                              FELDSPAR
                       (remembering)
                Oh, yeay... over and out!

      The bird nods, appeased, flies off.
                              DISPATCH PARAKEET
                       (as it goes)
                Awwk! Car Twelve is on the way.
                Car Twelve is on the way...

                              FELDSPAR
                       (thrilled)
                Gravel, this could mean promotions
                for both of us!
                       (trotting up to
                        speed)
                Load the shotgun and turn on the
                siren!

                                                          102.

227   FRED'S CAR - TRAVELLING                                    227
      Barney is rocking Fred's head back and forth, finally
      gives it one last mighty yank. Something breaks.
      Barney falls back on the passenger side of the car.
      Fred drives with one hand, "raps" the monster head.
      It rattles. When Fred speaks again, the monster mouth
      no longer opens and closes in sync.

                              FRED
                       (muffled, shouting)
                Ho, gweat! Hoo bwoke hit,
                Bahnee! Hi khnat twalk hennymore!
      Suddenly both men (pardon, man and xenosaurus) react to
      an approaching SIREN. They both look back at --

228   FELSPAR'S PATROL CAR                                      228
      Closing in. Gravel has produced a little sabre tooth
      CAT and is "cranking" its tail. As it WAILS away, the
      cops close in on our heroes.
229   BACK TO SCENE                                             229

                What, and explain what you're
                doing in that costume? Start
                talking about coo-coo berries and
                Fibrerock? By then it'll be too
                late!
                              FRED
                'Hen yore height, yore height...
      Fred pours on more speed. They careen around a turn.
      CAMERA WHIP PANS TO a road sign: SLATE CITY--1 MI.

230   SLATE CITY - REAR GATE                                    230
      A fence surrounds the empty housing development; in the
      distance, we can see the dark Slate Scrapers, and past
      them, the brightly-lit and gleaming Fibersphere and
      Slate Needle.
      We hear a SCREECH and then the CAMERA PANS BACK to pickup
      Fred's CAR as it whips around a turn, two wheels off the
      ground. It crashes right into the gate, knocking down a
      sign reading "SLATE CITY--DELIVERY GATE." The fence
      collapses all around the car.

                                                             103.

      Fred and Barney stagger out of the wreck. Barney,
      covered with debris, rummages around and sighs with
      relief when he finds the flit gun of coo-coo sap is
      still intact.
                                BARNEY
                         (hearing a siren)
                  We'd better split up; that way at
                  least one of us can make it to the

                  'Ood hidea.   Ood whuk, ol' bhudee.
      They slap hands together like basketball players, then
      head off in two directions.

      CAMERA PANS the audience as the accordion recital con-
      tinues. Several people look visibly ill. Finally,
      CAMERA ADJUSTS to take in Poindexter's big finish as he
      slides forward on his knees.
      There's a scattering of half-hearted applause, led by
      Lava and the Slates.

                  Sank you, sank you. Our nex'

      She steps aside as a spotlight picks out --

233   PEBBLES, BAM-BAM & DINO                                   233
      poised in the stances we recognize as the "first
      positions" of the "Dino Dance." However, whereas the
      previous version of this was done impromptu and
      a cappella with only a few primitive props and straw
      hats alone, this time the kids and Dino are fully
      costumed, with sequins, batons and the like, and the
      dance is completely choreographed.

                                KIDS
                  You can keep the twist,

      The audience seems to really like it -- all except --

      who glances over at the judges long enough to see that
      they like this a lot better than the accordion act.
      Suddenly Mrs. Slate jumps up, barges on stage. The
      MUSIC DIES.
                                 HEADMISTRESS
                   Madame Slate, what ees wrong -- ?

                                 MRS. SLATE
                   I'll tell you what's wrong! This
                   'act' is an absolute disgrace!
                   This is supposed to be a talent
                   show!  And a pedestrian animal act
                   like this belongs in a circus!

236   WILMA AND BETTY                                           236

      React, furious, jump out of their seats.
                                 BETTY
                   A circus, huh? Well, if our kids
                   belong in a circus with their act,
                   then your little nephew belongs in
                   a zoo with his --
                                 WILMA
                   Yeah -- a zoo where the animals
                   are dead -- because if they aren't,
                   they will be!
                                 MRS. SLATE

                   Flintstein, I'll have you know
                   that my little Poindexter has been
                   trained by the finest tutors!
                   Poindexter! Show them! Encore!

      The kid jumps up, begins to play. Immediately another
      GLASS SHATTERS. But then the CEILING FIXTURES CRACK,
      and then the PICTURE WINDOW PANELS begin to SHATTER one
      by one.

                                 MRS. SLATE
                          (alarmed)
                   Ah... Poindexter... that's enough
                   ... Poindexter...?

      The kids stops... But another WINDOW PANEL EXPLODES.
      Then one of the tables collapses.

      Pause. Every head in the room swivels around and stares
      at Poindexter. Nervous, he tosses the accordion aside.
      But the destruction continues: Another WINDOW PANEL
      SHATTERS. Then, the entire building shakes.

      Loses his balance, grabs onto Lava for support, ends up
      pulling him down, too. Slate gets to his knees and looks
      out the window... and his jaw drops in astonishment.
238   HIS POV - SLATE CITY                                       238

      In the distance, with a CRACKLING ROAR, the little rows
      of Fibrerock tract houses are falling like dominoes in
      a wave that is rolling toward the Slate Needle.
239   SLATE CITY DEVELOPMENT - NIGHT                             239

      A flashlight beam  rakes the CAMERA. Feldspar, shotgun
      in one hand, light  in the other, looks around cautiously.
      (The shotgun has a  slingshot mechanism; the flashlight
      is a mirror-backed  candle.)

      Behind him, FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.   Feldspar tenses, but
      it's --
                              GRAVEL
                No sign of the driver...
                              FELDSPAR
                You kidding? By now he's a couple
                of shinbones and a belch.
      Gravel drops down on one knee, excited.   He shines his
      light on Fred's big "clawprints."
                              GRAVEL
                Holy cowasaurus! Look how deep
                these tracks are! That xeno thing
                must weigh a ton!
      They aim their lights at the tracks, begin to follow
      them. Suddenly they round a corner and come face to
      face with --

      He's stopped between two sample homes to wrestle with
      the monster head again. Now, he freezes in twin flash-
      light beams!

                              FELDSPAR
                Okay, lizard, reach for the sky!
      Fred hesitates... then, hearing a CREAK and GROAN, he
      looks at the HOUSE beside him. The stucco-like exterior
      of Fibrerock is beginning to crumble.

      Tries to catch up and collides with the already damaged
      house. It collapses totally, falling in on itself,
      obscuring Fred. Finally the last TIMBER DROPS. Pause.
      Fred staggers out of the rubble, realizes that the impact
      has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its
      hinges. He rubs dust out of his eyes, turns and looks
      at the Slate Needle. He's much closer to it now.

      Quickly, he runs toward it.

      City. He falls on top of his accordion, smashing it with
      one last dissonant squeeze.

      Barney runs INTO the SHOT, sees the steps about to go,
      dives for them... too late! He ends up with a face full
      of Fibredust! Now, he whirls as Fred runs up, points --

      Barney aims, pulls back the plunger... too late! The
      elevator is gone. The cable swings back and forth
      loosely, "whapping" the shaft walls as it shoots upwards.
      Fred dives for the cable, misses! As he stumbles, Barney
      leaps on Fred's back, catches the cable! As Barney
      starts to whizz upwards, Fred garbs onto his ankles!

      Barney starts to help... and then they both notice that
      there's another monstrous head in the middle of their

                                 LAVA
                   All right, all right, I admit it!
                   I got in over my head in the stock
                   market... took some big losses...
                   I had these guys pull jobs for me
                   all over town disguised as a
                   monster... but it still wasn't
                   enough... and when I saw all those
                   coo-coo berries being delivered
                   every day, I guess I just lost my
                   head... I figured with the Woca
                   sap in the Fibremix, the berry
                   juice as superfluous...
                                 SLATE
                   I'll tell you what's superfluous,
                   Lava... your liver! So why don't
                   we remove it -- !
      He leaps, snarling, on top of Lava... Fred and Barney
      pull them apart. Then, more falling dust and beams give
      everyone more pressing problems --
                                                    CUT TO:
255   EXT. SLATE NEEDLE - NIGHT                                  255
      Rescue VEHICLES and police CARS ROAR up, slam to a halt,
      CAT SIRENS WAILING. The rescue workers jump out.
      Firefighters carry circular trampolines of hide stitched
      to bamboo frames; others go to the back of their trucks
      and start to turn cranks on the hook and ladder trucks to
      raise the ladders.
256   CLOSE ON A HOOK AND LADDER TRUCK                           256

      It's actually a wheeled carriage carrying a firesaurus,
      which is a critter with a very tiny body and an incred-
      ibly long neck. The bony plates on the creature's back
      make perfect stairs.

      However, the creature is noticeably listless and
      uncooperative.

                                 FIRE CHIEF
                   Come on, come on, what's the hold
                   up -- ?
                                 FIREFIGHTER
                   It's the kibble crisis, sir --
                   the firesauruses have been on
                   half-rations for a month!
      Above them, the BUILDING SHUDDERS again.

                                                             112.

257   IN THE SLATE NEEDLE                                        257
      Now, the remaining LIGHT FIXTURES CRASH down. When they
      hit the floor, the oil lamps inside spills and fire
      spreads.
                               WILMA
                        (pointing)
                Fred!   There's a fire hose -- !

      Indeed, it's on the back wall in a closed box marked FIRE
      HOSE--IN CASE OF EMERGENCY BREAK GLASS. Fred and Barney
      take a step towards it, but the fire quickly spreads and
      cuts them off.
      Helpless, they step back.

      With a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the two SLATE SCRAPERS visible
      through what's left of the picture window COLLAPSE. Then
      the big statue of Slate just outside the window begins to
      decompose. It falls in on itself like a sand sculpture
      in a storm... finally, for a split second it is, well,
      life-sized, and then the head of the statue snaps loose,
      CRASHES through the only remaining pane of GLASS here
      ... rolls up to Slate's feet.

      Pause. Everyone looks at everyone else. This is it:
      Titanic time. Fred embraces Wilma... Barney embraces
      Betty. Their kids are pulled into the clinch. Even
      Slate takes Mrs. Slate's hand. Talk about grace under
      pressure... and speaking of --
258   GRACE                                                         258
      -- the star fashion model, suddenly her Fibrethread
      costume decomposes, leaving her in her cute little
      animal print undies.
259   BETTY                                                         259

      In the middle of going down with the ship, she turns
      Bam-Bam's face away from this display.

                              BAM-BAM
                D-dad, are we gonna be okay?
                              BARNEY
                       (pause; false smile)
                Sure, pal. We just gotta wait for
                the fire department. Right, Fred?
                              FRED
                Y-yeah. Everything's gonna be
                just -- Whoa, hoo-hah, aggh --
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              113.

259   CONTINUED:                                                     259
      He's started yelping because he's realized his arm    is
      on fire, and now he jumps up and the others begin    beating
      at the arm with anything in their hands, and then    Fred
      suddenly pushes away from them, stands there with    a small
      flame flickering on his forearm like a Rock Vegas    stage
      magician.

                                 FRED
                   -- Wait a minute -- I don't feel
                   anything at all --

      With his other "claw" he slaps tentatively at the flames,
      and then confidentially snuffs it out.
                                 BARNEY
                   It must be the suit, Fred -- old
                   Bedrock High built them things to
                   last --
      Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the
      guests from the fire hose. As everyone gets the same
      idea, Dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth.
      All brighten.

      Barney helps Fred with the head, twists it into place.
                                  BARNEY
                          (rapping on the head)
                   -- Okay?
                                 FRED
                   Hist hust fine!
      He lowers his head, runs through the fire, which licks
      at him harmlessly. Then with his claw, he SMASHES the
      amber GLASS --

260   IN THE BOX                                                     260
      A big PYTHONSAURUS is curled up inside,     SNORING. (Note
      to herpetologists: The pythonosaurus is      not quite a
      snake: it has little vestigial forepaws      the better to
      emote with. Right now the snoring head      is in those
      little paws.)

      The Pythonsaurus stirs, looks at Fred, "sniffs" the
      smoke. Then he raises one hand and finger as if to say
      "one moment." Then the pythonsaurus turns his head
      towards a nozzle like the ones in hamster cages, slurps
      loudly.

      We hear gallons and gallons of WATER GURGLING away...

                                                               114.

261   IN THE MAIN ROOM                                            261
      Everyone retreats from the fire. Slate picks up the head
      of the statue, his only souvenir.

262   WITH FRED                                                       262
      Waiting impatiently until the pythonsaurus finally
      finishes drinking. It wipes its mouth daintily with a
      napkin, slaps a little fire helmet on its head, turns
      and runs back into the other room. (Behind him, yards
      and yards of pythonsaurus unroll from a hidden compart-
      ment behind the box.) Water shoots out of the creature's
      mouth.
263   WIDER                                                           263

      Fred turns in a semi-circle and puts out every lick of
      flame in the room. All the guests cheer, rush forward
      and slap Fred on the back. Pebbles jumps up on him and
      kisses him.
                                FRED
                  Hit fuzz nudding... wheely...
      The pythonsaurus looks around at the attention.
                                PYTHONSAURUS
                  Hey, what am I, chopped liver?
                                BARNEY
                  Come on, everybody -- we'll go
                  out the way we came!
      Barney squirts a pathway with his flit gun, solidifying
      a route in the crumbling Fibrerock. Then Barney and
      Fred stand back nobly, wave everyone on into the adjacent
      Fibresphere.

                                POINDEXTER

                  mean, ah, children and women
                  first, yeah, yeah, provided that
                  uh, there's room for the women...

      Meanwhile, the pythonsaurus gives Fred (or rather his
      costume) a big look up and down, looks TOWARD the CAMERA.
                                  PYTHONSAURUS
                  Hey, not bad.    Wonder if she lives
                  around here.

      Just then Fred tilts back the monster head.        The
      pythonsaurus reacts.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            115.

                                   PYTHONSAURUS
                   Heartbreaker!

      Depressed, the pythonsaurus follows the others. Fred and
      Barney cross over into the Fibresphere. As the do, Slate
      Needle completely collapses.

264   EXT. FIBRESPHERE - LONG SHOT                               264
      The Slate Needle tumbles down, taking a big chunk of the
      Fibresphere with it! But the rest of the huge globe
      stays put... for now.

      Barney gives the dwindling circle of solid Fibre around
      the group another shot of coo-coo juice. Poindexter Lava
      pushes his way forward.

      Embarrassed, Mrs. Slate grabs the kid by the neck,
      practically throws him at the cable. She follows him
      down, followed by Lava and Mr. Slate.
269   REAR OF FLEEING PEOPLE                                       269

      Fred and Barney have bravely held up the rear, their

      both put their hands on the cable... and then the whole

      Dust and smoke clear. When we can see again, well, it's
      not a pretty sight. The entire fibresphere is gone. All
      that's left, teetering on two spindly supports, are two
      tiny islands of safety connected by a twisted maze of
      rubble too small for a human to negotiate... and all
      that's holding that up is a long guide wire leading to the

      Bam-Bam... Pebbles! The platform shudders again. Barney
      aims the flit gun -- empty! The dads hold on to the
      kids. It's all they can do.
276   BELOW                                                      276

      Wilma and Betty gasp... what can be done?
277   THE SECOND ISLAND                                         277

      Bricks and chunks of Fibre stir... a form sits up...
      it's -- Dino! He looks around at the situation, becomes
      agitated... he wants to help... but how?

                                                            118.

278   WILMA AND BETTY                                            278
      Suddenly become inspired.

                                BETTY
                  W-wilma... those hoops of bamboo...
                  those wires... do you think -- ?

                               WILMA
                  Yes! Yes! Betty, we have to try
                  it -- ! Dino! Dino, look down
                  here -- !

279   DINO                                                         279
      Obeys, puzzled --

280   HIS POV - WILMA AND BETTY                                  280

      Amazingly, they grab scraps of wood, borrow fire
      fighter's helmets, and begin to do a buck and wing.
                         WILMA   AND   BETTY
                  You can keep   the   twist,
                  the frug and   hop
                  I don't need   to shimmy,
                  I don't need   to bop --
281   BIG CAMERA PUSH - DINO                                     281
      MUSIC COMES UP DRAMATICALLY as he catches on! His eyes
      fill with courage and he charges toward the spindly
      bridge that leads to his master and friends.
282   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              282

      Dino dives through the hoops of bamboo, duplicating his
      steps in "The Dino Dance." He reaches the other island!
      Without a beat, still keeping time, he puts the two kids
      on his shoulders, just like in the dance! Then he
      "presents" his tail to Fred -- Fred hands his tail to
      Barney -- and then --

283   LONG SHOT                                                    283
      -- Dino slides down the long wire, carrying everyone to
      safety! They all plow into the biggest rescue net as
      Wilma and Betty wind up!

                                WILMA AND BETTY
                  Yes, I don't need to shimmy,
                  I don't need to bop
                  'Cause I'm doin', doin', doin'
                  THE IGNEOUS ROCK!

                                                            119.

284   FRED                                                         284
      rolls out of the net and away from the others. He's
      slightly stunned, still in the suit. He sits up...
      suddenly lights snap on all around him! Fred looks up
      and sees --
285   HIS POV - CORDON OF POLICE OFFICERS                       285

      All with weapons aimed right at him. Spotlights on the
      police car roofs (actually little fires with parabolic
      mirrors) are operated by uniformed monkeys.

      Feldspar is at the head of the group. He cocks his
      shotgun. The elastic catapults at the hammers twitch
      menacingly --

                                FELDSPAR
                  It's the xenosaurus -- stand back,
                  men -- it's a vicious killer --
                  Ready -- Aim --
                                FRED
                         (with desperate poignancy)
                  High ham noght a zenosore! High
                  ham hay hooman beeng -- !
      BAM! WHAM! KABAM! Bullets and projectiles begin
      slamming all around Fred! He ducks behind a big fallen
      chunk of Fibrerock -- catches his breath as the bullets
      and shells bounce off its resilient surface.
286   CLOSE - FRED                                                 286
      Momentarily safe, he tries desperately to remove that
      stupid head -- bangs it against the wall, tears at it
      with his claws --
      -- meanwhile, the chunk of Fibrerock protecting him
      decomposes! He's back in the line of fire!
287   DINO                                                         287

      Flanked by Wilma, Barney and the kids, who are shouting
      for the police to stop, only Dino the wonder bronto has
      the wits to act!

      "YI-YI-YI-ING," he races forward, CAMERA FOLLOWING --
      and with lightning reflexes grabs the seat of Fred's
      monster suit and -- de-pants him!
      Instantly, Dino whirls Fred around, points to the now
      revealed striped undershorts.

288   WIDER                                                        288
      Pause.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              120.

288   CONTINUED:                                                     288
      Then Officer Gravel takes a good look at that rear end.

                                 GRAVEL
                   Hey, those are the biggest shorts
                   I've ever seen...
                          (realizing)
                   ... It... it must be Mister
                   Flintstone! Cease fire!
                          (to Feldspar)
                   Gee, Sarge, now you don't have
                   to shoot him -- !

      Now Fred confirms Gravel's hunch as the costume head
      finally pops off. All the cops lower their guns.
      (Strangely, though, Feldspar still continues to raise
      his gun -- even aims! Then an alarmed Gravel wrestles
      it away from his superior.)
289   THE FLINTSTONES AND RUBBLES - DAWN                           289
      Safe, they all emotionally embrace. Fred even suffers
      Dino's affection. (In the b.g., a police car holding
      Piltdown, Pyrite and Lava drives past. Poindexter Lava
      is chasing the car.)
                                 POINDEXTER
                          (distant)
                   Dad! Dad! Can I use the
                   Porscherock while you're in the
                   slammer?
      Suddenly the Slates push their way into the group hug.
                                 SLATE
                   Flintstone. Rubble. I... I
                   don't know what to say. I... I
                   treated you horribly... I ignored
                   you, abused you... and then you
                   come here and risk your necks like
                   this... well, there's no price you
                   can put on something like that,
                   so I won't even try. But let me
                   give you...
                          (with great
                           poignancy)
                   ... a hearty handshake.

                                 MRS. SLATE
                   Dear, don't you think a little
                   more than that is in order?

                                 SLATE
                   Honey, you're being hysterical,
                   go lie down, okay?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               121.

289   CONTINUED:                                                      289
                                 MRS. SLATE
                   I am not being hysterical, I am
                   being fair -- now the Flintsteins
                   and Rabbles saved all of our
                   lives, not to mention your
                   reputation.

                                 SLATE
                          (sighing)
                   Okay, okay.
                          (to Fred and Barney)
                   Boys, I'm feeling guilty about
                   how you've been taken advantage
                   of, so I'll tell you what... I'm
                   going to give you back all
                   world-wide rights to Fibrerock,
                   free and clear.
      He picks up a fragment of stone, begins writing on it.
                                 SLATE
                   Your only obligation will be to
                   cover oh, whatever legal expenses
                   might surface at some later time...
                                 BARNEY
                   You think there's gonna be some?
      Slate looks around at --
290   HIS POV - THE RUINS AND DESTRUCTION                           290
      Smoking desolation as far as the eye and CAMERA can see.
      As we watch the last remaining fragment of Slate City
      collapse, crushing a police car.
291   BACK TO SCENE                                                 291

                                 SLATE
                          (casually)
                   Oh, you never know...

292   RESCUE DINOS                                                    292
      Several sniff at the air, look curiously at a nearby
      pile of crumbled Fibrerock. One and then another
      shuffles over, tentatively tastes some... grins... and
      digs in! Seeing this, the "firesauruses" crane out
      their necks, also begin chowing down on the pile of
      Fibrerock crumbs.

293   FRED, BARNEY, SLATE AND OTHERS                                293
      All turn at the growing sound of the ANIMALS PIGGING OUT.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                 122.

293   CONTINUED:                                                        293
      Now DINO "YI-YI-YI'S" past this group and leaps into the
      pile, munching like crazy.

      Barney puts out his hand as chunks of Fibrerock shower
      down like rain from the feeding frenzy. Catching some
      pieces, he nibbles on it a little.

                                   FRED
                   Barn...?    What's going on?
                                 BARNEY
                          (sniffing it)
                   Lava Lava leaves... Woca sap...
                   all still there, but now the
                   nutrients are all released...
                          (realizing)
                   ... Fred, this... this is Dino
                   kibble!
                                 FRED
                   Dino kibble...?
      Disbelieving, Fred moves over to the happily-munching
      animals. He has to get on his knees to wiggle in with
      the pack. He grabs some, stuffs it in his mouth...
      chews. His eyes widen...
                                 FRED
                          (mouth full)
                   Dhinough khibble!!
      He spits it out, takes out the chunk of contract
      Slate wrote on.

                                 FRED
                   Barney, we -- we're rich!
                   Yabba dabba do -- !

294   SLATE                                                             294
      Faints dead away!       The CAMERA PULLS BACK... BACK...
      BACK --
295   EXT. DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT                           295

      We're back where we began. As "The End" appears on the
      drive-in screen, cars are streaming out of the drive-in
      theatre. The Flintstone car is among them.
296   EXT. DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                              296

      Fred and company roll into a '50's-style drive-in
      restaurant. A sign advertises BRONTO BURGERS AND RIBS.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

296   CONTINUED:                                                    296
      A pretty carhop on stone roller skates glides over.
      Fred holds up one finger towards her. She nods, scampers
      O.S. Fred rubs his hands and licks his lips with antici-
      pation... and then the girl returns with a massive rack
      of ribs on a car tray. She hooks it on the edge of
      the driver's door... and the entire car tips over with a
      crash.

                                                CUT TO:
297   EXT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT                              297

      WIDEN FROM the mailbox. Fred and family pull up. Dino
      runs in first, followed by Wilma with Pebbles already
      asleep on her shoulder. Fred follows, the saber-tooth
      cat on his heels. Fred stops in the doorway to put a
      milk bottle on the doorstep, and then puts the cat down
      beside it. He shuts the door.
      Quick as a flash, the cat leaps through the side window.
      Pause. The door opens and the cat puts Fred out, then
      slams the door! Fred recovers from his shock, tries the
      door... it's locked!

                                 MUSIC (V.O.)
                   We'll have a yabba

                   A dabba-do time
                   We'll have a gay old time!

                          (knocking)
                   Wilma...?
                          (another knock)
                   ... Wilma?
      CAMERA CRANES UP, WIDENS as Fred becomes a tiny sil-
      houette banging on the door.
                                  FRED
                   Wilma?   Wil-ma --!

                                                FADE OUT.
