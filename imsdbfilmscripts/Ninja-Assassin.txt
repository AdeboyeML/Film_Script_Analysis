    CLOSE ON a Horimono Tattoo as it is being drawn into
    flesh. The ink is needled into the surface of the skin,
    raw and bloody, the needled brush tapped with the
    precision of ritual.

    The tattoo is in the style of a Kuniyoshi print: Miyamoto
    Musashi thrusting his spear into the writhing dragon.
    The image has beauty but retains the violence required to
    saturate flesh with art.

    The skin canvas shifts uncomfortably with the needle-
    work.

    A place of designer furniture, beautiful girls carrying
    towels, tea and cigarettes. Dozens of Yakuza look on as
    the process continues, sleeves rolled up or shirts off to
    expose the lavish tattoos that cover their torsos.

    HOLLYWOOD, the young Yakuza member, is getting his first
    tattoo, a relatively small one on his back.

    He grabs a bottle of sake and suckles it like a baby.

                 The irezumi does not hide the
                 skin, the tattoo reveals the
                 nature of the man and illuminates
                 the four noble professions in the
                 Book of Five Rings: the Warrior,

                 I'll tattoo this ceiling with your

    The old man speaks with a kind of deference honed through
    years of service to men like Hollywood.

    Goons and girls all cluck their tongues in chorus.
    Hollywood peers at the new tat through the mirror.         He
    whistles approval as Yakuza One enters carrying an
    origami envelope.

              There were many with him and they

              it came from the shadows and their
              laughter was drowned in blood.
              You cannot bargain with what is
              coming. You cannot reason with it.
              Because it is not a human being.
              It is a demon sent straight from
              hell that will never stop until
              you are dead.

    He pulls open his robe, revealing a hauntingly beautiful
    tattoo of a Shinobi demon thrusting its blade into a lump
    of scar tissue at the center of his heart.

                            TATTOO ARTIST
              That night, one of their blades

              but for an accident of birth. My

    head disappears, sliced off from his jaw up, leaving his
    tongue wagging in space.

    Lights shatter around the room.

    of Hollywood's foot soldiers as one by one, they are
    eviscerated.

    There's a RUSH of movement, more felt than seen. The
    whistle of swords through the air. Cries and screams.
    Guns that fire suddenly and are just as suddenly stilled.

    STAY on the face of the Tattoo Master, barely visible in
    the thin trace of moonlight from a nearby window.
    Frozen. Immobile. As the killing continues around him.

    Then: silence, broken by the sound of heavy, desperate
    BREATHING, and a MATCH being struck by Hollywood who
    looks up --

    -- and sees a dark figures standing before him. Everyone
    else is dead. Only he and the Tattoo Master remain. The
    figure regards him with still silence. For perhaps the
    first time in his life, Hollywood is terrified.

    Their answer is silence. Hollywood sees his guns nearby.
    With a desperate scream, he THROWS the match in the air
    as he DIVES for his guns, grabbing one in each hand.

    There is a whistle of metal and suddenly his severed
    hands are tumbling gracefully through the air.

    The blade swings again, slicing through his body as if it
    were barely there, coming out the other side as --

    -- Hollywood's body erupts as it falls in two pieces,
    splattering the artist with blood.

    The match touches the floor and goes out.

    After a moment, the ninja emerges into the moonlight, the

    dark to inspect its kill.

    The artist doesn't move, but his eyes widen, his heart

    Silence. He waits for the death blow. It does not come.

      They begin to fold, corner to corner, end to end.
      Silently. The fluorescent strobing above them.

      We sense a strange tension between them as we realize
      they are alone in the midnight cleaners. He looks at
      her. She smiles. The uneven strobing on either side of
      the Laundromat casts uneven shadows on her face... almost
      as though she had two faces. One light, one shadow. We
      EXTEND the silence for a long BEAT until he looks down at

      The grown Raizo looks at his soup.    We cannot tell if he
      is going to eat or not.

                                 OZUNU
                   The world feeds on the weak.


18    FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE - NIGHTINGALE        18
      FLOOR - NIGHT

      Young Raizo stands in the central chamber of the
      compound. The floor beneath his bare feet is made of
      thousands of carefully mitred pieces of gleaming wood
      laid down in an intricate pattern. They are not,
      however, glued down to the floor. The slightest wrong
      move will make them shift noisily.

      This is our first look at the Nightingale Floor.

                                 OZUNU
                   Suffering exists only because                       *
                   weakness exists.

      Ozunu watches from the far side of the room as Raizo
      takes his first step. Carefully. Graceful as any
      dancer.

      He makes no sound.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                   You must hate all weakness. Hate                    *
                   it in others, but most of hate it                   *
                   in yourself.


      He takes another step, and another.    Each soft as a
      falling feather.

      He is a third of the way across the floor - his body
      gleaming with sweat - when he steps wrong and the floor
      sings beneath him.

      Raizo stops, a flash of panic in his eyes. Then he
      subdues the emotion and obediently lifts the offending
      foot, holds it out as Ozunu rises and approaches.

      Ozunu lays open Raizo's foot with a bamboo rod.      Slashing
      blows that leave deep cuts.

     Raizo's expression hardly changes. Ozunu returns to his
     place, and Raizo starts walking again, making no noise,
     and leaving no trace of his passage...

     ...except for a trail of small, bloody footprints.


19   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT            19

     The same evening. Most of the children in this place
     sleep on mats in the same room. They are exhausted,
     silent, motionless.

     We FIND Raizo and though he makes no sound, his eyes show
     silent tears of pain, his feet still bleeding and
     bruised.

     Kiriko looks on from her mat for a long, silent BEAT,
     knowing the agony he is in. Then, as if coming to an
     inner decision, she reaches under her mat for a leaf into
     which a thick salve has been folded. She crosses the few
     feet to Raizo's mat and, as he watches in silent agony,
     she puts her finger to her lips, then kneels down --

     -- and begins applying the salve to his feet. Within
     moments, we can see the pain leaving his eyes. Finishing
     quickly, she folds the remaining salve back into the
     leaf, exchanges a quick, furtive glance with Raizo, then
     heads back for her mat.

     He lays there for a BEAT, confused as to whether his
     diminishing pain is a good thing. Then he turns to look
     at Kiriko, but she lays with her back to him, apparently
     asleep.

     He regards her silently for a moment, then rolls over
     himself to sleep as we come around to --

     -- the other side of Kiriko, and see that she is very
     much awake, almost smiling. She closes her eyes.

                                                           CUT TO:

     The apartment is dark as Mika ENTERS and turns on the
     lights. She looks the place over, then goes room to
     room, turning on every light in the place. The practiced
     way she does it makes it clear she does this every night.

     Satisfied she's alone, she goes into the bedroom to
     change.


21   INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER           21

     Mika is curled up in a chair and with KGB report.

     She turns a page and sees a photocopied drawing of a very
     intricate floor that we now recognize as the Nightingale
     Floor. She reads the caption beneath it.

                   Historical evidence suggests that
                   Ibn-Battuta's journey through the
                   far east brought him into contact
                   with what might be one of the
                   oldest of the Nine Clans. He
                   travels with a group of orphans
                   that are being taken from a city
                   devastated by war to the Shido of
                   the Ozunu clan. The people of the

      We see Battuta, the 14th century Muslim explorer sitting
      among the original leaders of the Ozunu clan, watching
      two children fight.

                                 SABATIN (V.O.)
                   Battuta describes a ceremonial
                   dinner followed by a display of
                   martial skill. The combatants
                   were children neither beyond the
                   age of ten.

      Battuta masks his revulsion as the battle continues until
      one child beats the other to death. Small fists gleam
      with blood as one boy pummels the other.

      Slowly the light in the bedroom hallway goes OUT.

      She freezes, and the world seems to freeze with her.      She
      doesn't move, doesn't breathe.

      She forces herself to sit slowly up, reaching under her
      bed for a cricket bat. A car drives by outside. Could
      be nothing. Could be everything.

      Despite her fear, she edges toward the door. Slowly
      peers around it. The darkened hall is empty.

      There is a ticking sound, like someone tapping at a
      window. Could be a tree in the wind. Could be something
      else.

      She moves slowly through her apartment.   Every shadow
      could conceal unseen eyes.

      She comes to the end of the hall, where the overhead
      light is out. She flicks the switch on and off.
      Nothing. She reaches carefully toward the light bulb.
      Taps it. The bulb rattles, it's just burned out. She
      breathes a sigh of relief. Then she notices --

      -- that the living room window is open, the blinds gently
      swaying from the wind, tapping against the sash.

      She closes it and locks it. Looks to her desk,
      concerned. Did she leave the window open? Or is
      something going on.

      She goes to her desk, anxious, to check on something.
      She opens a drawer, revealing a box of tampax. Pulls out
      the tampax to reveal a key... a place no guy would think
      to check.

      She unlocks a drawer and takes out an unmarked DVD in a
      slim plastic case. Relieved, she starts to put it
      away...then stops. Is it the same DVD? She moves OS.

      MOMENTS LATER... the TV is switched on, and an image
      begins to play, revealing a time coded security camera,
      recording an urban street corner in Japan. The tape is
      riddled with digital noise and artifacting.

      Then, slowly, the digital noise seems to coalesce, to
      grow shapes. The shadows come to life.

      Then with incredible speed two dark figures start
      battling it out, their blades striking sparks that are
      still descending after they've slipped back into the
      shadows.

      They emerge over and over, brief flashes of clarity like
      the perfect arc of a calligrapher's brush describing the
      wing of a bird. Fight. Retreat. Silence. Shadows.
      Sparks.

      Mika hits the pause button and moves closer to the
      screen, examining the figures.

      One of the figures is wearing a mask, but the face of the
      other combatant is revealed, albeit somewhat obscured by
      the dim light and digital noise.

       As we REVEAL Raizo his breathing is rhythmic and deep,
       but this is really the first time we have heard him sound
       like he is straining.

       As we continue to WIDEN, we discover the reason for this:
       he is doing handstand push-ups. On the nails. Over and

       and trucks pass over the plates, they make a bump-thump
       sound. Bump-thump, bump-thump, bump-thump. We PUSH IN
       on Raizo under that sound.

     slap against the stone buildings.

27   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DOJO - NIGHT                    27

     Raizo, is fighting with TAKESHI, a few years older, in a
     room lit by hundreds of hanging torches. Armed with
     katanas, the boys duck, dodge and weave around the
     burning obstacles as they fight.

     They are both extremely agile, their bodies moving with
     the impossible flexibility of youth.

     Kiriko watches along with the other members of the clan.
     If she feels anything as she watches the fight, we cannot
     tell.

     They perform a vicious series of combinations, then
     Takeshi's sword cracks against Raizo's head, opening a
     huge gash.

     Raizo hits the ground hard, blood speckling the mats.

     Takeshi backs away as Ozunu steps in.

     As blood flows down the side of his face, Raizo looks
     like the young boy that he is. Pain throbs from the
     wound, and he begins to cry.

                             OZUNU
               Did Takeshi's blow hurt you?    You                   *

     He gouges three fingers into the boy's stomach and twists
     something inside of him.

     Raizo screams.

     His screams smear into uncontrollable sobbing.

                             OZUNU (CONT'D)
               That is true pain. You must learn                     *

     He steps back, leaving Raizo writhing in agony.

     Later.    Night.

     Raizo is still where we left him, a twisted knot of pain,
     his face stained with tears and crusted with snot.

     He is trying to control his breath, at first without
     success. Then slowly, finally, it begins to ease. His
     hand, twisted into a kind of rigor mortis, slowly begins
     to relax, opening like a lotus flower.

                  Why? It's obvious. If your little
                  fantasy has even slightest chance
                  of being real, then these Nine
                  Clans would have some pretty major

     falls, her breath as rhythmic as and gentle as the lap of
     sea-water in a tidal pool. He begins to breathe in sync
     with her, perhaps in hopes it will relax him.

     Slowly, all the other sounds in the room go away, until
     only her breathing, and his, remains. There is the
     slight murmur of their hearts.

     Then she opens her eyes...and smiles at him because he
     cannot see her. But he hears her heart begin to beat
     faster and that brings a faint smile to his lips.

     They listen to each other's breathing growing heavier,
     the sound of their hearts beating faster and faster.

     Her lips part as she makes the tiniest movement...tilting
     her pelvis up, rubbing her hips ever so slightly against
     the blanket-

     Sabatin and Mika sit across from each other. The house
     has the chill of loneliness. Tea has been set out
     between them.

                                MRS. SABATIN
                  You said you read my husband's

                  I found it...illuminating.
                  Especially the references to the
                  Rihla. Your husband quotes
                  passages not found in Battuta's
                  present manuscript.

                                MRS. SABATIN
                  My husband journeyed all over the
                  world researching that report, but
                  when he was home, he never spoke
                  about it. He said it was safer
                  that way.

                                MIKA
                  I understand the report caused
                  some problems for him inside the

                  The report caused "problems" for
                  Alexei's career the way Moses
                  caused problems for the Pharaoh,

                   Locks on the windows, locks on the

                   I will tell you a true thing, and
                   a hard thing. My husband was a
                   soldier. A member of Russian
                   intelligence. He had seen many
                   terrible things....

                   went down behind the hills...in

39    FLASHBACK - INT/EXT. SABATIN HOUSE - DAY                     39

      We are over the shoulder of someone who could be Raizo or
      Takeshi as the door opens revealing Alexei.

      After a moment Alexi invites the man in. A security
      camera watches them enter the house.

                                 MRS. SABATIN (V.O.)
                   They talked in Alexei's study for
                   sometime. Then the young man
                   left.

      Mrs. Sabatin watches the young man leave then hurries
      toward the study door.

                   It was unlike Alexei not to see
                   him out. I remember being very
                   scared. But when I opened the
                   door, he was just sitting there.
                   For a moment, he didn't even
                   notice me. Then he stood up and
                   kissed me and told me that he
                   loved me very much. He said I
                   should always remember that.

      We see Alexei looking shell-shocked, eyes hollowed, as he
      stands and kisses his wife. His eyes begin to shimmer
      with tears but before he cries, he leaves.

      The lights have come on outside his house. Alexei comes
      out, a gun in hand, shielding his eyes. Searching for
      whatever set off the automatic lights.

      Then, suddenly: darkness.

      And sudden MOVEMENT in the shadows that LUNGES toward

      Mika follows her into --

      -- an adjoining room, where Mrs. Sabatin pulls the bottom
      drawer of a bureau out and sets it on the floor. From
      the darkness she removes a metal box.

41    INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - DAY                       41

      Raizo sits alone. Crossed-legged on the floor. Utterly
      still.

      There's an ocean of sound swirling around him.    The
      cacophony of Instanbul evening rush hour.

      Raizo starts to build a dam; auricular sandbags laid one
      by one, walling off the outside world.

      The traffic outside- horns, engines, squealing tires,
      rattling trucks chassis- all fade away.

      People shouting, singing. A couple next door making love.
      A baby wailing. Jackhammers pounding...

      Slowly, the world fades away, until there is only one
      sound. Faint, familiar, but almost too quiet to hear...

     Raizo's heartbeat.

     He listens to it.    Meditates on its simple rhythm...

     Until a sound explodes in the room, it is a sound we
     haven't heard in his apartment-

     A phone.

     He rises slowly as the phone continues to ring.   He
     answers it silently waiting for something-

     The line clicks and goes dead.


42   EXT. ISTANBUL STREET SOUK - DAY                            42

     Raizo walks through the crowded market. Shoppers,
     salesmen and tourists fill the narrow aisles between the
     stalls.

     FIVE CHILDREN- who we see only from the back- run past.
     Shouting laughing. The last one jostles against Raizo as
     he goes by.

     Raizo keeps walking, but he is holding an envelope in his
     hand. He slips it into his pocket.

     There's a square of paper inside, and a photograph.

     On the paper is a street address in Berlin. The

     Close on the box. It sits on her desk, calling as
     another box once called to Pandora.

     She opens it.

     Inside are a series of cataloged photographs taken in the
     style of 1970's archeologists (like those of the dead sea
     scrolls) of the lost chapter of Ibn-Battuta.

     The scrolls contain his 14th century Islamic writing and
     several sketches.

     There is also a very rough map that suggests the location
     of The Orphanage.

     Images of the orphanage, of the children training and
     their ordeals, bloody combat, ritual bindings, beatings
     on the Nightingale floor.

     There is a scroll that she unrolls revealing the lineage
     tree of the Nine Clans.

     Also in the box is a single VHS tape.

     She pushes the tape into the player.

     It's a recording of a surveillance camera staring at the
     front of the Sabatin house.

     A man walks up to the house and rings's the bell. We
     cannot see his face. Sabatin opens the door. They
     exchange words. Sabatin seems wary but invites the man
     in.

     Mika doesn't understand why this is significant.

     She hits fast forward until she sees a flash as the man
     exits. She stops, rewinds and plays it again.                   *

     As he steps out of the shadow of the house, she sees his
     face-

     It is Raizo.

     She is startled when someone pounds on the door. It
     seems like it might rattle off its hinges as she hurries
     to open it revealing-

      him into her home office.

      With the key from the tampax box she opens the drawer.

      Maslow watches as she pulls out the contents of Sabatin's
      box as well as the illegally requisitioned evidence.

                                 MIKA
                   Most of this is from Sabatin.
                   Copies of what I think are the
                   lost chapters of the Rihle. I
                   think it describes the original
                   location of the Ozunu Clan but my
                   14th century Arabic is a little
                   rusty.

                                 MIKA
                   That's how it started. I made a
                   mistake, mixed up the case code
                   and they sent me that.

      A moment later the DVD is playing, Raizo and the other
      ninja dancing through the shadows.

                   why they're fighting though. It
                   could be a clan war.

      Maslow starts to put it together.

                                 MASLOW
                   So you requisitioned this by
                   accident. You used my code which
                   is why you didn't want to show me
                   this. Which is also why they're
                   tearing apart my office right now.

52   EXT. MIKA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                       52

     Mika parks her car around the corner from the apartment
     building, gets out and starts down the street when she
     sees --

     -- the apartment building and the one next door are dark.
     Candles and flashlights are visible in some of the
     apartment windows, a scattering of neighbors congregating
     outside. Mika approaches a NEIGHBOR.

                  Power's out. Us, the building
                  behind us, that one across the
                  street. Seems like every few
                  months, boom, the lights out. I
                  call, I complain, they
                  listen...nothing gets done. So I
                  sit out here, at least it's cool.

     Mika looks up at the building, scared but not ready to
     believe that ninjas are responsible for everything. She
     pulls a tiny LED flashlight out of her bag and starts
     into the building.

     -- where she climbs the steps, each creak adding to the
     possibility of attracting trouble. On the passing
     floors, we hear doors being opened and shut, footsteps,
     the distant murmur of voices. Could be nothing. Could
     be everything. She presses on.


54   INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER                      54

     She opens the door to her apartment, shining the tiny
     light ahead of her. Shadows chase each other across the
     room as she swings the light one way, then another.
     There seems to be no one else in the place. But as she
     hurries into her home office, we see --

     A shadow move behind her.

     As she packs she begins to hear something, a tapping.
     The same sound she heard before. She pulls the gun from
     her purse. With the flashlight spearing the darkness,
     she goes to her office.

     Again the window is open, the blinds gently blowing
     against the sash.

     She is certain the window had been locked.

     Now every shadow is alive.

     She rushes back to her bedroom aiming in every direction.
     Her flashlight finds her suitcase. On the top of her
     clothes she sees it: An envelope. Perfectly centered.

     Setting the gun down, she picks up the oragami-folded
     envelope. Opens it with a shaking finger.

     Black sand spills out.

     Terror steals her breath. Behind her, a shadow tilts and
     reveals the eyes of a ninja.

     Before she can even move, a blade flashes from the
     darkness, heading for her neck-

     Another shadow blocks the blade, knocking Mika over the
     bed.

     The sounds of a fight erupt all around her but the
     combatants are almost invisible in the surrounding
     darkness.

     Her flashlight catches glimpses. Impossibly fast, lethal
     predators trying to kill each other.

     She crawls towards the spilled contents of her suitcase,
     towards the gun. Another blow arcs for her and is again
     blocked.

     Her hand finds the handle of the gun.         She points into
     the dark, fires.

     The gun flash strobes the room, freezing the two ninjas
     in the blink of a flashbulb.

     They move towards her until a kick sends her gun flying.

     She can feel them fighting very close to her and when she
     finds them with her flashlight, a blade is struck deep-

     Blood erupts.       One shadow falls to the ground.

     The other turns towards her. Her flashlight shakes as
     the ninja reaches up and removes his mask.

     It is Raizo.

     He sees in her eyes that she knows him.

     The shadows come alive and four dark figures emerge, born
     from the black-

     The Hanta Kirra.

     Their leader drifts forward surveying the apartment, his
     dark eyes flashing that we recognize.

     Like snap-focus flashes taking in the myriad signs of the
     fight: the bullets in the wall, footprints, and shattered
     lights. One of the killers uses his sword to trace the
     line of a slashing cut in wall. Braille from the blow
     that Raizo used to cut the ninja.

     He removes his mask and we see it's Takeshi.

                  Raizo.

     Another Ninja leans forward and tastes the air with his
     nose. Eyes closed. Like a dog getting the scent, his
     inhalation a long, low whisper in the silent room.

64   FLASHBACK - INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT                           64

     Raizo is dressed in normal clothes his hair starting to
     grow back from the close shave he had in the Orphanage.
     He wears a silk blindfold.

     Ozunu sits in the leather gloom of the stuffed
     upholstery.

                                OZUNU
                  You may remove the blindfold.

     Raizo does so. Looking around at the lights of Osaka, a
     city he has never seen before.

     CLOSE ON the fat wrist of a large man as he strides
     across the lobby.

     He turns to his entourage which includes several
     bodyguards and a few arm pieces.

                                 KINGPIN
                  Wait here.   Gotta piss.

     Kingpin enters there is only one person in the bathroom-

     Raizo washing his hands. His eyes flash in the mirror,
     watching the Kingpin only after he has turned away.

     The enormous man steps into a stall. After a moment he
     begins to piss, moaning slightly as he does.

     Raizo hits the air dryer button.        The sound fills the
     room.

     A thin razor sharp blade flashes from his sleeve.

     The Kingpin continues to enjoy his piss but as we look at
     him we see the door behind him silently swing open,
     revealing Raizo.

     Raizo stares at the back of the man's head. He can
     almost see his jugular beating beneath the thick folds
     of his neck-

     But something prevents him from striking.

     Kingpin suddenly looks back over his shoulder-

                  The fuck-?

     which sinks into his enormous body.

                  Gonna take more than a knitting
                  needle to fuck me up, boy.

     Raizo attacks and it is immediately apparent that this is
     not going to be easy.

     Several ferocious blows that would have broken the neck
     of a smaller man, only seem to make the Kingpin madder.

     Soon both are covered in blood, and gore.

     But it is not until Raizo slams the man's head against
     the lip of the urinal-

     The first time a font blood splashing up--

     The second time the porcelain shatters as the Kingpin's
     head opens, spilling black blood across the floor.

     Raizo, still wearing his bloody clothes, climbs up onto
     the roof, his clothes spattered with gore.

     He waits as the shadows around him come to life: Ozunu,
     Takeshi, and several other clan members surround him.
     All but Ozunu wear their masks.

     We cannot tell if Raizo is crying as he takes the blade-

     He CRIES OUT, the light of madness in his eyes.

     He STRIKES, lashing out with the fury of a wild animal,

     by the handful, a storm of jagged steel racing for
     Raizo's flesh.

     Raizo blocks some of the shuriken, misses many more. The
     shuriken strike muscles, tendons, flesh. He SWINGS
     around, still trying to attack, there are too many of
     them.

                  for the location of The Orphanage

               Ninja only kill two kinds of
               people. The first kind has power

     without any sense of awkwardness; the world where he came
     from makes little distinction between male and female.
     She's not from the same world, keeping herself as covered

      Maslow takes hold of Mika as he shouts-

                                   MASLOW
                   NOW!

      An explosion of light; A firing line of kliegs all aimed
      at Raizo, each as bright as a slice of the sun.

                                   MIKA

      Twenty heavily armed men emerge from the wall of light.

      Raizo raises his hands slowly, a glance thrown like a
      shuriken at Maslow.

      The men swarm over him, binding him with brutal
      efficiency, hauling him away.

      Raizo wakes up.

      There's a commotion on the other side of the shoji
      screens that comprise the inner wall of the dorm.
      Silhouettes limned against the paper.

      Raizo moves to the screens. Pulls them a half inch aside
      as the other children watch...

      Through the tiny gap, he sees ninjas dragging Kiriko down
      the hall. Gagged, arms twisted with shiburi, blood
      streaking her pale and terrified face.

     Raizo is chained to the walls of a vault. Spread-eagled,
     double-locked, and lit from all sides so there are no
     shadows anywhere in the room.

     Raizo's head sags.   Eyes closed.

     Cameras stare at him.


81   INT. SAFE-HOUSE GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                      81

     Classic Berlin aesthetic. A modern office shoe-horned
     into an abandoned building: cubicles, computers and Aeron
     chairs amidst crumbling walls.

     Maslow's team are hanging out there, thirty agents, a
     fairly competent and well-armed bunch. Maslow is inside
     the control room which is like a small construction
     trailer. Several different monitors have images of
     Raizo.

                             SECURITY GOON
               Prisoner is secure sir.

     For a moment it appears that Raizo looks up as Maslow
     looks at him, as if somehow Raizo could see through the
     lens watching him. Then his head drops again.

                              MASLOW
               Right.

     He scans the different monitors.

                             MASLOW (CONT'D)
               Something's wrong with the

               Then why isn't he showing up?

               We think he's able to lower the

               neutral.

                                MIKA
                  So two weeks ago, there's no such
                  thing as a ninja and now every
                  city in the world has a warrant

     He opens the door retracing their steps into the dark.

     Mika suddenly very alone manages a slow nervous pirouette
     in the crypt-like garage, before skittering for Maslow's
     sedan.

     She slides in pulling the door shut behind her as quietly
     as she can--

     Maslow moves cautiously through the folds of midnight.
     He hears the fighting before he can see it.

     Raizo blocks a sword-thrust from Takeshi. Dodges around
     a hail of shuriken. Uses his chain to drive another
     Ninja back.

     Takeshi rips free his left arm. Draws a short, angled
     blade and brings it slashing down at Raizo's neck...

     Raizo blocks the knife with his elbow, twists, throws
     Takeshi twenty feet through the air. He recovers mid-
     flight like a cat and regains his balance.

     From the darkness a ninja fires a dozen shuriken at him,
     and at least three of the spinning blades find their
     mark.

     Raizo grunts at the impact, but vaults up and over a
     counter and LEAPS through a window, crashing out to -

     Peeling out toward the down ramp.

     The car fishtails down level after level through the
     oscillating light/dark of the dimly lit exit ramp.

     Her eyes twitch from mirror to mirror when she sees up
     ahead--

     A shadow hanging in the corner of the tunnel like a
     spider.

     She ducks just as the front of the sedan is shredded by a
     squall of stars.

     The sedan rebounds into the light. Its hood and
     windscreen looking as though it was gnawed on by a Great

     She passes under a light--

     Revealing a crouching ninja staring right at her, through
     the sun roof.

     She jams the barrel of the Glock between the two tips of
     one set of claws, right where his foot should be--

     A scream is followed by a gout of blood that washes over
     the sunroof--

     The ninja's body tumbling off the back of the car.

     Maslow's gnarled sedan bottoms out in a starburst of

     Shuriken sizzle past; some missing, some lashing open

97   EXT. WINGED VICTORY ROUNDABOUT - NIGHT                        97

     Raizo pulls free the shuriken in his side. Drops them to
     the ground where they clatter back and forth like so much
     tossed change. He looks up at winged victory silhouetted
     against the moonlight.

     And suddenly the ninja are on him.

     Raizo blocks and parries. Counterattacks with a reverse
     cut - and throws himself sideways as a truck comes
     roaring down at him.

     The truck fills the screen with lights and horns and
     three tons of death.

     Raizo cartwheels over the hood, forcing the Scarred Ninja
     to leap the other way, and as he turns --

     sparks flying.

     Raizo is tired, already wounded by the shuriken...

     With a cry, he hurls a second Ninja back and spins to
     face Takeshi...

     Too late. Takeshi's blade gets under his guard.       Opens
     up Raizo's side.

     His sword is ripped free from his hand, rebounds off a
     speeding sedan and clatters to the ground thirty feet
     away.

     Raizo gets into the car. Collapses into the seat, arms
     wrapped tight around the ugly wound in his side. She
     peels away before the others can stop her.

     Mika carves a path through the traffic, driving as fast
     as she can. Eager to get more miles between them and the
     ninjas.

     Raizo lets out a gasp as the car goes over a bump.        His
     shirt is drenched with his own blood.

      screened walls.

      Raizo is watching Kiriko who seems to be sleeping.

      In a flash of lightning, her eyes open and she stares at
      him and he feels in hi heart what she is saying goodbye.

      The flashing ends and as the thunder booms, she is gone,

      Kiriko's body is twisted, bound to a pole like one of the
      Bonsai trees.

      hear her heart pounding.

      A bucket of water slaps Raizo awake.

      He's bound to a pole in the middle of the courtyard by
      thick rope that bites into his flesh.

      Ozunu stands before him, as well as the rest of the clan,
      down to the youngest of them. Watching silently.

      He looks the same as he has in the flashbacks - except
      that now an ugly scar runs diagonally across the length
      of his face. Trace of Raizo's blade from atop the
      building in Dubai.

      When he speaks, Ozunu is speaking for the benefit of the
      rest of the clan as to Raizo.

                                  OZUNU
                   You are Ozunu. Your life is
                   meaningless compared to the

                   me.

      He takes a knife, and very carefully cuts out a very
      small piece of Raizo's flesh, from the upper arm. Raizo
      doesn't cry out.

                   will watch as the birds fight over
                   the pieces.

      He STRIKES Raizo as he did long ago, his hand jutting
      deep inside gut, flicking switches of nerves that cause
      instant agony. This time Raizo does cry out.

      wrack the young man's body. Blood burbles up through his
      mouth and flows down his chin.

      away as --

      A reinforced military Humvee crashes through the cloud of
      splintering timber with a roar and an explosion of

      The Ozunu Clan scatters as the massive vehicle heaves
      into the courtyard, revealing behind it still more
      vehicles, all equipped with brilliant lights.

      The ninjas take to the shadows, trying to melt away, but

      Maslow takes aim with his submachine gun and squeezes off
      a long burst.

      Takeshi blocks some of the slugs with his sword and
      dodges the others. He slides into one of the few
      remaining shadows.

      Raizo continues into the next hall to find --

      -- Takeshi waiting for him. An apparition in the
      wavering blaze of heat, silhouetted against a wall of
      fire.

                               TAKESHI
                Come, little brother, let us play
                like old times

      They spring at other. Meeting in the middle of the
      hallway as the flames dance around them...recalling the
      lanterns they used to fight through, in the days of their
      training.

      Their weapons ring out a frenzied drum roll of steel on
      steel. Neither giving an inch. Evenly matched in skill
      and ferocity. Locking together for a moment Takeshi
      smiles.

                              TAKESHI (CONT'D)
                No death tasted as sweet as hers.

      Raizo's back glistens orange in the firelight, sweat
      pouring as he strains, attacks, defends and attacks
      again.

      Takeshi jumps over them, twists mid-air and ducks low
      beneath Raizo's swinging chain as --

      -- Raizo stumbles back on the polished floor, blocking
      Takeshi's attack, but --

      -- Takeshi catches his wrist in an iron grip. As he
      brings his sword around, Raizo gets a loop of chain
      around the blade and locks it tight.

      Both men spin in their sudden embrace.   Faces inches from
      each other.

                              TAKESHI (CONT'D)
                I watched you die when I pierced
                her heart. You have always been
                too weak to be Ozunu.

      Takeshi's finger trips a hidden button on the sword.

      The blade retracts back through the handle and a yard of
      steel jolts out from the hilt of Takeshi's sword.

      He moves to slam it into Raizo's side...but Raizo FLIPS
      over him, holding onto the hilt and as he lands he --

      -- DRIVES the steel into Takeshi's heart. He still
      stands for a BEAT, more by inertia than will, then
      slumps, dead, to the floor.

      Raizo stalks down the hall.    One last task ahead of him.


117   INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE NIGHTINGALE FLOOR/MASTERS      117
      ROOM/ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

      Raizo walks across the Nightingale floor, his bloody
      footprints moving soundlessly.

      From the shadows he hears Ozunu's voice

                                 OZUNU
                   You have not forgotten your
                   training. You will always be
                   mine, child.

      Raizo stops, considers this, then continues; his
      footsteps now bringing every sound possible.

      Ozunu steps out of the darkness, as though shrugging off
      a cloak of midnight.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                   Perhaps this is the best way for
                   you to die.

      His blade rises as like a Cobra's hood, while the chain
      blade begins to spin.

                                 RAIZO
                   The breath I take after you are
                   dead, will be the first of my
                   life.

      Raizo unleashes all his fury: The chain cutting with the
      power of an enormous buzz saw--

      Hacking timbers in half--

      Carving scars in the floors and walls--

      Braziers are thrown, fumes begin to spread but--

      Raizo begins to weaken. An attack misses wrapping a beam
      and Ozunu has his opening-

      His assault is ferocious.

      Wounds begin opening like windows shears of blood
      billowing out.

      Raizo retreats, his chain just blocking, catching, or
      deflecting the whirlwind attack until--

      One sound cuts through the furious fight.

      Snap-zoom to Ozunu's ear as--

      The hammer is cocked, a cylinder spinning into place.

                                   MIKA
                   Die you fuck!

      She fires and Ozunu twists enough so that the bullet
      grazes him.

                   Bitch!

      A scatter shot of shurikens send her diving to the floor.
      But the distraction gives Raizo his chance.

      The blade whistles, the chain snaps and blood arcs out of
      Ozunu.

      Rage thunders the hall.

      Mika gets back up and aims but--

      Ozunu seems to pull the shadows and smoke around him as
      he disappears.

      She cannot see him.

      Ozunu's attack hits Raizo with the force of a bomb burst,
      his blade shatters through Raizo's chain--

      Hurling him back, petals of blood fluttering from his
      chest.

      Raizo tries to recover, his chain now in two pieces.

                                  RAIZO

                   Get away!

      Ozunu emerges from the smoke behind her, a wraith. His
      eyes are as black as the sockets of a skull.

      She spins around but is too late.

      The ancient blade runs straight through her chest just as-
      -

      Raizo finds them.

      He sees Kiriko, the same blade taking her life and howls--

      His pain a force of nature unleashed.

      The chain blades crackle in the air-

      Dual cyclones that batter Ozunu's parrying blade which-

      Finally shatters against Raizo's fury.

      And with a final scream, Raizo lunges at his master, the
      whistling blades lazering through his body until he
      separates, pieces hanging in mid-air, like an unstitched
      rag doll.

      Raizo throws down the blood slick blades and--

      --hurries to Mika's side. He picks Mika up and walks
      through the falling timbers and blazing shards to the
      door.

      Raizo puts his hand on her chest. Closes his eyes.          We
      can FEEL her heart-beat. Bump-thump. Bump-thump.

      Raizo opens his eyes.
