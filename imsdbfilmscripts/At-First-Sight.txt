AT FIRST SIGHT

EXT. VALLEY - DUSK
 
Gold light dappling across a valley that seems to reach on forever. 
We ease back, revealing more - taking in the visual feast - finally 
discovering a seated figure facing out over the valley - a DOG at 
his feet. 

VIRGIL ANDERSON, life ahead of him - someone seemingly at ease with 
himself. As we watch. him a moment - SOUNDS become prominent - 
whistle of the wind through the grass - a bird's wings as it takes 
flight - a tree branch creaking under its own weight. And as he sits 
there, listening, we see the last rays of sunlight slip from the 
day. 

BLACK - and our TITLES come up. 

Then out of the darkness come a pair of HEADLIGHTS. - and we're: 

EXT. NEW YORK TURNPIKE - INTO PINECREST - DUSK 

An old BMW 2002 making its way up the Taconic Parkway. 

INT. BMW - DUSK 

On the radio: Whitney Houston's "I'll Always Love You". AMY TREMONT, 
30's, driving, on the phone. 

AMY
I'm lost Betsy, and you know me - 
I don't wear lost well - wait, wait I'm losing you...
(the cell phone glitches)
I'm pulling over before you disappear forever.


Amy pulls off the side of the road. Wrestles with a map and the 
phone. 

AMY
Sign? I was looking for a sign? There's no...


Her attention is caught by something off camera. She stares out into 
the night.. 

HER POV - A small iced over pond - and in the middle - moving about 
is Virgil, ICE SKATING - hockey stick in hand - moving about the 
rink with an imaginary puck. 

AMY (O.S.)
(distracted)
Yes... I took the first ..... no, no, I'm listening...


Virgil winds up and takes a slap at the ice with his stick - throws 
his hands up in the air like he just scored. 

Amy smiles, peers off down the road. A sign: BEAR MTN. SPA AND 
RESORT 1.4 miles. 

AMY
Wait, I got it - yeah. No don't call me.. right, 
unless you hear from Atlanta. And fax me the 
designs - I want to tinker with them a bit more
... I'm going to rest - bye - I'll see you in a week.


Beep she hangs up. Looks back out to the pond. It's empty. Shrugs - 
about to pull out - that love song still blaring. 

AMY
Oh p-lease, Whitney.


CLICK - she shuts off the radio - and pulls back out onto the road. 

EXT. BEAR MTN. HEALTH SPA - NIGHT 

Amy pulling luggage out of her car. She takes a breath - clearly 
she's exhausted - and starts towards the entrance. 

INT. BEAR MTN. HEALTH SPA - RECEPTION DESK - NIGHT 

Amy at the front desk with the Night Manager CAROLINE, 30'S, 
annoyingly fit. 

CAROLINE
Â… we have a full weight room, lifecycles, 
stairmasters, a spa, yoga, aerobics, spin classes...


AMY
I'm really just looking for a quick fix, here. 
Do you have anything that just involves lying down?


CAROLINE
A massage.


AMY
Great. I'll have one a day. Not too early.


INT. BEAR MTN. - MASSAGE WAITING AREA - NEXT DAY 

Amy enters, wearing sweats, she checks her watch - looks toward a 
closed door - about to grab a magazine when she hears from behind 
the door: 

WOMAN'S VOICE
Virgil, Oh God..., right there. Yes.


Amy's interest piques - the woman's murmur continuing - deep 
ecstasy. 

WOMAN'S VOICE
Yes there - a bit more...
(a small bell DINGS)
--wait - wait, you can't stop - one more minute - noo! 

VIRGIL'S VOICE
Sorry, Susan - time's up. 
I've got someone waiting.


And the door opens - and we see a woman, 60's, 
SUSAN, Bette Midler type, backing out of the room. 

SUSAN
Virgil, you have to come live with me.


VIRGIL'S VOICE
And what would your husband say? 
Amy, you out there? - c'mon in.


SUSAN
That's it - I'm getting a divorce.


Amy smiles as she passes Susan and enters. 

INT. VIRGIL'S MASSAGE ROOM - DAY 

Virgil has his back to us as he prepares the table. The room is very 
ordered - every vial, bottle, towel has its exact spot. 

VIRGIL
Hey, Amy, I'm Virgil - why don't you 
get ready - hop up on the table.


Amy sees Virgil - his head turned slightly away - she drops her 
sweats and lies on the table, face down - pulling the sheet to cover 
herself. 

AMY
Sounds like you're a genius at this.


VIRGIL
(laughs)
That's right.. Mozart, Einstein, Virgil Anderson, massage therapist. 
Now I'm going to start working somewhat deep -
you let me know if you want anything deeper.


AMY
Deeper is good - where I come from, 
all you get is shallow.


VIRGIL
I like that - deep it is.


CLICK - he hits a button on a CD player and as we hear the soulful 
aria "Mira, 0 Norma" from Bellini's Norma. 

VIRGIL
First time in Pinecrest?


AMY
Came in late last night.. 
missed the town completely.


VIRGIL
If you came in broad daylight, 
you could still miss the town completely.


DISSOLVE TO:

Slow moving cuts of Virgil, working long strokes over Amy's body - - 
his hands gracefully LENGTHENING and STRETCHING her muscles. 

VIRGIL
Too much compute? work.


AMY
Uh-huh.


VIRGIL
Bad chair - you should think about a change.


AMY
(quiet)
Absolutely.


Virgil reaches his hands all the way down her spine and makes a move 
that causes Amy to release a very deep guttural sound. 

VIRGIL
Too deep?


AMY
No.. ..... just right.


Amy is now lost in another world - as Virgil shifts - working gently 
- not caressing - but molding - like a sculptor. 

A moment and Amy, surprisingly, begins to cry - softly. Virgil stops 
- takes a step back. 

VIRGIL
I - I'm sorry - it was too deep...


She cries for another few beats - then takes a breath. 

AMY
No - it.. It's not you..
It's just things have kinda built up, 
I don't know why I'm crying.. look, 
this is embarrassing...


VIRGIL 
Don't be embarrassed - 
you obviously needed it. 
We should stop for today.


AMY
Yeah, thanks.
You always make the girls cry.


VIRGIL
Not since grade school. 
I'm going to go now - unless you'd like me to stay.


AMY
Could you - just for a minute?


VIRGIL
Of course, whatever you need.


Virgil sits next to her - then reaches out - takes her hand and 
starts a slow comforting massage - we see Amy visibly relax. 

AMY
You ever feel like a Martian's
invaded your entire body?


VIRGIL
Every day.


Amy, closes her eyes - smiling slightly in thanks. 

INT. VIRGIL'S MASSAGE ROOM - LATER 

CAMERA pans slowly over to Amy asleep - and on the click of the door 
- her eyes dreamily open. 

AMY
Virgil?


INT. BEAR MTN. HEALTH SPA - LATE DAY 

Hallway outside the massage area. Amy exits the change room, now 
wearing her sweats - pulling on her sneakers. 

VIRGIL (O.S.)
(calling out)
Hey Caroline, you look incredible today.


CAROLINE (O.S.)
(laughing)
Quite a compliment, Virgil. See ya tomorrow.


VIRGIL (O.S.)
See ya.


Amy looks down the hall - sees a glimpse of Virgil rounding the 
corner. She chases after hi~n into the reception area where she sees 
him exiting the door and moving of f down the driveway. 

AMY
Virgil - wait...


He's gone. Hopping along, tugging on her last sandal - she decides 
to go after him - fighting her way through a large tour group just 
checking in. 

EXT. BEAR MTN. SPA - LATE DAY 

Virgil in the distance, moving his way towards the main street. Amy 
exiting the building - trying not to slip on the ice as she, hurries 
after him - trying to get close enough to call out. 

Virgil stops at a main roadway as Amy comes up behind him. 

AMY
Virgil, hey.


Virgil turns - sunglasses on - looks directly at Amy. 

VIRGIL
Yes.


AMY
It's Amy - Amy Tremont.


VIRGIL
Of course - you were sleeping, 
didn't want to wake you.


AMY
Yes thanks - you're the skater, right - 
I saw you last night, coming in. 
Pretty mean slapshot. 
You play on some team or something?


VIRGIL
Yeah, something. You a hockey fan?


AMY
Always liked it - never get around to 
seeing a game. But I loved to skate 
as a kid - unfortunately I have two left feet.


VIRGIL
(playing with her) 
They look perfectly OK with me.


Amy laughs, starts relaxing - unconsciously starts to flirt. Head 
cocked, shifts her weight on one foot, moving slightly closer. 

AMY
I love the view you get here.


VIRGIL
Same here - I never get used to it.


Just then a YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up in front of him and WHOOSH 
the doors pop open revealing CARL KIPLING, black, a hundred years 
old. Virgil turns as a few kids pile off the bus.. 

VIRGIL
Well, this is my ride. 
Hey Tommy, my man.


And with his hand extended a kid high fives it. Amy looks up - a BUS 
full of young school kids. Seems odd. 

TOMMY
Virge.


As the kid moves off. 

AMY
Well, I just wanted to apologize for back there - 
blubbering like that - I was just in a weird place.


VIRGIL
And now...


AMY
Now, I'm fine - so I wanted to 
thank- you. For what you did.


VIRGIL
For making you cry.


AMY
No, I made me cry - and you handled 
it great - didn't freak or anything.
(beat)
Is my mascara smeared or something?


VIRGIL
(laughs)
No. Why?


AMY
You're just looking at me funny.


CARL
Virgil - lets move it.


VIRGIL
As I said earlier - I just never get used to the view.


Virgil starts towards the bus, reaching behind to his pack. Pulls 
something out. 

VIRGIL
See you tomorrow.


And CLICK, CLICK, CLICK - a WHITE CANE unfolds in his hand. And he 
taps his way to the bus. 

AMY
See you... oh my God.


VIRGIL
What?


AMY
You're, you're -- I'm so sorry.


VIRGIL
(smile)
Hey, you already apologized once 
- no need to overdo it. Bye now.


Amy doesn't know how to respond. And he moves into the front seat of 
the bus - amongst "Hey Virgil's" from the school kids and Ca-chunk 
the doors close - the Yellow Bus steaming off - past Amy, as she 
stares at Virgil in the front seat - about to wave to him - then 
realizing he wouldn't see. 

As she turns and watches the bus move off down the street - a hand 
comes out - Virgil's - and waves good-bye. 

EXT. VIRGIL'S HOME.- DUSK 

The BUS stopping in front of Virgil's home - a side-by-side DUPLEX 
at the edge of surrounding woods. 

Virgil steps into the street and with a HONK the bus pulls away. He 
turns, grazes his hand across a tree out front - and starts towards 
his home. 

AT THE PORCH - he hesitates at the first door. Finds it with his 
hand - then raps on it. 

No answer. He moves over to his own door - and goes inside. 

INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - EVENING 

As he enters, Sophie, an aging LAB, lays on the couch. 

VIRGIL
Get of f the couch, Sophie.


As the dog slides guiltily off the couch. 

VIRGIL
Some seeing eye dog - 
more like sleeping eye dog.


Virgil bends down as he passes the coffee table to pick up the 
REMOTE CONTROL placed just so. Click - a Game Show pops on. 

VIRGIL
Met a girl today - nice voice -
followed me out of the building.


Sophie barks. 

VIRGIL
No she wasn't a stalker.


CLOSE ON Virgil's hand flipping open a large book marked "TV HOCKEY 
SCHEDULE" - it's completely WHITE - all in BRAILLE. 

JENNIE (O.S.)
Sophie's just worried about you - 
she watches too many horror movies.


In the kitchen, JENNIE ANDERSON, older than Virgil, simply dressed, 
putting a just made dinner carefully onto a plate. 

VIRGIL
Hey, you're here - so how 
are the kids today?


Running his hand down the pure white page - he finds what he wants: 
BAP - he hits the channel changer and the game comes on. 

JENNIE
The usual - need a lot of attention. So who's the girl?


Moving into the kitchen, Virgil puts the remote to the side of the 
refrigerator where it VELCRO sticks to an exact spot. 

VIRGIL
From the spa. I made her cry.


JENNIE
You haven't done that since-- 


VIRGIL/JENNIE
-- grade school.


VIRGIL
(smile)
That's what I told her. Coke?


Virgil moves past Jennie as she goes into the living room - hand up, 
door open and he's got a glass. Back to the fridge, he grabs a coke. 

JENNIE
I'm fine. Your dinner's ready - chicken's 
at 3 o'clock - rice is at...


VIRGIL
6 o'clock, peas at 9 o'clock 
and news at 11.


Jennie places Virgil's dinner down in an exact spot on a coffee 
table (facing away from the TV). 

JENNIE
(laughs)
One day I'm going to switch them on you.


VIRGIL
And one day I'll play forward 
for the New York Rangers.


Four precise steps into the room and Virgil plops down on the sofa - 
finds his fork. Jennie moves to a counter where a pile of school 
books sit. 

JENNIE

Ha - ha. You need new jokes.


VIRGIL
Or a new sister. 

JENNIE
I'd work on the jokes.


Picking up the books she moves past Virgil - pecks him on the head 
and moves to the door. 

VIRGIL
You want to watch some hockey?


JENNIE
(at the door)
You want to grade some spelling tests? 
(beat)
I'll be next door you need me.


She leaves and Virgil pats the couch and Sophie hops up next to him. 

VIRGIL
You know this girl - for one moment -
she actually thought I could
(Sophie grumbles as she settles in) 
I'm not kidding. 
(beat) 
And she had this great voice - relaxing - 
soft like a breeze through
(beat)
Wonder what she thinks about "blind dates." 


INT. AMY'S ROOM - EVENING 

Amy in bed - just out of the shower - the only light in the room 
comes from the TV. She has the remote, mindlessly switching channels 
- not staying on one for more than a second or two. 

Click - an Odd Couple rerun - click - ESPN bowling - click - Three 
Stooges - Moe poking Curly in the eye - click - click - click. 

Bored, she stops - notices a small scarf on a chair next to the bed. 
She picks it up, holds it against her eyes and ties it tight around 
her head. 

She stands - hands out in front of her - starts to walk across the 
room - not so bad - WHAM - right into a side table. Shit that hurts! 
Grabbing her leg, she hops - hits a lamp. 

AMY
DAMMIT!


Ripping the towel of f her head - hopping around on one foot - she 
hears: 

KNOCK KNOCK 

AMY
Coming!


Rubbing her leg - she limps/half walks to the door - opens it to: 

Virgil: dark glasses, cane, smile 

AMY
Virgil..?


She pulls a towel in closer - then realizes it doesn't matter 

VIRGIL
My turn to apologize. I should have told 
you I was blind it wasn't fair.


AMY
That's OK. You want to come in -
I just got out of the shower - give me 
a minute to get changed?


VIRGIL
(as he moves in)
Sure, I promise I won't look.


As Amy starts to get changed in the bathroom. 

VIRGIL
Anyways, I was in the neighborhood -- 
actually the whole town's my neighborhood 
-- and since you've never been to our
illustrious village, I thought maybe we could 
go into town - see what we see.


AMY
See what we see?


VIRGIL
Figure of speech
. 

AMY
You mean right now, tonight?


VIRGIL
Great - I'm blind and you're deaf - what a pair.


EXT. MAIN STREET - EVENING 

A few store windows lit up. Some people eating dinner at a 
streetside cafe. Virgil, holding Amy's arm as they walk down the 
street. 

WITH AMY AND VIRGIL WALKING: 

VIRGIL
... the Mechanic at the top of the street is Doug - smokes too 
much - but a good guy. Three steps down is Carlson's hardware
- he's got a laugh like a donkey - we sometimes listen to games
together - he's a Devil's fan. And just up ahead should be Grady's 
junk shop - he calls it "antiques"...
Smells like junk. I'd hate to see what it looks like
. 

A woman bustles past, NANCY BENDER, weighed down with groceries. 

VIRGIL
(intuitively)
Hey Nancy.


NANCY
Hey Virgil - got that book in for you.


VIRGIL
Nancy's our librarian, brings in 
any braille book I want.


NANCY
(to Amy)
The guy's nuts about the pyramids -
anything he can get his hands on...


VIRGIL
Thank-you Nancy - you should get your
groceries home - your ice cream's melting.


Nancy laughs - as she moves off. 

AMY
Nice place - you seem to know everyone here.


VIRGIL
Moved here when I was eight. 
My family figured it would be a 
good place for me to grow up. 
Tell me what you see.


AMY
Well, there's a good structure to the 
town - genuine lines, good use of space. 
To be honest I'd find a better balance 
to a lot of these buildings. But that's me.


VIRGIL
What's you?


AMY
The architect in me - can't leave well
enough alone. Art school in college - 
I made the arms for the Venus DeMilo. 
(realizing he probably doesn't understand)
see, the Venus De Milo has no arms and...


VIRGIL
(laughs)
I know the Venus De Milo has no arms, and 
the Mona Lisa has this captivating smile
and David doesn't wear a fig leaf.


AMY
How do you...


VIRGIL
I may not have been a lot of places -
but I read about things, then make an
image up here -- (points to his head)
--that works for me.


Grazing his hand across a telephone pole - Virgil stops - turns to 
Amy. 

VIRGIL
This is the end of the street. 
We should turn back.


AMY
What about past the end of the street? 
What's out there?


He turns around. 

VIRGIL
(shrugs)
Nothing.


AMY
No - there's an old run down 
building off to the side...


VIRGIL
Must be the old firehouse. 
It had a fire so they shut it down. (Amy laughs)
Honest to God.
(intrigued)
What else do you see?


AMY
A wall of shrubs - 
a field with an interesting configuration of trees.


The wind has picked up a bit. 

VIRGIL
Tell me how you see it.


AMY
(enjoying the game)
OK, sure. Let's see - long and elegant. Like -- 
like a woman dancing with two lovers, trying 
to decide which one she loves.


Virgil stops a moment - takes in the image. 

AMY
What?


VIRGIL
It's just - the image you just 
gave me - "Dancing trees. - I like that.


Virgil stops - his head cocks slightly. 

VIRGIL
We should go - it's starting to rain.


AMY
(looking around) 
There's a bit of a breeze but-- 


KABOOM - thunder - and the rain just drops. 

INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT 

They run in laughing - Amy closing the door behind them as Virgil 
moves his way into the center of the room - stands where the 
moonlight from a high window hits the floor. Water runs down the 
outside glass, causing the light to ripple across him. The room is 
empty - almost surreal. 

AMY
I can't believe how fast it happens...

(she sees Virgil - his head cocked towards the ceiling) 

AMY
Virgil?


Virgil's head turns toward her. 

VIRGIL
You like rain - I love the rain.


AMY
(moving to him)
What were you just doing there?


Virgil slowly moves his head about, sensing the room. 

VIRGIL
Listening - the rain - it brings out the 
contours of everything, gives life to 
a room I can't see.


WE SEE SLOW MOVING CUTS of the building as Virgil describes what he 
hears. 

VIRGIL 
You hear it?...on the roof dripping down the 
walls on every side. On the right, on the 
drainpipe, it's drumming with a deeper, 
steadier sound - - like a timpani - echoing 
across the room - tells me the room is large 
- open. You feel it - in your chest? On the left, 
the rain says... (he listens)
...a fire escape, with it's own rhythm 
- ping - ping. Then listen - there...
(he points)
--what's that - over there...?


AMY
Looks like it's...


VIRGIL
No, listen for it - not what it 
looks like - what it becomes. 
Come here.


Amy moves closer - Virgil puts his hands out on her shoulders - 
turns her to the sound. 

VIRGIL
Now just listen to it - shut out
everything but that sound - 
do you hear it?


Amy strains to listen - closes her eyes - her head instinctively 
turning - no in unison with Virgil's 

AMY
Yes - there - it's soft - like a shimmer


VIRGIL
The wind blowing the rain against a window.


AMY
(smile)
Like a cymbal. It's like our own 
percussive symphony, isn't it?


Amy opens her eyes - looks about the room - listening. 

VIRGIL
The world is invisible to me - with my touch it comes 
alive. But only one thing at a time. But when it's raining,
I feel everything at once. Sometimes, I wish it could 
rain inside rain all around us.


AMY
(musing)
"Einfuehlung."


VIRGIL
What?


AMY
Einfuehlung - it's an architectural term. 
It means to share an empathy. 
Been a long time since I felt that.


And as they stand listening to the rain, playing its music - Amy 
watches him - fascinated by him - then shivers slightly. 

VIRGIL 
You're cold, we should go.


AMY
No, I'm fine, really. It was just something passing 
through me - can't explain it - a good thing.


Amy smiles at him - then quietly realizes 
he can't see it. She moves close, her 
hand reaching out and taking his. 

AMY
What you just showed me Â… how 
I feel - makes me smile.


She takes his hand - hesitates - then puts it on the side of her 
face. 

VIRGIL
I see it now. Thank-you.


We hold a beat - enjoying the symphony of rain - then cut to: 

EXT. BEAR MTN. LODGE - MORNING 

The sun warming the cool morning air. The school bus pulling away to 
reveal Virgil making his way into work. 

VIRGIL (V.O.)
I thought after yesterday, 
you'd never get up on my table again.


INT. MASSAGE ROOM - NEXT DAY 

Amy on the table. Virgil squirting oil in his hand - preparing. 

AMY
You kidding? today, I'm looking 
for a complete nervous breakdown.


VIRGIL
I love a challenge.


And as he places his palms carefully on her back - working her back 
slowly we hear opera play quietly in the background. 

DISSOLVE TO:
Virgil's hands on the small of her back - something amazingly 
sensual about how he works her muscles. Amy speaks to him in low 
tones - in a state of complete relaxation. 

AMY
Can I ask how long you've been blind?


VIRGIL
Of course, most people avoid the subject. You tell them 
you're blind and they act surprised. "You're blind? Reallv? 
I didn't know - you hide it so well." And then they wave their
hand in front of your face just to make sure.
(beat)
It started when I was a little over a year old.


Virgil's hands move down Amy's sides - slow - feeling each contour - 
the oil making her skin glisten. Amy moves her head slightly with 
his touch. She lets out a small breath of air. 

AMY
(quiet)
You see shadows?


VIRGIL
No. Congenital cataracts. And a case of retinitis 
pigmentosa thrown in for good measure. 
This area needs to loosen up.


AMY
I think you're doing it. 
(beat)
No bright lights, nothing?


VIRGIL
I'm blind as a bat. Actually, blinder 'cause they 
emit sonar all the time. I don't have a sixth sense,
I just don't have the fifth one. I can't hear things in 
Vermont, can't smell if you're mad at me, and, no 
- I don't know Helen Keller, Ray Charles or Stevie Wonder.


Amy murmurs in response to Virgil's touch. 

VIRGIL
You say something?


AMY
No, I just - this feels nice - too nice.


Virgil moves his hands down her back - sensually kneading each 
muscle. It's clear he's enjoying this as much as she is. 

AMY
You're very good.. at what you do.


Another breath exhales from her involuntarily as Virgil hits a 
sensitive spot. 

VIRGIL
Thank-you.


AMY
You enjoy it.


VIRGIL
At times. Some clients make it 
more enjoyable than others.


Virgil now works down her thighs - Amy's back arching slightly with 
the movement - both of them heating to the moment. Both their 
breaths quickening. 

AMY
And this client...


VIRGIL
Is very, very...


DING - and the spell is broken. 

AMY
What?


VIRGIL
Sorry - it's time. I've got Mr. Ketchum coming in next - 
all two hundred pounds. Sorry - I felt like we 
were just getting started.


Amy sits up on the table - the sheet pulling away slightly revealing 
her. For a moment she watches him - his head turned towards her - 
but not seeing. Then she slowly pulls the sheet up covering herself. 

AMY
Thank-you. For last night as 
well - love to do it again.


VIRGIL
How about I cook dinner then, tonight.


AMY
I'd like that.


INT. BEAR MIN. - NEXT DAY 

Aerobics step class. Amy working out. In front of her two rather 
large women in neon stretch workout clothes - Amy tries to avoid the 
view - a thought - and she shuts her eyes as she continues her 
exercise. 

INT. BEAR MTN. - NEXT DAY 

Amy, towel around her neck - coming in from the workout. 

CAROLINE
Amy Â…


INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - NIGHT 

Onions frying. Tilt up to Virgil - cutting the last of it and 
putting it in the pan - sizzling as it hits. Vegetables and a box of 
pasta are arranged on the countertop. Sophie watches the 
proceedings. 

RRRRINNNG - the phone. 

Virgil stops cutting - his hand easily finds the phone. 

INTERCUT WITH Â… 

Amy: on the phone in her car on the Taconic Parkway. 

AMY
Virgil - it's Amy. I - I can't make dinner - 
I'm really sorry - an emergency came up - 
they're dragging me back to New York.


VIRGIL
Oh. Yeah. Anything serious?


AMY
The project we were working on was rejected - 
could go down the drain. I'll deal with it quick - 
I'd like to come back.


VIRGIL
Yeah. Good. Well. I'll be here.


Virgil hangs up the phone - frustrated, he reaches for the frying 
pan - and promptly burns his hand. 

VIRGIL
-DAMN IT!!!


Dropping the pan - Sophie goes scurrying, as he kicks at it - 
sending it across the room. He turns - thrusts his hand under the 
sink - turning on the cold water. 

VIRGIL
Shit - that was stupid.


EXT. FLATIRON DISTRICT - LATE DAY 

Evening rush hour traffic surrounding the Flatiron building. 

VOICE (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
I'm just saying there seems to be something missing.

INT. ROSWELL-TREMONT DESIGN - DAY 

A small cardboard model of what looks like a small mini-mall. Amy 
sits in front of it - drawing on a sketch pad. The office is sparse, 
functional. A few DRAFTSMEN can be seen in the background through a 
glass partition. 

DUNCAN
Absolutely Mr. Falk - something lj missing - we realize that now. We 
just need some time to figure out what.


DUNCAN ROSWELL, 30's, leaning a little too ardently into a speaker 
phone. The voice on the other end is JACK FALK - their would be 
employer. Their assistant BETSY ERNST, early 20's, sits in the 
corner, taking notes. 

FALK 
Fine - but you all know what kind of schedule we're on here?


DUNCAN
(watching Amy)
And budget. Yes sir. Don't worry, we won't let you down.


She takes a piece of paper, has an idea, starts sketching - Duncan 
hangs up. 

DUNCAN
Don't say it, I know. You were never happy with the design.


AMY 
I wasn't going to say that.


DUNCAN
But you'd have tinkered with it till the job went away. So now we've 
got him hooked, you've got your second chance.


And Amy shoves her rough sketch across the table. 

AMY
Look at these site photos - see those 
trees - we were going to get rid of them 
- let's incorporate them into the design 
use what's natural about the location. 
(Duncan stares at her) 
And by the way - the 53rd St. lobby - coming 
back from Pinecrest, I came up with a new 
addition - add some life to that place.


Duncan stares at the sketch - then looks up at Amy 

DUNCAN 
OK -- what's going on here? We sent Hydra 
the three headed monster off a few days ago 
and got back Mary Poppins in return.


AMY
What? I can't have a couple of ideas. 
(even Betsy stares at her)
Fine, you want to know - I met a guy.

Betsy stands. 

BETSY 
Too modern for me.


DUNCAN 
Sit down.Betsy. We're all friends here. 
So - spill the beans.


AMY 
Nothing to spill - he's a good guy - 
smart, funny, blind...
DUNCAN 
Whoa, whoa - wait a minute - Blind!? 
Like tap-tap, white cane blind? Come on 
Amy - I mean, I know you like 
challenges, hell you married me - but...


AMY 
I knew you'd be understanding.


DUNCAN 
(standing) 
No, no I am. You're right, this is none 
of my business anymore - but a blind
guy? If you're lonely - in my. opinion 
-- get a puppy.


BETSY 
Duncan, don't be a jerk.


DUNCAN 
You still work here.


He's gone. 

BETSY 
He's just jealous.


AMY
So much for the "we're all friends here" idea.


INT. ROSWELL-TREMONT OFFICES - NIGHT 

CLOSE ON - Computer screen. A cursor blinks - then the words 
CONGENITAL BLINDNESS - a CLICK and a web page for the AMERICAN 
BRAILLE INSTITUTE comes up. 

WIDE - we see Amy hovering over her computer - various sketches of 
the proposed building next to her - two giant Magnolia trees have 
been incorporated into the design. As we watch her search on the 
computer we move over her shoulder to see in the corner of her plans 
- a sketch of the intertwined "dancing trees" and the Firehouse. 

Betsy enters carrying her jacket. 

BETSY 
Everybody's gone for the day.


AMY 
Thanks. You go ahead - I'm just finishing 
up something here.


She turns to look at Betsy who now peers over her shoulder - sees 
what she's doing. Amy looks up at her - sees Betsy's look. 

AMY 
What? I just want to know a little more 
about what's wrong with him.


BETSY 
(pause) 
Amy? Friend to friend?


AMY 
Shoot


BETSY
I hate to admit it but I agree 
with Duncan on this one.
AMY
(back to the computer) 
Don't shoot.
BETSY
He makes sense sometimes. My father had 
a problem a few years back with severe 
cataracts. Do you have any idea what 
you're getting into?


Amy spins in her chair - looks to Betsy. 

AMY 
You ever listened to rain - 
I mean really listened?


BETSY 
This like that smell the roses thing?


AMY
(turns to her) 
I've spent the last five years of my adult 
life with a man who has the emotional 
content of a soap dish. The only time I 
saw him cry was doing our tax return three 
years ago.
(beat) 
I need more than that, Betsy. For once in a 
long, long time I feel like I can breathe again. 
Just the way he touches me I know I found 
someone I can connect with.


BETSY 
Ah, here we go.


AMY 
No, no. I can tell he's sensing everything about 
me with a simple touch. He listens to my every 
word as if it's the only sound on the planet - 
I feel like even though he can't see me, he knows 
everything about me. He just moves me - does that 
sound crazy.


BETSY 
(beat) 
Does he have a brother?

EXT: PINE CREST MOUNTAINS - LATE DAY 

The FROZEN POND, nestled against a strand of pine. Virgil skates 
fast across the ice enjoying the speed - the wind using his hockey 
stick as a guide - he nears the edge of pond - feels it with the 
stick and slams to a stop. 

He shuffles his body around to face in the other direction - then 
starts skating again - passing AMY standing on the snow covered 
bank. 

ON AMY - smiling, watching Virgil - enjoying his release of energy. 

HER POV - VIRGIL - skating well, a look of relaxation we've never 
seen on his face. He skates in an arc coming back past Amy. 

Finally she speaks. 

AMY 
Wayne Gretzky, look out.


Virgil slams to a halt in surprise - nearly toppling over. 

AMY 
Sorry -- sorry. 
Didn't mean to scare you.


VIRGIL 
Amy?!


AMY 
I said I'd come back.


VIRGIL 
How long ... how long have you been...?


AMY 
Watching you? Just got here - 
couldn't find you at the spa - took
a chance you'd be here. You're very good.


VIRGIL 
Skated since I was a kid. My dad taught me 
- wanted me to play pro one day. 
How do you like my pond?
AMY
It's beautiful.


VIRGIL 
Describe it for me.
AMY
OK. Let's see. Like cool 
blue silk - you know blue?


VIRGIL 
I think so - keep going.


AMY 
Blue silk stretched tight across 
a bowl - surrounded by white 
jacketed sentries of trees on 
the horizon, protecting it from 
the outside world.


VIRGIL 
Horizon's a tough one.


AMY 
What?


VIRGIL 
Never understood horizon - if touch it - 
don't know what it that's OK I liked 
the rest of picture. 
(he starts moving towards her) 
You want to skate?


AMY 
Sorry, I didn't bring my skates.


VIRGIL 
Don't need them. Come on step hold of my stick.


AMY 
Excuse me?


VIRGIL
(smile) 
Hockey stick. Here.


He holds the stick out like a cross bar. Amy moves cautiously 
forward and takes hold of it. 

VIRGIL 
OK. Now hold on for balance. 
I used to do this with Jennie when we were kids.


And Virgil starts skating backwards pulling Amy with him. Amy is 
apprehensive at first then starts to enjoy the movement - the 
sensation - both of them laughing out loud. 

WIDE as we see them move about the rink - Amy sliding and being 
pulled by Virgil. As he picks up speed we hear Amy scream in 
delight. 

AMY 
Look out - we're running out of ice.


Virgil turns expertly, arcing around the edge of the ice but Amy 
loses her nerve - and balance - and lets go of the stick and goes 
flying into an embankment. The momentum carries Virgil off down the 
ice - both of them laughing hysterically. 

VIRGIL 
You OK?


AMY 
Fine. Never been dumped so fast in my life.


VIRGIL 
Me, dump you? No way. Stay where you are 
- I'll come to you - just keep talking.


Amy sits up on her elbows in the embankment. 

AMY 
What do I say?


Virgil starts gliding across the ice searching for Amy. 

VIRGIL 
(hearing her voice, veering in her direction) 
Anything - how'd you become an architect?


AMY 
God - let's see - I was in college - 
art school - a little aimless - and I met
this guy -. an architect - opened up a new 
world to me. I liked the structure the 
control - finding problems, coming up with 
solutions - when I graduated - we started 
a company together - on impulse got married
- which was crazy - divorced a year ago - 
but we're still partners.. which must seem
even crazier.


And Virgil's suddenly there - going a little too far - tumbling off 
the pond and into her. 

VIRGIL 
You'd think I meant to do that. 
A patented move.


They're close - in the snow together - face to face. 

AMY
(Amy smiles, realizes) 
This is tough.


VIRGIL 
What?


AMY 
I bat my eyelashes, toss my head just 
right, and there's this very sexy thing 
I do with my eyes - then realize none of 
it matters to you.


VIRGIL 
It doesn't matter. 
Tell me what you look like.


AMY 
I.. .1 don't know I'm...


VIRGIL 
Wait. Let me.


He puts his hand out, over her face -- hesitates, then slowly feels 
down the contours of her cheek, her eyelids, the shape of her lips - 
Amy moving with the touch, the sensuality of it - and as he 
continues - Amy's hand reaches up - touching his face - Virgil 
smiles. 

VIRGIL 
Eyes, mouth, chin, cheek.. 
you are very beautiful.


AMY 
Thank-you. So are you - more than 
I could describe.


Virgil's hands move down her face - closing her eyes - letting her 
just experience his touch - his exploring. 

And as both their hands continue, enjoying the sensation of 
discovering each other - Amy leans forward, her eyes still closed, 
finding his mouth - grazing his lips with her own - softly, gently, 
then they fold into each other's arms locked into a warm, deep kiss. 

INT. VIRGIL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 

It's dark - a pale moonglow highlights the two intertwined naked 
bodies. A fire burns in the background. In flowing CUTS we see them 
make love: 

Virgil - his head tilted down - Amy - puts her hand to his chin - 
lifts his head - then kisses each of his closed eyelids in rhythm 
with Virgil's movements. 

Amy - now astride Virgil - she closes her eyes - feels it the way 
Virgil would - moving faster now - in total rhythm - shuddering in 
mutual release -- and she collapses on top of him - a deep breath 
and she rolls over - cuddles into his arm. 

A long beat - out of breath: 

AMY 
So -- that's what a blind date is.


They breathe - then both start laughing - quietly - then 
hysterically together as Virgil wraps her up in his arms - holding 
her tightly. 

EXT. PINECREST - DAWN 

The horizon. The sun cresting it - bringing a new light to the day. 

INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - EARLY MORNING Sounds of a shower in the 
background. Amy in Virgil's robe, pulls a juice container out of the 
fridge - pours herself a glass, putting the juice on the counter as 
she walks into the living room - taking in the sparseness of his 
surroundings. 

CLOSE ON - an open Braille Book. The completely white pages with 
minute bumps. Amy pulls up a chair, sits - and flips through the 
book, running her hand across the pages - trying to understand his 
world. 

She then turns to the front cover to see what it is. Playboy. 

We hear the shower stop as Amy smiles, puts the book down - pushes 
the chair aside then moves to a series of pictures on the wall: 

Virgil as a young boy - his sister Jennie a few years older - and 
his mother and father. Then another picture next to it - Virgil in 
his skates and Jennie older - no father - Sophie at their feet. 

And a final picture - Virgil as an adult - he and Jennie on the 
front porch - his arms wrapped around his sister like he's never 
going to let go. 

VOICE (O.S.) 
Hello?


Amy turns to see - Jennie, carrying a bag under her arm. 

AMY 
Hello.


Jennie moves towards the kitchen. 

JENNIE 
I'm Jennie, Virgil's sister. 
And you are..?


Virgil steps out - bathrobe - drying his hair. 

VIRGIL
Jen, this is Amy Tremont.


Jennie now at the kitchen - stares at the juice container - places 
it back in the fridge - just so. 

JENNIE
I was just at the market Virgil, 
picking up a few things before 
school - and I thought you might like some...


VIRGIL 
(smells) 
Apples and bananas.
Amy sees the fruit on the counter - impressed. 

JENNIE 
He's being a show-off, Amy - I always bring him these. 
(putting them in the fridge) 
The apples are on the bottom shelf...


VIRGIL 
At two o'clock. Oranges at 10. 
I know, thanks.


JENNIE 
Amy -- you in town long...


And WHAM - Virgil moving into the room, collides right into the 
chair Amy moved - knocking into a lamp sending it to the ground. 
Jennie immediately rushes over. 

AMY 
Virgil?


VIRGIL 
I'm fine.


JENNIE 
No you're not - you're bleeding. 
(turning to Amy, sudden) 
First lesson with a blind man, 
Amy - don't change anything - 
it's too dangerous


AMY 
(moving to Virgil)
I'm sorry - I didn't know...


VIRGIL
It was my fault. I'm OK.


Jennie still dabbing at his leg. 

VIRGIL
(embarassed, snaps) 
Goddamit, Jennie - I said I was OK 
- leave me alone!


Jennie hesitates, then stands to go - sees the hockey book out of 
place. A glance to Amy and she picks it up - quietly moves it back 
to it's rightful spot. 

JENNIE 
I've got parent meetings tonight - 
there's dinner in the freezer - left corner.
(turns to Amy) 
Nice to have met you, Amy.


AMY 
Me too - and again - I'm sorry.


And she's gone - leaving Amy and Virgil together - a moment of 
awkwardness. 

AMY 
She seemed ... nice.


VIRGIL 
She seemed jealous.


AMY 
Your leg is still bleeding.


VIRGIL 
It'll stop - happens all the time. 
Welcome to my world.
We hold on Amy - taking this in: 

INT. BEAR MTN. - LATER THAT NIGHT 

Japanese lanterns criss-cross across an open area. Guests of the spa 
mingle about - drinks in hand - some dance on a floor set up over 
the aerobics area. Music plays in the background. 

Amy, carrying two trays of food, finds her way to where Virgil sits 
at a table off to the side - putting his food in front of him. 

AMY 
Let's see if I can get this right. 
Chicken's at three - salad at seven - 
vegetables at ten.


VIRGIL 
(picking up his fork) 
Very good - thank-you.


AMY 
This is nice. 
They do this every weekend?


VIRGIL 
Every Friday - for the guests leaving. Supposed to make them want to 
come back.


AMY 
(sits, uneasy) 
Love the music - 
Gershwin - makes you want to...


She stops. Virgil, fork poised over his food, senses her 
uncomfortableness. 

VIRGIL 
You like dancing?


AMY 
Hmmm? Yeah - don't do it much. 
(changing subject) 
Chicken's good.


Amy resumes eating - Virgil's fork spears something on his plate - 
raising it to his mouth - both we and Amy now see it's a large pat 
of butter. Too late - it's in his mouth. 

Amy watches him - the reaction on his face as he tastes it - then 
surreptitiously swallows it. Then realizes Amy saw him. 

VIRGIL 
Nothing like a good pat of fat. 
What do you say we dance?


AMY 
No, really, I'm fine...


Virgil is up - pulling her hand. 

VIRGIL 
Come on


She stands and Virgil puts his hands on the back of her shoulders. 

VIRGIL 
Lead on.


And as she ushers him to the floor the music changes - a salsa - 
lively. Amy stops: 

AMY 
Different piece - maybe we should...


VIRGIL 
You kidding - take my hand.


And as she does - Virgil starts dancing to the music - feeling the 
beat - in perfect rhythm but his moves are his own, something we've 
never seen before - uninhibited, wild - a little funny, but also 
there's something sensual in his abandonment. 

All Amy can do is hang on for the ride - enjoying Virgil enjoying 
himself. People even clear back a little to give him some room - 
however he moves about the floor easily - somehow sensing where the 
other couples are. 

It's a whirlwind moment - a moment where the two of them get lost 
with each other - for a second shutting out the world and it's just 
them, the music and their movement. 

Then suddenly the music is over. And they stop - the moment gone. 
Virgil turns to Amy and she applauds Virgil's wild moves 

He takes a bow with a flourish. Spins to another angle - another 
bow. Spins back again - a step back and: 

CRASSSH - he's into the buffet table - sliding to the ground - food 
spilling on top of him. Amy, can't help but laugh, rushes to him. 

AMY 
You have to teach me that move.


And Amy reaches down to his guacamole covered hand - and pulls him 
up into an embrace and as they kiss amidst sauce and salad dressing 
- we see: 

INT. AMY'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING 

Amy - on the phone - looking out her window. 

AMY 
Betsy - you were telling me about your father, 
his cataracts - you said he had a problem. 
How is he now? 
(she listens) 
Doctor - Dr. Aaron? - do you have his number?


INT. BEAR MTN. GYM - DAY 

A handful of people on various pieces of equipment. Virgil, tank 
top, heavy sweat, on a stationary bicycle - working out. Amy next to 
him on a treadmill - trying to keep up as Caroline from the front 
desk comes and hands her something. 

Amy reads it briefly then hops off the treadmill moving to Virgil. 

AMY
Virgil, I just got some great news.


VIRGIL 
(picking up speed again)
The Atlanta project?


AMY
No, no - I was talking to my assistant 
this morning - her father had these 
severe cataracts...


VIRGIL 
(slowing) 
Oh. Really.


AMY
She put me in touch with a Dr. Richard 
Aaron - the guy's the leading eye surgeon
on the eastern seaboard - he's been working 
with techniques - I don't know all the jargon 
- but I spoke to him earlier on the phone 
at the Institute...


VIRGIL 
You called this guy?


Virgil stops riding - starts to get off the bike. 

AMY 
(excited) 
I told him all about you - he just faxed me 
back - he'd love to get a look at your eyes 
- he thinks maybe, mavbe - there might be a 
chance of reversal.


Virgil faces Amy, best he can, while he pulls on his sweat jacket. 

VIRGIL 
I don't get it - am I missing the sign 
that says it's help the handicapped week.


Virgil starts to move away. Amy stops him. 

AMY 
I thought you'd be excited. What's the problem?


Virgil turns on her. 

VIRGIL
No problem. That's the whole point 
here Amy - there is no goddamned problem.


And Virgil turns and bumps into a stationary bike, he SHOVES it off 
to the side, and makes his way out of the gym. 

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 

Virgil enters, visibly upset - passing a CO-WORKER coming out of the 
shower. 

CO-WORKER 
Hey Virgil.


Virgil steams right past him - not answering - hands feeling down 
the lockers - finding his - he tugs it open - pulls off his shirt 
and throws it in. He takes a breath, settles himself - then SLAMS 
the locker door shut. 

EXT. JENNIE'S SCHOOL 

PARENTS are picking up their CHILDREN from Jennie's school. As 
Jennie helps the last of the kids into her mother's car - she looks 
up to see Amy across the street. 

JENNIE 
Amy, right?


Amy nods - starts towards her. 

AMY 
I'd like to talk to you if 
I could -- about Virgil.


JENNIE 
Something wrong?


AMY 
Sort of. There's something I don't 
understand. You see I spoke to a doctor 
who's apparently doing breakthrough 
work on cataracts -
(Jennie turns to Amy) 
- but when I brought it up to Virgil he acted as if...


JENNIE 
What don't you understand?


AMY 
If I was blind almost all my life -- 
and there was even a remote possibility 
I could see - I'd jump at it.


JENNIE 
When there's something you've adapted to, 
accepted - you'd just want to change 
it without even thinking about it? 
(beat) 
We're very comfortable here, Amy. 
Virgil has everything he needs.


AMY 
I thought just maybe he'd like to not 
be falling over things for the rest 
of his life. Look, I see...


JENNIE 
(cuts her off) 
Yes you do and Virgil doesn't. He spent 
the first eight years of his life having 
his eyes prodded, pierced and poked by 
doctors, faith healers, spiritualists, 
shamans and medicine men. My father had them 
lined up out the door. It hurt and disappointed 
us all and it almost killed him. He doesn't 
need to go through that again. Now - maybe 
you understand.


And she turns on her heel and is gone. 

EXT. VIRGIL'S COTTAGE - LATE DAY 

Amy making her way up to the porch - hearing from inside. 

VIRGIL (V.O.)
No, no - why - why?!


She hurries up the steps, reaching the open door where she sees 
Virgil, his head in his hands. 

VIRGIL (V.O.)
I can't believe you're doing this to me.


AMY 
What - Virgil?


Virgil turns sharply - Sophie jumps up - starts barking. 

VIRGIL 
Sophie - stop it. Amy? C'mon in - it's just 
the Rangers. I could check better than these 
guys today.


AMY 
They lost?


VIRGIL 
I prefer to think of it as not winning.
I thought you would have been long gone
after that outburst from my evil twin
brother. We've had him committed you
know. Rikers Island - hard time. 
(standing)
Can I get you something - - Coke - beer?


AMY 
No - I - I'm fine. I just wanted apologize 
for stomping around in life like Bigfoot today.


Virgil turns towards Amy. 

VIRGIL 
Amy, you see the big tree outside? 
How far is it from my front porch?
AMY
Guessing, about thirty feet.


VIRGIL 
To you. But to me, it's fourteen steps exactly. 
Fourteen steps and I arrive right where I want 
to be. But -- if I run or rush, I'll lose count 
and slam into it.


AMY
I'm sorry. Told you - can't leave well enough 
alone. I - I guess I should get back, start to pack...
VIRGIL 
Rushing into trees again?


Off Amy's smile we CUT TO: 

EXT. VIRGIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 

On the Porch - the two of them - sipping glasses of wine - we see 
their dinner - Hungry Man beef entree - each category of food in 
it's own perfect little compartment. 

AMY 
You know this dinner - this is really quite...


VIRGIL 
Ordinary? 
(she laughs) 
It's an acquired taste - trust me. 
Jennie thinks it's the only way I'll 
know where my food is. But I have a 
secret weapon.
(holds up a little bottle) 
Hot sauce! Let's you know you're eating 
something - like some.


He starts to sprinkle liberally on Amy's food. Amy, laughing grabs 
the bottle. 
AMY 
That's OK - I'll do it. 
Don't want to overdo it.


She puts the bottle down - looks to Virgil - sips her wine. Time to 
face it. 

AMY 
Virgil - I have to go home tomorrow...


VIRGIL 
Wait, wait - you smell that?


AMY
No - what?


VIRGIL 
The winter pines - it's so strong at 
night - drifts on the wind - wait - 
hear the breeze then...


AMY 
There.


Amy closes her eyes - takes in the scent - and they both sit there - 
close - taking in the night air - enjoying the moment. 

And on Virgil's face we see him lost in thought. 

INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - NIGHT 

CLOSE ON VIRGIL - eyes closed - we hear a sound - like night 
crickets. His eyes slowly open. 

He rolls over - his arm reaching out for her: 

But there's no one there. Virgil sits upright. 

VIRGIL 
Amy?


Amy is sitting in a chair by the window. 

AMY 
I'm here - trouble sleeping.


VIRGIL
C'mere.


And she crawls back into bed, Virgil takes hold of her and as she 
settles into his arm, he strokes her face gently - a blind man's 
version of watching his lover fall to sleep. 

BLACK - then we hear voices 

INT. VIRGIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING 

CLOSE ON: Amy's face - the voices awaken her - cutting into her 
dreams. 

She looks out the doorway - sees Virgil and Jenny arguing on the 
front porch. She can't hear what they are saying - but it's clear 
there's a problem. 

INT. VIRGIL'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING 

Amy pulling a robe around herself - comes into the room - as Jenny 
turns on her heel and walks away from Virgil. 

EXT. PORCH - MORNING 

Virgil stands there a moment - taking in what just happened. Amy 
steps out onto the porch. 

AMY 
Everything alright?


VIRGIL 
Yeah, yeah. Morning - Look, 
something I want to say...


AMY 
The leaving thing - I know - hate it too.


VIRGIL
The other night - when we were dancing - 
being with you - I felt different -
special - I don't know - whole.


AMY 
That was whole?


Virgil puts his hand out - she takes it - he turns to her. 

VIRGIL 
(smile) 
Just for a second I felt like I could see 
you - all of you. 
(beat) 
What you said about this Doctor, this eye guy - 
I know how important it is to you...


AMY 
(turns to him) 
Are you sure you want to do this?


VIRGIL 
We're just going to talk to the guy 
- what could it hurt?
Off Amy's smile: 

SMASH TO: 

EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - MORNING 

A soaring shot. Amy's car - travelling across the bridge - heading 
towards Manhattan. 

AMY (V.0.) 
You're going to love the city 
- so many things to see.


INT. CAR - MORNING 

Virgil in the passenger seat - windows open - taking in all the 
sounds - new and exciting. Amy watches him as she drives. 

VIRGIL 
(laughing) 
Waitwaitwait - he hasn't said he 
can even do anything yet.


AMY 
I know I just feel good about this. 
(Amy looks to him - sees him feeling 
the light against his face) 
Virgil, before you lost all sight, 
do you remember seeing anything at all? 


VIRGIL 
Yeah, I do. I was just a baby when it 
happened - but there is one thing. 
(beat) 
Something ... puffy. That's all I 
remember about it. Everyone says it's 
"clouds," but I know I had it in my hands 
- so it couldn't be clouds. This puffy 
thing - that was something special - 
it's stayed with me all these years - 
I don't know why.


INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY 

DR. RICHARD AARON, wire rims, short, stylish haircut - is finishing 
a high-tech examination of Virgil's eyes. Cups attached to wires sit 
over his eyes. The machine, an ELECTRORETINOGRAM, emits an 
irritating strange flat line sound. The room is very dimly lit. 

Aaron adjusts an intensity dial on the machine - a series of 
flashing lights hit Virgil's eyes. The doctor jots down a reading - 
then with a flourish, spins the machine away from Virgil's face and 
pops a button emitting a detailed computer print out. 

In the corner sits an older gentleman - Dr. Goldman - focused on 
papers in his hands. 

AARON 
OK - we're done.


Aaron bumps up the lights and wheels his chair back over to Virgil 
as Amy moves to join them. 

AARON 
Some good news. You have grade 4 
posterior subscapular cataracts.


VIRGIL 
And this is the good news?


AARON
Good news in that I should be able to 
remove them with little or no damage 
to your cornea.


AMY 
So -- what does that mean - 
they're gone - then what?


AARON 
The cataracts are acting like a curtain - 
covering the window of sight. If the disease 
to the retina is reduced as much as I think 
it is - there's a very good possibility 
we can give you sight.


Amy looks to Virgil - apprehensive. Virgil's expressionless - taking 
this all in. 

VIRGIL 
Sounds expensive.


AARON 
(looks to Goldman who nods imperceptibly) 
We feel there's an opportunity for us all here - 
I think I can get the institute to pick up the bill.


VIRGIL 
So. Say you remove the cataracts - 
do you have any idea what kind of vision I'd have?


Aaron looks to Goldman. 

AARON 
At this time - no. Unfortunately the 
cataracts are not allowing me to see the 
retinal wall. I can't tell how advanced 
the retinitas pigmentosa has become.
VIRGIL 
So you're suggesting an operation 
that may or may not be successful.


AMY 
But there is a chance he 
could regain his sight.


AARON 
There have been a few cases of restored 
vision in adulthood to a patient blind since birth. 
(moves near Virgil) 
The operation is delicate, I'll admit - 
but nothing as invasive as what you went 
through as a child. Of course there is 
always some risks with any operation - 
infection, swelling - long shot stuff. 
I would do both eyes at the same time 
- it's basically out patient surgery.
Virgil - an exhale of air. A lot to take in. 

VIRGIL 
What if it doesn't work? What if I have 
the operation - with all it's risks - 
and you remove the cataract - and it doesn't work.


Aaron looks to Amy. 

AARON 
(somber) 
It would be evident that you will 
never be able to see.


Virgil's head shifts slightly. Not what he wanted to hear. Amy 
reaches out takes his hand. 

AMY 
What do you think?


VIRGIL 
That's what I need - to think.


EXT. AMY'S LOFT - SOHO - DAY 

Virgil and Amy stepping out of a cab. Virgil using his cane - seems 
blinder than we've seen him before. The city sounds an assault on 
him. 

AMY 
This is my place - there's a park 
across the street and...


She stops - realizes he wants to walk in silence. They enter her 
loft building, an old converted industrial space. 

INT. LOFT STAIRWELL - DAY 

There is an odd, loud sound which echoes three times after every 
bounce. As they come up on the second floor landing, a basketball 
comes flying down the hall which Amy fumbles with - then catches. 

AMY 
Ethan!


From around the corner comes ETHAN COLVIN, eight, oversized Knicks 
shirt. Amy tosses him his ball. 

ETHAN 
Sorry - my mom won't let me go 
outside till she gets home from work.


AMY
Well, if the super catches you playing
ball in the hall, he'll have a coronary.


ETHAN 
A what?


AMY 
Never mind. Ethan, 
this is my friend Virgil.


VIRGIL 
Hey, Ethan


ETHAN 
(seeing his cane) 
Are you blind?


VIRGIL 
Yeah.


ETHAN 
Cool. See ya.


And he turns and runs back up the stairs. 

AMY 
(apologetic) 
Virgil...


VIRGIL 
Hey, the kid thinks I'm cool 
- what's so bad.


INT. AMY'S LOFT - LATE DAY 

Amy's loft is a wide open space - a KITCHEN facing onto a small 
living area - a BED in the corner of the room - a WORK SPACE with 
DRAFTING BOARD and DRAWING RACKS fill one side of the room. By a 
window stands a plaster SCULPTURE stuck in the corner as if 
forgotten. 

AMY 
This is where I hang my hat 
- it's a bit of a mess but...


Amy stops, realizes he can't see it. Virgil puts his overnight bag 
down. 

VIRGIL 
Now, Blind 101. Help me out with a mental map. 
Walk me down a straight line and show me your 
place, all the obstacles. Remember once you've 
told me, they can't be moved - otherwise...


AMY
Got it - here take my arm. 
(they start about the room) 
Couch, chair, TV to the left, 
low table at.. .at 4 o'clock, 
has the phone on it...


They come to the Sculpture, Virgil's hand grazes across it. 

VIRGIL 
What's this?


AMY 
Nothing. A sculpture.


VIRGIL 
It's yours?


AMY 
My art school days - not very good.


Virgil continues to feel the sculpture from top to bottom, not 
stopping during the dialogue. 

VIRGIL 
It's a mother? - holding her child - up in the air 
- like she's proud? It's beautiful.


AMY
It's not done yet - 
one day I'll finish it.


Virgil turns - his hand to the wall - feels a window: 

VIRGIL 
Does this window open? 
I could use some air.


AMY 
(moving to the windows) 
I think so.


As Amy throws open the window, a wind blasts through - catching a 
stack of plans on her drafting table - blowing them across the 
floor. 

AMY 
Damn!


Virgil turns, concerned, makes his way to her. 

VIRGIL 
What happened?


AMY 
The wind - knocked over my plans.


Amy down on the floor picking them up - Virgil senses her down there 
- crouches down beside her - tries to help her pick up. 

VIRGIL 
What is this - these plans?


Amy looks at Virgil - - his hand running across one of her plans. 

AMY 
Just my work - - some plans for the Atlanta 
project we're bidding on - drawings of a lobby 
we're finishing up, some other smaller stuff. 
It's -- it's what I do.


Amy realizes they mean nothing to him - he hands them back - stands. 
She watches him - then standing, moves to him. 

AMY 
I've got to get to work. Tonight we'll do something 
- we could listen to music or go out for dinner...


VIRGIL 
How about a movie?


AMY 
A movie?


VIRGIL 
Yeah. I haven't been in years.


AMY
Alright. A movie. I won't be long.


And Amy gives him a quick kiss and dodges for the door - a beat - 
she forgets her purse - steps back in to see: 

Virgil standing there quietly - his hand out on her plans again - 
feeling the paper - searching for the design - wanting to know her - 
wanting to understand her - finding nothing there. 

Amy feels uncomfortable - quietly steps out - closes the door. 

INT. REVIVAL THEATER - NIGHT 

WIDE - the theater half full playing Woody Allen's "Annie Hall" the 
very funny scene where Woody and Diane Keaton wrestle with the 
lobster. 

We move in slowly and discover Virgil and Amy leaning in close to 
each other - Amy quietly describing the scene to him. 

AMY 
There's these big pots and Woody's got 
a huge lobster in his hand...


VIRGIL 
Lobster - what's a lobster?


AMY 
(trying not to use her hands to describe) 
It's a.. .kind of like.. it's got...


Then she looks to Virgil - sees he was kidding her. 

AMY 
(laughing) 
That's it - you're on your own.


Off Virgil's laugh: 

INT. SUBWAY LINE - NIGHT 

BWAM - a subway train explodes past us. 
INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 

A collection of typical night riders - everyone keeping to 
themselves. Two kids sit in the corner - blasting their boom box 
Virgil stands in the middle of the train - enjoying the vibrations. 
Amy sits on a seat watching him. 

VIRGIL 
And they lived happily ever after.


AMY 
Woody and Diane...


VIRGIL 
And the lobster?
AMY 
Stop with the lobster. 

A song comes on the radio - Virgil's head turns. 

VIRGIL 
Hey - you here that?


All she hears is the clatter of the subway. 

AMY 
What?


Virgil turns towards the music - BAPPING his hands rhythmically on 
the subway car wall. 

VIRGIL 
Hey - can you turn that up?


The KID shrugs - CRAKKS it up. It's Gershwin's "Can't take that Away 
from Me." Virgil turns to Amy - picks up on the song - hands RAPPING 
- he starts singing: 

VIRGIL 
"The way you comb your hair, 
The way you sip your tea..."


He finds Amy, pulls her up and into an embrace as he saunters them 
down the aisle. 

AMY 
Virgil?!


VIRGIL 
(loudly) 
"Can't take that away from meee" - what?


AMY 
People are watching.


VIRGIL 
Watching? Watching what?


AMY
You. Me. Everyone is staring at us.


VIRGIL 
And?


AMY 
Well - it can be embarrassing.


VIRGIL 
(kidding) 
Oh - I see.


AMY 
No - you don't.


VIRGIL Touche. 
"The way you make me see..."


AMY
(turns to him) 
What do you mean?! 
(Virgil gives her a look - 
I want the operation) 
You mean it. I mean I only want 
you to have the operation...


VIRGIL 
Amy. I want the chance to see. 
The chance to see Central Park, 
the Brooklyn Bridge, apples, raisins,
a buffalo, a carbuerator and the man 
in the moon. 
(beat) 
But I would give all that up - 
just to see this face.


And Amy folds herself into Virgil - a moment - they hold each other 
- then - Amy starts to sing along with the song - Virgil joining in 
- and they dance - together - in love. 

SMASH CUT TO: 

EXT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 

AMY/VIRGIL (V.0.) 
"You can't take that away from me."


And the car explodes past again - and as the music dies we cut to: 

INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM 

CLOSE ON: a platter of silver utensils - fine, exacting scalpels. A 
gloved HAND comes into frame - picks up a clamp - and we follow it 
to: 

VIRGIL'S EYES - the clamp being used to hold it open. The work we 
are seeing is grueling - difficult to watch - but at the same time 
so fascinating it is hard to take our eyes off. 

Dr. Aaron followed by Dr. Goldman - hands in the air - mask on - 
leans over Virgil - looks to the ANESTHESIOLOGIST who nods - then to 
no one in particular. 

AARON 
OK Virgil - let's get to it.


And as he is handed a SCALPEL, we watch as it moves down to cut open 
the white section of the eye - and just as it feels almost 
unbearable to watch- - 

INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY 

We see Amy, coffee cup in hand, grab a second just poured cup out of 
a vending machine. She makes her way over to reveal Jennie who sits 
quietly reading a book. 

AMY 
Coffee? It's really bad. 

Jennie looks up - smiles takes the cup. Amy sits down next to her. 
They both sip for a moment. 

AMY 
Virgil never mentions his parents 
- do they know? 

JENNIE 
Our mother died when I was 20 - Virgil wasn't
even a teenager. And our father - he's been 
gone for quite awhile. 

AMY 
I'm sorry. I didn't know. 

Jennie looks into her coffee - takes another sip. 

JENNIE 
(smile) 
You're right this is bad.


AMY 
It must have been very tough on you 
- taking care of Virgil alone after 
your mother died.


JENNIE 
He's my brother.


Simple. 

AMY 
You don't like Virgil 
doing this - do you?


JENNIE 
I don't like Virgil getting hurt. 
Hope is like fire, it can keep you 
warm - - or it can burn you.


INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - DAY 

Dr. Aaron: - focused on his exacting work. His hands move deftly. 

CLOSE ON: Virgil's eye. Cut open. Aaron's probe working right in the 
middle of it. 

DR. AARON 
There you are.


And Aaron pulls out the cloudy cataract tissue - holding it up for 
all to see - before he PLOPS it on a tray. Switching instruments - 
he gingerly picks up a plastic implant - moving back towards the eye 
- he glances at the nurse assisting him: 

DR. AARON 
You know what they say, Virgil? 
The eyes are the windows to the soul.


Virgil can't move - listens intently as he carefully places the 
implant into Virgil's eye. 

DR. AARON 
(with a wink) 
That makes us the Windex to the soul. 
(he focuses) 
OK, both eyes done. Let's patch him up.


On a large monitor we see an EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Virgil's eye - 
waiting. 

INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL - LATER 

Virgil being wheeled down a hall - head wrapped in bandages. 

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY 

As he enters: 

VIRGIL 
Hello?


Jennie's there - takes his hand. 

VIRGIL 
Jennie?


JENNIE
How're you feeling?


VIRGIL
OK - a little pain, 
like a tequila hang over
- is Amy here?


AMY 
Right here - Dr. Aaron said you did great


VIRGIL 
So how's my hair - I'd hate the first time 
I see myself to be a bad hair day. 
(Virgil reacts to a sound) 
What's that?
AMY 
There's camera guys here too.


WIDE - we now see the room has a small VIDEO CREW in it preparing to 
document the event. 

VIRGIL 
Camera guys?


AARON 
(entering) 
For posterity. We're going to make you
famous. We're also sending this closed 
circuit to one of our conference rooms 
- there's a lot of people interested in 
our results today. So how you feel Virgil?


VIRGIL 
Good. Great. Fine. 
(a laugh) 
Nervous.


Aaron moves about the room closing blinds to let in just a few slats 
of light. 
AARON 
Nothing to be nervous about. 
Now Jennie and Amy, if you would 
stand off to my right -- I want 
Virgil to get just a slight bounce 
of light.
(returning to Virgil) 
Ready Virgil.


VIRGIL 
Let's go.


Both Amy and Jennie subconsciously adjust their hair as Aaron starts 
to unravel the bandages. 

When the bandages are completely off - all that is left are two 
gauze patches on both eyes. 

AARON 
Okay - last phase - 
we remove these patches and...


VIRGIL
(suddenly apprehensive, hand up) 
Okay - wait. So - so - what do I do? 
I mean, what will I see first?


AARON
Well - we're all here - Amy, 
your sister. This is new for 
us all. Why don't we find out?


Aaron reaches up and plucks the two patches from his eyes - and 
everyone waits. 

Virgil slowly opens his eyes - he just seems to be staring blankly, 
bewildered - not focusing at Aaron who stands before him, still 
holding the bandages. 

Amy looks to Jennie - to Aaron - what's happening? Then finally: 

AARON 
Well?


And Virgil reacts - a startling look of recognition mixed with fear 
crossing his face. 

AMY 
What is it Virgil?


VIRGIL 
It's - it's - I don't know.


And now for the first time we see Virgil's POV: 

There is light, movement, color, shadow - but somehow it is foreign 
to us. There is no perception of depth -. no sense of definition of 
shape or shadow - it is as confounding to us as it is to Virgil - 
like an explosion of Picasso, Dali and Monet on screen. 

Suddenly in the midst of this chaos of images - there is movement - 
and a voice emits out of what we now for the first time recognize as 
a mouth. Dr. Aaron speaks again - leaning in to Virgil, who reacts 
back. 

AARON 
Virgil - what do you see?


VIRGIL 
Something's wrong.


Jennie's reaction comes pouring out of her eyes in tears, first 
slowly, then a dam break. 

AMY 
Virgil what's wrong?
What's happening?


AARON 
Everything's fine - 
it's going to take...


JENNIE
It's not fine - 
don't say it's fine.


AARON 
Tell me what you're seeing Virgil.


Virgil suddenly pulling back - his eyes dancing around in his head - 
trying to take it all in - trying to focus. 

VIRGIL 
(over everyone) 
I don't know - it's all screwed up - 
this can't be seeing - something's wrong
- too confusing - what the hell's happening??!


HIS POV - the camera crew coming toward him for a closer shot - it's 
like a giant monster violently moving towards us! 

VIRGIL 
What is it - Stop!


Virgil's hand lashes out towards the camera crew - even though they 
are 15 feet away. 

AARON 
What? The camera?


JENNIE 
(to the crew) 
Stop moving!


AMY
Virgil, it's just the camera.


The room has heightened into chaos - Virgil reacting to everything 
he sees, any quick movement - Amy moves next to him - Aaron trying 
to remain calm - Jennie assuring Virgil everything's OK. 

AARON 
Alright - alright - they've stopped. 
OK. Let's everybody just calm down 
- we'll take it slowly.


Everyone settles - takes a breath. 

AMY 
Virgil. What can we do?


They all look to Virgil - breathing heavy - his eyes swinging back 
and forth. 

VIRGIL 
I gotta focus - gotta think - 
gimme a second - OK, OK - get me a 
coke. Somebody?


JENNIE
He's thirsty - someone get him a drink!!


VIRGIL
No - just a can - a bottle -- 
put something in my hands!


Amy reaches over - grabs an empty coke can. 

AMY 
Here - how's this?


Virgil takes it in his hands - closes his eyes - feels it. Then 
slowly opens his eyes - trying to focus on what is in his hand - 
Aaron catching on. 

AARON 
Good, Virgil - that's it - use your touch - 
associate - now, tell me - what do you see 
in your hand?


Long moment. Virgil holds it up - stares hard. 

VIRGIL 
A can. Is it a can?


JENNIE 
What's going on?


They all look at Virgil turning the can over and over in his hand - 
staring intently at it - learning it. 

AARON 
(beams) 
He's associating - one sense to the other. 
His fingers tell his brain - then his brain 
tells his eyes and he recognizes the image 
in front of him. 
(realizing) 
He's seeing!


Aaron looks to Amy and Jennie - they're still doubtful - he motions 
to them to meet him outside. 

AARON 
Virgil - let's rest your eyes for today and 
we'll check them again tomorrow. We should
all be happy - we've got something.


Virgil: not happy, just very confused. As Aaron leaves, Jennie takes 
Virgil's hand while Amy stands there upset - watching him just 
staring at a Soda Can. 

INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - DAY 

In the corridor, Dr. Aaron shaking hands with Dr. Goldman - people 
exiting the near-by conference room all congratulating the two 
doctors. As Amy exits the room - Aaron moves to her. 

AMY
What just happened in there?


AARON 
You saw it. Success.


AMY 
Success - wait a minute - then why can't 
he see me, his sister, anything.


AARON
He sees you. He just doesn't 
understand that he sees you.


AMY 
But he'll overcome it - I mean - 
this is temporary right?


AARON 
There's a very real possibility the 
part of his brain area allocated to 
vision is atrophied - given it's lack 
of use, Virgil has probably used it 
for some other function.


Jennie has stepped into the waiting area - has just heard Aaron. 

JENNIE
You didn't think of this?


This is as much an accusation of Amy as of Aaron. 

AARON 
We had no way of knowing what his faculties 
were until we gave him the operation. If you 
remember - we didn't know what to expect 
- though it's clear his retinal disease must 
be in remission.


AMY
So what are we supposed to do now - 
you saw him - it's like he's another 
person in there.


AARON
He won't need to stay here - take him home 
- let him rest. But I will need to see him 
every couple of days for the next month. 


AMY 
Isn't there some kind of therapy 
he should be doing - someone to help him.


Aaron stares at her - hadn't thought of this. 
AARON
OK, there is a visual therapist - Ray Webster 
- a little unorthodox - that's why he's probably 
your best bet, especially considering the unique 
aspects of Virgil's condition. I'll contact 
him for you - but there's no guarantee he can help.


JENNIE 
(can't believe this) 
No guarantees.
AARON
Jennie, I told Amy here when we first talked - this is whole 
new ground - for all of us.


And Jennie quietly turns and goes back into Virgil's room. Amy just 
stares at Dr. Aaron - a little overwhelmed. 

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CHANGE AREA - DAY 

Virgil - starting to dress. He stares at his clothes on a hangar - 
not comprehending what it is. He closes his eyes - his hand going 
out to feel it - then opening his eyes - he takes the shirt turns - 
and notices someone watching him. 

VIRGIL 
Hello?


HIS POV - it's his own reflection in a mirror next to his clothes. 
Virgil stares at himself standing stock still - waiting for a 
response from the person staring at him. 
VIRGIL
Is there...?


Slowly realizing that what he sees is himself. He starts moving 
towards the mirror fascinated. 

Virgil's POV - Focusing on the image as it slowly takes shape - 
becomes clearer to him. His hand going up to his nose - moving it 
back and forth - laughs at it's absurdity - then is taken with his 
own smile. He tries a smile - comes off awkward as he starts to 
stare at his teeth. Touching each part of his face he investigates 
his chin, ears and finally his hair. 

Then he stops - and just stares - and stares at a face that is his 
own - but so incredibly foreign to him. Who is this person? 

INT. VIRGIL'S ROOM - DAY 

Jenny starting to pack up Virgil's things. Suddenly there is a burst 
of laughter from the other room. She looks up quizzically 

INT. HOSPITAL CHECK-OUT - DAY 

Amy in the check-in area - pacing - on a cellphone. 

AMY 
Duncan - I know the additions to the mall will 
cost more.. look, I can't do this on the phone 
- I'll be in tomorrow.. yes, I remembered they're 
putting the fixtures in the lobby - I'll get 
there as well - I'm just asking for one more day.


INT. WAITING AREA - DAY 

Jenny - finishing packing up Virgil's things. 

VIRGIL (V.O.)
Amy?


Jenny looks up - Virgil standing in the doorway, dressed. 

JENNIE 
No - it's Jennie.


She moves toward him - Virgil pulls back - hands out in front of 
him. 

JENNIE 
I'm sorry - I'll move slower - I just...


And Virgil's hands are on her face - eyes closed - feeling. He opens 
his eyes - staring blankly - trying to figure this out. 

VIRGIL 
This is you.


JENNIE 
This is me.


INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY 

Angle on Amy moving down the hall - hearing the voices. 

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 

JENNIE 
Everything's going to be alright 
- we just need to get you home.


VIRGIL 
No, no - I can't go home. 
I need to be here - see the therapist
- doctor's. I want to be here.


JENNIE
But I can't stay here - and you can't 
do this alone--who's going to take care.. .?


She stops. Realizing. 

ANGLE On Amy - outside the door - not wanting to go in. 

JENNIE 
Amy? She's going to look after you? 
She doesn't know anything about the blind.


VIRGIL
I'm not blind anymore - and I'm not 
going to let someone I care about 
walk out of my life again.


JENNIE
(moves to him) 
It's not your fault he left. 
You can't keep blaming yourself.


VIRGIL 
(beat) 
I'm staying here.


A pause - and Jennie moves her hand out to him - touches his arm. 

INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

Amy feeling uncomfortable - starts to step away. 

JENNIE (O.S.)
Amy?


Amy turns - Jennie in the doorway. 

JENNIE 
Virgil's finishing getting ready. 
Could you walk me to my car?


Amy nods - sees an element of defeat in Jennie's eyes. 

EXT. HOSPITAL - LATE DAY 

Jennie and Amy stand on the curb near Jennie's car. A moment of 
uncomfortableness - then: 

AMY 
You alright? 

JENNIE 
I'm scared to death. I've spent my whole life 
looking for any holes he might fall in. 
I'd run up ahead and cover them. Everywhere
I look here, I see holes.


AMY 
Please believe me - I don't want him 
to get hurt anymore than you do.


JENNIE 
Amy - when Virgil was very young, he couldn't 
see those close to him - so he never learned 
to reach out. 
(turns to her) 
Don't expect him to reach out when he's in pain,
or confused, or unhappy. If you really care 
about him you have to just be there for him.


And before Amy can answer, she gets into her car - starts it up and 
drives off. 

EXT/INT AMY'S.LOFT - DUSK 

Virgil slowly gets out of the cab, looks up at the buildings - 
immediately gets dizzy and nearly falls over. Amy lunges to help 
him. Virgil is laughing in spite of himself. 

VIRGIL 
This is just great - I don't believe this. 
What's that saying - stop the world I wanna get off.


ETHAN (O.S.) 
Hey Virgil, it's Ethan.


Virgil turns to the familiar voice. Ethan, basketball under his arm, 
coming out of the building with his Mom, KAREN COLVIN. Virgil scans, 
tries to focus on them. 

VIRGIL 
That you Ethan?


ETHAN 
It's me - and this is my mom.


AMY 
Virgil - Karen.


KAREN 
Hi, Virgil - heard a lot about you.


ETHAN 
You look funny.


VIRGIL 
You should see how I look from this side.


AMY Let's just get you inside - 
then you can rest. 
We'll see you later Ethan. Karen.


And she gives Karen a small glance as she takes Virgil's arm as they 
start towards the stairs leading into the building - Virgil suddenly 
slamming to a halt. 

VIRGIL 
Wait, wait, what are we doing 
- WE'RE WALKING INTO A WALL!!


Virgil's POV - the staircase. A flat image - a solid wall with 
horizontal lines. Ethan, surprised, what's up here? 

AMY 
It's OK - it's not a wall - 
it's just a staircase. You're 
going to have to trust me on 
these things.


VIRGIL
God, I feel like... like such a child - 
I just thought seeing would be different.


AMY 
We'll get a hold of this Ray Webster guy
- we'll get his help.


Virgil steps slowly forward - giant baby steps - each foot reaching 
out to feel the step before making the commitment. 

HIS POV - the 'wall' of stairs changing perspective with each step. 
Like an accordion spreading itself out to us. This is all a very bad 
acid trip. 

INT. AMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK 

VIRGIL'S POV - multi-colored balloons, dozens of assorted flowers, 
bowls of colorful fruit and streamers intertwined across the room. A 
candyland of seeing. 

VIRGIL 
Man. Something exploded 
in your apartment.


Amy laughs - pulls him into the room. Virgil trying to take it all 
in - not understanding anything. 

AMY 
I wanted to do something 
special for you.


VIRGIL 
It's making me a little 
bit dizzy - but it is special.


Virgil's hands go out - Amy moves to him - he holds her shoulders. 
He stares at her. 

As she turns her head slightly, Virgil is able to focus on her - her 
eyes - her smile. 

VIRGIL 
Okay - so - this is what 
beautiful looks like.


AMY 
Thank-you. You want to
see the rest.
Focusing on her, Virgil smiles, takes her face in his hands - leans 
in and kisses her. She pulls back a little. 
AMY 
I can't believe this 
- how nervous I am.


She kisses him then takes a step back. 

AMY 
What if you don't like what you see?


VIRGIL 
Do you want me to turn off the lights?


AMY
No - no. This is your first seeing day. 
(she starts to unbutton her dress) 
I want you to see everything.


And she drops the dress from her shoulders - it hits the ground - a 
beat - and she stands there naked. 

AMY 
OK?


VIRGIL 
Yes, very OK.


And she takes a step towards him and folds into his arms and as they 
kiss we slowly fade to black. 

INT. AMY'S LOFT - NIGHT 

The sound of heavy New York rain. Amy awakening, and sees Virgil is 
gone, his side of the bed empty. She looks across the room - where 
she sees silhouetted against the moonlit window - - Virgil standing 
next to Amy's sculpture, his face and body pressed up against the 
pane of glass. 

AMY 
(wrapping a house coat around her) 
Virgil?


Virgil turns around - half faces her - the rain on the windows 
decorating his face. 

VIRGIL 
I can't sleep - I'm afraid if I close my eyes...


AMY 
It'll be black when you open them again.


Virgil nods. A moment and his hand goes out to her sculpture. 

VIRGIL 
You enjoy sculpting?


AMY 
At first. I liked the idea of molding - 
taking the way I saw things up here- - 
(touching her head) 
- and making it take shape with my hands.


VIRGIL 
But you never finish them.


AMY 
Pieces never come out the way I wanted 
- the way I saw them. I end up working 
on them forever - like this one - 
never getting them right.


Virgil stares out the window at the rain. 

VIRGIL 
This is what rain looks like?


AMY 
Yeah.


VIRGIL 
It looks lonely. Not what I expected. 
But I like it.


Amy smiles - moves into him as he pulls her in close and they look 
out at the night rain. 

INT. ROSWELL-TREMONT - DAY 

Amy working over a CAD computer with & draftsman. 

AMY 
You've got to alter each of 
the windows by five feet...


DRAFTSMAN 
These are the specs you gave me.


AMY 
I know - I'm changing them - 
this is better. 
(calling out) 
Betsy!


Betsy pokes her head in. 

AMY 
Can you get me some research on 
those Maple trees we're leaving in. 
They're too big - I want to change 
them so they fit in with the design 
better. Get rid of the dead weight.


BETSY 
Don't you have an appointment?


Amy looks to her watch. Starts for her jacket and the door. 

AMY 
Yes, yes. Thank-you. 
Evan here will print out the new specs 
- give them to Duncan - tell him I'll
be back in two hours.


DUNCAN (O.S.) 
Amy?


Duncan steps out of his office. She turns - virtually out the door. 

AMY 
Just give me two hours.


And she's gone. 

EXT. NYU CAMPUS - NEXT DAY 

A few KIDS smoking on the steps. Others entering, laden down with 
books - a small sea parting to allow Amy helping Virgil up the steps 
and inside. 

INT. NYU HALLWAY - DAY 

They make their way down the hall - past a - room where a group of 
BLIND CHILDREN learn to read Braille. Amy can't help but stare at 
these young faces struggling to learn. It's a whole different world. 

INT. RAY WEBSTER'S OFFICE - DAY 

A strange space, dark, as all the windows are covered. In a jar on 
the desk - two pickled eyeballs stare back at Virgil and Amy waiting 
patiently. There are books everywhere - periodicals stacked and 
overflowing on shelves. A dead plant in the corner. 

RAY WEBSTER - 60's, almost completely bald, wearing a worn NYU 
sweatshirt, sits at the desk in front of them - flipping through a 
file in front of him. 

WEBSTER 
Right - OK, Virgil - says here you went 
blind at one - before you developed a 
visual vocabulary. 
(Webster stands - moves towards a bookshelf) 
You have no sense of depth of field, 
no knowledge of space, shape, size or 
distance. Basically your eyes work but 
your brain hasn't learned to process 
the information. 
(beat) 
You are mentallv blind. Neurologists 
call this "visual agnosia".


VIRGIL 
I call it pretty screwed up.


WEBSTER 
Better term. I'll make a note of that.


Webster plops down a large book - flips through some pages, then 
searching his pockets: 

WEBSTER 
Dammit


AMY 
What?


WEBSTER 
Glasses, can never find 'em. 
(calling out) 
Mrs. Fenster.


Mrs. Fenster pops her head in the door - this must be a ritual they 
have as she instantly pulls her GLASSES off and hands them to 
Webster who drops them over his nose. They are clearly woman's 
glasses - pointed in the ends - little jewels. As Mrs. Fenster 
leaves. 

WEBSTER 
(referring to the book) 
OK. Alberto Valvo "Sight Restoration after 
Long Term Blindness" - blah-blah-blah. -
ah here... 
(reading) 
"One must die as a blind person to be born
again as a sighted person. However it is 
the interim, the limbo- -between two worlds,
one dead/the other powerless to be born - 
that is so terrible." 
(slamming the book shut) 
There. You're in limbo.


AMY 
What do you mean - there - he's in limbo.
That's all you have to offer?


WEBSTER
What? - I'm Anne Bancroft all of a sudden? 
I'm a professor - I teach people, how to 
teach the blind how to become independent. 
(beat) 
There's no book on what you're going through
- I'd like to help - but like the rest of 
things in life - it's up to you.


VIRGIL
Wait a minute - up to me? 
I thought you were going to help me here.


Webster rummages in his desk - pulls out a magazine photo - then 
digging in a brown paper bag - he pulls out an apple. 

WEBSTER 
You want a lesson? Right - here. 
What's this?


He holds out the apple for Virgil - who reluctantly takes it - holds 
it in his hand, eyes closed, feels it - then opening his eyes he 
holds it out in front of him, trying to focus on it. 

HIS POV - as the apple slowly takes on dimension and shape. 

VIRGIL 
It's an apple.


WEBSTER 
Good. Good. 
(holding up the photo) 
OK. What's this now?


Virgil stares at the photo. HIS POV - a photo of -- an APPLE. Not 
that different from the real apple he holds in his hand - he holds 
the real apple up to compare - using his eyes. 

VIRGIL 
It's an apple.


WEBSTER 
(holding the paper out to Virgil) 
Good. Good. But is it an apple or 
just a picture of an apple?


And Virgil feels the paper and suddenly realizes - it's not an apple 
- just a representation of one. Virgil is visibly disappointed. 

VIRGIL 
So this is a joke? Is that what you're
saying - your eyes lie to you? Great 
- looking forward to this.


WEBSTER 
Your eyesight can and will play tricks on 
you Virgil. Remember that. No matter what
I could teach you - no matter what exercises 
I could give you - they'll still play tricks on you.


VIRGIL
That's all it is right now - one big trick. 
Nothing makes any sense. I can't function like this.


WEBSTER
(he moves to his chair) 
Virgil - look - you have to learn to see - 
just like you learned to speak. Only this 
is not like learning a new language - 
it's like learning language for the first time. 
(he leans forward) 
Perception - sight - life, is about experience 
- about reaching out and exploring the world 
for yourself. It's not enough to just see Virgil -- 
(he points two fingers into his eyes) 
-- we've got to look as well.


And Webster turns the fingers from his eyes outward - to the world. 

AMY 
(wound up) 
Well, thank-you Obi Wan Kenobi - 
but that doesn't tell us anything. 
What we need is some assistance here 
- some kind of program - a set of exercises 
- we're kind of adrift and...


WEBSTER 
Amy - last I checked - this isn't a game 
of Parcheesi, it doesn't come with a set of rules.


AMY 
I can't believe you're just...


VIRGIL
Amy. Let's go.


AMY 
No, wait, Virgil...


VIRGIL 
Let's go. 
(standing) 
Thank-you Dr. Webster.


WEBSTER 
You want me - I'm always here.


And Virgil turns and half steps - half shuffles towards the door. We 
hold on Amy's befuddled face - then: 

EXT. NYU - DAY 

Virgil feels his way down the steps - Amy rushing out after him. 

AMY 
I'm going to call Aaron - 
get him to recommend someone else.


VIRGIL 
He's right, Amy. I've got to do this 
on my own. No one taught you how to see.


Virgil starts walking stiffly towards the street. Amy hurries after 
him - grabs him just as he was about to step into traffic. 

AMY 
I was a baby then - I had years to learn - 
you don't - you need to...
(anxious)
 --we don't even know what to do 
- where to start..


Virgil's hand goes out - brushes a mailbox. 

VIRGIL 
What's this - this thing?


Amy looks over. 

AMY 
(shrugs) 
What - it's a mailbox.


VIRGIL 
What color is it?


AMY
Blue.


Virgil stares at it - tries to take it in. 

VIRGIL
Blue. OK, good - that's a mailbox
- it's blue. There - we've started.


She says nothing. Virgil senses her apprehension. 

AMY Let's just get a cab, get you home 
- and tonight we can work on it.
(hand out) 
Cab!


A cab veers across traffic - pulls up to them. 

VIRGIL 
I want to walk. I want to see what's out there.


AMY
Fine. Let's walk.


VIRGIL 
Don't you have a job?


AMY 
I'm going to make time for this. I promise.


VIRGIL 
Go to work. If I need you - 
I have your number.


A beat, she looks to Virgil then climbs into the cab and it pulls 
away. 

Virgil looks left, right - trying to decide where to start his 
journey when we see the cab back up in front of him and Amy climbs 
out. 

AMY 
Screw work - let's go try those eyes.


INT. LECTURE RALL - DAY 

Aaron at a podium. The room filled with colleagues. A NEWSCREW 
records the lecture from the back of the hall. 

AARON 
Now just two weeks after surgery--the patient is 
still having difficulty understanding images,
shapes, contours - 

EXT. NY CITY STREET - NEW DAY 

Virgil - determined to see - making his way down a street - trying 
to dodge people coming at him from all angles. Amy walks a short 
distance behind him - coaxing him along. 

HIS POV - people seem to explode out of two dimensions into three. 
This is clearly exhausting. 

AARON (CONT'D)
- and his progress with depth of field has been especially slow...


WHAM - Virgil collides with a kid on a skateboard - Amy winces as he 
quickly regains his balance - shakes it off - starts his journey 
again - determined. 

EXT. BROADWAY - STREET VNNDORS - DAY 

Amy trying to help Virgil take in the confusion of images - 
explaining to him items hanging about the stalls. It's clear he's a 
little overwhelmed - when something familiar catches his eye. He 
moves toward it: 

HIS POV - focusing - trying to give it shape - it's a YELLOW CAB - 
just like the one Amy drove off in - again he focuses - reaches out 
- surprisingly wrapping his hand around the car. 

AARON (CONT'D)
Virgil is still very reliant on his touch 
to interpret objects in his surroundings -


He then realizes it's a porcelain toy from a souvenir shop. Amy 
watches him examine it like a child as we hear: 

EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY 

AARON (CONT'D)
- and his understanding of three dimensionality 
is extremely limited and confounding to him...


Virgil - his hands all over a small long haired TERRIER. He looks to 
Amy as he stands. 

VIRGIL 
It's a dog.


Amy on her cellphone - trying to get work done - nods - yes that's a 
dog. Virgil looks back at the pup - which has now turned around 
backwards. 

VIRGIL 
Now what's that?


On Amy - disturbed by his slow progress. 

EXT. GARDEN MARKET - ANOTHER DAY 

Amy and Virgil being led through a series of plants and trees by a 
EARTHY SALESWOMAN. 

SALESWOMAN 
I believe we have just the tree you're 
looking for your lobby. Needs very little 
light - slow growing - ah here we are...


Amy and Virgil stop at a large Ficus Tree. 

AMY 
Nice. Good. What do you think Virgil?


AARON (CONT'D)
He is also still having great difficulty 
"scanning", basically putting a whole picture together.


Virgil stares at the large tree. Up - down - up - down - up - down - 
up - down - Amy and the Saleswoman watch him, Amy wants to help but 
can't comprehend what he's going through. 

AARON (CONT'D)
If he looks at the top of a tree - then scans 
to the bottom - he's forgotten the top by the 
time he reaches the trunk.


INT. AMY'S WORK - DAY 

ANGLE ON Virgil in Amy's office - staring at a construction sign - 
FUTURE HOME OF etc... Using his finger to outline the letters of the 
sign - he tries to read the word FUTURE. He mouths the letters - 
tries to form the word. 

AARON (CONT'D)
This includes the ability to read. In reading a 
word - he forgets the first letter by the time 
he gets to the last.


Amy working with a draftsman - glances up to see Virgil struggling 
with reading. 

INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - LECTURE ROOM - DAY 

Bathed in a bank of lights, Aaron at the podium continuing. Virgil 
quiet - is seated behind him. 

AARON (CONT'D)
-- meaning ... he has a total lack of visual 
memory. This is an unexpected physiological 
flaw. We are hopeful Virgil can overcome this. 
(beat) 
Thank-you - that's all for today.


INT. NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY 

Virgil and Amy exit the hall, are immediately surrounded by 
REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS. There's a sudden FLASH. Virgil reacts, 
pulling away. 

VIRGIL 
What's that?


AMY 
A camera - it's OK - 
taking your - picture.


VIRGIL 
What, by flashing me in the face?


FLASH - there's another - Amy tries to block the light. 

AMY 
Please!! - It's not good for him.


Suddenly - there's a mike in his face, as CHRISTIE EVANS reporter 
from Channel 2 news steps forward with CAMERA CREW in tow. 

CHRISTIE EVANS 
Mr. Anderson. Christie Evans Eyewitness news. 
We heard the Doctor speak about your progress 
- and we're wondering what your expectations are.


As Virgil stops - stunned by the lights in his face. As he looks to 
Amy we cut to: 

INT. HOME - LATE DAY 

TV MONITOR - Virgil turns to camera - starts talking to the 
reporter. As we pull back we hear less and less as we reveal a 
modest living room. A TEENAGER doing homework on a table in the 
corner and a MAN - early 60's, rugged - sitting on a couch watching 
the news. 

MAN 
Oh my God.


He leans forward - his interest piqued and he picks up the phone. 

MAN 
Information. Pinecrest. 
For a Jennie Anderson..


INT. RESTAURANT - LITTTE ITALY - LATER THAT NIGHT 

A silver fork held up in front of us. 

AMY 
What's this?


Virgil and Amy sit on the patio of La Mela. Virgil's hand goes out 
for the fork. Amy pulls it away. 

AMY 
Uh uh uh. See it first. 
No cheating. Concentrate.


Virgil stares hard at it. 

VIRGIL 
(guessing) 
A pen. I don't know - let me touch it.


She hands it to him. 

VIRGIL 
A fork.


AMY 
Right.. Now put it down in 
front of you. How far is it from.


VIRGIL 
Twenty feet


AMY 
You're not looking.


VIRGIL 
Dammit, Amy, Amy, I spent all day in front 
of that panel feeling like a guinea pig. 
Every time I open my eyes I have to look. 
Can we just sit and have dinner for once?


Amy just stares. It's clear they're both tired. 
AMY 
I'm just trying to help you see.


VIRGIL 
I know. But that's all it seems we're 
about. How was your day - what goes on 
at work - how about those Rangers - 
did the stock market hold today - 
is there anything else going on in our 
world besides my eyes?


AMY 
(beat) 
OK, we've been invited to a party 
- Duncan's birthday.


An ITALIAN WAITER appears - putting a large plate of spaghetti in 
front of Virgil and Amy. Virgil is a little repulsed by what he 
sees. 

VIRGIL 
What's this - looks like worms.


AMY 
It's spaghetti - it's fine.


As Virgil tries to maneuver his fork - Amy reaches behind her. 

AMY 
I brought you a present - 
good for hand eye coordination.


She hands him a TOYS R US bag. He peers inside. 

VIRGIL 
Great - you go to work building buildings 
- I go home with building blocks.


INT. ROSWELL -TREMONT - LATE DAY 

Amy - looking a little worn - staring blankly at her computer. A 
three dimensional rendition of the mall rotates on the screen. 
Duncan pokes his head in. 

DUNCAN 
I'm here for you to wish me 
happy birthday. How's it going?


AMY 
(distracted) 
OK. He's progressing, slowly 
- doing the best he can.


DUNCAN 
I was actually wondering about the mall 
designs. We're expected in Atlanta tomorrow 
- with these plans.


AMY 
I can't go to Atlanta tomorrow 
- not with Virgil's problems,..


DUNCAN 
Ok, ok 
(Duncan moves in behind her) 
I'm sorry. Things aren't going so well?


AMY 
(stares at her work) 
He seems blinder now than he ever was.


Duncan puts his hands on her shoulders - starts to knead them. Amy 
starts to relax. 

AMY 
Do you ever wonder why 
you do the things you do?


DUNCAN 
Didn't get what you expected did you? 

AMY 
Sometimes I think he's not going to make it 
- that he's never going to be able to see.


DUNCAN 
Amy - listen to me. You liked this guy 
- I saw that. You wanted to help him 
- it didn't work out so hot. You can't 
punish yourself.. Sometimes things just 
don't work out the way we want them to 
- look at us.


Amy smiles warmly. 

AMY 
Yeah. Thanks Duncan.


DUNCAN 
Anytime. 
(beat, a joke) 
Now back to work.


As he starts out of the room, Amy turns stops him. 
AMY 
Hey, Happy Birthday.


INT. AMY'S LOFT - DAY 

Virgil sits at the kitchen table staring at everyday kitchen 
utensils - being held by Ethan. 

VIRGIL 
Measuring cup?


Ethan shakes his head - no - it's a cheese grater. Virgil stares 
again. Ethan mimes grating cheese. 

VIRGIL 
Cheese grater.


ETHAN 
Yes - my man.


Ethan holds up something new - one of those strange spaghetti 
strainers. Now they are both staring at something they don't 
understand. Virgil looks to Ethan. 

ETHAN 
Got me.


VIRGIL 
(laughing) 
You're no help. How am I supposed 
to do my homework if...


ETHAN 
Homework - dude - I
ain't doin' homework.


Virgil continues to look at the strainer as Ethan gravitates towards 
his cane folded up on the table. 

ETHAN 
(beat) 
You're lucky you got a cane.


Virgil looks over - sees his fascination. 

VIRGIL 
You want it. I've been thinking
about throwing it out.


Ethan's up in a flash. 

ETHAN 
Man - really - I can have it? Cool. 
(picking it up) 
I could be a Ninja Darth Vader fighter 
with one of these - protect my mom from 
the evil super.


Virgil is up - with the spaghetti strainer in his hand. 

VIRGIL 
But first you'll have to fight 
off the evil --- whatever this is.


As they joust about - Virgil enjoying himself - there's a knock at 
the door. 

VIRGIL 
Could be the super - go for cover.


As Ethan ducks behind the couch, Virgil makes his way to the door, 
fumbling with the handle - he opens it to: 

JENNIE. Virgil stares at her. We soon realize he has no idea who 
this is. 

VIRGIL 
Yes?


Jenny looks at him, her eyes welling. 

JENNIE 
Virgil - it's me.


And suddenly Ethan is there - cane drawn like a sword. 

ETHAN 
En garde.


Jennie startled - looks to Ethan then Virgil. What's going on? 

VIRGIL
Jennie?! Jennie.. God, I'm sorry 
- c'mon in - this is my friend Ethan 
- what are you doing here?


Off Jennie's look: 

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 

Virgil and Jennie standing across the street from a building being 
torn down. Hard hatted WORKERS hover about the large trucks at work. 

VIRGIL 
You want to tell me 
what we're doing here?


Jennie points. 

JENNIE 
That's him. That's our Father.


Virgil looks in the direction she's pointing - tries to focus on a 
figure moving across the lot. The MAN we saw watching TV. 

VIRGIL 
I can't - I can't see him.


Jennie looks to him. 

JENNIE 
I thought your eyes were better.


VIRGIL
No. I - I don't want to see him. 
My eyes aren't good enough - not yet 
- he won't understand. It won't be enough.


Virgil takes a step back. 

JENNIE 
He's our father. He heard about the 
operation and he's asked to see you. 
Look here he comes.


VIRGIL 
GODDAMIT Jennie - I don't want to 
see him - I don't even know why you
brought me here.


And Virgil takes another step back then turns and starts of f down 
the street leaving Jenny alone. 

INT. AMY'S BUILDING - NIGHT 

Amy making her way up the stairs - roll of plans under her arm. 
Opening her door to: 

INT. AMY'S LOFT - NIGHT 

A totally dark room. She drops her things. 

AMY 
Virgil?... Virgil?!


She flicks on the light - to reveal Virgil has been sitting in the 
dark. She looks over - sees the scattered blocks on the floor. 

VIRGIL 
I'm here. I forget about the lights sometimes.


AMY
Look - about this party tonight 
- it's no big deal - maybe we should just...


VIRGIL
It's your partner's birthday. We should go 
- besides you wanted me to meet your friends, right?


AMY 
Yeah. Right.


INT. LOFT - NIGHT 

Noisy, crowded - PEOPLE mill about carrying drinks - black and 
silver balloons float about the ceiling. Moving through the crowd - 
music blasting - Amy introducing people to Virgil over the noise. 

A WAITER walks up to them holding a tray of wine. 

WAITER 
Glass of wine? Red - white?


Amy reaches out - takes one. 

VIRGIL 
Which is the red?


Amy looks at the waiter - then points to one. Virgil's hand reaches 
out slowly - hovering - it's clear it's confusing - trying to 
separate out one glass. The Waiter looks to Amy like "is he OK?" 

AMY 
Virgil - here let me.


Her hand darts in front of his. 

VIRGIL 
(quick) 
No! Sorry - I mean - I'm almost 
there - I think I got it.


And she backs off as his hand wraps around a glass - pulling it 
back. At the last second knocking over two other glasses. 

VIRGIL 
Dammit. Sorry.


The Waiter - trying not to spill on himself. 

WAITER 
Trust me - you're not the first - 
or probably the last. Let me get a cloth.


VIRGIL 
Thanks


The Waiter smiles - and as he walks off. Virgil nervously takes a 
large drink of wine. 

WAITER 
I hope you're driving.


Suddenly from the front of the room - MARSHALL, the host calls out: 

MARSHALL 
OK. He's coming up the stairs. 
Everybody get ready - kill the lights.


Excitement - a buzz - Virgil looks around then CLICK - all the 
lights go out. Virgil panics momentarily. 

VIRGIL 
What - what's happening?


Amy moves to him in the near dark room. 

AMY 
It's for the surprise - 
they turned off the lights.


VIRGIL 
Surprise - yeah.


And suddenly the lights flood back on, everyone screams: SURPRISE!! 

Duncan - at the door with Betsy - genuinely surprised - catches his 
breath - then fakes a quick heart attack and drops to the floor. 

The room explodes in laughter - Amy included. This action is even 
more confusing to Virgil. 

VIRGIL 
Is he OK?


Hearing this - everyone breaks into bigger laughter - Virgil now the 
focus of attention - good naturedly laughs - Amy smiles, 
embarrassed. Virgil takes a gulp of his wine, finishing it off. 

LATER: 

The Music is cranked! Many couples dance. Virgil exits the bathroom 
- glances back in the mirror again, at his hair - not sure he likes 
its style. He tries brushing it to the other side - it's OK. How 
about the other way - not so bad - maybe. It's clear he's a little 
tipsy as he keeps playing with his hair. 

WAITER (O.S.) 
Here ya go Virgil.


Virgil turns - the Waiter stands there holding a glass of wine - 
placing it carefully into Virgil's hand: 

VIRGIL 
Cheers, Kevin.


AMY (O.S.)
(over the noise)
Virgil!!


Virgil embarrassed, turns - can faintly hear Amy's voice over the 
music. Searches the room - bopping bodies - balloons being bashed 
round - lights dim. The number of drinks he's had isn't helping. 

AMY 
Virgil--over here!!


Amy, standing with Duncan and Betsy. 
DUNCAN
Maybe he's blind again.


AMY 
Don't even think it. C'mon - I want the 
both of you to meet him - he'll never 
find us here.


With VIRGIL - smiling as he sees Amy, Duncan and Betsy move towards 
him. 

AMY 
Virgil - I'm sorry - I went to get 
Duncan. Duncan - Virgil. And this is 
Betsy.


DUNCAN 
Hey Virgil good to meet you.


BETSY 
Heard a lot about you.


VIRGIL 
Heyyy! Yeah. Good to meet you.


Virgil thrusts his hand out - colliding it into Duncan's. 

VIRGIL 
Sorry - things still get a 
little cockeyed sometimes.


DUNCAN 
(holding up his drink) 
Few more of these and I'll be the same.


VIRGIL 
Lemme get Kevin - my man - 
he'll top you up. KE-VIN!!!


AMY 
Virgil!


VIRGIL 
What?


Uncomfortable - everyone stops. 

AMY 
Nothing. It's ok.


DUNCAN 
Amy, in Atlanta tomorrow...


AMY 
Duncan - I told you...


DUNCAN 
I spoke to Falk and he...


AMY 
(can't hear) 
What?


Duncan pulls Amy in close to talk - shutting Virgil and Betsy out. 

BETSY 
Amy said you had great hands. 


VIRGIL 
(laughs) 
She did, did she.


Virgil holds them up in front of his face - tries to see them. Then 
looks past them and watches Amy and Duncan - more importantly looks 
at Duncan's hair, his clothes. It's clear he's becoming aware of 
appearances. His own especially. 

As they break their tete a tete. 

BETSY
You know my father was blind for several 
years, he had cataracts as well.


Somehow this comes out patronizing. 

VIRGIL 
Really. I'm surprised I don't 
know him. It's a club you know.


Kevin, the African American waiter comes up. 

KEVIN 
Yes.


Virgil throws his arm around Kevin. 

VIRGIL 
Kevin - Duncan here the birthday man 
- could use himself a drink. Kevin here 
tells me he's black - did you know that
- I mean look at him - look at me -
isn't that the damnedest thing. He's black. 


Amy is mortified, Kevin laughs. 

KEVIN
I'll get you a drink.


Virgil looks to Amy. 

VIRGIL 
What's that look?


AMY 
What look?


VIRGIL 
I've never seen your face that way 
before. It's.. .weird. What does it mean?


Before she can answer - a dance song breaks out - Betsy wraps her 
arm around Duncan's. 

BETSY 
Come on Duncan - let's dance - 
move those old bones.


Duncan only acknowledges Betsy's contact with a raised eyebrow to 
Amy. 

DUNCAN 
What the hell it's my birthday -- nice to 
meet you Virgil - see you at the opening.


And they're gone onto the floor. Virgil watches him - sees the ease 
with which Duncan moves, handles things. 

VIRGIL 
Opening?


AMY 
The lobby we designed. Virgil - you can't...


VIRGIL 
Let's dance.


Virgil takes her arm and pulls her out on the floor. Amy - ready for 
one of Virgil's wild dances takes hold of his hand. The music 
blaring, Virgil starts to get into it - Amy starting to relax - then 
Virgil slowly notices how everyone else is dancing - more 
conservative. 

He's even getting some looks from people. Slowly he winds down - 
tries to mimic what everyone else is doing - ends up in just a slow 
shuffle. 

Amy watches him - sees he's uncomfortable - moves to him - but 
Virgil turns on his heel and strides away. Amy follows after him. 

INT. LOFT - CORNER - NIGHT 

Virgil stands near the glass doors leading to an outdoor balcony. 
Amy comes up to him - finds Virgil facing a wall - eyes shut. 

AMY 
What are you doing?


Virgil's head cocks slightly towards her - just like when he was 
blind. 

VIRGIL 
I feel like Rip Van Winkle. 
I've woken up from a thirty year sleep 
- and the world's passed me by.


AMY 
It's just dancing. Who cares?


Virgil whirls on her - his hand on her shoulder to steady his look 
at her. 

VIRGIL 
No-no-no-no. It's not the Goddamn dancing. 
I wanted to come here tonight - show you I
could "fit" in. Like the big boys do. Big 
seeing boys. Yes. Well, I don't. Don't.


AMY 
It's just going to take time. 
You weren't ready. We shouldn't have come.


VIRGIL 
No - I - me, shouldn't have come. 
You want me to see - but you know what 
- you know what - shit - I don't belong 
in the wonderful world of seeing. 


Amy reaches out to him. 

AMY 
Virgil Â… look Â….


Amy realizes what she just said - Virgil pulls his arm away. 

VIRGIL 
No, I won't. I'm tired of looking. 
Fuck looking and the horse it came in on.


And he spins to get away from her and takes a step crashing right 
into the sliding glass door which explodes in a shower of little 
crystals. 

The party slams to a halt - Amy stands stunned. Virgil shaken - tiny 
cuts on his face. 

AMY 
Oh my God, are you alright?


Virgil slams his eyes shut. 

VIRGIL 
Yeah, I'm just fine. Take me home.


INT. AMY'S LOFT - NEXT MORNING 

Virgil, small nicks on his face, wakes up - rolls over - feels the 
empty bed beside him. Looks up to see Amy pulling her coat on - 
suitcase at her side. 

AMY 
Didn't want to wake you.


VIRGIL 
You're going.


AMY 
I'll only be a couple of days.


VIRGIL 
This isn't working.


AMY 
What - we're not working - your eyes 
- what's not working?


VIRGIL 
I get up every morning - I look in the mirror 
- and I stare at a total stranger. I stare and 
I stare - and no matter how hard I look - I 
don't see Virgil there anywhere. And the more 
I look at you...


AMY 
What? You don't see me?


VIRGIL 
I saw you better when I was blind.


AMY 
Well, you're not blind any more. 
I'm sorry if that disappoints you. 
(beat) 
I've got a plane to catch. I'm going 
to go before we say things we don't mean.


And she grabs her bag and is out the door. As we hold on Virgil's 
face. 

AT THE WINDOW - Virgil looking out - watching Amy get in the cab. 

As she drives away we see Virgil watch the car recede - then his 
hand goes out. 

HIS POV - his hand grasping at the tiny disappearing cab - trying to 
hold onto it like in Times Square - trying not to let it go. 

INT. FALK BOARD ROOM - DAY 

CLOSE ON - Amy's sketches. The Mall has been integrated into the two 
large trees - giving it shelter and shape. 

FALK (O.S.) 
I love it.


Amy and Duncan sit across from Falk, a man in his 40's - earned 
everything he's got - no bullshit kinda guy. 

FALK 
But we already cut those trees down.


EXT. NYU CAMPUS - DAY 

Kids milling about. A young couple neck unabashedly against a wall. 

We see this is Virgil's POV - he's watching - people together. 

INT. NYU HALLWAY - DAY 

Virgil makes his way down the hall. Stops at an open doorway - a 
sign next to it with raised letters in Braille. As his hand feels 
across it - he also reads the visual letters - Dr. Ray Webster. 

Peering inside - he sees a Lab - full of the NEWLY BLIND - some 
TEENAGERS - a couple of ADULTS - a handful of SEEING IMPAIRED - all 
learning to use a cane. The rapid tapping of their cane like a room 
full of typewriters. 

Virgil watches - the Blind working their way around a small obstacle 
course - many of them running into desks, tables - it's tough, 
frustrating work. 

Suddenly Virgil feels someone next to him. Webster. 

WEBSTER 
You want to join us.


Virgil watches the blind. 

VIRGIL 
No - no - I'll wait for you 
out here - when you're done.


As Virgil moves off to a hallway bench: 

WEBSTER 
Virgil


Virgil turns as Webster tosses his something. Virgil misses it - it 
hits the ground - he reaches down - finding it, he picks it up - 
it's an apple. He looks to Webster who smiles back at him. 

WEBSTER 
I'll be done in a minute.


INT. HOTEL LOBBY - ATLANTA - DUSK 

Amy and Duncan walk through the lobby to their rooms. A little combo 
plays music in the adjacent bar - a few people on the tiny dance 
floor. 

AMY 
You'd think he would have told us. 
I mean those trees were in the photos.


DUNCAN 
We'll just have to win him over tomorrow. 
Let me buy you a drink - get those 
creative juices going.


AMY
(looks at her watch) 
Aw - no - I really...


But Duncan has her by the arm - and in one spin has her in a dance 
embrace. This move seems comfortable, familiar to them both. 

DUNCAN 
C'mon - listen, they're playing our song.


AMY 
(laughs) 
Mack the Knife was our song?


INT. WEBSTER'S LAB - LATER 

Webster is cleaning up after class. Virgil watching some of the 
Teenage kids and Adults find their way out of the room. As the last 
of them leaves. 

WEBSTER 
OK - I'm just about done here - I got a place
for you - relax those eyes a bit.


INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT 

A table front and center. Some empty beer glasses in front of them. 
Two full ones in their hands - they're both a little in their cups. 
A STRIPPER grinds and weaves her way about the small dance floor to 
the sounds of Talking Heads "Burning down the House". 

VIRGIL 
(eyeing the girl) 
You want to know the truth -- God's honest truth? 
Seeing's been the shits.


WEBSTER 
You got to be kidding me son. You can say 
that - sitting here in these prime viewing seats. 
Forget fixing your eyes - we're going to get 
your head examined.


VIRGIL 
I'm serious. I was better off blind. 
People don't have these expectations of you 
you can't live up to. You're blind - 
fine - they deal with it.


WEBSTER 
Didn't get what you expected did you?


VIRGIL 
When I was blind - I had an image of 
what everything was, up here...
(points to his head)
now - it's all different - not at all 
what I'd expected - not what I'd hoped for.


WEBSTER 
Virgil, let me explain something here. 
When you were blind - you dealt with things 
one at a time - sequentially right? A wall 
led to a door to a tree to a car. That's 
how you got to what you wanted - right.
(beat)
Seeing people - for better or worse - 
deal with everything all at once - taking in 
the whole picture - which sometimes confuses 
the hell out of what they want.
(beat)
Virgil, my advice after three beers - don't be 
afraid to take in the whole picture - just don't 
lose sight of what you want.


VIRGIL
What I want is to make it work with Amy.


WEBSTER 
And what does she have to say


VIRGIL 
She just wants me to see.


WEBSTER 
It's that important is it?


VIRGIL 
You know what I learned a long 
time ago. Seeing girls like seeing guys. 
(beat) 
I'm not going to let her down.


INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT 102 

Amy and Duncan are dancing - they seem good together. Nothing fancy 
- but they move as one about the floor. 

DUNCAN 
See - not so bad.


AMY
Not so bad.
DUNCAN 
It's nice to dance together again. 


AMY 
Yeah.


DUNCAN 
You remember...?


AMY 
First time we danced - Connecticut. We 
watched the leaves turn - so much to see 
- I'd love to go back. 


DUNCAN 
So would I. 
(beat) 
What happened to us Amy? You're so intent on 
fixing everything - why'd you give up on us?


AMY 
I learned some things can't be fixed. 
We got married for all the wrong reasons. 
I don't think I fell in love with you as 
much as I fell in love with architecture.


DUNCAN 
(serious) 
I never fell in love with architecture - 
but I know I fell in love with you. 


AMY 
Now - that's bullshit.


DUNCAN 
It used to work.


They smile at each other - everything's easy right now - pause - 
they dance - Amy looks up at Duncan - who hesitates - then leans in 
and kisses her. 

A moment and Amy pulls away slightly - looks down for a second - 
then she leans back in and they kiss again. We hold on this kiss, 
then cut to: 

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

BLACK - we hear movement - then a light comes on in the bathroom. 
Amy stands there clutching her clothes - staring into the mirror. In 
the background we see Duncan curled up asleep in bed. 

Amy stares at herself long and hard. 

AMY 
(whisper) 
Oh, God.


And she starts to dress: 

DUNCAN 
Amy? - what's going on -
what time is it?


Click - he flicks the bedside lamp on - squinting - finds Amy. She 
doesn't talk - keeps dressing. 

DUNCAN 
What's wrong?


AMY 
What's wrong? This was' a mistake - 
a big mistake. Go back to sleep - 
you've got an important meeting tomorrow.


DUNCAN 
I've got? - hold on here - you're not 
bailing out on me - I need you.


AMY 
(flat) 
For the meeting.


DUNCAN 
Of course for the meeting.


Dressed, she moves toward the doorway - Duncan sits up in bed. 

AMY 
I'm going home.


DUNCAN 
To be a babysitter.


She stops at the door. 

AMY 
Can't we for once be adults - face the 
fact that we've just made a colossal error? 


DUNCAN 
Fine - this was stupid, there - happy? - 
but goddamit Amy - I still care about you. 
Where do you actuallv think any of this is 
going to lead with this guy?


AMY 
I don't know - but the one good thing to come 
of this mess tonight - I know I want to find out.


And she's gone - WHAM. 

EXT. AMY'S LOFT - DUSK 

A cab pulls up - Amy gets out - looks up at her loft - it's dark. 

INT. AMY'S LOFT - DUSK 

Kitchen light on - a pile of Ethan's blocks on the table. Amy makes 
her way over to see it reads: 

ON THE ROOF 

EXT. AMY'S ROOF - DUSK 

Amy opens the door and sees Virgil leaning against the parapet wall, 
staring out at the night Manhattan skyline. After a moment, he walks 
back to the other end of the roof, turns and slowly walk - toward 
the parapet wall again - all the time staring at the skyline - with 
a smile and look of amazement on his face. 

AMY 
Hi


Virgil turns - finds her. 

VIRGIL 
Hey.


Amy starts toward Virgil. 

AMY 
Whatcha doing?


VIRGIL 
It's the craziest thing. You start back over 
there - focus on a building. And when you walk 
towards it - it changes - each step makes it 
look different. I started out just looking 
for the horizon.


AMY 
You can't see it from here 
- too many buildings.


VIRGIL 
But it's still there - even though you can't 
see it - right? You gotta have faith it's there. 
Things exist beyond what I can see - 
I just have to take it on faith.


She comes up next to him - Virgil, looking out over the wall turns 
to her - studies her face: 

VIRGIL 
You have so many looks?


AMY There's something I have to tell you. 
I was getting confused - which is no 
excuse for how I've acted, but...


VIRGIL
Wait - no - this isn't your fault - 
I'm the one's been a shit. You're too 
hard on yourself - expect too much of yourself.


AMY 
Virgil Â…



VIRGIL 
(stopping her) 
Let me say this. Every day of my life - 
I've wished for just one thing.


AMY 
To see.


VIRGIL 
To be whole. For just one month. For just 
one day or one minute. For one goddamned 
half a second. And not just to be able to 
run, or ride a bike, or drive a car. 
(beat) 
But for once not to have a bruise from 
bumping into something or to stand in a room
and have to ask "is anyone here" and here 
that dead silence, knowing someone is there. 
Not to have food on my sweater, or have to 
put my finger in my glass to know when it's 
full. I just want to be whole. 
(beat) 
I went to see my father the other day.


Amy moves toward him. 

VIRGIL 
I couldn't face him. I felt like 
I was letting him down. I feel 
like I'm letting you down.


AMY 
No Â…



VIRGIL 
No, listen. I gave up years ago - I'm not 
going to give up now. Amy - that day I met 
you - for the first time in my life I felt 
someone needed me as much as I needed them. 
I don't want you to give up on me.


Amy out of breath - feels a surge of love for this man - moves in 
kissing him. A long kiss - then: 

VIRGIL 
Besides I couldn't leave you - 
I owe too much in back rent.


And as Amy pulls him into embrace - we hold on her face - then: 

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY 

CLOSE ON - Dr. Aaron - harsh lights washing him out. 

AARON 
Up until the operation five weeks ago - 
Virgil had been a touch person - someone 
who's vocabulary, whole sensibility, 
his picture of the world was based on 
tactile -- non-visual terms.


INT. DOWNTOWN ATELETIC CLUB - DAY 

A HEALTH INSTRUCTOR - 50's Jack LaLaine type - is giving Virgil the 
tour of the facilities. They enter the weight/workout room. Various 
shapes and sizes of people work out on various shapes and sizes of 
workout machines. 

Aaron's voice-over continues as Jack motions to Virgil to follow 
him.. Virgil hesitates. 

HIS POV - chrome, iron, plastic - but somehow it's more defined than 
we've seen before. 

Determined - Virgil starts his way into the gym - hand' out brushing 
by what he sees in front of him. 

AARON (CONT'D)
But - now - as a sighted person - by 
focusing singlemindedly on his goal, 
Virgil has a new found ability to 
understand his own physical relationship 
to objects in his life around him...


Virgil now drops his hand - starts moving through the maze of people 
and equipment - actually "seeing" his way. 

AARON (CONT'D)
Distance, size, shape - perspective - 
now all have profound meaning to him...


EXT. HEALTH CLUB - DAY 

Virgil negotiating a glass door - exiting the building. 

AARON (CONT'D)

and though there are still miles to go in his 
learning process - for all medical intents 
and purposes - he is becoming a seeing person.


Virgil walking down the street - deftly dodging a kid on a 
skateboard - throwing out his hand to hail a cab. 
AARON (CONT'D)
This is an extraordinary achievement and 
advancement for medical science and a 
tribute to Virgil's determination to see.


INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY 

AARON (CONT'D)
Ladies and Gentlemen - Virgil Anderson.


Applause and Virgil looking to Amy in the audience, stands - a 
seeing man - and easily makes his way to the podium. Standing in the 
lights he readjusts the microphone - moving it up from the much 
shorter Aaron. 

VIRGIL 
(clears his throat) 
Since this may be one of our last 
sessions - are there any questions?


VOICE IN THE DARK 
Mr. Anderson - is there something you
were surprised to see for the first time
- something that looked quite different 
than you thought?


VIRGIL 
Breasts. 
(laughter) 
No, really. Don't get me wrong - I love them 
- they just weren't what I expected.


VOICE 
What about your girlfriend?


VIRGIL 
Whose did you think I was talking about?


Laughs. 

ANOTHER VOICE IN THE DARK 
Now that you're fully seeing - 
what are you looking forward to most?


VIRGIL 
Not having to do these sessions. 
(laugh) 
No - actually - being independent.


VOICE 
Can you read yet?


VIRGIL 
No, but...


VOICE 
Will you ever be able to?


VIRGIL 
I don't know.


VOICE 
If you can't read - will you ever be able to drive?


VIRGIL 
(suddenly somber) 
I don't know.


VOICE 
Well how can you say...


FAMILIAR VOICE 
(interrupting) 
Virgil. After so many years of darkness - 
describe what it is to actually see.


Angle on the Voice in the dark. Webster. 

CLOSE ON - Virgil - as he thinks about the question. 

INT. ROSWELL-TREMONT - AMY'S OFFICE - LATE DAY 

CLOSE ON - the Atlanta project. Miniature size. And a set of plans 
laid out across Amy's desk. Virgil's hand comes into frame - touches 
the model - moves to the plans - touches them. 

ON VIRGIL - alone in Amy's office - looking at her work. We go to 
his face - his eyes - we see that he is seeing Amy's work. 

AMY (O.S.)
You're here.


Virgil looks up - Amy at the doorway. 

VIRGIL 
The Atlanta project - I thought it went away.


AMY 
Duncan did some song and dance - Falk's coming
to the lobby opening tomorrow - see our work.


VIRGIL 
I see it Amy.


AMY 
What's that?


VIRGIL 
Your world. What you do. The plans - 
the work the ideas. The molding. 
For the first time I really see what
you do - and not just up here... 
(he points to his head) 
but in here.


Virgil's hand goes out to her chest - places it on her heart. 

AMY 
(moves in close, sexy)
Tonight is your night something 
special I want to show you
VIRGIL 
What is it?


SMASH TO: 

EXT. BUILDING - LATE DAY 

AMY (V.0.) 
Everything.


TOP OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER 

The sun starting to set - the whole of the five burroughs of New 
York laid out in front of us. Virgil moves to the edge - looks out 
over this amazing panorama. 

Amy moves up next to Virgil - they take it in a moment. 

AMY 
That's the Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State 
Building, Chrysler building just over there...


VIRGIL 
Amy, look at me.


AMY 
What? 


VIRGIL 
This face - this is everything. It's all 
I've ever wanted to see. 
(he watches her) 
You have so many looks. 
What do all those looks mean?


AMY 
Well. Let's see. This... 
(makes corresponding face) 
... is sad. This...is frustrated. 
This... is tired. This.. is confused. 
This.. is happy. And this... 
(her face softens) 
... is what in love looks like.


Virgil puts his hand on her face - looks at it carefully. 

VIRGIL 
This look - this look I love. 

Amy leans forward and kisses him - and he soon forgets it even 
happened. As they kiss we pull slowly back and away as the sun goes 
deep gold and we start to hear what sounds like rain: 

We cut to: 

INT. AMY'S LOFT - NIGHT 

And they are still kissing - and we realize they are in the shower - 
together - kissing - exploring - very sensual. As Virgil moves to 
kiss her neck - her breasts - Amy's head tilts back in to the spray. 

AMY 
Virgil - it's raining.


And he moves up again - looks her in the eyes - and for a moment his 
eyesight shudders ever so slight1y - it goes away and they kiss 
again. 

EXT. AMY'S LOFT - MORNING 

Amy and Virgil on the street - each hailing separate cabs. 

AMY 
So - eight o'clock tonight.


VIRGIL 
Eight o'clock - building opening - 
I haven't forgotten.


She blows him a kiss and she's gone. Virgil watches her cab pull 
away - clear something is bothering him. 

HIS POV - his vision going in and out. Then clear, then clouded 
again. 

INT. DOWNTOWN ATHLETIC CLUB - DAY 

Virgil's massage room. Not as organized as he had at Bear Mtn.. 
Virgil is working on an OVERWEIGHT MAN - his back is splotchy from 
too much sun. 

Virgil massaging - becomes preoccupied with his skin's imperfections 
- losing his concentration. 

OVERWEIGHT MAN 
Hey, Virgil - I'm the one supposed 
to fall asleep here. 


VIRGIL 
Yes - sorry.


He closes his eyes - gets back into his rhythm. 

INT. ATHLETIC CLUB - LATER 

Virgil, pack over his shoulder leaving for the day - about to cut 
through the weight room - when it suddenly comes to a halt. 

His POV - his vision fading in and out - and then suddenly quick 
flashes of black. On the final BLACK: 

We smash to: 

INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY 

Virgil at the desk. The Nurse looks up. 

VIRGIL 
Daphne - I need to see Dr. Aaron 
- right away. It's an emergency.


INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY 

Dr. Aaron is again examining Virgil on the Electroretinogram. Done, 
Aaron pulls the machine out of the way. Looks at Virgil - rubs his 
hand across his face. 

VIRGIL 
What does that mean?


AARON 
What?


VIRGIL 
What you just did?


Virgil imitates him. 

AARON 
It means - the machine is only registering 
sparks of activity - retinal sparks - 
followed by nothing. How long has this 
been going on?


VIRGIL 
I don't know - first I thought I was 
tired - some blurs - occasional cloudiness 
but it's been getting worse. Today I'm 
getting complete blackouts.


AARON 
Your retinal function is down ten 
percent. I'm afraid - your retinal 
disease seems to have returned.


VIRGIL 
You're afraid. What does that mean - I 
thought you corrected it. You told me 
I was a 'seeing person'.


AARON 
Now, you've every right to be upset. 
Maybe you didn't have the blood vessels 
to supply enough oxygen to the retinas. 
- Possibly some trauma - there are so 
many variables...(beat)
to be honest, I don't know. I wish to God I did.


Virgil stands, anxious - starts pacing. 

VIRGIL 
OK. You're the expert. Tell me - what 
do we do now - how do we repair this?


AARON 
Virgil. I -- I wish there was a 
nice way to say this.


Virgil backs away - doesn't want to hear it. 

VIRGIL 
No - there is no nice way to say it is 
there. No nice way to let the man know 
it's all over - that.. he's going blind again!


AARON 
Virgil, I understand what...


VIRGIL 
No you don't! Don't ever say that. 
You'll never understand. Ever!


Aaron stands there - says nothing - tries to let Virgil's anger 
dissipate. A long moment. 

VIRGIL 
How long?


AARON 
Hard to say. 
Month - few weeks - 
(beat) 
Days.


Virgil stands there stunned - then looking to Aaron. 

VIRGIL 
God, what do I tell Amy? 
What do I tell her?


On Virgil's face. 

INT. EYE INSTITUTE HALLWAY - DAY 

Virgil steps into the hall - Sees: 

A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY - blind - eyes half shut - hands reaching out, 
plodding it' a half circle over to where his mother waits for him. 

And we see the realization on Virgil's face of seeing his past - and 
what he will return to: 

EXT. STREETS - DAY 

Virgil RUNNING, RUNNING, best he can - through the crowded street - 
hands out - bumping into people - desperate - scared - trying to run 
from himself - from his fate. 

WHAM - he comes to a stop - out of breath - he looks left - right - 
where do you go - then sees something off screen. His face torn with 
fear - he moves forward - hand out - reaching to a window - to his 
own REFLECTION. 

And we push slowly in on the reflection as he touches the window - 
his hand on his face - a face he may never see again - and a cloud 
passes overhead and his reflection is gone. 

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 

Virgil stands at the site - amidst the rubble and mud. His Father 
walks slowly over to him - raising his arms to embrace him. 

Virgil takes a step back - not, ready - his father stops, 
understands - looks his son up and down. 

FATHER 
You look good. Hey - how do I look?


VIRGIL 
I need some answers. Why'd you leave? Because 
I'm blind - or because I quit trying to see?


FATHER 
To the point - I like that - 
something you got from me.


VIRGIL 
Cut the bullshit - "dad". I don't hear from 
you for over twenty years - then you find 
out I can see and all of a sudden you show up?


FATHER 
(looks around) 
Hey. Virge - can we talk about this later, huh...


VIRGIL 
No, not later. Now! Was my blindness so 
wrong that made you tear our family apart.


Virgil's riled his father. He steps towards Virgil tries to speak 
under his breath. 

FATHER 
Every morning I woke up and looked at you 
and saw my own failures. If I couldn't get 
my own son to see then...What difference 
does any of this make - you can see now 
- hell, I knew you could.


Virgil watches his father - this stranger. His eyes start to well. 

VIRGIL 
I'm going blind again.


His Father looks at him - stunned. He reels from the news - takes a 
step back. 

FATHER 
No...


VIRGIL 
The doctor told me today. You're the first 
person I've told. I wanted to come see 
you before it was completely gone.


FATHER 
(speechless) 

A beat and Virgil's father takes another step back, then turns and 
walks away - forever. 

EXT. NEW BUILDING - LATE DAY 

Virgil standing across the street. Trying to take in the building 

EXT. NEW BUILDING - LATE DAY 

Standing at the front as a security guard opens the door. 

GUARD 
Sorry the building doesn't open until tonight.


VIRGIL 
I know. I'm Virgil Anderson...with Roswell 
Tremont. We did the lobby. I'm here to 
check some details for tonight.


GUARD 
Oh, okay, sure Mr. Anderson.


INT. LOBBY - LATE DAY 

The lobby is pretty, straightforward. Open - a few plants - a large 
central check in desk. Simple - unobtrusive - nothing exceptional or 
unique. 

Virgil moves his way about the lobby - looking at it carefully from 
every possible angle - his hand grazing across walls, entranceways - 
desperately committing as much as he can to memory - finally ending 
up in the middle of the room in a final attempt to absorb as much as 
he can. 

GUARD (O.S.) 
You want to see that the thing work?


VIRGIL 
Thing? What thing?


GUARD 
This thing


The Guard reaches over - hits a switch - and against one section of 
windows a wall of water comes dripping down - causing a shower of 
indoor rain - the sound instantly echoing off of the walls. 

Virgil smiles - moves toward it - closing his eyes - listening to 
the indoor rain - really taking in the room having total empathy 
with what Amy has created. 

INT. AMY'S LOFT - BATHROOM 

Virgil, wrapped in a towel, is shaving. But he has his eyes closed. 
Amy comes in, dressed beautifully - using the mirror to put her 
earrings in. Virgil quickly opens his eyes. 

VIRGIL 
You nervous?


AMY 
No - not a bit. 
What do you think?


She pivots for him. 

VIRGIL 
You look great.


AMY 
Really. Not too flashy? 
(she looks in the mirror, she is nervous) 
I'm going to change.


Virgil lets her go - calls to her. 

VIRGIL 
This is an important night for you.


AMY 
But you know what's most important... 
(she pokes her head in) 
That you're going to be there to see it.


Virgil turns to the mirror, stares at himself - contemplating what 
he's up against. 

INT. NEW BUILDING - NIGHT 

The lobby is filled with business types, waiters circulating with 
champagne, tiny hors-d'oeuvres. Virgil and Amy enter - standing at 
the top of the stairs leading to the party. Virgil immediately going 
into a performance for Amy. 

AMY 
So.


VIRGIL 
Amy, it's good - very good. 
I'm proud of you. I love the detail 
- planted pots in the corners, 
the moldings... 
(beat) 
It's got genuine lines.


AMY 
(excited) 
Look around - do you see it?


VIRGIL 
What?


He looks about the room - then turns towards the indoor rain. 

HIS POV - clear - then slight haziness - a momentary flash of black 
- then back in focus. 

He turns to Amy. Puts his arm around her. 

VIRGIL 
Our rain. 


AMY 
Your rain.


DUNCAN 
Hey Virgil.


He extends his hand. Virgil, obliged slowly extends his - having 
trouble focusing - but Duncan helps him - taking hold of it and 
shaking it. 

DUNCAN 
Still working on that hand shake 
you'll get it don't worry.


VIRGIL 
Congratulations - the place looks great.


DUNCAN 
Thanks - here's the genius though - 
I just get the gigs. Can I steal her 
away Falks' over there and I can't 
tell if he's impressed with our work 
or just has gas from the pate.


VIRGIL 
Go - do your thing.


AMY 
I'll be right back. There's food 
and drinks down on the floor.


Duncan and Amy start down the stairs as Virgil tries to find a safe 
place to stand. His eyesight fading in and out - he looks around - 
decides to negotiate the steps: 

He takes one step on the stairs - looks down - is able to see Amy 
with Falk and Duncan, looking up at him - she smiles - he does his 
best - smiles back - lets go of the handrail - takes another step - 
finally reaching the bottom floor. 

He stands there for a long moment - lost as to where to move. A 
glimpse towards the rain sculpture and he starts towards it using 
the sound to help guide him. 

Amy looks over - sees Virgil moving across the floor - gives him a 
little wave - he doesn't notice her. 

At the rain Virgil stands taking in the sound. A FIGURE comes up 
next to him. 

VIRGIL 
Quite a party. Love the detail of the building.


WEBSTER 
Sometimes the detail doesn't matter.


Virgil stops - turns to Webster. 

VIRGIL 
Ray. What are you doing here?


WEBSTER 
Aaron called me. He was worried. 
I've been trying to find you - 
Amy's office told me you were 
here. It's bad?


VIRGIL 
It's almost gone. Last few days 
have been pretty bad.


WEBSTER 
Obviously Amy doesn't know.


VIRGIL 
It's going to break her heart. 
This is her big night - I didn't 
want to ruin it. Thought I could 
pull it off.


WEBSTER 
(beat) 
You can't avoid this forever.


Virgil turns back towards the rain. 

VIRGIL 
I know 
(beat) 
So Ray? Is it better to have seen and 
lost than never to have seen at all?


WEBSTER 
I thought it was loved and lost.


Amy comes up to them. 

AMY 
Dr. Webster - this is a surprise.


WEBSTER 
Virgil invited me - wanted to show 
you off I think. The place is terrific 
- he's got every right to be proud.


AMY 
Thank-you. I need Virgil for a 
moment - schmoozing time.


WEBSTER 
Shmooze away.


VIRGIL 
(as he's led away) 
Thanks Ray. I'll call you.


ANGLE ON - Duncan standing anxiously with Falk and his wife Donna as 
they arrive. 

AMY 
Virgil - I'd like you to meet Jack 
Falk and his wife Donna up from Atlanta.


VIRGIL 
Pleased to meet you.


DONNA 
Amy tells us you were blind.


Amy spurts out a glass of wine. Virgil deflects the comment. 

VIRGIL 
That's OK - nice to see someone so honest.


FALK 
Amy tells us you're her inspiration. 
Any help you can give us with our project?


VIRGIL 
I'm a little biased but I kind of 
liked Amy's original design.


FALK 
But could we do better.


Amy jumps in with. 

AMY 
We could do better, Mr. Falk - a lot better.


FALK 
Good, I like that attitude. 
Let's keep trying for perfection.


Everyone smiles - Amy wraps her arm around Virgil. 

AMY 
That's right - that's 
why I've got Virgil.


Pleasant laughter all around - and as Amy and the others continue - 
we push in on Virgil as he takes in this thought. 

EXT. NEW BUILDING - NIGHT 

Virgil and Amy out front. People leaving - Duncan getting into a 
town car with Falk and his wife - he looks back - gives the thumbs 
up and climbs in after them. The car pulls away into the night. 

VIRGIL 
You wanna walk - I feel like some air.


AMY 
See what we see? Sure.


VIRGIL 
Can I take your arm - eyes a little tired.


As they walk. 

VIRGIL 
You really made the place 
come alive with that fountain.


AMY 
Thank-you. 
(beat) 
You know I've been thinking - you're doing 
so great now - and if we get this new 
design job we'd have some extra money
- I think we should go on a big seeing
celebration.


VIRGIL 
(taken aback) 
A seeing celebration?


AMY 
Yeah, maybe in a couple of months. 
I looked into Egypt - we could see 
the pyramids - we could see it 
together for the first time. 
What do you say?


VIRGIL 
You know - there is something 
I'd like to see.


AMY 
Of course, anything.


VIRGIL 
The Rangers play tomorrow. Season'll 
be over before we know it - could be
our last chance.


AMY 
The Rangers. Sure, why not?


BLACK 

Then a tiny pinpoint of light ahead - one that grows increasingly 
larger as we move towards a SOUND. A hum that grows in intensity 
until the light fills the frame and BAM - we exit the tunnel and we 
are: 

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT 

That glorious first view - people - the white ice shining below like 
a giant jewel- and the players - in bright colors scurrying about 
the playing surface below. 

AMY 
This is amazing - isn't it?


She looks to Virgil who is awed by what he is seeing. Then suddenly 
on his face - a flash - one of those moments of darkness. 

AMY 
Should we find our seats. Looks 
like the game's already started.


VIRGIL 
Yeah - I - I'll follow you.


INT. GARDEN - SEATS - LATER 

Virgil and Amy in the loge seats - on the aisle - up behind the 
goal. Amy looking at the stadium while Virgil next to her, watches 
the game best he can. 

AMY 
I love the stadium the 
way it's structure...


VIRGIL 
Amy - the game...


AMY 
Right - the game.


SMASH - a hard check into the boards deep in the Rangers end of the 
ice. The puck squirts out Gretzky picks it up - fires it across ice 
- one, two it's back to him and he has a wide open break from center 
ice - the crowd is out of their seats - Virgil included - Amy 
quickly getting caught up in the enthusiasm. 

On Virgil's face - watching Gretzky skate towards him - excited - 
then losing him - another flash of blackness - like a blow to the 
head - and we hear the crowd suddenly explode - and as Virgil's 
vision regains we see the players mobbing Wayne after his goal - the 
little red light behind the net the only evidence of it happening. 

We see the frustration as Virgil realizes he'll never see it. 

AMY 
He scored, he scored - you see 
that - it was amazing.


As the players make their way to center ice - the crowd sits and Amy 
sees the expression again on his face. 

AMY 
What? That was good right?


VIRGIL 
Yeah - it was great - I was just...


Suddenly Virgil becomes transfixed. Walking down the aisle, away 
from him: 

A VENDOR - carrying a tray of PINK COTTON CANDY. 

Virgil stares at it a moment - transfixed - then like in a trance - 
he stands - stepping out into the aisle - a man on a mission. 

AMY 
Virgil, where are you going?


And he's on the stairs - carefully moving down the stairs toward the 
vendor. 

Then she sees the Vendor - handing Virgil a large cotton candy - 
round and puffy like a cloud - but something he can hold in his 
hand. Amy can't believe it - watching Virgil - his fascination at 
finding this long lost memory. 

AMY 
The puffy thing.


Angle on Virgil turning - admiring his prize - then looking up, 
trying to find Amy - who waves to him excited. 

HIS POV - scanning the crowd - it's hazy - then flashes of dark. 

Amy's face - suddenly drops - it's clear, even though she is only 
four rows up - he doesn't see her. 

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT 

Game is over - Virgil is packing up his stuff - Amy staring. at him. 

AMY 
Virgil, what's happening?


VIRGIL 
Just having a bad eye day. 
A lot to take in.


AMY 
Tell me. What's going on?


VIRGIL 
Nothing. I see almost nothing.


Amy: she feels like she's about to explode. 

AMY 
Oh God.


VIRGIL 
It's OK.


AMY 
OK?!!


VIRGIL 
It's OK for you to cry.


AMY 
(recovering) 
No, no - I'm not going to cry. 
Solve the problem. We made it 
through one operation - we'll 
make it through another. We won't
give up. We'll get this right 
- we just need to...


VIRGIL 
I saw Dr. Aaron. 
There's nothing they can do.


AMY 
Then we'll find another Doctor. 
There's got to be someone else. 
We'll find something that works.


VIRGIL 
Don't you get it - 
I can't go through this again.


AMY 
So just like that - we just forget it - 
give up? Why the hell haven't you told
me what was going on?


VIRGIL 
(whirls on her) 
Because of this!!


AMY 
What this?


VIRGIL 
You! Not letting it go - thinking 
there's a solution. Goddamit, 
I'm not design flaw in your fucking 
work that you can just change to 
make work Or throw away because 
it doesn't meet your expectations. 
(beat) 
Let's face it - it's over!!


AMY 
Virgil, give it time, you'll see.


VIRGIL 
No! I won't! This conversation is ended!!


INT. AMY'S APARTNENT - NIGHT 

The door swings open - Amy and Virgil enter - Virgil moves towards 
the bed - pulls out his duffel bag. 

AMY 
What are you doing?


VIRGIL 
I'm leaving.


AMY 
What do you mean leaving - you're 
leaving this apartment - you're 
leaving New York - you're leaving me?


Virgil turns - they stand across the room from each other - miles 
apart. 

VIRGIL 
I'm going home.


Amy walks toward him, picking a battle, rejection. 

AMY 
So you're big sister can take care of you - 
feed you TV dinners for of your life.


Virgil tries to side step her. 

VIRGIL 
I'm not going to go through this bullshit again.


Amy moves in front - confronting him 

AMY 
Is that what this has all
been to you - bullshit?


VIRGIL 
Yes!! Who the hell were we fooling? 
I'm blind - I'm not meant to see 
- I don't belong here.


AMY 
God damn right you're blind. You want to 
live in your own little world - this perfect 
world that your sister built for you 
- where no one can touch you ... where no 
one can reach you.


VIRGIL 
Do you know the reason why I remembered the 
cotton candy all those years? Because I went 
to the game with my father. And it's the 
only good thing I can remember about him. 
The rest is him pushing me to be something
I'm not - then turning his back on me the 
minute his plans fail.


AMY 
I am not turning my back on you. 
You want me to give up on you 
- you love the self pity.


VIRGIL 
I don't want you to give up on ME. 
But you won't give up on me seeing.


AMY 
Because there must be other options.


VIRGIL 
Not anymore.


Virgil, avoiding her, sidesteps quickly past her - straight into the 
lamp, which crashes to the ground and breaks. 

DARKNESS. 

VIRGIL 
Dammit.


A short few steps then a much larger crash - the sound of a large 
heavier thing breaking. 

AMY 
Virgil!!


Amy feels her way to the lights - and turns them on. We see that 
Virgil has collided with Amy's sculpture of the woman. He sits among 
the pieces on the floor. 

Virgil - feeling the damage. 

AMY 
(going to him) 
Is anything broken?


VIRGIL 
No - no bones are broken.


Virgil uses the wall to stand - then - with his hands out in front 
of him he finds his way to the bed. 

VIRGIL 
It's finished - can't you see that! 
We both didn't get what we wanted.


AMY 
(quietly) 
I never meant to hurt you.


VIRGIL 
When you asked me to come here - 
did you ever think this wasn't going 
to work - that for one minute I may 
not be able to see. 
(beat) 
Did you ever think it would be OK 
to have a relationship with a blind man?


Amy - a pause.. Too long. 

VIRGIL 
There's my answer.


And he grabs his duffel and pack - throws the last few things in - 
and moving to the door - leaves. 

INT. BUS - NIGHT - RAINING 

Virgil riding - crossing the George Washington Bridge - going home. 
He looks out the window - sees the receding city - and he closes his 
eyes - listens to the rain. 

EXT. PINECREST - MAIN STREET - NIGHT 

The Bus comes down the main street of Pinecrest. Stopping - the bus 
door opens and Virgil gets out - and turns to face up the street - 
the street he knew so well that is so foreign to him right now. 

EXT. VIRGIL AND JENNIE'S - NIGHT 

The door opens. Jennie smiles warmly, reaches out to him. 

JENNIE 
Welcome home.


INT. HOME - NIGHT 

Virgil and Jennie entering his place - to be greeted immediately by: 

SOPHIE bounding across the floor towards them - tail wagging - 
tongue hanging out. 

VIRGIL 
Sophie!?


And he bends down to hug her. Sophie laps at his face. Virgil holds 
her back to get a good look at her. 

VIRGIL 
Let me look at you. 
You're so beautiful.. yes.


Jennie watches her brother - happy to have him home. Hoping to get 
him back to 'normal'. 

INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - LATER 

Virgil walks around, touching things, seeing the simplicity of his 
life. Nothing on the walls - no decorations - no plants. Everything 
functional. He realizes this is a home designed by his sister. 

He moves over to the photo of the family. He on his dad's shoulders. 
Stares at it - at his father and mother for the first time. 

JENNIE 
Mom and dad. 

Virgil just stares. 

JENNIE 
Everything's as you left it. 
Nothing's changed.


VIRGIL 
Jen - I'm pretty tired - 
I'd like to be alone.


The PHONE rings. Rings again. Virgil doesn't move - his apprehension 
is clear - he knows who it is. Jennie sees this and moves toward the 
phone. 

Virgil turns and walks out onto the front porch - followed by 
Sophie, as his sister picks up the phone in the background. 

EXT. VIRGIL'S PORCH - NIGHT 

He sits down - looks into the night as we hear Jennie faintly on the 
phone. A beat and she hangs up. We hold on Virgil: 

EXT. PINECREST STREET - DAY 

Virgil walks down Main street. Seeing his town - a town he grew up 
in but now seems so foreign. Virgil seems oddly disturbed by what he 
sees. 

The yellow bus drives by - full of kids - Carl at the helm. Somehow 
it's not what he expected. 

INT. ROSWELL-TRRMONT DESIGN FIRM - DAY 

Amy organizing all her work on the Atlanta project - - the original 
designs - the new design with the trees - then she sees: 

The sketch she made of the "dancing trees". Her eyes hold - and she 
slowly shuts them - and with them tightly closed - her hand reaches 
out and runs along the drawings. 

EXT. PINECREST - END OF MAIN STREET - DAY 

We find Virgil standing - looking out at the end of the street where 
he stood with Amy. In front of him he sees: 

The "dancing trees". 

VIRGIL'S POV - a retinal spark - a quick glimpse of the intertwined 
trees - one lover choosing between two others. 

INT. FIREHOUSE - LATE DAY 

Virgil - stands in the middle of the room. Looks about at what was 
at one time so special to him. Now it just seems old and dingy - the 
magic is gone. 

He closes his eyes for a moment - listens - cocks his head to the 
left - the right - but there is nothing there. 

EXT. TOWN LIBRARY - LATE DAY 

Virgil standing outside - staring at a building he's never seen - 
never been inside. 

HIS POV: flickering a moment. 

INT. LIBRARY - SUNSET 

Virgil now sits at a table. Stacks and stacks of LIFE magazine 
splayed out in front of him. He is flipping through them at a rapid 
rate - like a drowning man searching for air. 

IMAGES - cars, JFK, the pyramids, Martin Luther King, houses, 
flowers, Marilyn Monroe, that Napalm burned little girl in Viet Nam, 
African masks, Dachau prisoners, Nixon, Warhol paintings, the Mona 
Lisa, that vulture watching over the little baby, the Eiffel tower, 
First Man on the moon, the Venus De Milo, that guy in front of the 
tank in Tianaman square .. and the Pyramids. 

The pictures go by fast and furious - Virgil soaking them up like a 
sponge - life, beauty, horror, great people, great events... 

And we move in on his face - absorbing these images for the last 
time - a face filled with anguish at a world disappearing. And we 
cut to: 

EXT. AMY'S ROOF - SUNSET 

Golden rays of the late afternoon sun. Amy on the roof - leaning on 
the parapet - watching the horizon. 

Then a thought comes to her. And mimicking what Virgil had done - 
she walks back to the other end of the roof, turns and looks out 
towards the skyline again ... then starts slowly walking towards the 
parapet till she reaches the wall again. 

The reaction on her face - she doesn't "see" it - not like Virgil 
did. 

INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - DAY 

Virgil is shifting furniture in his house. A table - moves it to the 
window - moves a chair to join it - stands back to have a look at 
it. 

HIS POV - a moment of clear - then haze - then dark - then haze. 

Virgil rubs his head - these last days of sight have been painful 
and exhausting for him. 

JENNIE (O.S.) 
Hello! 

She's at the door. Virgil cocks his head in her direction. 

JENNIE 
I picked up some things at the store - 
T-shirts, I'm sure you're out, some socks...


VIRGIL 
Jennie, what's at the 
end of Main Street?


JENNIE 
Well - I think it's Vivian's little stationery...


VIRGIL 
Beyond all the stores - past firehouse. 
What happens when this is no more Main Street?


JENNIE 
Well - there's nothing really - you know that. ~ 

VIRGIL 
No! You told me that's all there was. 
That's wrong. There's a helluva lot out there.


Jennie surprised at where this is going. 

JENNIE 
I told you what you needed to know.


VIRGIL 
What was within my reach.


JENNIE 
What more do vou want?


VIRGIL 
Isn't there anything more that vou want?


JENNIE 
Is this about our father -
he called told me...


VIRGIL 
No. This isn't about him. Jennie - 
you've spent your whole life as 
blind as I was. The world doesn't 
stop within our reach.


JENNIE 
Virgil, please. This is your home. 
Stop thinking about what's out there 
- things that will never matter to you. 
You're safe here where everyone...


VIRGIL 
Where everyone what!?


JENNIE 
Knows you.


VIRGIL 
Can protect me?! (beat) 
Jennie, this place was a wonderful safe 
haven for me growing up. I know that. 
(looking around) 
And I can only imagine what you gave up 
to keep this world for me. I thank you 
and love you from the bottom of my soul. 
But now I want to give you your life back.


JENNIE 
Virgil, I - I can't...


VIRGIL 
You can


Virgil reaches out his arms for her to join him. 

VIRGIL 
I'm reaching out, Jennie.


This gets Jennie and she goes to him, really hugging him for the 
first time as tears flow from her eyes. 

INT. AMY'S LOFT - LATE DAY 

Amy, dressed in sweat pants and tee shirt sitting on the ground, 
trying to piece the sculpture back together. It's a difficult fix. 

KNOCK KNOCK 

DUNCAN 
Amy - you in there.


AMY 
Go away.


She scrapes some plaster into a dust pan. We hear enters a key in 
the door - and the door opens. Duncan 

DUNCAN 
I knew keeping this key would come in 
handy one day. What a mess - what happened?


AMY 
It broke - I'm trying to fix it.


DUNCAN 
So - guess what?


AMY 
I'm not in the mood for games.


DUNCAN 
We got it. The goddamned Atlanta mall - 
we got it!! Now - pull yourself out of this 
slump - I want you to fly down this week to...


Continuing to work on the sculpture. 

AMY 
I'm not going.


DUNCAN 
What are you ta1king about? 
What's the problem here?


AMY 
The problem?! Everything. 
Nothing is right thank-you very much.


DUNCAN 
You know what the problem is - you're 
the problem - you met a blind guy you 
thought was cool and spent the first 
two months trying to change him.


AMY 
Are you finished?


DUNCAN 
Not even close. Let me tell you something 
- you can't change people to solve you. 
You tried to do it with me - you tried 
to do it with Virgil. You ever think 
some of the things you try to fix 
- ain't broke.


And he's gone - as Amy slumps into a chair - confused, tired - then 
slowly she starts to hear: 

TAP - TAP - TAP...TAPTAP - TAP 

The SOUND of a CANE in the stairwell! Amy's heart starts racing - 
she takes a breath - jumps up quickly and moves her way over to the 
door - unlocking it and swinging it open: 

AMY 
(excitedly) 
Virg .......


The CANE - being held by Ethan - as he taps his way down the stairs. 

ETHAN 
Hey Amy.


AMY 
Hi, Ethan. Sorry - I thought...


ETHAN 
He's not coming back is he?


AMY 
No - he's not.


Ethan sees she's covered in dust - looks past her into the loft. 

ETHAN 
Whatcha doin'?


He looks past her at the sculpture half repaired. 

AMY 
Cleaning up a mess - going to start over.


EXT. PINECREST - SUNSET 

Virgil walks the path, Sophie following close behind. By the way he 
walks, counting steps, touching landmarks, we realize he is using 
sight very little. 

EXT. HIDDEN VALLEY - SUNSET 

Coming through the clearing, to the plateau where he took Amy, the 
leaves now starting to turn golden colors - he stops - stands over 
top of the pond. 

VIRGIL'S POV - A retinal spark. The view across the valley, with 
white clouds against the bluest sky. 

His hand reaches out - to touch the edge of the world - to touch the 
horizon. 

And as he drops his hand, we see the clouds start to race by - while 
the blue sky goes golden then drifts into darkness. Virgil doesn't 
move from the spot. The screen goes almost black - then slowly the 
sun starts to rise in the east. 

Virgil makes no movement. A long beat - then - as the sun moves 
across him - he realizes it's day. He stands and unfolds his cane. 
It's clear he has returned to being completely blind. 

As he turns and starts his way down the hill we hear: 

VIRGIL (V.O.)
Growing up blind - I had two dreams. 
One was to see. The other - to play 
for the New York Rangers.


INT. LECTURE HALL - N.Y. EYE INSTITUTE - DAY 

Virgil stands at the podium speaking - dark glasses on, cane in 
hand. 

VIRGIL 
After the 'miracle' of my short period of 
sight - I realize - I'd rather play for the Rangers. 
(laughs from the dark) 
It's not that it was so awful - I saw many 
things - some good, some back some that 
I'm already forgetting.


INT. WEBSTER'S LAB - NYU 

VIRGIL (V.O.)
But I realized that our eyes aren't what 
make us see. We only live in darkness 
when we don't look - look at what is 
genuine about ourselves - genuine 
about others - you don't need eyes for that.


Virgil sitting with three young blind children - working through 
Braille with them. Webster watches from the corner of the room. 

EXT. NYU - DAY 

Virgil - small brown bag in one hand - cane in the other - exits the 
building and makes his way across the street to Washington Square. 

EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY 

Virgil - taking in the sun - finishing off the last of his sandwich. 
Balling up his paper bag - he taps his cane out - finds the garbage 
can nearby - and tosses the bag - rim shot - it misses, hits the 
ground. A hand reaches into frame and puts the bag in the garbage. 
Virgil looks up - senses the presence. 

VIRGIL 
Did I miss?


VOICE (O.S.) 
By a mile.


VIRGIL 
Amy?


ANGLE ON Amy: watching Virgil - realizing his sight is gone. 

AMY 
Ray told me you were living in town 
- said I could find you here. 
(beat) 
I rushed, didn't I? Fourteen steps 
to the tree and I made us smash 
right into it.


VIRGIL 
We tried.


Amy sits next to him. 

AMY 
I finished the sculpture. 
I'd love you to see it.


VIRGIL 
Figure of speech.


AMY 
Figure of speech. Virgil - when I 
first met you - you saw more than 
any sighted person I've ever known. 
I didn't mean to take that away from you.


VIRGIL 
Amy. I saw ... I actually saw 
the horizon. You did that for me. 
It's out there. You showed me you 
just have to reach for it..


Amy smiles - her hand goes out - hesitates - then lands lightly on 
his. 

AMY 
You want to walk?


VIRGIL 
See what we see?


AMY 
Yeah. Just see what we see.


Virgil smiles, nods. As he stands - he takes her arm - and as they 
walk off into the park, we slowly FADE to BLACK and just LISTEN, 
listen to the SOUNDS of the day - the percussion of the city. 

THE END
