          Sleepy thick fatigue, the end of a red-eye flight. Most
          passengers still asleep, a few read, or stare blankly.
          In business class, A HUSBAND and WIFE, mid-30's. He's awake,
          reading a document. She sleeps nestled against his shoulder.
          He's trim, sharp, good looking in an academic way. Even in
          sleep, she's beautiful. Wide-mouthed and honey-haired.
          The plane's aspect SHIFTS, the pilot's voice comes on in
          German. The man lifts his window shade, peers out at the
          first rays of sun touching the skyline of Berlin.

          The couple. Dr. Martin Harris and Elizabeth Harris. WIDER: a

          CHUNK! KA-CHUNK! Stamps both passports, swipes the bar

          Raining. A melee of travelers and vehicles. Liz beside him,
          Martin wheels a baggage cart through the crush. An ATTENDANT
          ushers them toward a waiting cab and DRIVER...
          a CRASH of THUNDER -- the rain suddenly triples in
          strength. A DELUGE. The taxi driver hustles Martin and Liz
          towards his car. He shields his head with a newspaper,
          piling their bags into the trunk, cursing.
          Martin sets down his case, moves to help the driver...

          Tegel airport. Arrivals. Quick.
          The driver pulls out into traffic. The rain still heavy.
          Martin stares out at the wet city. Eyes track as the shadowy
          columns of the Brandenburg Gate pass by. He lets himself
          relax a little, enjoying this moment of forced calm.
          He catches sight of the driver in the rear-view. Young,
          female, shortish hair. Tomboy cute. Smart eyes, older than
          her years. Layers of clothing. GINA.
          She glances into the mirror, catches Martin watching her.

          DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, just missing the boxed REFRIGERATOR

          Doctor Harris, it's all right.
          The taxi you were in went into
          the river. You were the only
          passenger. Your heart stopped
          for six minutes. It is Thursday,
          November 27th. For four days you
          have been in a coma.

          driver, who saved your life,

          accident and no one else has come
          forward. I must apologize, but
          we had no idea who you were.

          Martin exits, pulling dirty clothing closed against the cold.
          He scans the street, unnerved, frowns as he spots A BROWN
          RANGE ROVER, up the street, parked, idling. He squints,
          paranoid, checks the other way...
          His eyes lock on a lit S-BAHN station across the Platz.

          EXT. S-BAHN STATION BERLIN MITTE - NIGHT

          Martin pushes through the turnstiles, his footsteps echo in
          the empty tile corridor as his eyes play over the
          advertisements. Happy sexy Germans smile back at him... The
          SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS behind him, matching his. He slowly
          becomes aware, glances back.
          MARTIN'S P.O.V.: The empty corridor, curving away...
          Martin STOPS, listens... nothing. He starts to move again,
          aware that the delicate "click" of the following steps also
          begins again.
          UP AHEAD, the corridor straightens out at the train platform,
          several late-night travelers waiting. Martin begins to
          hurry... the FOOTSTEPS also increase in speed.
          Another sound: A TRAIN APPROACHING. Martin gives up cool,
          starts to run as the train barrels into the station, its
          noise eclipsing all sound. Doors open and Martin leaps in,
          turns to face the open door...
          .moments pass, the car's bell signals. Then a MAN appears,
          rushing from the corridor, one hand raised.

          He's mild-faced, glasses, carrying a shopping bag in one
          hand. He FROWNS as Martin does nothing to stop the door.
          The two men stare through the glass as the train begins to
          move. The man shakes his head: foreigners.

          INT. S-BAHN TRAIN - NIGHT

          Martin shivers with cold and exhaustion, eyes play over the
          few passengers in the car... a nondescript man a few benches
          down who stares at him, then back to his paper.
          Martin eyes him, paranoid. Slowly gives up, lets his gaze
          plays over the adverts. Times, dates... Nov 26th. Memories
          reawakened...

          A piece of CARD falls from between its pages. Something
          printed on one side. Martin flips it over, scribbles on the

          across: Young, nondescript, his head bobbing gently to
          whatever his Ipod earbuds are playing, staring into his
          computer... The young man looks over, meets Martin's eyes,
          holds for a long moment, small smile, looks back.
          Martin studies him for a moment, forces his gaze back to the
          page, the negation of his life on a small screen.

          his screen, ears listening for the tell tale sound of music
          seeping from the earbuds... nothing.
          Martin rises suddenly, looks to the bored ATTENDANT who nods
          towards the back. Martin moves past college kids on
          Facebook, to a dim back corridor, a door marked "Manner," and
          what's he's looking for: a back door, cracked.

          GINA picks up steaming food from the kitchen, drops it off

          week's pay and stuffs it in an envelope for her. She thanks
          him in German, tucks it away and ducks behind the counter to
          steam milk for a coffee. Glances up... freezes.

          MARC SPIEGLER is German, fluent English. Patient, but

          Martin's paperwork as Martin places his watch and the
          "Horticus" book on the table.
          Where the form asks for a complaint, Martin has written

          DR. FARGE fans a penlight across Martin's eyes. Propped

                         FARCE
          The police brought you here. The
          mistake was mine. I should never
          have let you leave.
          Martin blinks, bleary. Farge talks briefly to the nurse in
          German. She nods, starts prepping a hypodermic at a table.
          Farge looks back to Martin. Explains gently:

                         FARGE (CONT'D)
          Confusion... memory loss... the
          complete or partial loss of
          identity... these are common
          stages in recovery. Some
          temporary, others longer term.
          We're going to do an MRI. Try to
          find out what's happening.
          Martin stares out the window, not fighting, hardly listening.
          A bird alights on a branch.

                         FARGE (CONT'D)
          The mind is like a jigsaw puzzle.
          The pieces fit together to create
          the person we are. With major
          trauma, the puzzle is shattered.
          But the brain's ability to
          recover is remarkable. The mind
          needs a narrative, an identity...
          a soul. Without memory, without
          a past, we are nothing. In the
          coma state, memories are rebuilt.
          In some cases the pieces move.
          In others they go missing. And
          sometimes... completely new
          pieces are found.
          The bird flies off. Martin's eyes track... empty.

                         FARGE (CONT'D)
          Comas sometimes perform a kind of
          alchemy. A patient awakes
          convinced of a reality that was
          previously only fantasy.

          The Cafe Owner is still watching the local news, looking for
          another glimpse of Martin. Door jingles. He glances over to
          see two men, one holding up a POLICE Badge.

          Martin sets the borrowed clothing down on the bed, looks
          around himself as he takes off his jacket.
          Intimate, to be in here. Photographs on a cluttered vanity:
          Old country, Bosnia. Men in suits and women in long dresses.
          Children, a boy and two girls... Gina?

          IN THE KITCHEN
          Gina goes to the fridge, removes a pot of plain stew and sets
          it on the stove. She uses a spoon to pull off a chunk of
          fatty meat. Drops it on a chipped plate and opens the
          window...
          leaning out into the rain, Gina reaches up, slides the
          plate onto a sloping roof above. Excited YOWLS as stray cats
          come running from every direction.
          Gina ducks back inside, pulls the window shut, glances
          towards the cracked door to her bedroom as she ducks into the
          bathroom, turns on the hot water...

          out. A lonely man in the park. A woman with her child.
          Dark, shadowed... Beautiful.
          Gina clears her throat. Martin looks over, sees Gina
          standing in the doorway, realizes.

          hop groove plays. She spoons some of the stew into a bowl,
          sets it on the table.

          Martin lets the hot water run over his head, drip across his
          face, allowing himself a tiny moment of relaxation.

          BANG! BANG! Knocking on the door again. Gina puts the bowl

          She throws open the door... SMITH and JONES press in! Jones
          clamping a hand over her mouth.
          Watching them work is awe-inspiring, chilling. There's no
          wasted motion whatsoever. Their faces calm, observant.
          Jones holds Gina, gun covers the dark entrance to the
          bathroom where the shower still runs as Smith turns the music
          up LOUD, then opens the oven, blows out the pilot light,
          turns on the gas...

          their work. He can see their weapons.
          His eyes SEARCH for anything useful, anything at all.
          There's nothing. He reaches towards the small window to the
          exterior. It swings open, revealing the FIRE ESCAPE beyond.

          Jones nods to Smith who goes out the door, covers the hall.
          Jones FLIPS Gina onto her stomach, presses her face to the
          floor, pulling down the top of her pants as he prepares to
          inject her with the hypodermic.
          She struggles, SCREAMS IN RAGE, chokes on the gas. Her EYES

          You know, the most dangerous man
          in the world is the man who feels
          that he is drowning. He will
          drag under anyone who tries to
          help him.
          Jurgen sets his newspaper on the bar. A picture and article
          about the murdered nurse. Martin's picture, fuzzy.

          'Horticus', turns to the numbers on the end papers.

                         MARTIN
          These numbers, are a code. The
          first number refers to the page
          of a given book. The second to a
          specific line on that page. The
          third number to words on that
          line. If I didn't have the exact
          edition of the book, the code
          would be unbreakable.

          hammering down onto the table. A final convulsion. Then
          he's still.
          A long beat. Cole buttons his jacket. Slips on some gloves.
          Gently lifts Jurgen's head from the table top, rests it on a
          forearm, as though Jurgen were asleep rather than dead.
          Restoring some dignity to him.
          Cole goes to the mantel, wipes off the one framed photo he
          picked up. Takes Martin's Rolex, drops it into his pocket.

           Sleeting rain streaks the glass. Endless grey city-scape.

          Martin pushes them into the alley next to cafe, jams the bag

          water of the Alley, hands and knees, GASPING for breath.

          Pure instinct and adrenaline. Gina grabs the bag, stumbles
          across the street, HORNS BLARE as cars swerve to avoid her...
          And she's gone.

          Martin stands at the broken railing where Gina's taxi plunged
          into the water seven days ago. The tire marks are there.
          The railing is half-repaired, half taped off.
          He stares down into the oily black water, toes near the
          edge... weight shifting... then his knees give. He sits
          hard, his hands moving uselessly, almost on their own.
          Tears flow freely. Sobs RACK his body.

          y real name? Don't you still
          want... me?
          She leans forward, just a breath. Warmth radiating, Martin
          stepping back...

                         MARTIN
          Please, just stop, Liz...
          Her face, reading him. His fear, his uncertainty... She
          smiles, just a little... Liz throws the knife! Martin FIRES
          as the blade sinks into him, sending him reeling back onto
          the floor.

                         MARTIN
          His hand going to the knife sunk in his shoulder, SCREAMING
          in agony as he rips it out, looking up at...

                         LIZ
          A soft distance in her face. A small hole in her chest, just
          below her beautiful collar bone. Her eyes find him, focus,
          smile...

                         LIZ
          You'll never know. You'll never
          know who you are...
          A long beat. We're not sure when exactly the life goes out
          of her eyes. Finally, Martin pulls himself forward. Gently
          closes her eyelids.

          EXT. HOTEL IMPERIAL - NIGHT

          Police keeping people back. FIRE TRUCKS everywhere, jets of
          water fighting back the flames. A collective GASP...
          as the bomb-damaged corner of the hotel starts to FOLD
          INWARD in a spray of dust and smoke.

                         GINA
          moves through the crowd, anxiously searching the stream of
          people still pouring from the building...
          She JUMPS as a hand takes her arm. Turns her. Martin. she
          stumbles back, hands raised against him. Fear, betrayal,
          love... Him standing there, empty, bleeding...
