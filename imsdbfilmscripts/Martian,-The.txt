           It's time to start thinking long term.
           The next NASA mission is Ares 4. It's
           supposed to land at the Schiaparelli
           Crater, 3,200 km away.

           NASA presupplies each mission years in
           advance, so the MAV is already there,
           synthesizing fuel. In four years when
           the Hermes returns, I'll have to launch
           from there. Which means I gotta get to
           the crater.

           kilometers before they need to be
           recharged at the Hab. That's problem A.
           Problem B is it'll take me... roughly
           fifty days to make the journey. So I

           I know that's a surprise. And I know
           you'll have a lot of questions. Here are
           the basics: he's alive and healthy. We
           found out two months ago and decided not
           to tell you. I was strongly against that
           decision. We're telling you now because
           we finally have communication with him

           waiting at the Schiaparelli Crater. And
           the plan is to use it to launch me into
