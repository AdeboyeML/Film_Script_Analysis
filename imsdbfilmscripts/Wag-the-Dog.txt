FADE IN:

A CARD, WHITE ON THE BLACK SCREEN, READS:

            Why does a dog wag its tail?

BENEATH IT, THE NEXT LINE FADES IN:

            Because a dog is smarter than its tail.

CROSS-FADE TO THE NEXT CARD, WHICH READS:

            If the tail were smarter, the tail would wag the dog.

FADE IN:

EXT THE WHITE HOUSE NIGHT

A VAN FULL OF PEOPLE STOPS AT A SIDE ENTRANCE.

ANGLE INT THE WHITE HOUSE

AT THE SIDE, UTILITY ENTRANCE, WE SEE THE DISGORGING WORKING-CLASS MEN AND
WOMEN, THEY PASS THROUGH SECURITY SCREENING IN THE B.G., THROUGH METAL
DETECTORS, AND PAST SEVERAL GUARDS WHO CHECK THE PHOTO-I.D.'S AROUND THEIR
NECKS.

ANGLE INT THE WHITE HOUSE

WILFRED AMES, AND AMY CAIN, A BRIGHT YOUNG WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES, WALKING DOWN
A CORRIDOR, LOOKING WORRIED.

ANGLE AMES AND CAIN
AMES AND CAIN HAVE STOPPED AT THE END OF THE HALL.  BEYOND THEM WE SEE THE
CLEANING PEOPLE COMING IN FROM THE VAN, AND BEING CLEARED THROUGH A METAL
DETECTOR INTO A HOLDING AREA, AND HANDED CLEANING MATERIALS, MOPS, VACUUMS, ET
CETERA, BY A TYPE HOLDING A CLIPBOARD.  PART OF THE GROUP, A MAN IN HIS
FORTIES, IN A RATTY JACKET, OPEN COLLARED SHIRT, PASSES THROUGH THE GROUP,
AND IS STOPPED BY A SECRET SERVICEMAN WHO APPEARS NEXT TO AMES.  IN THE B.G.
WE SEE A TV IN AN ADJACENT ROOM, SHOWING A POLITICAL COMMERCIAL.

                          AMES
                    (TO SECRET SERVICEMAN)
            ...That's him.

AMES MOVES OUT OF THE SHOT.  LEAVING US ON THE POLITICAL COMMERCIAL.

WE SEE TWO BUSINESS PEOPLE ON THE PLANE, A MAN AND A WOMAN.

                          BUSINESSMAN
            Well, all I know, you don't change horses in the middle
            of the stream.

                          BUSINESSWOMAN
            "Don't change Horses," well, there's a lot of truth in
            that.

THE IMAGE SHIFTS TO A PRESIDENT, DOING PRESIDENTIAL THINGS.  AND THE VOICE-
OVER.

                          VOICE-OVER
            For Peace, prosperity, for all of us:  Don't change
            Horses in...

ANGLE

A CORRIDOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE, AS AMES AND THE MAN IN THE RATTY JACKET (BREAN)
WALK HURRIEDLY.  AMES FINISHES ONE CIGARETTE AND USES THE BUTT TO LIGHT A
FRESH ONE.  THEY PASS BY A LARGE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE BACK OF A MAN, BENDING TO
SHAKE HANDS WITH ONE OF A LINE OF GIRLSCOUTS.  AMES GLANCES UP AT THE
PHOTOGRAPH AND SHAKES HIS HEAD DEJECTEDLY.

INT WHITE  HOUSE "SITUATION" ROOM.   NIGHT.

A WOMAN WITH A STENOPAD, ARRANGING PADS AND PENCILS AT A SMALL CONFERENCE
TABLE.  A SECRET SERVICE TYPE PUTS HIS HEAD IN THE ROOM, AND BOWS OUT, AND
NODS, BREAN AND AMES ENTER HURRIEDLY.

                          AMES
            We're going to...

HE STOPS TALKING AS A WHITE HOUSE WAITER ENTERS WITH A TRAY WITH COFFEE THINGS
ON IT, FOLLOWED BY TWO YOUNG AIDES, SLEEPY AND DISHEVELLED, WHO ENTER QUICKLY,
AND APOLOGIES UNUTTERED, SIT AND MAKE THEMSELVES SMALL.

BREAN MAKES A LITTLE GESTURE AT THE WAITER, WHO IS SETTING OUT THE COFFEE,
AND AT THE STENOGRAPHER, MEANING "GET THEM OUT OF HERE."

                          AMES
            Thank you, that'll be all.

THE STENOGRAPHER AND THE WAITER LEAVE

                    (OF THE TWO STAFFERS)
            Who we got here...?

                          AMES
            John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....

                          BREAN
            Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this
            room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you
            do here, f'it got out, you leaked it.
                    (TO AMES)
            Tell'em what they need to know.

                          AMES
            When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.

                          BREAN
                    (NODS)
            Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He
            had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years
            back...?
                    (SMILES)
            What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get
            nervous.

AN AIDE ENTERS, WITH SEVERAL TYPED SHEETS, WHICH SHE HANDS TO CAIN. CAIN
READS TO HERSELF, PASSES THEM TO AMES.

                          BREAN
                    (CON'T)
            ...he made a pass at some Secretary, back in...

AMES TAKES THE SHEETS, AND READS.  GESTURES TO BREAN, "ONE MOMENT, PLEASE."

ANGLE INS.  THE SHEET, WHICH AMES HOLDS.

IT READS:
             AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES I REGRET THAT
            PERSONAL INCAPACITY HAS RENDERED ME MOMENTARILY UNABLE
            TO CONFRONT AND CORRECT....

BREAN LOOKING ON, AS AMES READS, AND SHAKES HIS HEAD SADLY.  BREAN TAKES THE
SHEETS.

            1.)  Statutory Rape.
            2.)  The President's long-documented mental problems
            3.)  Brought about by reaction to Drugs to control
            flu...?

ANGLE AMES READING OVER BREAN'S SHOULDER.

                          AMES
            ...did he have the flu...?

BREAN LAYS DOWN THE SHEET SOMBERLY, EVERYONE LOOKS AT HIM.

            There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last
            month.  One of them expressed an interest in a
            Frederick Remington bust.  The president took her into
            the oval Office, for a period...

                          AMES
            Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three
            minutes, the Secret Service...

BREAN GESTURES HIM TO BE QUIET.

                          BREAN
            Okay.  And she's alleging...?

CAIN GESTURES BREAN TO KEEP READING THE SHEETS IN FRONT OF HIM.  HE DOES SO.
PAUSE.  TO HIMSELF.

                          AMES
            We are virtually certain it isn't...

                          BREAN
            Who's got the story?
                    (PAUSE)

                          AMES
            Don't you want to know if it's true?

                          BREAN
            What difference does it make if it's true?
                    (PAUSE)
            It's a story, and, it breaks they're gonna have to run
            with it -- How long've we got til it breaks?

                    (PAUSE)
            Okay.  We'll set up the War Room Here...

AN AIDE BRINGS HIM A CUP OF COFFEE.

                          BREAN
            Thank you.  Now:  where is he?

                          LEVY

            Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.

BREAN TAKES A NOTEBOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET, AND LOOKS AT IT.

                          BREAN
                    (AS HE READS FROM HIS NOTEBOOK)
            Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China
            til Tomorrow.

                          CAIN
            ...why?

                          BREAN
            ...you the Press Office?

            He's sick, get it out now.  Get him on the phone'n tell
            him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the
            story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it.

                          CAIN
            What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?

                          BREAN
            Well, that's what we're doing here...

BREAN IS SUNK IN THOUGHT.  AN AIDE STARTS TO SPEAK.  AMES SILENCES HIM, BREAN
BECKONS AMES OVER.

AMES NODS, AND WAVES AN AIDE OVER AND WHISPERS TO HER.

            And gemme a car.

                          CAIN
            Is there a press conference today?

                          BREAN
            What do you think?  What I need from you:  I need a
            base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I
            need some clean money ...

                          LEVY
            How much...?

AMES GESTURES HIM TO BE QUIET.

                          BREAN
            And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There is no
            B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is
            leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip,
            "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..."
            "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If
            the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is
            fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, Why?"  "In the
            Crisis."

                          AMES
            What crisis?

                          BREAN
            I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at
            Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane right now to
            Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To
            talk to the Boeing people.

                          AMES
                    (TO LEVY)
            Do it...

LEVY MOVES TO A TELEPHONE.

                    (TO CAIN)
            And you?

                          CAIN
            But there isn't a B-2 bomber.

                          BREAN

            General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in
            Seattle to talk with Boeing...

                          AMES
            It won't hold.

                          BREAN
            One day, Two days?  Course it's gonna hhhh....

CAMERA TAKES THEM DOWN THE HALL, WHERE WE SEE THE CLEANING PEOPLE, WITH FLOOR
POLISHERS, LOOKING UP AT THE PICTURE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE GIRLSCOUTS, AND
SNICKERING.

ANGLE
ON BREAN AND AMES LOOKING ON.
THE CLEANING PEOPLE NOTICE THEY ARE BEING WATCHED AND DISPERSE.

                          AMES
            It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.

                          BREAN
            We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to distract
            them for two weeks til the election.

                          AMES
            What would do that...?

HOLD, ON BREAN THINKING.

                          AMES
                    (CONT.)
            What in the world would do that?

                          BREAN
            I'm working on it.

HE TURNS AROUND AND STARES AT THE WALL.

BREAN WALKS TO THE COUNTER WHERE THE COFFEE AND ROLLS ARE STEAMING.  ON THE
WALL ARE HUNG TWO WIPE-OFF SLATES.  ONE READS "DAYS TO ELECTION 12," THE OTHER
READS "% IN FAVOR 63" BREAN PICKS UP A ROLL, DOWNS A COFFEE, AND STARTS OUT OF
THE DOOR.

CAMERA TAKES THEM OUT INTO THE HALL.
BREAN LEANS CLOSE TO AMES.

                          BREAN
            Gimme twenty thousand dollars.

HE STARTS INTO THE HALL, FOLLOWED BY THE ENTOURAGE, AND THE CAMERA.

                          BREAN
            I'll be back within the hour.  Now,

                    (WALKS ALONG, SHAKING HIS HEAD)
            It's going to be fine.  It's going to be ... you
            remember in 88, when...

AN AIDE COMES UP TO THEM, HOLDING A VIDEOTAPE.

                          AMES
            What is it...

AIDE WHISPERS TO AMES.  WHO NODS, TAKES THE TAPE, AND BREAN, AND THE AIDE,
INTO A SIDE OFFICE.

INT SIDE OFFICE NIGHT.
AS THE AIDE PUTS THE TAPE INTO A V.C.R.

                          BREAN
            What is it?

                          AMES
            It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.

THE PICTURE COMES ON, IT SHOWS THE PRESIDENT DOING SEVERAL PRESIDENTIAL
THINGS.  THE COMMERCIAL WE SAW EARLIER.

                          BREAN
            That's our commercial.
                    (PAUSE)
            I've seen it.  That's our commercial.

                    (TO AIDE)
            Turn up the volume.

THE AIDE DOES SO, AND WE HEAR MAURICE CHAVALIER SINGING,
            "Thank heaven, for Little Girls...."

ANOTHER AIDE ENTERS, SHEEPISHLY, HANDS A THICK PACKET TO AMES, WHO HOLDS IT
OUT TO BREAN.

                          BREAN
            What is this?

                          AMES

            We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the
            "appearance" of a war.

            I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of

THE BUSINESS TYPES BEGIN TO QUEUE UP IN A SLEEPY LINE.  BREAN LEANS CLOSER TO
THE TELEVISION, AS IT CHANGES TO A NEWS LOGO, AND A TALKING HEAD APPEARS.

                          TALKING HEAD
            Good morning:  With the election eleven days away the
            world slept, expecting news from the President on Trade
            and his visit to China, another sort of news, however,
            has emerged from the Presidential Quarter.  Chris
            Andrews, station KCRT, Santa Fe Reports:

BREAN LEANS BACK FROM THE TELEVISION, AND PUTS HIS ATTENTION ON THE BUSINESS
PEOPLE ABOUT TO FILE ONTO THE PLANE.  AS HE WATCHES THEY MOVE FIRST ONE AT A
TIME, AND THEN, IN A GROUP, DRAWN TO THE TELEVISIONS.

ANGLE:
BREAN, LOOKING AT THE BUSINESS PEOPLE, CLUSTERING UP.  BEYOND HIM, WE SEE THE
TALKING HEAD FROM SANTA FE, THE SHOT OF THE PRESIDENT WITH THE GIRLSCOUTS,
WHICH WE SAW PREVIOUSLY ON THE WHITE HOUSE WALL, AND ON THE CAMPAIGN BUTTONS.

BREAN TAKES OUT A NOTEPAD AND STARTS MAKING NOTES.  AMES WANDERS INTO THE
SHOT, WITH A CUP OF DUNKIN' DONUTS COFFEE, AND THE CELLPHONE INTO WHICH HE IS

MOSS CALLS AFTER HIM

                          AMES
            Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....

MOSS STARTS STRIPPING OFF HIS CLOTHES, AND CHANGING INTO A SWIMSUIT.

                          MOSS
            You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true,
            right?

HE SWITCHES ON THE TELEVISION IN THE CABANA.  WE SEE A FEMALE TALKING HEAD.

THE SCREEN GOES TO THE PHOTO OF THE PRESIDENT WITH THE GIRLSCOUTS.

MOSS TURNS DOWN THE VOLUME.  AS HE AND BREAN TALK THE TV SHOWS IMAGES OF THE
PRESIDENT WITH GIRLSCOUTS, AND WITH OTHER YOUTH GROUPS.

                          MOSS
            And you're here why...?

                          BREAN
            I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a
            great supporter of the Party.

                          MOSS
            Party's gonna need more than a couple bucks now.

THE POOL ATTENDANT ENTERS WITH A TRAY ON WHICH IS A GLASS WITH LIQUID AND A
CARROT STICK IN IT, AND A GLASS FULL OF CELERY STICKS.

                          BREAN
            What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding
            action.

                          MOSS
            ...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO
            Shreds.

THE SCREEN CHANGES, WE SEE THE SEAL OF THE PRESIDENT, AND WE ARE IN THE
NEWSROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE.  A SHOT OF THE RESTIVE REPORTERS, IN THE B.G.
OF THE CABANA WE SEE THE POOL ATTENDANT TAKING HIS LEAVE, HURRYING BACK TO
THE OTHER TELEVISION AT THE POOL DESK.

WE SEE LEVY TAKE THE PODIUM, ARRANGE HIS NOTES, AND CLEAR HIS THROAT.

BREAN LEANS FORWARD, ANXIOUS, IN HIS SEAT.

            ...the illness of the President, which we are assured,
            is not serious.  I repeat, it is not serious, the
            doctors suspect it's a stomach flu, but have advised
            him not to fly.  He will remain, on the ground, in
            China for, they estimate, one or two days, I stress
            that, during this time he will, of...

ANGLE, ON BREAN AS HE LOOKS AT MOSS, LEANING INTO THE TV.  HE THEN
SWITCHES HIS GLANCE TOWARD THE POOL DESK, ANGLE HIS POV.  AT THE POOL DESK
WE SEE THE TWO ATTENDANTS, THE NANNY, THE KID AND SEVERAL NEWLY ARRIVED
BATHERS CLUSTERED, RAPT, AROUND THE TELEVISION.

            Would you comment on the rumors... on the rumors that
            the President's trip, that the President's delay... is
            due to the situation in Albania?

ANGLE
ON THE TELEVISION WE SEE SKLANSKY, AND SEE THAT HE IS THE CHAP IN THE
BATHROBE WHOM BREAN GAVE THE ENVELOPE TO.

                          LEVY
            There, uh, I'm not aware of the situation to which you
            refer.

                          SKLANSKY
            Sir:  the heads of the Albanian Desks at C.I.A., and at
            the National Security agency have been recalled on

A WOMAN REPORTER STANDS.

            Mr. Levy, early this morning Major General William
            Scott flew to Seattle.  Is his trip connected with the
            B-2 Bomber?

                          LEVY
            Uh...Mrs. Rose, there, to the best of my knowledge,
            there is no...

            connected with recent Muslim Fundamentalist, anti-

BEAT.  MOSS LOOKS AT BREAN.

                          MOSS
            How close are you to this thing?

BREAN PICKS UP A CELLPHONE FROM THE TABLE, AND DIALS

                          BREAN
                    (TO MOSS)
            What do you want the kid to say?

MOSS LOOKS AT BREAN APPRAISINGLY.

                          MOSS
            Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the
            President, there will he an update at 5:45.'

AS MOSS SPEAKS BREAN NODS TO AMES, SPEAKS INTO THE TELEPHONE.

                          AMES
                    (INTO PHONE)
            Have the kid say I know we're all concerned for the
            President.  There will he an update on his

MOSS LEANS OVER AND TURNS DOWN THE VOLUME ON THE TV.
BEAT.

                          MOSS
            Well.  You bought yourself one day.  Maybe two.

            String a few together.  All I need's eleven,

                          MOSS
            How you going to stretch it?
                    (HE GESTURES AT THE TV)
            This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve-
            year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?

                          BREAN
            What do you think would hold it off?

                          MOSS
            Uh, nothing, oh, nothing ... uh... a War, uh...
                    (HE PAUSES, THEN LOOKS AT BREAN WITH
                    COMPREHENSION.)
            You're kidding.

BREAN SHAKES HIS HEAD NO.

                          MOSS
            I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?

                          BREAN
            I'm gonna tell you why...

BREAN LEANS CONSPIRATORIALLY, OVER TOWARD MOSS.

                          BREAN
            Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight.
            What does that mean?

                          MOSS
            Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...

            We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the
            fucking wars.  Y'know why.  Cause it's show business.
            That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm.
            Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi.
            Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty
            years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf
            War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500
            missions a day, 100 days, One Shot of One Bomb.  The
            American people bought that war. M'I getting through
            to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till
            some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days.
            N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why
            I'm here.

ANGLE
AT THE POOL DESK. THE ATTENDANTS AND THE GUESTS ARE WATCHING THE TELEVISION.
ON WHICH WE SEE COMIONTATOR TALKING ABOUT A MAP OF ALBANIA.

THE SCENE SHIFTS TO THE SHOTS OF THE PRESIDENT BEING PRESIENTIAL, AND WE
HEAR, "THANK HEAVEN, FOR LITTLE GIRLS..."
AMES WINCES, WE SEE THE POOL ATTENDANTS LAUGH.

                          BREAN
            It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in
            Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.
                    (PAUSE)
            You get the Actors get up there, and strut and
            Posture.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump
            in and Save the Thing.
                    (PAUSE)

THEY LISTEN TO THANK HEAVEN, FOR LITTLE GIRLS, AND THEY LOOK AT MOSS.

PAUSE

                          MOSS
            Why Albania?

                          BREAN
            Why not?

MOSS NODS DECISIVELY.  AS IF TO SAY, "BY GOLLY, NOW YOU'RE TALKING..."

                          MOSS
            Pat? Pat?

ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS RAISES HIS HEAD FROM THE TV AND SPRINTS OVER TO THE
CABANA, WHERE WE SEE MOSS AND BREAN DEEP IN CONFAB.  MOSS GESTURES TO THE
TRAY WITH THE JUICE AND THE CELERY.

                          MOSS
            ...throw this shit out.  Gemme a pot of coffee and a
            packet of Camels.

                          MOSS

            "They Got To Know?"  Stan...?  Get with it.  Who Killed
            Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren
            Report, said he was killed by a Drunk Driver.  You
            watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after
            day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building.
            The truth, I was in the building when they shot that
            shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia,
            1/10th scale model of a building.

                          MOSS
            Is that true?

                          BREAN
            How the fuck do we know.  You take my point?

            It's not "war."  It is a Pageant.  It's a Pageant...
            Like the Oscars... why we came to you...

                          MOSS
            I never won an Oscar.

                          BREAN
            N'it's a crying shame.  But you staged the Oscars...

            you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul,

            think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice
            old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would
            consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says,

            to infiltrate this country.

                    (CONT.)
            Thank you.

                          MR. YOUNG
            What's on your mind?

                          BREAN
            I have a question for you.

                          MR. YOUNG
            Ask it.

                          BREAN
            Why do people go to war?

                          MR. YOUNG
            Why do people go to war?

                          MR. YOUNG
            I'll play your silly game.

                          BREAN
            Why do they go to War?

                          MR. YOUNG
            To preserve their Way of Life.

                          BREAN
            Would you go to War to do that?
                    (PAUSE)

                          MR. YOUNG
            I have.

                          BREAN
            Well, I have, too.  Would you do it again...?  In't
            that why you're here?  I guess so.  N'if you go to war
            again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to
            fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and Togo?
            Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time
            has passed.  It's passed.  It's over.  The War of the
            Future is Nuclear Terrorism.  It is and it will be
            against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst,
            perhaps, to their own governments, have blah blah blah.
            And to go to that war, you've got to be prepared.  You
            have to be alert, and the public has to be alert.
            Cause that is the war of the future, and if you're not
            gearing up, to fight that war, eventually the axe will
            fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.
                    (PAUSE)
            And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it
            "job security," or you can call it anything you like.
            But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect
            your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, this
                    (HE GESTURES AROUND THE ROOM)
            is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no
            war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil
            Painting.  And there ain't no war but ours.

            opportunity to call upon our President to stand and
            face the charges, the heinous charges brought against
            him.  You know, folks, there is nothing in life as
            precious as the Innocence of a Child.

ON THE TELEVISION WE SEE A TALKING HEAD, ANNOUNCING THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRESS.
IN THE B.G. AIRFORCE ONE IS ROLLING TO A STOP.  WE SEE THE RAMP COME DOWN AND
THE PRESIDENT COME OUT IN THE RAIN AND HURRY TOWARD A WAITING HELICOPTER.

HE SEES SOMETHING OFF TO THE SIDE AND STOPS, HIS AIDES TRY TO DISSUADE HIM,
BUT HE PULLS AWAY.  THE NEWS CAMERA HUNTS AND FINDS A SMALL ALBANIAN GIRL,
CARRYING A SHEAF OF WHEAT IN HER HANDS, AN OLD WOMAN BEHIND HER, BOTH STANDING
IN THE RAIN.  THE PRESIDENT ADVANCES, AND MOVES TO LET HIS AIDES LET THE CHILD
COME FORWARD.  WE SEE THE PRESIDENT, MOVED AT THE SIGHT OF THE LITTLE GIRL,
OFFERING HIM THE SHEAF OF WHEAT, WE HEAR A REPORTER, V.O.

            to speak English, but my Grandmother...

THE CAMERA MOVES ONTO THE GRANDMOTHER, STANDING, NODDING, BEHIND THE LITTLE
GIRL, AND THE PRESIDENT, REALIZING FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE OLD WOMAN IS
STANDING IN THE RAIN, MOVES TO HER, REMOVES HIS SUITCOAT, AND PLACES IT OVER
HER HEAD.  SHE CLASPS HIM TO HER BOSOM.  SHE SPEAKS TO HIM IN ALBANIAN.

                          TRANSLATOR

            Well, well, well, well, wait a minute, we got 86
            percent.  We bring'em back tomorrow, the charts go up,
            they don't go down...

THEY WALY THROUGH THE MALL, PAST A NEWSSTAND SHOWING TIME AND NEWSWEEK BOTH
OF WHICH BREAN PICKS UP, ONE SHOWS THE PHOTO OF SCHUMANN AND THE LEGEND,
"COURAGE, MOM," THE OTHER A PHOTO OF SCHUMANN, AND THE LEGEND, "GIVE HIM
BACK."  THE VENDOR IS WEARING A "303" T-SHIRT.

                          BREAN
            I don't wanna tell them their business, but why not
            wait to give it to him after the election.  When he's
            gonna need some help....

            Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my

            giving up that one...

            They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the
            airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em.
            They're concerned that the last kid had the Wheat.
            Variations include, the kid is a boy, the kid is twins,
            it's a little dog ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff,

MOSS HOLDS UP THE MILITARY DIRECTORY.

                          MOSS
            I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave
            us "special prisons."

            Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.

            What happens if he doesn't have his medication?

                          MOSS

BREAN GOES TO THE FRONT OF THE PLANE.

A BEATEN-UP BREAN STRUGGLES FROM THE PLANE, FINISHING A BOTTLE OF SCOTCH, HE
FLINGS IT FROM HIM, REACHES IN HIS BACK POCKET, OPENS ANOTHER, AND, AS HE DOES
SO, HE SINGS DRUNKENLY.

HANGAR, A VAST CROWD, FLASHBULBS BEGIN POPPING.

ANGLE ON MOSS, AS HE GLANCES AROUND, AND THEN AT AN AIDE, AS IF TO SAY,
WELL...

THE AIDE LOOKS AROUND, AND THEN, WITH RELIEF, AT THE CROWD, AS A SMALL DOG
BREAKS AWAY, AND RUNS TOWARD THE CASKET.

SEVERAL PHOTOGRAPHERS BREAK THROUGH THE CORDON, AND BEGIN SNAPPING PHOTOS OF
THE SMALL DOG, AS IT SITS, ITS HEAD COCKED, NEAR THE CASKET.

BREAN AND MOSS WALK AWAY, CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM TOWARD A SMALL READYROOM OFF THE
HANGAR.

            ...coffee...?

                          JOYCE
            What would be true, then.

            Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may
