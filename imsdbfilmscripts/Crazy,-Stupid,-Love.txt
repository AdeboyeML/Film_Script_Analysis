           Cal's a few drinks in now. The door to the bar opens as 
           BERNIE (late 40s) rushes in. An oak tree of a man. He's

           It's good to see you, man. I've 
           called you a few times. It's been 
           a rough couple of days, obviously. 
           Nothing I could use more than my 
           old pal Bernie to unload on. Hey,

           Jacob shakes his head. Jesus Christ. He says something
