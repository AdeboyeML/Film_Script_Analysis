    The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER
    wearing a fireproof balaclava...

    Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion. His
    name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA.

                         NIKI (V/O)
               My grandfather always said history is
               cruel and reductive and no matter how
               long we live, or how much we achieve -
               we are remembered for very little. So
               make sure it's the right things.

    NIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking.
    Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision...

    Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be
    using slicks or wets?

    Engines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars. An
    OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One
    Minute"...

    Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.

                           NIKI
                 This is bullshit. We have no control
                 over our legacy. We cannot choose what
                 we are remembered for...

    A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian
    above the noise, (we see sub-titles)...

                           MECHANIC

                      want to change?)

    NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white
    helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of
    MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.

                           NIKI
                 Otherwise I wouldn't be remembered for
                 my rivalry with this asshole. And the
                 1976 season.

    NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him.
    Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack...

                           NIKI
                 What about Hunt? Has he changed?

                           MECHANIC
                 No, he's going on wets.

    The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews,
    mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on..

    The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but
    HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1.

    NIKI's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's
    glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava,
    flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS..

                 I don't know why it became such a big
                 thing. We were just drivers. Busting
                 each other's balls. To me this is
                 perfectly normal. But other people saw
                 it differently.

    NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT's eyes meet for a
    split-second, eyes staring...

    NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the
    engine. The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000

    NIKI's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel-spin

    NIKI gets away first. A good start! But within seconds there's
    a McLaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck.

    His arch-rival. HUNT.

    But as the McLaren roars past, NIKI sees a white helmet.
    Number 12. It's not Hunt. It's MASS. On his bald, slick tyres.

    NIKI curses under his breath. He screwed up. Made the wrong
    decision. Should have gone on slicks. He urgently needs to
    change tyres...

                Never! Racing is for playboys and

                nothing in their heads. The name
                `Lauda' appears on the front pages,

                Fine. Keep your money. Don't invest in

                            STANLEY
                  Because he's a proven winner at the
                  highest level, a good guy, and someone
                  who quite frankly, could teach you a
                  thing or two.

     NIKI ignores this, continues scrutinizing the contract...

                            NIKI
                  OK. There is one clause missing.

                            STANLEY
                  The one about mechanics' exclusivity?
                  Sorry. We have a cardinal rule at BRM.

                  This is something I cannot sign.

                Thank you. My parents always wanted me
                to be a doctor, or stockbroker, and
                gave me a first class education...but
                to no avail. My brothers are the
                success stories. I get bored easily. I
                have a hot head, an inability to
                tolerate discipline. I fall out with
                people left and right. I'm quick to
                settle matters with my fists. The only
                creatures I've ever loved and treated
                well, are budgerigars. In any normal
                area of life, I'd be...or AM...a total
                liability. All I've got going for me
                is I'm quick in a car.

     The PAUL RICARD circuit near Marseilles in the South of
     France. Where all winter training and testing is done.

     NIKI arrives. An attractive woman (AGNES) greets him...

     A silence. The RECEPTIONIST continues with her work. NIKI
     watches her, unsure what to say, (small-talk not his forte)...

                  the receptionist, she's on her lunch.

     NIKI is thrown. Feels humiliated. A total jerk. He is about to
     say something when the door opens, and...

     Two other F1 DRIVERS walk in..

     they talk effortlessly and flirt confidently with AGNES.

     What are you doing answering the phones? New haircut! Like it.
     What have you done to the weather?

     They make her laugh. And smile.

     NIKI feels invisible. Embarrassed. Awkward. Inadequate. He
     gets to his feet. And goes to the car that has come to collect
     him.

     As he goes, (unseen by NIKI), AGNES watches him. Ignoring the
     other DRIVERS. Intrigued.

     He's different. Interesting. Intense. Intelligent eyes.

     car, and is greeted by LOUIS STANLEY, and the BRM team...

     It's true. NIKI is driving in the slow lane. Like a pensioner.

                No need to drive fast. It only
                increases the percentage of risk.
                We're not in a hurry. No one is paying
                me. Right now, with zero incentive or
                reward, why would I drive fast?

                  race. Maybe two. Because you're

                 two weeks before that race in Spain,
                 we put 20-inch rims on the rear
                 wheels. We get an extra half second
                 speed on each lap!! But the Old Man
                 tells me we can't use those rims, they
                 make the car too wide. Against the
                 rules. So we go back to 19-inch rims
                 making the car slower again. Rules are
                 rules. For all of us. You're just a
                 bad loser who can't accept that.

   Where death has become a real option.

   Because he doesn't care anymore. Because it's all he deserves
   anyway...

   And in that moment, in reaching his lowest point, JAMES has
   unwittingly stumbled on the one thing that gives him an
   advantage over everyone else...

   The fact that he doesn't care. The fact that death has become
   an option. The fact that there is no risk he is not prepared
   to take...

   So every corner is tighter, every braking point later, every
   gap is an opening, no matter how tiny...

                 Not at all. For him to catch me, he'd
                 have to win all the remaining races,
                 and I'd have to lose them. And pigs

                 Thank you. I called this meeting
                 because as all drivers know the
                 Nurburgring is a race track from the
                 Stone Ages. The most stupid, barbaric,
                 outdated, dangerous, track in the
                 world. You've all seen the rain which
                 has been falling this morning. Those
                 of you with experience know the Ring
                 needs perfect conditions to be even
                 remotely acceptable in terms of risk.
                 As you can see today is anything BUT
                 perfect, so I called this meeting to
                 take a vote to cancel the race.

                 There would be no change to the
                 situation as far as points is
                 concerned. The race would simply be
                 cancelled.

                           NIKI
                 It's true. You leave without your fee,
                 but you might leave with your LIFE.

   Another voice pierces the controversy...

                           VOICE
                 It also means you would effectively

               Yes, I am frightened. Always a little
               bit when I race. I accept every time I
               get in my car there is 20% chance that
               I could die. But not one per cent
               more. And today, with the rain the
               risk IS more. How dare you accuse me
               of lack of courage? Let me remind you.
               I have the track record here. I am the
               only person in history to do the Ring
               in under 7 minutes. So actually it's
               to my ADVANTAGE to race here today.

                 Jochen's going on slicks. You want to
                 change?

   JAMES looks in his wing-mirror back to his colleague, JOCHEN
   MASS's car, number 12, several rows behind him.

   White helmet. A team of Mclaren MECHANICS hastily changing the
   tyres to bald, dry tyres - ('slicks'). Then JAMES looks over
   at the car beside him...

                           JAMES
                 Has Niki changed?

                           CALDWELL
                 No. He's going on wets.

   NIKI's car: surrounded by Italian Ferrari MECHANICS.

                           JAMES
                 Then we go on wets, too.

   JAMES pulls down his visor...as he and NIKI's eyes meet for a
   split-second, then...

   The STARTER waves the flag. They're off!

   JAMES's foot hits the floor - his engine screams at almost
   9,000 rpms, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd. The
   car is catapaulted forward, the wheel-spin leaving livid black
   scars on the asphalt..

   JAMES and NIKI both make good starts, and are neck and neck,
   but within seconds there's a McLaren right behind them,
   gaining fast.

   JAMES realizes it's his team-mate, JOCHEN MASS in a white
   helmet. Number 12. On his slick tyres.

   MASS was right to gamble on the track drying out. JAMES curses
   under his breath...

                 Shit...!

   to change tyres. With barely one lap completed...

   Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the
   crazy, panicked situation as JAMES comes into the pits to

   breaking as late as he can, engine screaming.

   The world flies past in a blur. The steering wheel shakes. The
   car cannot be driven any harder. No thought for safety. No
   thought of failure..

   Failure is unimaginable. Unconscionable.

   He turns into the final straight, then stops when he sees

   Filling his lungs with chemicals, along with the smoke and

   Screaming voices. Panicked reactions.

166 EXT. MONZA PITLANE/ FERRARI PITS - DAY                         166

   JAMES pushes through the pitlanes, until he reaches the
   crowded FERRARI pits. He sees a racer in the background. The
   name LAUDA on his overalls...

                           JAMES
                 Niki?

   NIKI turns round. JAMES sets eyes on him for the first time.

   JAMES reels, visibly horrified by his appearance. His bandages
   are blood stained. He has no hair. Looks grotesque..

   NIKI sees the horror in JAMES's face. Sees the shock. The
   horror. And recognizes in that moment, this is how it's going
   to be - this is how people will respond to him - forever.

                           NIKI
                 Wow. It's that bad, huh?

   JAMES opens his mouth. Tries to say something.

                           NIKI
                 In the hospital I told them to tell me
                 straight, no bullshit - how bad it
                 would be. My appearance. They said
                 with time it'd be fine. But it won't.
                 I can tell, seeing your reaction. I am
                 going to spend the rest of my life
                 with a face that frightens people.

   NIKI stares at JAMES, at his rival's beauty, his blonde,
   tanned perfection. His matinee idol, movie star looks...

                           NIKI
                 That's a tough one to get used to.

                 Yes. You did.

                            NIKI
                 Trust me, watching you win those
                 points and all those races while I was
                 in hospital fighting for my life...you
                 were equally responsible for getting
                 me better.

   Ouch. That could have been meant generously. But in this case

   A packed press conference. The world's media. NIKI's accident
   and recovery (as a story) has reached way beyond F1 race fans.
   This is front page news around the globe..

   NIKI walks out onto the podium - all eyes staring at him - the
   sense of a ghoulish, voyeuristic freak show....

   NIKI sits on the podium, in front of microphones, flanked on
   both sides by FERRARI drivers and top brass. But no one wants
   to talk to them. Everyone's here to talk to NIKI..

                           NIKI
                 Sure. I had a skin graft operation
                 where they put half my right thigh in
                 my face. It doesn't look too good but
                 one unexpected advantage is it's
                 impossible to perspire through a skin
                 graft, so sweat will never run in my
                 eyes again - which is good for a
                 driver.

                 But it is one. Relentlessness is good.
                 Means you're a fighter. That you never
                 give up. Behind my back I know some of
                 you guys call me `The Rat.' Because I
                 look like one. It's meant as an
                 insult. But I don't mind it. Rats are
                 ugly, sure. And no one likes them. But
                 they're intelligent. With a strong
                 survival instinct.

               You're right. I could learn from you.
               In hospital the toughest part of my
               treatment was the vacuum. Pumping the
               shit out of my lungs. It was agony.
               While doing it, I was watching
               television...you winning all those
               races...and I was cursing you.. "That
               bastard, Hunt", I would shout, "I hate
               that guy." one day the doctor said,
               "Mr. Lauda, may I offer one piece of
               advice? Stop thinking of it as a curse
               to have been given an enemy in life.
               It can be a blessing, too." I said,
               "Who are you, Confucius?" He said, "A
               wise man gets more from his enemies
               than a fool from his friends." And you
               know, he's right. Look at us. We were
               a pair of kids when we first met.
               Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3. Headed
