          A MAN, standing waist-deep in the surf. White shirt, neck
          tie, hair perfectly parted. Wire framed glasses rest on the
          bridge of his nose. His name is ALEJANDRO.
                         
          He rises his face to the sun.
                         
                               ALEJANDRO(V.O.)
                     I think about the price. The price
                     of appetite. The cost of
                     forgetting who we are. Pretending
                     we are... who we will never be...
                         
          He looks young for 35, but his eyes -- seems they lived for
          decades before him. He closes them, bathing his face in
          sunshine.
                         
                               ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
                     So easy to pretend we are not to
                     blame. That a demon enters us.
                     No... The demon is inside. We just
                     make potions that release it.
                         
          The muscles of his neck tense.
                         
                               ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
                     There's no revenge for all they
                     have taken. No justice. It simply
                     is...
                         
                         
          His lip curls. His eyes open. He looks down.
                         
                               ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
                     And still. They must be forced to
                     look at all they have destroyed. By
                     having the same done to them. Or
                     they will forget... Forget they are
                     human. Believe they are as
                     different as they feel... Then they
                     are the lion, and everything we
                     loved and lost, simply its meal.
                         
          We hear SPLASHING and the panicked gasps of a man trying not
          to drown.
                         
          Only now do WE SEE: Alejandro is holding someone under the
          water.
                         
          He lets the drowning man catch a breath, barely. Pushes him
          back under. Looks out. Lost in thought.
                                                                      2.
                         
                         
          We watch from the beach as Alejandro stands in the ocean to
          his belly, the sun high overhead.
                         
                                                                            CUT TO:

          -- FRAME IS FILLED WITH A BLUE EYE, AS BLUE AS THE OCEAN --
                         
          The eye blinks, and we can almost feel a breeze -- we are
          that close.
                         
                                                WOMAN'S VOICE
                       (Whispered) Our Father, who art in
                       Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy
                       Kingdom come...
                         
          A VERTICAL LINE OF WHITE LIGHT invades us, then grows. The
          eye disappears in it's wake.
                         
                                  WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                       Thy will be done, on Earth as it is
                       in Heaven.
                         
          TWO DOORS swing open. We see the silhouettes of TWELVE PEOPLE
          DRESSED FOR BATTLE, rifles at the ready, barrels pointing up.
          CAMERA is so close to the woman's face, it almost touches
          her. Her lips are moving, silently reciting...
                         
          We are in a SWAT ASSAULT VEHICLE. It is MOVING BACKWARDS fast
          and slams through a faded picket fence. Stops in the yard of
          a crumbling house.
                         
          They all rise and leap from the vehicle.
                         
          EXT. TRACT HOUSE -- PHOENIX -- DAY.
                         
          WE ARE RIGHT BEHIND THE WOMAN, who mumbles the prayer as she
          runs. The back of her vest reads: FBI. Her name is KATE MACY.
                         
                                                MACY
                       Give us this day... our daily
                       bread...
                         
          They reach the door, a shotgun BLASTS THE HINGES. It falls
          like a drawbridge.
                         
                                                MACY (CONT'D)
                       And forgive us our trespasses as we
                       forgive those who trespass against
                       us.
                                                                      3.
                         
                         
          She speaks the prayer faster, desperate to finish before she
          has to kill anyone, or be killed herself.
                         
                                             MACY (CONT'D)

                    deliver us from evil...
                         
          SWAT officers rush in, screaming.
                         
          Macy's turn: She runs through the busted door-
                         
          INT. TRACT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS.
                         
          In the hallway now. The chaos is closer. She hurries the
          words. So close now...

          Two LATINO MEN, 20'S, are slammed to the ground. Another
          LATINO comes from nowhere, throwing himself on an AFRICAN
          AMERICAN MAN wearing an FBI vest. A taser is pressed to his
          neck and he falls, paralyzed, backward.
                         
          Macy takes in the chaos, then pushes farther into the house,
          running past a bedroom with an open door.
                         
          From the corner of her eye she sees:
                         
          A MAN POINTING A SHOTGUN AT HER.
                         
          She ducks as a SHOTGUN BLAST rips 10 inches of dry wall above
          her.
                         
          She turns, pressing the CAMERA against the wall. We watch
          over her shoulder as she returns fire.
                         
          A rooster tail of shell casings are thrown over us, invading
          our view. Bullet after bullet pound him. The man's knees
          give. He's falling...
                         
          A round hits him in the face and he is thrown back -- blood,
          brain, and skull fragments explode like shrapnel on the wall
          behind him.
                         
          Adrenaline hits her like a fever. She gets dizzy, sits
          against the wall, gasping for breath. A SWAT officer rushes
          to her.
                         
                                               SWAT OFFICER

                       I'm good. I'm good.
                         
          The SWAT officer looks at the hole in the drywall. Leans
          forward. Looks closer... What the fuck IS that??
                         
          His face now inches from the hole then jumps back like he was
          bitten by a snake.
                         
                                                SWAT OFFICER

          WE SEE WHAT HE SEES:
                         
          The SKULL OF A MAN. Dry skin sunken into bones like
          cellophane.
                         
          Macy stands up and turns around. Looks at it. Trying to
          process what she's seeing. She walks up and starts pulling at
          the drywall. Other officers join her. They yank and tear a
          six foot hole in the wall, then stand back, speechless.
                         
                         
          Bodies are standing side by side. A lime-green dust has
          spilled out on the floor.
                         
          The entire house is a tomb.

          Macy sits on the porch. Swallows water from a bottle. Holds
          it down maybe ten seconds. Vomits... We see another SWAT
          OFFICER doing the same.
                         
          FBI AGENT REGGIE WAYNE, 30, African American, walks from the
          house, fighting the same urge. Sits beside her.

                    By telling me the truth without
                    having to drown you.
                         
          They come around a bend and we see:
                         
          A COLOMBIAN MILITARY BASE.
                         
          Structures built in simple but orderly rows. Humvees, one
          after the other, parked neatly in front. Soldiers move about.
          Colombia may be corrupt, but they are orderly about it. None
          of the filth and chaos of northern Mexico. They have been at
          it much longer, with battle lines very clearly drawn.
                         
          The man turns to Alejandro.

                    things that I don't understand.
                         
          Alejandro offers him a polite smile.

                    will.
                         
          The man walks away, turning back occasionally to see if he is
          truly free.
                         
          Alejandro turns in another direction, spots THREE US MARINE
          HUMVEES, EIGHT MARINES BESIDE THEM. Matt stands in front.
          They walk toward each other.

          Alejandro's kind, hollow eyes almost show emotion.

                    Doesn't matter. It leads to Fausto.
                    And I'm going to turn you loose.
                         
          Alejandro stands for a moment. The tiniest hint of a smile
          curls his lips.

          Macy sits beside Alejandro. Studies him. He looks like a
          doctor or accountant, but there is an absent manner to his

          the weight of his thoughts. He catches her looking at him.

                    They got some bitchin peanuts in
                    the back. Kind of a self-serve deal
                    though.
                         
          He puts his head back, closes his eyes. She looks over at
          Alejandro who is already asleep. Macy's wired. No chance of
          sleep. Pulls a magazine from the seat back as the plane
          begins to taxi...

          WE SEE: Alejandro's face in profile. Sunlight spilling over
          him through a small window. He looks different. Softer...
          Happy...
                         
          DARK BROWN HAIR lowers into frame toward him. He pushes it
          back, revealing a young woman. She smiles and kisses him. He
          lets her hair fall as the kiss grows. Dark hair fills the
          frame...
                         
          It gets very still. Darker now. Sunlight is gone. We PULL
          BACK. Farther. Farther still. See the woman's body. She lays
          face down in a hallway, naked. Blood pooled beneath her.
                         
          We hear a HEART BEAT. We move down a hall. Heart beating
          FASTER. Past a MEXICAN POLICE OFFICER, who somberly watches
          us... At the end of the hall we hear something rubbing,
          swaying. We move faster. Heart beats faster. Racing now.
                         
          Come to the end of the hall, the SWAYING IS LOUDER. We turn
          left, push open a door. Look up -- The swaying sound is a
          ROPE. It swings in and out of frame. We follow it down -- the
          LIFELESS BODY OF A YOUNG GIRL at the end of it.

          Alejandro jolts awake, slamming his hands into the seat in

                    when we're done, Matt -- you can be
                    the tip of the spear and we don't
                    have to rob a guy from Delta... Be
                    careful on the turn-around -- if a
                    Federale is a shooter it will be on
                    the turn around. Ray, your Team 1

          Everyone laughs. The Delta operators rise. Though this is a
          room of professionals, these men truly look like the ones you
          want to stand behind.

          Men begin rising and readying their gear. The mood is
          relaxed. Matt walks to the Marshal -- they shake hands and
          disappear in the back.

          They continue past. Into an even worse part of Juarez, if
          that's possible. The vehicles come to a stop. POPPING SOUNDS
          can be heard. Like fireworks.

          He cracks his window. The sound floods in. GUNFIRE. Not ten
          shots, not fifty. Hundreds. It is a battle. Over the radio we
                         HEAR:

                    Everybody hold on. Mexicans are
                    adjusting our route. There's
                    activity ahead we need to go
                    around.
                         
          We sit here, listening to the gunfight as it builds in
          intensity. We hear a series of explosions.
                                                                    35.
                         
                         
          Both agents in the front seats reposition their rifles.
          Ready.
                         
          The convoy rolls again. Makes a left, drives away from the
          battle as though they were avoiding road construction. A few
          blocks and they all snake right. Macy is trying hard not to
          be terrified.
                         
          Suddenly, the convoy picks up speed. Moving 70mph over a road
          that barely qualifies as two lanes.
                         
          They race past a park. A large building can be seen on the
          right. The Mexican flag flies in front. Numerous Federal
          Police vehicles in front.
                         
          The convoy stops in front and the Delta operators are out of
          their vehicles, setting a perimeter. The Marshals and Matt
          emerge and move straight to the building, two Deltas follow.
                         
          Macy stays glued to the front door of the building. Waiting.
          Alejandro shifts in his seat toward Macy.

                    try anything, it will be at the

                    us when we return... Be ready.

          Matt and the Marshals come out with a man covered in a
          blanket. He is placed in the backseat.

          Suddenly, the Tahoe lurches forward -- moving between the
          vehicle with Matt and the Marshals -- acting as a shield.
          Macy looks out the window at the Federal Police trucks. She
          notices the agent riding shotgun has his rifle at the ready
          in the direction of the Federal Police.
                                                                   36.

          She turns to find him pointing his rifle almost at her head.
          She leans back, and moves her hands toward her ears, ready to
          cover them.

          The Tahoe begins moving and performs a lighting fast three
          point turn, and just like that we are headed north.
                         
          Macy lets out an endless sigh of relief. We are driving very
          fast now.
                         
          Macy looks out the windshield, the hills of El Paso loom in
          the distance.

          It disappears as buildings fill our view, then at the next

          At the loop, the Mexican Federal Police vehicles peel off,
          leaving the convoy alone. At the border, US HOMELAND SECURITY
          OFFICERS can be seen standing with rifles, making a very
          public show of force.
                         
          There is no lane cleared for them, and just like that -- they

          The innocent masses stuck in the crossfire duck out of view

          The kid with the AK 47 in the back of the Buick makes a move
          for his door handle. Alejandro clocks it, puts 10 rounds
          through the window, killing him and the man beside him before
          the door is opened.

          the tinted window.
                         
          The sound is deafening. As the man falls out of view, all we

          Alejandro and the agent riding shotgun jump in and roll their
          windows down and sit out of them like turrets as the vehicles
          start up and race to the border.
                         
          They pass the guard house without stopping, Border Agents

                    This diagram is based on other

                    is NOT accurate, it is for
                    reference only. We expect a small
                    exit corridor on our side of the
                    border. They mark the international
                    border in the tunnel with red paint
                    so Border Patrol doesn't pursue
                    past that point. Once on the
                    Mexican side, there will be a small
                    staging area, then another shaft
                    will lead to the main warehouse and

          In an instant, he has the gun and removes the magazine,
          disassembles the slide, and tosses the pieces on the table.
          She screams and rushes him. He spins her and pushes her back.

          She breathes heavy, trying to remain calm.
                         
          He begins lifting her shirt. She struggles and he grabs her
          throat. She looks into his eyes and it is a killer looking

          She surrenders, turns her head to the side. He lifts her

          She nods as her lip quivers. Clinging desperately to her
          dignity. She has never felt so powerless, and that is his
          point.
                         
          He drops her shirt and steps back. She crosses her arms,

          They round the corner. We follow them to a park. Weeds cut

          Playing. Being children. The referee blows a whistle. The
