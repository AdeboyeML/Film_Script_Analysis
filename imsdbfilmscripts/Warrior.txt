          PADDY CONLON (60) exits the doors of a run-down church
          holding a 12-STEP BOOK. He is followed by a cluster of other
          PEOPLE in the program and says his goodbyes.

          Paddy grips the steering wheel with labor-calloused hands and
          drives over the P.J. McArdle Bridge and up a winding hill. He
          listens to "MOBY DICK" on tape as the last piece of daylight
          bleeds away. With rosary beads swaying from his rear view,
          Paddy turns and eases the Olds past row houses in a blue-
          collar neighborhood high above the city.

          TOMMY CONLON (28), hard miles on a handsome face, sits on the
          stoop of an old row house in a wool watch cap and winter
          coat. A duffel bag is at his feet, a bottle of whiskey in a
          brown bag in his hands. He reaches into his coat pocket, pops
          a handful of prescription PILLS, and stares off into the
          approaching night.

          Paddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house, clicks off
          the tape, kills the engine, and climbs out of the car. As he
          approaches the stairs, Paddy sees Tommy. Can't believe his
          eyes.

          Father and son look at each other. It's obvious it's been a
          long, long time. Tommy takes a bemused look down at the car.

           priorities.
                         
          Paddy grins uncomfortably. Lets the remark go and climbs the
          stairs as Tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a
          fresh BOTTLE of Jameson. He offers it to Paddy.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)

          Paddy shakes his head. Tommy looks at him. Paddy Conlon not

          Paddy and Tommy walk through the front door. The house is
          clean, yet all the furnishings are from the late 1970s. Tommy
          stands in the den and looks around, breathing the old place
          in, as Paddy makes his way into the kitchen.
                         
                          TOMMY

          The sound of glasses CLINKING in the kitchen as Tommy takes
          off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home. He
          glances down at a BIBLE on a table beside a weathered Barca
          lounge chair.
                         
                          TOMMY

           who can take a punch nowadays.
                         
          Tommy takes another swig from his bottle and looks at a
          series of old PHOTOGRAPHS lining the walls as Paddy walks
          into the room carrying a coffee pot and saucers on an old
          wicker tray. Tommy looks at him, incredulous.

          mall photography studio, of a MAN AND WOMAN (late 20s) POSING
          WITH A YOUNG GIRL (2). The man looks like the second boy in

          Tommy turns back to the photos and looks at another one of
          the woman. Obviously his MOTHER. He puts it down, glances at
          the bible, then stares hard at Paddy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           So you found God, huh? That's
           awesome. Mom kept calling for him,
           but he wasn't around. I guess Jesus
           was down at the mill forgiving all
           the drunks. Who knew?

          is fading. The pills are kicking in. He tries to open his
          eyes, but it's no use, and after a few moments he's out.

          Paddy glances down, where some pills have fallen out of

          Relieved and heartbroken at the same time.

          A chaotic birthday party in the back yard of a middle-class
          home in the suburbs of Philly. A CLUSTER OF 5-YEAR OLDS run
          about, some whacking at a pinata hanging from a tree, some
          whizzing down a large blow-up slide, some getting their faces
          painted by a make-up artist dressed like a GYPSY.
                         
          TESS CONLON (29) bounces around the yard, multi-tasking like
          a champion and filming the proceedings with a VIDEO CAMERA.
          She trains the camera on BRENDAN CONLON (30), who sits in a
          lawn chair in a scarf, hat, and women's make-up.

           Daddy is now a princess.
                         
          Tess laughs. Brendan looks at her with a "Help me out here"

          The make-over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents."
          Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with
          gifts as PARENTS and CHILDREN gather around.
                         
          Brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to
          the gift table. Amidst all the presents is one BOX, covered

          white TENT is set up outside, and the parking lot is
          overflowing with cars. Something big going on.

          Aluminum bleachers are set up around a ring, where TWO
          AMATEUR FIGHTERS go at it under a bank of sodium lights.
          Hundreds of rowdy LOCALS swill beer and BOO lustily when the
          action slows.

          paces in his corner as a cluster of BIKERS cheer him on from

          Lo and behold, there's a shirtless Brendan standing in the
          corner of the ring wearing a pair of shorts. On his right
          shoulder, an elaborate TATTOO of the CONLON FAMILY CREST.

          Brendan reaches out to touch gloves with Mike Moore, but his
          opponent snubs him and storms back to his corner. He means
          business. Brendan, looking less sure of himself, retreats to
          his corner.

          The bikers raise hell as the BELL sounds. Moore comes out
          bombing. Brendan dodges a couple of wild haymakers, then gets
          caught in the side of the head with a right hand. He stumbles
          back into the ropes and Moore presses into him, swatting at
          him with his huge hands.
                         
          Brendan absorbs the blows, ducks down, grabs Moore by the
          legs, lifts him, and dumps him on the mat with a resounding
          THUD. Obviously bull strong and with tremendous punching
          skills, Brendan sits on his opponent's chest and starts
          raining down shots, banging and banging, pulverizing his face
          and body.
                         
          It's a full on ass-whooping going on in there until finally,
          mercifully, the referee stops the butchery amidst a mixture
          of CHEERS from the crowd and BOOS from the bikers.
                         
          A winded Brendan walks to his corner, touches the side of his
          head, wipes a small amount of blood on his shorts, and climbs
          out of the ring, where a PROMOTER approaches.

          It's dark, except for the moonlight glowing through the
          window. An exhausted Brendan takes off his shirt and begins
          washing his badly SWOLLEN FACE. Then the door opens, and Tess
          shuffles in.

          she gets a look at his face.

           Just because you decide it's a
           special day, it doesn't make it one
           for me. I got a wife and kids

           Tommy Riordan's captured the
           media's attention, but the question

           more importantly, can he compete in

           who he was, and I've gotta say the
           fact that I don't know is strange.
           In an internet age where there are
           no secrets, this guy is a complete
           mystery. I can't find out anything

           The only reason that Tommy is even

           video. Let me describe it for you
           folks for the few who haven't seen
           it, and I don't know anyone who
           hasn't, but Tommy Riordan ripped

           battle, saving lives in the

          There's no anger in Tommy. He simply walks toward the old man
          and tries to pry the bottle out of his hand. As he struggles
          to take it, the Walkman falls to the ground. Faint dialogue
          is heard coming from the earphones.

           For the love of God. We're lost.
                         
          The old man is running out of steam. He begins WEEPING.

          Paddy wobbles, tears streaming down his face. Tommy looks at
          him. The first time we've seen anything resembling compassion
          on that relentless face of his. He HUGS his father and pries
          the whiskey bottle from his hand

          Tommy pulls his father back on to the bed. Puts his arms
          around his chest and tries to quiet the old man. It's a
          tender moment, and it seems as if Tommy is only able to
          relate to the brutal, former version of the father he knew.

          A bigger, even more bombastic FIREWORKS display than before
          explodes over Atlantic City. If it's possible, the CROWDS on
          the beach and boardwalk have swelled. It seems as if the

          Outside Boardwalk Hall, the giant electronic BILLBOARD has a
          new motif. Koba still swings mightily from the side of a
          ferris wheel, but now Tommy, in a camouflage superhero
          outfit, flies right toward him. On a collision course.
                         
          Mad Dog Grimes holds on to Tommy's cape, trying to slow him

          Tommy, flap down, tears of pain pouring down his face, stands
          defiantly in his corner. In the other corner, Frank attends
          Brendan. In the crowd, Tess covers her mouth. She can't
          believe what Tommy allowed to happen to him.
                         
          Frank puts the stool down and gives Brendan some water.
          Brendan's face is wracked with guilt and concern over his

          This is not what Brendan wants to hear. He looks over to Josh

          Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank exits the cage. The wounded
          Tommy stands in his corner, his ruined left arm hanging low.
          Brendan makes eye contact with him.

          The BELL sounds. Round Four begins. Tommy throws useless
          right jabs. He's one handed and has no chance. Brendan stays
          away from him, not wanting to hurt his brother.
                         
                          BRENDAN

          Frank screams at Brendan from cageside to take the wounded

          Tommy and Brendan circle each other. Tommy throwing rights
          and wincing in agony at any movement. Brendan stares at him.
          Everything about him says "Quit, Tommy." But Tommy won't.

          He knows he'll lose the fight on the judges' scorecards if he
          doesn't do something.

          Tommy keeps throwing defiant right jabs at Brendan. Finally,
          with no choice, Brendan fires back. He batters the
          defenseless Tommy up against the cage and POUNDS away at him,
          blasting his left shoulder with punches that make Tommy wince
          in pain. It's anyone's guess how he can take it.
                         
          Brendan presses his brother up against the cage. Begging him
          to quit. But Tommy merely responds by elbowing Brendan in the
          face again. This sets the older brother off, and he resumes
          pounding on Tommy until the HORN sounds and Rosenthal pulls
          Brendan away.

          Brendan heads back to his stool as Tommy leans against the
          cage in agony. The Marines scream for him, but his eyes are
          glazed over. It's unthinkable that he hasn't broken yet.
                         
          From near cageside, Paddy looks to the corner and makes eye
          contact with Brendan. They exchange a small look of
          understanding. A NOD. They both know what needs to be done.

          In the crowd, the "Tommy" CHANT begins in earnest. In fact,
          it may be louder than ever. Having done the impossible and
          carried on with one arm, Tommy is more superhuman and heroic
