               My missionary ancestors came to the
               islands and told the Hawaiians to put
               on clothes, work hard, believe in
               Christ, and stop surfing and hula
               dancing. They made business deals
               along the way -- buying an island, or
               marrying a princess and inheriting her
               land. Now their descendants wear
               bikinis and running shorts, play beach
               volleyball and surf, and take up hula
               dancing. Hawai'i has always been a
               place of contradiction.

               My friends on the mainland think just
               because I live in Hawai'i, I live in
               paradise. Like a permanent vacation --
               we're all just out here drinking mai-
               tais, shaking our hips, and catching
               waves. Are they nuts? How can they
               possibly think our families are less
               screwed up, our heart attacks and
               cancers less fatal, our grief less
               devastating? Hell, I haven't been on a

                 For the last 23 days, I've been living
                 in a "paradise" of IVs and urine bags
                 and endotracheal tubes and six-month-
                 old US magazines. Paradise. Paradise
                 can go fuck itself.

    Matt looks up at the WOMAN we saw in the speedboat, now lying
    stiffly on an upright HOSPITAL BED, her head cocked to one
    side, a feeding tube in her nose, a ventilator in her
    trachea, IVs in her arm.

                 This is Elizabeth King, my wife.
                 Twenty-three days ago she was launched
                 from a powerboat during a race and hit
                 her head, almost drowned. Now she's in
                 a coma that scores 5 on the Glasgow
                 scale and 3 on the Rancho Los Amigos
                 scale, scores showing an extremely
                 severe coma. Liz is very competitive.
                 Whatever she does, she does to the
                 fullest.

                 She reacts non-purposefully to stimuli
                 in a non-specific manner, but
                 occasionally her responses are
                 specific, though inconsistent. Her
                 reflexes are primitive and often the
                 same, regardless of stimuli
                 presented...

                 day now the doctors will give me their
                 final verdict if she's going to come

                  birthday party and Scottie sat outside
                  by herself. It was a mean thing to do,
                  but Lani here probably did it just to
                  show off, right?

                Unlike a lot of my cousins, I haven't
                touched my share of the trust money.
                Like my father before me, I live only
                on the income from my law practice. I
                don't want my daughters growing up
                entitled and spoiled. And I agree with
                my father -- you give your children
                enough money to do something but not
                enough to do nothing.

     Matt enters the room to find SEVEN COUSINS waiting to greet
     him. From their casual clothing and shaggy hair, an observer
     might hardly suspect their status.

                Not only am I the sole but I'm a
                commercial real estate and
                transactional attorney, so the most
                involved of my cousins have been
                meeting with me regularly to analyze
                the bids -- Cousin Dave, Cousin Hal,
                Cousin Six, Cousin Wink, Cousin Lisa,
                Cousin Connie and Cousin Stan, both of
                whom oppose the sale entirely. Don't
                be fooled by appearances. In Hawai'i
                some of the most powerful people look

                  toward a lower bid from a guy named Don

     Alexandra slides into the water, swims to the other side and

               her. Do you understand what I'm

                  parties and have people over, which we
                  do, of course, but who ends up doing

                  Nobody's forcing you to clean and buy a
                  new outfit and think of some goddamn

                  more fun that way, anyway.

     pettiness of everyday life. He at once pities it, is
     impatient with it, and longs for it.

                  old person would just hurry up?

     lowers his head into one hand, squeezing his temples. It's

                  leave in the morning, and be back
                  tomorrow night. If it takes another

                  the way to shore. Got cuts all over

      Matt sits on the sand, glancing occasionally back toward the

      Suddenly TWO BOYS -- Brian's kids -- come running through the
      hedge and past Matt on their way into the water.

      Matt turns around to see Brian's wife JULIE SPEER dutifully
      trailing behind.

                   That's right. It's an octopus. Such a
                   funny creature with its eight legs.
                   But did you know octopi are actually
                   extremely intelligent, like dogs and
                   cats? They have unique personalities,
                   and just like us they have a lot of
                   defense mechanisms. I'm sure you know
                   about the ink sac. She uses ink to
                   confuse her predators. She can
                   camouflage herself. She can emit
                   poison, and some can mimic more
                   dangerous creatures, like the eel. I
                   keep her to remind me of our defense
                   mechanisms -- our ink, our camouflage,
                   our poison, all the things we use to
                   keep away hurt. The reason Dr.
                   Johnston invited me here today is to
                   meet you, Scottie. I've heard a lot
                   about you.

                   unique and spirited girl.

                   You're going to have to be a very brave
                   girl right now, and you're surrounded
                   by people who love you. I came to meet
                   you and tell you that if you ever want
                   to talk about what you're feeling, I
                   would like to talk to you too. I can

                   work for an octopus but not for us.

      Dr. Herman looks at everyone with great sincerity before

      and it squeaks a little.

                          DR. JOHNSTON
                Yes. We worked really hard with her,
                but three other doctors and I agree
                she's in what we call an irreversible
                coma. Do you know what that means?

                          SCOTTIE
                It means she doesn't have a brain
                anymore.

                          DR. JOHNSTON
                Not exactly, but... yes, that's the
                general idea. So we're doing exactly
                what she wanted us to do if that ever
                happened. That's why she's not
                attached to the machines anymore.

                          ALEXANDRA
                It's for the best, Scottie. Look at

117   INT. KING HOUSE - MATT'S STUDY - NIGHT                             117

      Matt sits at his desk lost in thought. The only sound is the
      tick-tock of an old clock reading 3:20. Then he gets up and
      starts pacing, shooting occasional glances at the BLUEPRINTS
      and RENDERINGS atop his desk.

119   INT. KING FAMILY SHARED PROPERTY HOUSE - DAY                       119

      Matt opens all front doors and lanai doors, letting air into
      the old place. He notices old PHOTOS OF KING ANCESTORS.

120   EXT. KING FAMILY SHARED PROPERTY - DAY                             120

      Matt walks around the property alone, taking it in and
      thinking. Like everywhere in Hawai'i, the nature here is
      powerful -- TREES, BIRDS, SPIDERWEBS.

121   EXT. KING FAMILY SHARED PROPERTY HOUSE - DAY                       121

      for the poll. We recognize some faces.

      CLOSER --

      Amid drinks held aloft, a CALABASH is passed among the
      cousins into which the each places a folded BALLOT.

      Matt sits watching the proceedings with Cousin Hugh, Cousin
      Six and another ELDERLY COUSIN at a table piled with papers
      and contracts.

                   holdouts who don't want to sell at all,
                   it's Don Holitzer. Chicago group a

                   know you have a lot on your plate right
                   now, but you're not going to fuck this
                   up for us. It's over. If we don't

                Your head's not right, Mattie. Your
                head's not right. You want a couple
                days to think it over? Take a couple
                days.

                          MATT
                I don't need a couple days. I have the
                authority, and this is what I want. I
                haven't wanted something in a long
                time. We have other businesses we're
                converting to corporations. We can
                figure it out.

                But it's utterly unproductive land. It
                doesn't generate enough income to pay
                the goddamn taxes.

                          COUSIN HUGH
                You're the trustee. You know better

      that this is his moment.

      He walks to the bed, takes her hand, rubs his palm over her
      hair. He says something to her as though silently praying,
      then realizes he should say it aloud.

      He presses his lips to hers and puts his hand on her stomach.

      far-away sadness on her face. She walks slowly toward --

      to comfort her, but she's not in the mood. She allows them
