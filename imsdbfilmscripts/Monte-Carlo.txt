          Leaning on the lip of the kitchen's bar, Emma presses the
          record button on her answering machine, then speaks with a
          put-on, coolly sophisticated,'jet-setting accent.

          She hangs up the phone and sits herself down at the coffee 
          table where a game of solitaire is laid next to a microwaved
          Lean Cuisine dinner.
          She turns up the volume with the remote and gathers the
          cards, shuffling.
          Eyes glued to Princess Diana on television, Emma suddenly

          Water pours in sheets from the sky as Alice, Meg and Emma
          splash down the Rue de Rivoli and duck beneath the shelter of
          the hotel's canopy.
          They shake water from their arms and hair, pluck at their
          sopping clothes.

          the overhang on the far side of the entrance, as a camera
          flashes in taking Emma's picture.

          shakes her head emphatically.

          GOERS down the twisting streets, when he sees the commotion
          and crowd around the dirt lot.

          Alice sticks like glue to a kid with the ball, maneuvers in,
          steals the ball, and doubles back in the opposite direction,
          racing up the field as the crowd laughs and claps.
          She passes the ball to kid who drives it to the goal, scores.
          Alice looks up from the game at the tapping of a car horn to
          see Jean-Pierre honking in celebration as he leans against
          the car with his GUESTS, enjoying the game.
          Alice stops to wave, and takes the ball full in the face.

          from the car as worried kids and spectators form a circle
          around Alice's prone body.
          The little dog licks Alice's face and she opens her eyes.
          She leaps up as Jean-Pierre crosses the lot.

          along with plates, ashtrays, crumpled napkins.
          Emma sits on the lower landing deck, legs in the water, shoes
          in her hand, looking out at the lights.
          Nikolai moves his legs in the gentle current beside her,
          tuxedo trousers rolled, while he concentrates on working a
          napkin into intricate folds.

          Meg tries to follow the discussions and familiar teasing of
          the chefs as they pass plates, goading her to taste.
          She looks over at Bernard, who smiles as he holds his hands

          Meg and another chef, locked in a chopping duel, plow though
          onions at a blinding pace, their knives flashing, creating an
          escalating staccato on their cutting boards.
          Meg sweeps her onion from her board to a pan, and slams her
          knife down in victory as all the chefs erupt with applause.
          Henri seizes Meg's hand, raising her arm in the air, and
          presents her with a bottle of wine.
          Meg turns to Bernard, beaming, thrilled, utterly happy, as
          the other chefs clap her on the back, shake her hand.

          Now, Emma, you're sure about this?

                         EMMA
          I'll call you both as soon as I
          know. They may have to get a sub
          at school for a couple of weeks,
          but, oh, you guys, I swear it
          sounded like a proposal!
          Alice and Meg turn to Nikolai who grins and nods away.

                         NIKOLAI
          Yes! Yes!

          0 EXT. HOTEL DE PARIS - FRONT DRIVE - MOMENTS LATER

          Jean-Pierre closes the car's door with Alice, Meg and Richard
          inside, stepping back to join Emma, Nikolai, Bernard,
          Penelope and Domenico, who watch as the car pulls out.
          Together, they wave their friends away.
          Jean-Pierre shakes hands with Nikolai and kisses Emma, tips
          his head in farewell to Bernard, then enters the hotel with
          Penelope and Domenico.
          Emma and Nikolai shake hands with Bernard, then turn and head
          for the marina, trailed by one of the paparazzi while the
          other two pause to reload their cameras.
          As Bernard hops on his moped to zip away, the revolving doors
          turn and Cordelia steps out, talking on her cellphone,
          followed by a train of bellhops and luggage.

                         CORDELIA
          Yes, Daddy! It was a huge success--
          She stops suddenly, as if struck, and her expression of
          perpetual anger melts away as she listens, blinks.

          One of the paparazzi raises his camera to take her picture,
          but another places his hand over the lens.

          Alice sits between Richard and Meg at the departure gate,
          each lost in their own thoughts as TRAVELERS pass to and fro.
          A long beat.
          A small smile finds its way onto Alice's face and she gently
          lowers her head to rest it on Richard's shoulder.
          Richard finds Alice's hand and squeezes it in his own.

          INT. NICE AIRPORT - JETWAY - DAY

          Meg walks down the jetway in her skinny jeans, a bounce in 
          her step, shopping bags in one hand, the bottle of wine
          gripped in the other, as though headed for a party.
          Behind her, Alice carries her shopping bags and Richard totes
          Alice's suitcase.

          A bulletin board in Meg's classroom is covered in African
          fabric, photographs and letters, all under a banner that
          reads: Food Drive for Our Sister School - Zambia.
          The two students who had cooked their pot holders sort canned

          A STUDENT carefully scoops spices with a measuring spoon,
          holding it out for Meg to add to her pan.
          She ignores the spoon, instead reaching to pinch some spice
