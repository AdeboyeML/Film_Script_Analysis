          Leaving the door open, Vern turns around and motions at Eddie
          with his left hand to come in. The place is all mismatched
          antique furniture -- the possessions of someone who collected
          once, with enthusiasm, but who's letting it all go to hell.
          Vern sits, keeping his injured arm elevated.
