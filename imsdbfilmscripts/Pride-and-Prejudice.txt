          A vast mansion is coming to life. Maids pull dustsheets
          off furniture; servants open shutters. Sunshine spills
          into the great rooms of Netherfield. outside, a glimpse
          of rolling parkland.

          sweeping and polishing, readying the house for its new
          occupants. The shutters of a room are opened onto the
          imposing gardens. A coach pulls up and, through the
          window, we see a young man get out.

          2 EXT. LONGBOURN HOUSE - DAY. 2

          Elizabeth Bennet, 20, good humoured, attractive, clearly
          nobody's fool, walks through a field of tall meadow
          grass. She is reading a novel entitled 'First
          Impressions'. She approaches Longbourn, a fairly run down
          17th Century house with a small moat around it. Elizabeth
          jumps up onto a wall and crosses the moat by walking a
          wooden plank duck board, a reckless trick learnt in early
          childhood. She walks passed the back of the house where,
          through an open window to the library, we see her mother
          and father, Mr and Mrs Bennet.

                         MRS BENNET
          My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard that
          Netherfield Park is let at last?
          We follow Elizabeth into the house, but still overhear
          her parents' conversation.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          Do you not want to know who has taken it?

                         MR BENNET
          As you wish to tell me, I doubt I have
          any choice in the matter...

          As Elizabeth walks through the hallway, we hear the sound
          of piano scales plodding through the afternoon. She walks
          down the entrance hall past the room where Mary, 18, the
          bluestocking of the family, is practising, and finds
          Kitty, 16, the second youngest, and Lydia, 15, the
          precocious baby of the family, are listening at the door
          to the library.

          Have you heard? A Mr Bingley, a young man
          from the North of England, has come down
          on Monday in a chaise and four.

                         KITTY
          With five thousand a year!
          Jane, (the eldest, most beautiful and most charmingly
          naive of the girls), joins them at the door.

          INT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS.

          Mr Bennet is trying to ignore Mrs Bennet.

                         MRS BENNET
          What a fine thing for our girls!

                         MR BENNET
          Bow can it affect them?

                         MRS BENNET
          My dear Mr Bennet, how can you be so
          tiresome! You know that he must marry one
          of them.

                         MR BENNET
          Oh, so that is his design in settling
          here?
          Mr Bennet takes a book from his table and walks out of
          the library into the corridor where the girls are
          gathered, Mrs Bennet following.

          Mr Bennet walks to the bookshelf to replace the book he
          is carrying. Mary is there practising the piano. The
          girls come in to listen.

                         LYDIA
          Oh, yes, Papa.

          The piano stops. A frozen silence. They all stare.

          no compassion for my poor nerves?

                         MR BENNET
          You mistake me, my dear. I have a high
          respect for them; they are my constant
          companions these twenty years.

                         MRS BENNET

          Mr Bennet winks at Elizabeth and turns to Mary, a
          serious, somewhat pedantic young woman.

                         MR BENNET
          And what do you say, Mary? Are you not
          excited by the prospect of a ball?

                         MARY
          Society has claims on us all, Papa. As
          long as I have my mornings to myself, I
          consider an interval of recreation and
          â¢ amusement as quite desirable.
          Elizabeth laughs.

          6 INT. ASSEMBLY ROOMS -- MERYTON VILLAGE - NIGHT.

          The local subscription dance is in full swing. It's a
          rough-and-ready, though enthusiastic affair...yeoman
          farmers, small-time squires with their ruddy-cheeked
          daughters.
          Lydia and Kitty, with their mother, are fussing over
          their clothes - straightening their dresses, tidying
          their hair and so on.

          watch your tongue.

          And eat my hat.
          She stops speaking. And stares. A dazzling group enters
           the room: George Bingley, 25, a good hearted soul but
          â¢ prone to bumbling embarrassment when his enthusiasms get
          the better of him, his sister Caroline, 23, a victim of
          every latest fashion, counting herself superior to most
          company she encounters, and finally, Mr Fitzwilliam
          Darcy, 27, dashing, brooding with an introversion which
          could be misconstrued as hauteur. They are dressed in the
          highest fashion. Darcy surveys the hall. He catches
          Elizabeth's eye. She stares, with a kind of surprised
          shock. Jane notices and looks at Darcy. He turns away.

                         JANE
          Luckily, you are not wearing a hat.
          A hush falls as the local people turn to stare. The
          newcomers - creatures from another world - make quite a
          stir.

          Caroline Bingley, standing next to Darcy, gazes at the

          We are a long way from Grosvenor Square,
          are we not, Mr Darcy?
          He does indeed look superior to the assembled company. On
          the dance floor a young couple, staring at the newcomers,
          trip over each other, stumble and burst out laughing.

          in a state of high excitement.

                         LYDIA
          Mama! The regiment is arriving next week!

                         KITTY
          And will be here for the whole winter!
          Mrs Forster told us!

                         LYDIA
          They're going to be stationed in the
          village!

          Mr Bingley'turns to Jane.

                         MR BINGLEY
          May I have the honour?
          They leave, to dance.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you dance Mr Darcy?

                         DARCY
          Not if I can help it.
          Elizabeth, Darcy and Miss Bingley stand in silence as
          they over hear the following...

                         LYDIA
          It's easy. You just walk up and down in
          front of them and drop something.
          Lydia pantomimes the actions for Kitty.

          â¢ They pick it up. You say 'oh thank you
          sir' and blush prettily and then you're
          introduced!

                         MR BENNET
          I have long suspected that we have two of
          the silliest girls in the county.

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh Mr Bennet! I remember the time when I
          liked a red coat myself, and if a smart
          young colonel with six thousand a year
          should want one of my girls I shall not
          say nay to him.
          Mr Darcy overhears this. Profoundly embarrassed, Lizzie
          moves away.

                         CUT TO:
          The dance floor. Mr Bingley is dancing with Jane. His
          ears blushing with thrilled embarrassment. Mrs Bennet,
          with a group of other mothers, watches the young couple
          with rather too obvious satisfaction.

                         MRS BENNET
          7 That dress becomes her, does it not. 7
          â¢ Though of course my Jane needs little
          help from couturiers.
          Elizabeth wanders through the throng. She looks at
          Bingley and Jane ending the dance - she is coy and
          demure, he clearly smitten -

                         CUT TO:
          Darcy is joined by Bingley exhilarated by the dance.

                         BINGLEY
          Come Darcy, I must have you dance. I hate
          to see you standing by yourself in this
          stupid manner.

                         MR DARCY
          (shakes his head)
          You know how I detest it.

                         MR BINGLEY
          Upon my word, I've never seen so many
          pretty girls in my life.

                         DARCY
          You are dancing with the only handsome

          ever beheld, but her sister Elizabeth is
          very agreeable.
          They have stopped at the edge of the dance floor and have
          not seen Elizabeth and charlotte who are standing close
          behind them. Elizabeth smirks as she overhears their
          conversation.

                         DARCY
          Perfectly tolerable, I dare say, but not
          handsome enough to tempt me.
          Elizabeth's smile drops.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          You had better return to your partner and
          enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting
          your time with me.
          Bingley goes off.

                         CUT TO:
          Elizabeth and Charlotte, who have overheard Darcy and
          Bingley's exchange.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Ignore him, Lizzie, he is such a
          disagreeable man it would be a misfortune
          to be liked by him.

                         ELIZABETH
          Don't worry. I would not dance with him
          for half of Derbyshire.

                         CUT TO:
          Later. Bingley politely dancing with Charlotte. As he
          does so, he catches sight of Jane dancing with somebody
          else. A look of pure longing, but he cannot dance every
          dance with her. Lizzie too is dancing and clocks this.
          Lydia and Kitty are exuberantly dancing too, laughing and
          chatting. Darcy stands watching, a look of infinitely
          superior boredom on his fine features.

                         CUT TO:
          Bingley is standing with Jane, Elizabeth, Mrs Bennet and

                         MRS BENNET
          But Lizzie will never admit she is plain.

          Of course it's my Jane who's considered

          Oh, Mama, please!

                         MRS BENNET
          When she was only fifteen there was a
          gentleman so much in love with her that I
          was sure he would make her an offer.
          However, he did write her some very
          pretty verses.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (IMPATIENTLY)
          And so ended their affection. I wonder
          â¢ who first discovered the power of poetry
          in driving away love?

                         DARCY
          I thought that poetry was the food of
          love.

                         ELIZABETH
          Of a fine, stout love it may. Everything
          nourishes what is strong already. But if
          it is only a thin, slight sort of
          inclination, I'm convinced that one good
          sonnet will starve it away entirely.
          Darcy looks at Elizabeth with surprise. A glimmering of
          interest.

                         DARCY
          So what do you recommend, to encourage
          affection?

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh dancing, of course. Even if ones
          partner is barely tolerable.
          She gives him a dazzling smile. Darcy looks startled. He
          has no idea she heard him. He blushes.

          will persuade me into matrimony, which is
          why I will end up an old maid.

          expect such a compliment.

                         ELIZABETH
          That is one great difference between us.
          Compliments always take you by surprise.
          Well, Mr Bingley is certainly very
          amiable, and I give you leave to like
          him. You've liked many a stupider person.

          his vanity had he not wounded mine. But
          no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak

          description of the ball. Mary is doing some needle work,
          whilst Lydia, Kitty and Jane blearily eat.

                         MRS BENNET
          And then he danced the third with Miss
          Lucas. Poor thing, it is a shame she is
          not more handsome. The fourth with a Miss
          King of little standing. And the fifth
          again with Jane.

          in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

          volatile Bennet household. Darcy is reading the

          Apparently, Lady Bathurst is redecorating
          her ballroom in the French style. A
          little unpatriotic, don't you think?
          Mr Darcy is about to answer when the door opens. A
          footman appears, his face rigid with disapproval.

          Miss Elizabeth Bennet.
          Lizzie comes in, her face flushed, her skirt covered in
          mud. She looks ravishing. Darcy stares at her, then
          quickly rises to his feet. Caroline Bingley, astonished,
          looks her up and down.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Good Lord, Miss Bennet. Have you walked
          here?

          No response.

          Darcy is quietly reading as Bingley paces about
          anxiously. Caroline berates him from the sofa.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Stay!? She is a perfectly sweet girl but
          save being an excellent walker, there is
          very little to recommend her.

                         BINGLEY
          I thought she showed remarkable spirit
          coming all this way.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          The eldest Miss Bennet, as you know, I
          hold in excessive regard and I wish her
          well settled. Though I do fear with her
          families low connections there is little
          chance of it. Their uncle is in trade,
          you know, in Cheapside.

                         BINGLEY
          If they had uncles enough to fill all
          Cheapside it would not make them one jot
          less agreeable.

          22 EXT. GARDEN -- LONGBOURN - DAY. 22

          Mr Bennet is overseeing the gardener who is pruning the
          hedge. Mrs Bennet bustles up. She looks very pleased with
          herself.

                         MRS BENNET
          Well, my dear, its all going according
          to plan. He's half in love with her
          already!

          (a touch disingenuously)
          Who, my sweetest?

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Bingley! And he doesn't mind that she
          hasn't a penny, for he has enough for the
          two of them.
          Suddenly a distant trumpet sounds, dogs bark. The militia
          are arriving. Lydia and Kitty rush past. They are dressed
          up to the nines to greet the officers. Mrs Bennet's face
          lights up.

          â¢ figures.

          23 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 23

          Mrs Bennet and her two daughters rush down the street
          into the village. Dogs bark, children run alongside as a
          regiment of soldiers march through the street. Geese
          scatter; shopkeepers stand in their doorways. The two
          Bennet girls simper at the handsome young soldiers. Mrs
          Bennet, flushed and excited, runs panting behind them.
          Lydia deliberately drops her hankerchief. One of the
          soldiers stands on it. She is appalled.

          Elizabeth is reading a book. Darcy is writing a letter.
          Bingley is sat nervously. Caroline, obviously bored,
          wanders the room looking for distraction. She looks over
          Darcy's shoulder.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

          (without looking up)
          â¢ You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.
          Caroline Bingley lingers, annoyingly.

          How many letters you must have occasion
          to write, Mr Darcy. Letters of business
          too. How odious I should think them!

          It is fortunate, then, that they fall to
          my lot instead of yours.

          Mr Bingley now pacing anxiously around the room.

                         MR BINGLEY
          Its amazing, how young ladies have the
          patience to be so accomplished.

          cushions and play the piano. I never
          heard of a young lady, but people say she
          is accomplished.

                         DARCY
          The word is indeed applied too liberally.
          I cannot boast of knowing more than half
          a dozen women, in all my acquaintance,

          I do.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Absolutely. She must have a thorough
          knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
          dancing and the modern languages, to
          deserve the word. And something in her
          air and manner of walking.

                         DARCY
          And of course she must improve her mind
          by extensive reading.
          Elizabeth closes her book.

          arm and they start walking up and down.

          Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would
          you consider that a fault?

          That I couldn't say.

          For we're trying to find a fault in you.

                         DARCY
          Maybe it's that I find it hard to forgive
          the follies and vices of others, or their
          offences against myself. My good opinion,
          once lost, is lost forever.

          Darcy, exhausted, rides into the stable yard. In the

          puts his head under it and douses himself with cold

          Mrs Bennet, Lydia, Mary and Kitty are introduced to
          Caroline, Bingley and Darcy. Elizabeth holds her breath
          as her mother launches into untold gaucheries.

                         MRS BENNET
          What an excellent room you have sir. Such
          expensive furnishings. I hope you intend
          to stay here, Mr Bingley.

                         BINGLEY
          Absolutely I find the country very
          diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?

                         DARCY
          I find it perfectly adequate even if
          society is a little less varied than in
          town.

                         MRS BENNET
          But I assure you there is quite as much
          going on in the country as there is in
          the town.

                         ELIZABETH
          Indeed Mania, I think Mr Darcy merely
          meant there were not such a variety of
          people to be met in the country as there
          are in town, which you must acknowledge

          It would be an excellent way to meet new

          I think a Ball is a perfectly irrational
          way to gain new acquaintance. It would be
          better if conversation instead of dancing
          were the order of the day.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Indeed much more rational but rather less
          like a ball.

          fire through the doorway. Mr Collins leaves the room and
          takes Mrs Bennet aside to a very discrete conference, out
          of hearing of anyone else.

                         COLLINS
          Mrs Bennet. You do know I have been
          bestowed by the good grace of Lady
          Catherine de Bough a parsonage of no mean
          size.

          â¢ MRS BENNET
          I have become aware of the fact.

          â¢ Well, it.is my avowed hope that soon I
          may find a mistress for it, and I have to
          inform you that the eldest Miss Bennet
          has captured my special attention.
          Collins looks lasciviously into the room.

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Collins, unfortunately it is incumbent
          on me to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet
          is - very soon to be engaged.

                         COLLINS
          Engaged!

                         MRS BENNET
          But Miss Elizabeth next to her in both
          age and beauty would make anyone an
          excellent partner. Do not you agree, Mr
          Collins?
          Mr Collins looks through the doorway at Elizabeth

                         COLLINS
          Indeed. Indeed. A very agreeable
          alternative.

          Elizabeth and Jane are walking towards the house when,
          across the moat, they see Mr Collins come out of the
          house and advance towards them.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh no!
          Mx Collins spots them and darts through a door in the
          garden wall and hurries towards the bridge to meet them.

                         ELIZABETH
          Quick! This way!
          She pulls Jane across the duck board spanning the moat,
          through the house and out the front.
          Mr Collins doubles back and follows them into the house.
          The girls are no-where to be seen. He looks around,
          puzzled.

          We've lost him.
          They slow down to a walk. And then stop. outside the
          milliner's shop the incorrigible Lydia and Kitty are
          chatting to Wickham, the dashing young officer we spotted
          earlier. He is utterly gorgeous - slim, handsome, tousled
          hair. The perfect romantic hero.

                         ELIZABETH
          Kitty? Lydia!
          She and Jane join them.

          They come into the shop. The others go towards the
          counter. Wickham hangs back, and smiles a complicit,
          witty smile at Elizabeth. She colours.

                         WICKHAM
          Though I must warn you, I have very poor

          No, it's true. My rooms in town,

          the world.

          Especially if, like me, one has none.

          is broken by Lydia coming up.

          That depends on what the French have in

          Mr Bingley !
          It is indeed Bingley, riding towards them. He is
          accompanied by Darcy.
          â¢ Bingley jumps off his horse and hurries over to Jane. His
          open, friendly face is filled with delight.

                         BINGLEY
          I was on my way to your house.

          Elizabeth pays no attention to the following
          conversation, instead she is looking at Darcy who, in
          turn, is staring at Wickham. They both obviously
          recognize each other and look very uncomfortable.

          Be sure to invite Mr Wickham.
          Darcy turns and rides off without a word.

          A small cards party is underway. Three tables have been
          set up. Elizabeth, Wickham, Jane, Lydia, Kitty, Charlotte
          and Sir William and Lady Lucas are present. A small
          number of officers and other ladies are also present. We
          move around the tables. Kitty is sat with Sir William and
          Charlotte and Mary. Jane sits at a table with Mr Collins
          and Lady Lucas. Lizzie sits with Lydia and two other
          officers. Lydia flirts outrageously.

          LYDIA.
          We have asked mama if we might have new

          Yes, white, they must be white.

                         LYDIA
          White is the only colour to be worn this
          season.

          So I believe.
          Mr Collins is at a table with Lady Lucas, he glances over
          at Elizabeth, as he talks.

                         COLLINS
          - of course, when you understand that
          Lady Catherine de Bourgh is its
          proprietor you will realise what an
          immense compliment that is. Lady
          Catherine spent eight hundred pounds on a
          chimney-piece alone.
          â¢ Wickham who has been talking to some of the other
          officers comes and sits beside Elizabeth, passing by Mr

          Will you be attending the Netherfield
          ball, Mr Wickham?

          I hope to.

          How long has Mr Darcy been a guest a
          Netherfield?
          Elizabeth pounces on this reference to Mr Darcy and takes
          her chance.

                         ELIZABETH
          About a month. Are you acquainted with,

                         WICKHAM
          Indeed, my fate has been very intimate
          with that gentleman. I have been
          connected with his family since infancy.
          Elizabeth is genuinely surprised, there is a pause while
          she is forced to play her hand.

                         WICKHAM (CONT'D)
          You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet,
          especially given the cold manner of our
          intimacy this afternoon. Are you well
          acquainted with that gentleman?

                         ELIZABETH
          As much as I could ever wish to be. I
          have spent four days in the same house as
          him, and I think him very disagreeable.

                         WICKHAM
          I cannot pretend to be sorry.
          Elizabeth blushes.

          But really I speak out of turn.
          Collins voice breaks the moment.

          As she passes the other tables we follow and witness
          snippets of their conversations.

          singularly pleased with him.

          At the moment she has more suitors than

                         WICKHAM
          Oh no - it is not for me to be driven
          away. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he
          must go not I.
          Pause.

                         ELIZABETH
          I must ask you Mr Wickham, what is the
          manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

                         WICKHAM
          Do you really want to hear?
          Lizzie nods.

                         WICKHAM
          He ruined me.
          She stares at him.

                         ELIZABETH
          How so?

                         WICKHAM
          My father managed his estate. We grew up
          together, Darcy and I. His father treated
          me like a second son. Oh he was the
          kindest of men and bequeathed me the best
          living in his gift, for I had my heart
          set on joining the church. But when he
          died Darcy ignored his wishes and gave
          the living to another man.

                         LIZZIE
          Why did he do that?

                         WICKHAM
          Out of jealousy, for his father loved me
          more than he loved him.

                         LIZZIE
          How cruel! Are you sure?

                         WICKHAM

                         (NODS)
          And out of pride, for he considered me
          too lowly to be worth his consideration.

          0 How could Mr Darcy do such a thing? I
          will discover the truth from Mr Bingley
          at the ball this evening.

                         ELIZABETH
          If it is not true let Mr Darcy contradict
          it himself. But until he does, I hope
          never to encounter him.

          Poor, unfortunate Mr Wickham.

          On the contrary, he is twice the man
          Darcy is.

          And lets hope for you a rather more

          There are hundreds of guests. All the women, roughly two
          hundred, are dressed in white. The men are either in red
          â¢ officer uniform or dressed in black and white. There are
          a number of rooms each occupied by a different activity,
          cards, buffet, women's closet. The final and grandest
          room is the ball room, a swirl of elegant dance.
          The Bennet's enter the first reception room, the girls,
          including Mrs Bennet, are all dressed in white. Mr
          Collins is slightly detained as people pass. Mr Bingley
          bounds up to Jane.

          You're here! I'm so pleased.

          How are you, Miss Elizabeth?
          Elizabeth is not paying attention, instead she is
          searching over Mr Bingleys' shoulder for a sight of
          Wickham.

                         BINGLEY
          Are you, looking for someone?

                         ELIZABETH
          â¢ No, no not at all. Admiring the splendor
          of the ball.

                         JANE
          It is lovely, Mr Bingley.
          Bingley and Jane move off leaving Elizabeth with Mrs
          Bennet and others. While Mrs Bennet talks we focus on
          Elizabeth searching the sea of red coats.

          pleasant gentleman in all my years. Look
          how he dotes on her! Still Jane has
          always done what is best for her family.
          Elizabeth takes this opportunity to slip away into the
          next room. Elizabeth looks around but cannot see Mr
          Wickham. Suddenly she thinks she sees him, so starts to
           a r, move over. The man turns round, it is not Wickham but
           someone else.
           Elizabeth walks nonchanantly into the next room, again
           looking for Mr Wickham. She cranes around trying to see
          â¢ him then she is suddenly surprised by Charlotte Lucas.

          Perhaps he is in the ballroom.
          They both walk into the ball room. We pull back to reveal
          a sea of dancers. Wickham is nowhere to be seen. Jane
          appears and catches Elizabeths arm.

                         JANE
          He's not here. Apparently otherwise
          detained.

          Detained?
          Mr Collins arrives, breathless. He smiles eagerly at
          Elizabeth.

          Oh. I didn't think you danced, Mr

                         MR COLLINS
          I do not consider it incompatible with
          the office of a clergyman to indulge in
          such an innocent diversion.
          Elizabeth tries to smile, politely.

          delicate attentions which is my primary
          object of the evening.
          Elizabeth turns as part of the dance and for a moment she
          dances beside Jane.

                         JANE
          Apparently Your Mr Wickham has been
          called on some business to town, though
          my informer told me he would have been
          less inclined to be engaged had it not
          been for the presence at Netherfield of a
          certain gentleman.
          Jane indicates towards where Darcy stands watching them.

                         ELIZABETH
          That gentleman barely warrants the name.
          The dance leads Elizabeth back to Mr Collins.

          Elizabeth dances face to face with Darcy. Neither can
          speak. They dance for a moment in silence.

          I do love a Sarabande.

                         DARCY
          Indeed. Most invigorating.
          They continue, for a moment, in silence.

                         ELIZABETH
          It is your turn to say something, Mr
          Darcy - I talked about the dance, now you
          ought to remark on the size of the room
          or the number of couples.

                         DARCY
          I am perfectly happy to oblige, please
          advise me of what you would like most to
          â¢ hear.

                         ELIZABETH
          That reply will do for the present.
          Perhaps by and bye I may observe that
          private balls are much pleasanter than
          public ones. But for now we may be
          silent.

                         DARCY
          Do you talk as a rule while dancing?

                         ELIZABETH
          We are each of an unsocial, taciturn
          disposition, unwilling to speak, unless
          we expect to say something that will -
          amaze the whole room, and be handed down
          to posterity with all the eclat of a
          proverb. So a little lubrication to avoid
          embarrassment might be advantageous.

                         DARCY
          I see no striking resemblance of your own
          character in this, how near it is to mine
          I cannot say. (beat) Tell me do you and

          â¢ looks back at Darcy who is dancing with Lydia. He stare
          at Elizabeth as he dances. Elizabeth smiles at her
          current partner in embarrassment.

          Yes, we often walk to Meryton - it is a
          great opportunity to meet new people. In
          fact when you met us we had just had the
          pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.

                         DARCY
          I will admit your Mr Wickham is blessed
          with such happy manners as may ensure his
          making friends - whether he is capable of
          retaining them is less certain.

                         ELIZABETH
          He has been so unlucky as to lose your
          friendship. I remember hearing you once
          say that your resentment once created was
          unappeasable. You are very cautious, I
          suppose, as to its being created?

                         DARCY

          I hear such different accounts of you as

          Mr Collins starts making his way determinedly towards
          Darcy.

          Elizabeth watches from a distance, with acute
          embarrassment, as Collins interrupts Darcy. Darcy does
          not notice him so Collins raises his voice.

                         COLLINS (CONT'D)
          Mr Darcy!
          The room around him stops. Darcy is surprised and turns
          round. In dumbshow we see Darcy is horrified by Collins'
          obsequiousness, during the conversation Collins points
          Elizabeth out to Darcy.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          What interesting relatives you have, Miss
          Bennet.
          Elizabeth walks away into another room.

                         CUT TO:
          The other room, where Mary is singing badly at the piano.
          Elizabeth is horrified. She turns to leave only to see Mr
          Bennet looking on. He winces as Mary misses a high note.
          Mary finishes the song with an off key flourish. Polite
          applause. Mary smiles and prepares for another song.

                         ELIZABETH
          Aren't you going to do something?

                         Â¢

          Mary dear, you've delighted us long
          enough.

                         MARY
          But they asked for another song.
          Mr Bennet shuts the lid.

          Let the other young ladies have a turn.

          Later. Charlotte and Lizzie are sat together.

                         ELIZABETH
          Perhaps my family have made a competition
          to see who can expose themselves to the
          most ridicule.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Well, at least Bingley has not noticed.

          They look over and see Jane and Bingley dancing. Bingley
          clearly besotted by Jane.

                         CHARLOTTE
          But does she like him? There are few of
          us who are secure enough to be really in
          love without proper encouragement.
          Bingley likes her enormously but might
          not do more if she does not help him on.

                         ELIZABETH
          She is just shy and modest. If he does
          not perceive her regard he is a fool.

                         CHARLOTTE
          We are all fools in love. He does not
          know her character as we do. She should
          move fast. Snap him up. There is plenty
          of time for us to get to know them after
          we're married -
          Elizabeth looks over the dancefloor to see Lydia dancing
          with a soldier. she's a little drunk, and very
          flirtatious. He says something; she shrieks with
          laughter.

          Elizabeth sits at the side of the dance-floor. She looks
          at Mrs Bennet dancing in outrageous fashion. Cut to
          later: Lydia is getting more and more leery with a group
          of soldiers, Elizabeth walks away in embarrasment only to
          see Mr Collins smiling at her from across the room. Cut
          to: Elizabeth dancing joylessly with the excruciating Mr
          Collins, as she turns in the dance she sees Darcy look on
          with obvious disdain. Cut to: much later, the band are
          exhausted, guests are leaving. The staff are asleep on
          their feet. Elizabeth almost alone watching her parents
          dancing almost the only people left on the dance floor,
          Kitty is asleep over Elizabeth's lap. This is a never-
          ending nightmare.

          Day light creeps through the curtains. Mrs Bennet is
          sprawled on a sofa. Lydia completely drunk. Kitty asleep.
          Jane sitting demurely. Collins looking longingly at
          Elizabeth. Mrs Bennet is holding court, whilst the
          footmen behind are literally ready to drop. Bingley is
          standing, the perfect host, but obviously willing the
          â¢ Bennets to leave.

          life. Mr Bingley you must have such a
          ball once a month at least.
          Caroline who is standing with her brother, yawns
          ostentatiously.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mother. I really think it is time to go.

                         MRS BENNET
          Don't be impertinent. our hosts are
          perfectly happy with our company, are you
          not, Mr Bingley? I hope I can entice you
          to Longbourn to sample our hospitality.
          We would make sure you had 3 or 4 courses
          at least.
          She holds out her glass for a top up and carries on.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          So tell me Mr Bingley. Whom did you like
          least of all your guests this evening?

                         ELIZABETH
          Really. This is enough.
          Darcy looking down at Elizabeth from a staircase. He
          turns and walks away.

          The Bennet's are squeezed into their carriage. It is
          light outside. Only Mrs Bennet is awake but the lack of
          an audience does not stop her from talking.

                         MRS BENNET
          Allowing for new carriages, dresses
          etcetera, etcetera. We will be having a

          Mrs Bennet I was hoping, if it would
          not trouble you, that I might solicit a
          private audience with Miss Elizabeth in
          the course of the morning.
          Elizabeth is open mouthed.

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh! Yes. Certainly - Lizzy would be very
          happy indeed. Please -- go ahead. No time

          Collins would like a private audience
          with your sister.
          Everyone looks in amazement.

          Wait. I beg you. Mr Collins can have
          nothing to say to me.that anybody need
          not hear.

          No. Nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you-will
          stay where you are. Everyone else, to the
          drawing room. Mr Bennet.

          Mrs Bennet makes sure everyone leaves, winks at Mr
          Collins then shuts the door before Elizabeth has time to
          do anything. Elizabeth looks at Mr Collins who looks at
          her in earnest. There is a horrible pause of intense
          embarrassment.

                         MR COLLINS
          Dear Miss Elizabeth, you can hardly doubt
          the purpose of my discourse. My
          attentions have been too marked to be
          mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the
          house I singled you out as the companion
          of my future life.
          Elizabeth stares at him, astonished.

                         MR COLLINS
          But before I am run away with my feelings
          perhaps I may state my reasons for
          marrying. Firstly, that it is the duty of
          a clergyman to set the example of
          matrimony in his parish.

          â¢ that it is at the urging of my esteemed
          patroness Lady Catherine that I select a

          My object in coming to Longbourn was to
          choose such a one from amongst Mr
          Bennet's daughters, for as you know I am
          next in the entail of the estate and such
          an alliance will surely make amends for
          this.

          assure you in the most animated language

          Elizabeth enters the drawing room. In the drawing room,
          Mary is trying to read, through the family din. Jane sits
          very still. Her face is white. There's a letter in her
          hand. Mrs Bennet charges in, Lydia and Kitty in tow, and
          speaks to anyone who will listen.

          Oh, ungrateful child! I shall never speak
          to her again! Not that I have much
          pleasure in talking to anybody. People

          complaints can have no inclination for
          talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer...
          She jabbers on but her voice fades. We're with Jane, re-
          reading the letter.

          talks to Elizabeth.

          Poor Jane. However, a girl likes to be

          distinction among her companions.

          It's your turn now, Lizzie. Since you've
          turned down Mr Collins you're free to go
          off and be jilted yourself. What about Mr
          Wickham? He is a pleasant fellow and
          would do the job credibly.

                         ELIZABETH
          Thank you, but a less agreeable man would
          satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's
          good fortune.

          I have not heard from Mr Wickham since
          the regiment left for Brighton, but I am
          informed by Lydia who keeps a breast of
          all matters military that he does very

          Elizabeth, Charlotte and Mr Collins walk hurriedly across
          the lawns towards the great house. Beyond the toparied
          hedges the grey building looms ominously above them. It
          is grand without being elegant.

          stops in front of a painting of a devil. She stares at

          Your youngest sisters must be very young.

          Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. But I
          think it would be very hard on younger
          sisters, not to have their share of
          amusement because the elder is still
          unmarried. And to be kept back on such a
          motive! It would hardly encourage
          sisterly affection.

          Mr Darcy!
          An awkward pause.

                         ELIZABETH
          Please, do be seated.

                         (PAUSE)
          I'm afraid Mr and Mrs Collins are gone on
          business to the village.
          A pause. What on earth does Mr Darcy want? He paces up
          and down.

                         DARCY
          This is a charming house. I believe my
          aunt did a great deal to it when Mr
          Collins first arrived.

                         ELIZABETH
          I believe so -- and she could not have
          bestowed her kindness on a more grateful

          Another pause.

                         DARCY
          Mr Collins seems very fortunate in his
          choice of wife.

          the few sensible women who would have
          accepted him.
          Darcy sits down.

                         ELIZABETH
          Shall I call for some tea?

                         DARCY
          No. Thankyou.
          The sound of the front door, and voices. Darcy jumps up.

                         DARCY
          Good day, Miss Bennet. It's been a
          pleasure.
          He bows to her and leaves. Elizabeth sits there, bemused
          and intrigued.

                         CUT TO:
          Charlotte, in the hallway, taking off her bonnet. Darcy
          hurries past her, with a swift bow, and leaves abruptly.
          Charlotte gazes after him in surprise.
          â¢ Charlotte heads to the drawing room where she finds
          Elizabeth sitting, bemused.

                         CHARLOTTE
          What on earth have you done to poor Mr
          Darcy?

          71 EXT. HUNSFORD CHURCH - DAY. 71

          Sunday service is over and worshippers are leaving the "
          church. Mr Collins, in his vestments, obeises himself to
          Lady Catherine, who is sweeping out with her miserable-
          looking daughter and downtrodden governess. Elizabeth
          joins Colonel Fitzwilliam. They walk down the path
          together.

                         FITZWILLIAM

          I do imagine your cousin brought you down
          with him chiefly to have someone to order
          around. I wonder he does not marry and
          secure a lasting convenience of that
          kind.

                         FITZWILLIAM
          She would be a lucky woman.

          Really?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          Darcy is a most loyal companion. From
          what I heard, on our journey here, he
          recently came to the rescue of one of his
          friends just in time.
          Darcy, waylaid by various people, comes out of the
          church. His eyes search for Elizabeth. He sees her with
          Fitzwilliam and hesitates. Too late! Mr Collins steps up
          to him and engages him in conversation. Elizabeth stops,
          at the churchyard gate.

                         ELIZABETH
          What happened?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          His closest friend. Mr Bingley.
          A silence.

                         ELIZABETH
          Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for
          this interference?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          There were apparently strong objections
          to the lady.

                         ELIZABETH
          What kind of objections? Her lack of
          fortune?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          I think it was her family that was
          considered unsuitable.

                         FITZWILLIAM
          I believe so. I know nothing else.
          Elizabeth grows pale. She turns to look at Darcy who is
          joined by his aunt.

                         ELIZABETH
          I wish Mr Darcy and all his friends well
          in finding partners suitable to their
          very high standards. Good morning, Col.
          Fitzwilliam.
          76 Elizabeth see that Collinses are still busy with their 76
          parishioners and slips away. Darcy sees her from a
          distance.

          72 EXT. ROSINGS PARK - DAY. 72

          Lizzie walks across the park - anywhere, she hardly
          cares. She is in a turmoil of misery and fury. How could
          Darcy do such a terrible thing! It starts to rain.

                         CUT TO:
          â¢ A Grecian summer house by the lake. The rain is now
          bucketing down. Lizzie hurries into the summer house and
          sits down, heavily, on a bench.
          Her poor sister; Lizzie gazes in despair at the rain-
          lashed landscape.
          A man approaches, across the park. He draws nearer.
          It's Darcy. Elizabeth stiffens. He's hurrying towards
          her. Sodden, breathless, he comes into the. summer house.
          He is in a state of agitation - far too agitated to
          notice her upset face.

                         DARCY
          Miss Bennet, I have struggled in vain but
          I can bear it no longer ... . The past
          months have been a torment...
          He pauses, unable to speak. Elizabeth stares at him in
          astonishment. He struggles on.

          confusion of feeling. Finally she recovers.

          Might I ask why, with so little endeavour

          for ever, the happiness of a most beloved
          sister?

          face.

          Do you deny it, Mr Darcy? That you
          separated a young couple who loved each
          other, exposing your friend to the
          censure of the world for caprice, and my
          sister to its derision for disappointed
          hopes, and involving them both in misery

          From the first moment I met you, your
          arrogance and conceit, your selfish

          me realize that you were the last man in
          the world I could ever be prevailed upon
          to marry.

          Elizabeth is in the drawing room, she looks at a book on

          walks to the mirror and stares at herself. After a moment
          suddenly Darcy's face appears. She freezes. They stare at
          each other without speaking. Finally...

                         DARCY
          I came to leave you this.
          He places a letter on the table behind her. Elizabeth
          does not turn but watches him through the mirror.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          I'm not going to renew the sentiments
          which were so disgusting to you, but to
          address the two offenses you have laid
          against me. I had not long been in
          Hertfordshire before I saw that Bingley

                         Â¢
          preferred your eldest sister. I observed
          my friend's behaviour attentively and I
          could perceive that his partiality for
          Miss Bennet was beyond what I have ever
          witnessed in him.
          Elizabeth cannot bring herself to look at Darcy. She
          stares at her own reflection as he speaks.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          Yet when I observed your sister .1
          detected no symptom of peculiar regard,
          and witnessed only the families coarse
          appetite for having their daughters
          married favorably. And so in London,
          perhaps erroneously, I persuaded him of
          the unfitness of the match citing your
          sisters coolness towards him.
          We zoom in on Elizabeth's reflection.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          It was unknowingly done and though the
          motives which governed me may to you
          appear naturally insufficient, they were
          done to protect a friend. As to the other

          Pause.

          No. He did not.
          Elizabeth has never felt more alone in the company of her
          sister.

          A ravishing landscape of savage and romantic beauty -
          scudding clouds, mountains, wild rocky outcrops.
          Elizabeth is walking freely, the wind in her hair. As she
          nears the peak of a promontory, Mr and Mrs Gardiner are
          below making their way towards her. They smile at her.
          She strides off determined to reach the very top. When
          she gets there she stands with her arms outstretched, her
          head back laughing into the wind. The view is
          magnificent. She breathes deeply.

          their food.

          Elizabeth is preparing for bed. The chambermaid fills her
          washbowl and starts to leave.

          I'm so glad you changed your mind.
          Elizabeth is alert, her eyes bright with curiosity. The
          parkland is wild and rocky. Deer graze; rooks wheel in
          the sky. A sense of freedom and liberation. As the
          carriage drives over the top of a hill, close on
          Elizabeth's face. She gasps. The Gardiners gasp.
          A huge, wide shot of Pemberley House. It's vast,
          breathtakingly beautiful, set in great boulder-strewn
          park lands. A mansion built of golden stone, glowing in
          the sunlight.

          Elizabeth and the Gardiners are being taken on the tour
          by the housekeeper, Mrs Reynolds, who witters on in the
          background with descriptions of each room. Elizabeth is
          apart and we witness the exquisite house from her point
          of view. A book lies open, on a reading desk, Elizabeth
          turns it over to read the title.

          The huge picture gallery. Elizabeth is apart from the

          Darcy. She looks at it thoughtfully but is interrupted by
          Mrs Reynolds and the Gardiners who are following her.

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          This is my master - Mr Darcy.

          If he should marry, you might see more of
          him.

          Yes madam, but I do not know when that
          will be. I do not know a lady who is good
          enough for him.

                         MRS GARDINER
          What do you mean?

                         Â¢

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          I've known Mr Darcy since he was a boy.
          He was always a kind and generous person
          even then. Not everyone can see it,
          because he does not make a meal of it
          like a lot of young men nowadays. But he
          is the most sweet-tempered and kind-
          hearted man I have ever known.

                         CUT TO:
          As the Gardiners look at more paintings, Elizabeth drifts
          out through the open doors and onto a terrace. In the
          bright sunlight the view of the gardens and valley beyond
          is exquisite. Outside the music we heard before is
          louder.

          92 EXT. TERRACE - PEMBERLY - THE SAME. 92

          Elizabeth wanders aimlessly across the terrace, being
          unconsciously drawn by the music. Suddenly Elizabeth
          recognizes the tune (perhaps it is one she has played
          earlier - but this time it is played exquisitely). She
          follows the music round a corner, intrigued as she gets
          â¢ closer and closer to its source. She finally realizes she
          is outside the room where the music is being played.

          She steals herself a moment, but her curiosity gets the
          better of her and she discretely peeps in.

                         Â¢
          Through the window she sees Georgina Darcy, a beautiful
          fifteen year old playing the piano with great passion and
          fluency. She is moved by the music and listens. After
          sometime, then someone steps into her view but is mostly
          hidden by shadows in the room. He is directly behind
          Georgina and gently puts his hands over her eyes.
          Georgina stops playing and laughs uproariougly. She
          stands and kisses the figure, the sunlight hits his face.
          It is Darcy.
          Georgina and Darcy kiss. Elizabeth is stunned to see him
          there. Darcy glances up and sees Elizabeth watching him.
          For a moment they both stare at each other frozen with
          surprise. Georgina starts in fright at the figure,
          Elizabeth turns and runs. Darcy comes out after her.

                         DARCY
          Miss Bennet!
          Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches
          up with her. They both blush, deeply.

                         ELIZABETH
          I thought you were in London.

          Another ghastly silence. Then they both speak at once.

          A wood. Now she is out of sight Lizzie collapses on a
          log. She is utterly undone. Around her, the birds sing.

          It's that night. Lizzie comes downstairs, for supper. And
          stops. Through a gap in the door to the restaurant she
          sees Mr Darcy talking to her aunt and uncle.

          94 INT. LIBRARY AND DRAWING ROOM -- PEMBERLEY - DAY. 94

          A footman escorts Elizabeth and the Gardiner's through
          the stupendous library. From the drawing room, the sound
          of a piano playing.. It's the same music Elizabeth played
          at Rosings, but this time played very beautifully.
          Elizabeth is filled with trepidation; we can almost feel
          her heart racing.
          The footman opens the double doors to reveal the
          magnificent drawing room. Darcy is there. So is the
          dreaded Miss Bingley. Seeing her, Elizabeth's polite
          smile falters. Darcy's sister Georgiana plays the piano.
          She jumps up and hurries over.

                         DARCY
          My sister, Miss Darcy...
          They smile and bob. Georgiana is a friendly, sweet girl.

                         GEORGIANA
          Miss Elizabeth, my brother has told me so
          much about you. I feel as if we are
          friends already.

          to be rescued. What does Mr Darcy mean by this?
          She moves away, to speak to her uncle. Miss Bingley moves
          closer to Darcy.

          Darcy is driving Elizabeth and the Gardiner's back to
          Lampton. The rugged landscape looks even more beautiful
          and dramatic in the dusk light. Elizabeth sits up with
          Darcy who holds the reins, while Mr and Mrs Gardiner sit
          comfortably in the carriage. Mr Gardiner smiles broadly
          at two large fish that lie beside him.

          Oh there is nothing so bad as parting
          with ones children! One seems so forlorn
          without them.

          That is the consequence of marrying a
          daughter. It must make you better
          satisfied that your other four are
          single.

          113 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 113

          Elizabeth and Jane are out shopping with their mother and
          sisters. Their housekeeper, Mrs Hill, comes out of the
          butchers shop.

                         MRS HILL
          Did you hear the news, madam? Mr Bingley
          is returning to Netherfield.
          A stunned silence. Lizzie glances at Jane. She blushes.

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Bingley?
          Mrs Hill indicates a woman in the butcher's shop.

                         MRS HILL
          Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch Of pork,
          for she expects him tomorrow.

          Tomorrow?

          Not that I care about it. Mr Bingley is
          nothing to us and I'm sure I never want
          to see him again.

                         (MOVES AWAY)
          No, we shall not mention a word about it.

          Is it quite certain he is coming?

                         MRS HILL
          Yes, madam. I believe he is alone; his
          sister remains in town.

                         MRS BENNET
          Huh! Come along, girls.
          Their mother goes into the draper's shop. Jane pauses at
          the threshold.

          It's all right, Lizzie. I'm just glad
          that he comes alone, because then we
          shall see less of him.

                         (BLUSHING)
          Not that I'm afraid of myself, but I
          dread other people's remarks.
          A brave smile. Lizzie, of course, is not convinced in the
          slightest. They go into the shop.

          114 EXT. LONGBOURN -- DAY. 114

          Mr Bingley rides towards Longbourn, a look of slight
          trepidation in his eyes. Darcy now comes into view riding
          along side him. They cross the moat bridge.

          115 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN -- DAY. 115

          Mary is practising her scales. Jane and Elizabeth are
          sitting at their work, with their mother. Kitty rushes
          in.

          fluster.

          Whatever you do, do not appear
          overbearing.
          Kitty looks out through a window.

          Look. There's someone with him. Mr whats
          his name. The pompous one from before.
          Elizabeth looks through the window at Darcy, her heart
          leaps to her mouth.

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Darcy indeed! The very insolence of
          0 0 it. What does he think of coming here?
          Elizabeth returns to her seat and sits down, heavily. Mrs
          Bennet hurries over to Jane and pinches her cheeks.

          Stop that and sit down! Find yourself
          some work! Oh Lord.
          They sit there, frozen, pretending to sew. The drawing
          room door opens and Mrs Hill shows in the two men. They
          bow. Bingley smiles warmly at Jane, who blushes.
          Elizabeth glances at Darcy. His face is strained. Mrs
          Bennet is all smiles for Bingley. She ignores Darcy.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          How very glad we are to see you, Mr
          Bingley! There are a great many changes
          since you went away. Miss Lucas is
          married and settled. And one of my own
          daughters too, you will have seen it in
          the papers though it was not put in as it
          ought to have been. Very short, nothing
          about her family.

          congratulations.

          - but it's very hard to have my Lydia
          taken away from me. Mr Wickham has been
          transferred to Newcastle, where ever that
          is. Thank heaven he has some friends.
          Mrs Bennet shoots a frosty glance at Mr Darcy. This is
          more than Elizabeth can bare.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you hope to stay long in the country,
          Mr Bingley?

          She does indeed. Well, I must be going, I
          suppose. Darcy -
          Darcy cannot quite believe it. He gives Bingley a harsh
          stare, Bingley has not completed his task.

          It was very pleasant to see you all
          again. Elizabeth, Miss Jane..
          Bingley can almost not bear to look Jane in the eye as he
          acknowledges them all very briefly and bolts for the
          door. Mrs Bennet fusses around him.

                         MRS BENNET
          You must come again. For when you were in
          town last winter you promised to take a
          family dinner with us. I have not forgot
          you see. At least three courses.
          Bingley and Darcy take their leave, leaving the Bennets
          sitting in silence all looking at once another. Kitty is
          fit to burst out laughing, Elizabeth and Jane horrified
          by the awkward visit.

          Oh Lizzie, if I could but see you so
          happy. If there were such another man for
          you!
          There is a noise outside.

                         ELIZABETH
          Perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may
          meet with another Mr Collins in time.
          What is that?
          More noise, it sounds like a carriage, then a loud
          banging on the door downstairs. The girls look at each
          other.

          124 INT. DOWNSTAIRS -- LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 12.4-

          Mr Bennet, Mrs Bennet and the girls lit by only candles
          have gathered. The door bangs again.

                         MARY
          Maybe he's changed his mind.
          Timidly, Mr Bennet opens the door revealing a wide-eyed
          Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Everyone gasps.

                         ELIZABETH
          Lady Catherine!
          Lady Catherine does not acknowledge her, but comes in
          uninvited, inspecting the assembled company of aghast
          Bennets.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          (to Mrs Bennet)
          And these are your daughters, I suppose.

          All but one, the youngest has been lately
          married your ladyship. And my eldest was
          only proposed to yesterday afternoon.

          Could I offer you a cup of tea, perhaps?

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Absolutely not! I must speak to Miss
          Elizabeth alone, as a matter of complete
          urgency.
          The Bennets all look at each other", bewildered by this
          strange turn of events.

          Elizabeth leads the way into the drawing room - lights an
          oil lamp. Lady Catherine walks in. The door closes behind
          them.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to
          understand why I am`here.
          â¢ Lit only by the oil lamp Lady Catherine resembles a
          flickering ghoul.

                         ELIZABETH
          Indeed you are mistaken. I can not
          account for this honour at all.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Miss Bennet, I warn you, I am not to be
          trifled with. A report of a most alarming
          nature has reached me that you intend to
          be united with my nephew, Mr Darcy.
          Elizabeth stares at her, amazed.

          LADY CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          I know this to be a scandalous falsehood,
          though not wishing to injure him by
          supposing it possible, I instantly set
          off to make my sentiments known.

                         ELIZABETH
          If you believed it impossible, I wonder
          you took the trouble of coming so far.

          Your coming here will be rather a
          confirmation, surely, if indeed such a
          report exists.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          If? Do you then pretend to be ignorant of
          it? Has it not been industriously
          circulated by yourself?

                         ELIZABETH
          I have never heard of it.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          And can you declare there is no
          foundation for it?

                         ELIZABETH
          I do not pretend to possess equal
          frankness with your ladyship. You may ask
          the questions, which I may not choose to
          answer.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          This is not to be borne. Has my nephew
          made you an offer of marriage?

                         IS

                         ELIZABETH
          Your Ladyship declared it to be
          impossible.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Let me be understood. Mr Darcy is engaged
          to my daughter. Now what have you to say?

                         ELIZABETH
          Only this - if that is the case you can
          have no reason to suppose he will make an
          offer to me.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Oh obstinate girl! This union has been
          planned since their infancy. Do you think
          it can be prevented by a young woman of
          inferior birth, of no importance in the
          world and wholly unallied to his family?
          Whose own sister's elopement resulted in
          the scandalously patched-up marriage,
          only achieved at the expense of your
          uncle? Heaven and earth, are the shades
          of Pemberly to be thus polluted? Now tell
          me once and for all, are you engaged to
          him?

          such an engagement?

                         ELIZABETH
          I will not. And I certainly never shall.
          Allow me to say, the arguments which you
          have supported this extraordinary
          application have been as frivolous as the
          application was ill-judged. You have,
          insulted me in every possible method and
          can now have nothing further to say. I
          must ask you to leave immediately. Good
          night.
          Elizabeth throws open.the door, revealing the family
          outside.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          I have never been thus treated in my
          entire life.
          Lady Catherine storms past the family and out into the
          night. Elizabeth is standing shaking with the excitement
          of having stood so firmly up for herself.

                         MR BENNET
          Lizzie, what on earth is going on?

          Just a small misunderstanding.
          She walks past them to bed.

                         ELIZABETH
          For once in your life. Just leave me
          alone.
          Everyone looks aghast at Elizabeth's reaction.

          Jane is fast asleep. Elizabeth unable to sleep. She
          quietly climbs out of bed and creeps out of the room.

          rise.

          Elizabeth walks out into the open countryside. The mists
          are starting to evaporate. From out of the mist in the
          distance a figure emerges. Her heart misses a beat. She
          is alone, vulnerable. Then she sees it is Darcy.

          Elizabeth hardly knows how to react at this unexpected
          meeting. Rather politely she thanks Mr Darcy.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mr Darcy, I must thank you for your
          unexampled generosity to both my sisters.
          I know what kindnesses you have done for
          poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the
          happy resolution for Jane also.

                         DARCY
          I am alarmed that you know of what I have
          been so in earnest to keep silent. But
          you must know that your happiness was one
          of my prime inducements.
          Elizabeth looks at Darcy.

          DARCY (CONT`D)
          I know you are too generous to trifle
          with me. I believe you spoke with my Aunt
          last night, and it has taught me to hope
          as I had scarcely allowed myself before.
          If your feelings are still what they were
          last April, tell me so at once. My

          love and love you. And never wish to be
          parted from you from this day on.
          Elizabeth looks at him. She does not say a word. Darcy is
          staring at her for a reply. A tear rolls down Elizabeth's
          cheek.

          only have my sentiments changed there are
          no other words which could give me
          greater pleasure.
          Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very,
          very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her
          eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the
          kiss becomes passionate.

          Elizabeth's whereabouts. Through a window we see
          Elizabeth lead Darcy along the duck board plank across
          the moat. Elizabeth enters the house, everybody starts.

          After a while Darcy emerges, he gives Elizabeth the
          briefest of smiles and leaves the door open. Elizabeth
          walks in. Her father is in a state of shock.

          â¢ Very much.
          He looks at her earnestly, searching her face. He loves
          his daughter very deeply. What he sees leaves him in no
          doubt.

                         MR BENNET
          I cannot believe that anyone can deserve
          you, but it seems I am over-ruled. So I
          heartily give my consent.
          Elizabeth jumps up and puts her arms around him.

                         MR BENNET
          I could not have parted with you, my
          Lizzie, to any one less worthy.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh thank you!
          She starts to rush out.

                         MR BENNET
          (calls out after her)

          Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at

          We move through a vast wedding party, following Elizabeth
          and Darcy. We meet all our characters. Lydia and Wickham
          are missing. Let everyone have an end.
          Darcy and Elizabeth kiss, then Darcy pulls Elizabeth off
          into the shadows. We see them disappear into the park.
          Coming close, we see them in the moonlight. It's Darcy
          and Elizabeth. Deer turn to gaze at them. The music fades
          as they walk further from the house, up the hill, past
          the outcrops of rocks. An owl hoots. Darcy turns to
          Elizabeth and smiles.

                         DARCY
          Allow me, Mrs Darcy.
          He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the
          rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by
          side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley.

                         ELIZABETH
          How did it begin?

                         DARCY
          I cannot fix the hour, or the spot, or

                         Â¢
          the look. It was too long ago and I was
          in the middle before I knew it had begun.

                         ELIZABETH
          Now be sincere, did you admire me for my
          impertinenc?

                         DARCY
          For the liveliness of your mind, I did.

                         ELIZABETH
          You may as well call it impertinence,
          though make a virtue of it by all means.
          My good qualities are under your
          protection, and you are to exaggerate -
          them as much as possible. And, in return,
          it belongs to me to find occasions for
          teasing and quarrelling with you as often
          as maybe... and I shall begin directly...
          We draw back-their figures diminish, smaller and
          smaller under the immense, star-spangled sky. . .Fainter
          and fainter, the sound of music and laughter...
