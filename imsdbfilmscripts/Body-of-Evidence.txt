BODY OF EVIDENCE



     

     B O D Y   O F   E V I D E N C E

     by Brad Mirman (second draft)

     --------------------------------------------------------------


     Over the BLACK we hear the SOUNDS of two people making love.  A
     MAN'S VOICE MOANS passionately.


     FADE IN:


     INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

     ANDREW MARSH lies on his back in bed.  He is a frail-looking
     man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair.  On top of
     him is a much younger WOMAN.  Although her back is to us, we
     catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side
     to side.  We see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman.

     She moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched
     back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts.  She reaches
     down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him
     deeper inside her.  They move together -- faster -- and faster.

     The CAMERA slowly begins to PULL BACK.  As it does we see what
     we are watching is on a TELEVISION.

     Further back still.  We see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS
     standing before the television watching the act.

     The CAMERA begins to pan around the room.  Rain streaks down
     the windows of the room -- LIGHTNING flashes outside.  A VIDEO
     CAMERA is set up on a tripod.  More PLAIN CLOTHES POLICE,
     looking, dusting, talking.

     We continue to PAN.  We can now see it is the same room on the
     tape.  ON the bed lies the naked body of ANDREW MARSH, a sheet
     covering his lower torso.  His face is ashen, mouth open, his
     dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare.  The last instant of
     his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain.


     EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

     LIGHTNING fills the night sky.  THUNDER BOOMS overhead.  The
     wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path.
     The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES.  At the
     end is a cul-de-sac.  Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway,
     their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.

     A four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway.  JOHN CARDENAS steps
     out into the rain.  He is a handsome Latin in his thirties,
     with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair.
     He does not run through the rain -- he walks.

     DETECTIVE REESE, a man who looks more like an accountant than a
     homicide detective runs out to meet him.

                                                                 2


                         CARDENAS
               Is it Marsh?

                         REESE
               Yeah.

     Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas' face.  It lasts an
     instant, then it's gone.

                         REESE
               Sir, do you mind if we get out of the
               rain?

     Cardenas doesn't move.  He ignores the question.

                         CARDENAS
               Who found him?

                         REESE
               His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.

                         CARDENAS
               She was here?

                         REESE
               No.  She stopped by to pick up some
               papers.

                         CARDENAS
               Show me.

     Reese starts for the house.  Cardenas looks up into the night
     sky.  A FLASH of LIGHTNING fills the SCREEN.


     INT.  HOUSE, BEDROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA - NIGHT

     Pull back to reveal a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snapping pictures of
     Marsh in bed.

     Cardenas enters followed by Reese.  He moves through the
     FORENSIC and MEDICAL TEAMS.  Anything Cardenas feels about the
     gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of
     indifference.

     Standing by the bed is ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ROGER
     TROXELL, a short, baby-faced man.  Cardenas looks down at the
     body, then over at the MEDICAL EXAMINER, DR. HENRY McCURDY, a
     portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes.

                         CARDENAS
               How long?
                                                                  3

                         MCCURDY
               About three hours.

                         CARDENAS
               Cause?

                         MCCURDY
               Not sure.  I'll have everything you
               need tomorrow.

                         REESE
               Take a look at this.

     Reese points to the nightstand drawer and Troxell opens it.  On
     top of the nightstand is a box of tissues and a bottle of nasal
     spray.  Inside are ROPES, HANDCUFFS and an assortment of SEXUAL
     AIDES.

                         TROXELL
               This guy was into some kinky shit.

     Cardenas looks at the various sexual devices, then walks out of
     the room.


     INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

     JOANNE BRASLOW sits on chair.  Her eyes are tired -- red from
     crying.  She is mid thirties -- attractive, but her looks come
     more from effort than nature -- expensive hair cut -- the right
     cosmetics.  She has a corporate look to her.

     Cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her.

                         CARDENAS
               Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney
               John Cardenas.  You arrived at what
               time tonight?

                         JOANNE
               A little after eleven.

                         CARDENAS
               Why did you come by?

                         JOANNE
               I had some papers to pick up.

                              CARDENAS
                    Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?

                              JOANNE
                    I assume his girlfriend.


                                                                      4

                              CARDENAS
                    Her name?

                              JOANNE
                    Rebecca Lawson.

                              CARDENAS
                    You wouldn't know her address, would
                    you?

                              JOANNE
                    No -- but I can get it for you.

                              CARDENAS
                    Thank you.


          INT.  HALLWAY, CITY HALL BUILDING - DAY

          Cardenas walks down the corridor with McCurdy.

                              MCCURDY
                    Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces
                    of sperm on the sheets.  The
                    toxicology report says there were
                    high levels of cocaine in his blood.

                              CARDENAS
                    What'd he die of?

                              MCCURDY
                    The official cause of death was a
                    cardiac arrest.

                              CARDENAS
                    The official cause?

                              MCCURDY
                    That's what my report will read.

                              CARDENAS
                    But there's more?

          They reach a door and stop.

                              MCCURDY
                    It's speculative at this point.
                    Marsh had advanced Arterial disease.
                    His heart attack was induced by
                    excessive aerobic activity -- in
                    conjunction with the drug.

          McCurdy enters the room.  Cardenas thinks for a moment, then
          follows.


                                                                      5


          INT.  CARDENAS' OFFICE - DAY

          Spacious and sparsely furnished.  The walls are empty.  No
          commendations, plaques or photographs to add prestige to the
          office.  Cardenas steps into the room and looks at McCurdy who
          is already seated next to Reese and Troxell.

                              CARDENAS
                         (to McCurdy)
                    What are you saying, Henry?  That his
                    girlfriend fucked him to death?

                              MCCURDY
                    Yes.

          A trace of a grin shows on Cardenas' face.  He walks over to
          the window and stares outside.  Reese, Troxell and McCurdy wait
          as he thinks.  A beat.  Cardenas turns back to the room.

                              CARDENAS
                    What can we prove?

                              MCCURDY
                    We know Marsh had a head cold.   We
                    found cocaine mixed with water in a
                    nasal spray container on the
                    nightstand.  The coke would contract
                    the nasal membrane the same as any
                    decongestant, but for a much shorter
                    time.  He'd keep using more and more
                    -- never knowing what he was taking.

                              CARDENAS
                    Any prints on the nasal spray?

                              REESE
                    Marsh's and Rebecca Lawson's.

                              TROXELL
                    What if he did know what was in it?
                    A lot of users put it in nasal spray
                    bottles so they can use it in public.

                              MCCURDY
                    Cocaine is the last thing a man in
                    his condition would want.

                              CARDENAS
                    Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the
                    scene?

                                                                      6


                              REESE
                    A man across the street from Marsh
                    saw her drive up about four thirty
                    Sunday afternoon.  And her prints are
                    all over the place.

          Cardenas stands and walks to a DART BOARD on the wall.  He
          gathers the DARTS, moves back and tosses one.

                              TROXELL
                    Marsh's Cardiologist told me that
                    after Marsh was diagnosed with heart
                    disease he quit smoking, quit
                    drinking and started exercising every
                    day.  Does that sound like a guy
                    who'd start shoveling cocaine up his
                    nose?

                              CARDENAS
                    What did he say about Miss Lawson?

                              TROXELL
                    He can remember at least one occasion
                    -- and the receptionist can recall
                    two times when she accompanied Marsh
                    to the office.

          Cardenas throws another dart at the board.

                              CARDENAS
                    So she knew about his heart?

                              TROXELL
                    Had to.  I also interviewed three
                    women who were in past relationships
                    with Marsh.  There's no evidence that
                    he had anything but straight sex
                    prior to meeting Miss Lawson.

                              CARDENAS
                    What about the will?

                              TROXELL
                    That's the best part.  She gets it
                    all -- everything.


          EXT.  CEMETERY - MORNING

          Gray clouds hang over head.  A light drizzle falls.  A GROUP of
          MOURNERS hold umbrellas as they stand around the grave.

          In the b.g. the PRESS is visible, held back my private SECURITY
          GUARDS.

                                                                      7


          A WOMAN dressed in BLACK stands in the front of the MOUNERS,
          her face hidden behind a hat and veil.  RAYMOND SATTLER, a
          tall, distinguished-looking man in his sixties stands beside
          her.  He supports his weight with the aid of a CANE.  The
          service concludes.  Sattler along with several other PEOPLE
          offer her their condolences.  Joanne Braslow is there.  She
          does not go over to Rebecca.

          CARDENAS AND REESE stand off to the side by a large oak tree.
          Cardenas watches and waits.  He steps forward as Sattler leads
          the woman by.

                              CARDENAS
                    Miss Lawson?

          The Woman stops.  Her back is to Cardenas.

                              CARDENAS
                    I'm District Attorney, John Cardenas.

          REBECCA LAWSON removes her hat and veil and slowly turns
          around.  She is in her late twenties.  A deep pain fills her
          face -- controlled, but evident.  Her eyes are tired -- heavy
          from crying -- but no tears show now.  This is a woman whose
          grief is private and not displayed for others.  Although
          emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful.  So
          beautiful that even Cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide
          how impressed he is.

                              SATTLER
                    I don't think that this is the time,
                    or the place.

                              CARDENAS
                    I just wanted to introduce myself and
                    inform Miss Lawson that there will be
                    an inquiry.

                              SATTLER
                    An inquiry into what?

                              CARDENAS
                    For starters I'd like to know why she
                    left the house and didn't report the
                    death?

                              SATTLER
                    Because he wasn't dead when she left,
                    and even if he was, not reporting a
                    natural death in a timely fashion
                    isn't a crime.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did I say it was a natural death?

                                                                      8


          Cardenas and Rebecca lock eyes.  Rebecca stares at him
          genuinely shocked by his accusation.  Cardenas nods and walks
          away.  In the b.g. we see Joanne staring at Rebecca with
          hostility.


          INT.  HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Large and homey.  A fire roars in the fireplace.  FRANK DULANEY
          sits on his couch as he goes over some PAPERWORK.  He is mid-
          thirties, powerful, self-assured.

          SHARON DULANEY enters.  She is an attractive woman in her early
          thirties.  She kisses him on the cheek then pushes his
          PAPERWORK aside and sits down on his lap.

                              SHARON
                    You're on vacation, remember?  You're
                    supposed to be relaxing.

                              DULANEY
                    I am relaxing.

                              SHARON
                         (pushing the papers
                          aside)
                    This is not relaxing.

                              DULANEY
                         (playfully)
                    Really?

                              SHARON
                    Really.

                              DULANEY
                         (playing along)
                    And I suppose you're going to show me
                    how to relax?

                              SHARON
                    If you want me to.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm always open to learning new
                    things.

          She kisses him -- soft, gentle kisses.  Dulaney puts his arms
          around her and kisses her harder.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm beginning to see what you mean.
                    Why don't we go upstairs and work on
                    the advanced course?

                                                                      9


                              SHARON
                    I can't.  I've got to finish a
                    counter offer on the Bergman
                    property.

          The moment is passing by.  A trace of frustration shows on
          Dulaney's face -- this is obviously not a new occurrence.

                              DULANEY
                    Can't it wait?

                              SHARON
                    No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.

          The moment is gone.  Dulaney forces an understanding smile.  He
          looks towards the door and sees his EIGHT YEAR OLD SON,
          MICHAEL.

                              DULANEY
                    Hey, Slugger.  Ready for bed?

          Michael walks over to this parents.

                              MICHAEL
                    Uh huh.

          The PHONE RINGS.  Dulaney answers it.

                              DULANEY
                         (into phone)
                    Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?...
                    Well, I was sort of planning on...
                    Alright... Okay, goodbye.
                         (hangs up; to Sharon)
                    That was Sattler.  He thinks the
                    D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca
                    Lawson.  He wants me in the office
                    tomorrow morning.

                              SHARON
                    We're supposed to go to the lake.

                              DULANEY
                    I know.  What can I do?  He is the
                    boss.

                              SHARON
                    He could let you have your vacation.

                              MICHAEL
                    Dad -- is it true what they're saying
                    about that Miss Lawson Lady?


                                                                      10

                              DULANEY
                    What are they saying?

                              MICHAEL
                    The kids at school say she humped Mr.
                    Marsh to death.

                              DULANEY
                    Hey, you know better than that.  What
                    did I teach you to say when someone
                    is accused of doing something?

                              MICHAEL
                    She allegedly humped him to death?

          Dulaney grins.  Sharon is fighting the temptation to laugh.

                              SHARON
                    I swear -- the both of you.
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Some example you set.

                              DULANEY
                         (imitating her)
                    Some example you set.

          He makes a funny face at Michael who LAUGHS and makes one back.
          Dulaney grabs him and starts TICKLING him.  Michael SCREAMS
          with LAUGHTER as he tries to tickle him back.  Dulaney then
          starts TICKLING SHARON -- Michael helps him.  Sharon ROARS with
          LAUGHTER and falls to the floor.  The three of them roll around
          LAUGHING hysterically.


          INT.  SATTLER'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Sattler sits on a couch sipping a cup of coffee.  Dulaney sits
          across from him.

                              DULANEY
                    Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man.
                    A trial like this is going to put
                    Cardenas in the spot-light.

                              SATTLER
                    We've already got press arriving from
                    over the country and she hasn't even
                    been charged yet.
                    Cardenas wants to see her in his
                    office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you
                    to go with her.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm supposed to be on vacation.


                                                                      11

                              SATTLER
                    I know -- but she wants you to
                    represent her if Cardenas files.

                              DULANEY
                    Why?

                              SATTLER
                    Because I told her you were the best
                    criminal attorney we have.

                              DULANEY
                    Raymond, I'm the only criminal
                    attorney you have.

                              SATTLER
                         (jokingly)
                    Well, I guess that makes you the
                    best.
                         (candidly)
                    Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit
                    three million dollars.  As executors
                    of the estate and her attorneys that
                    could generate a lot of legal fees
                    for us.  All I'm asking you to do is
                    talk to her.

          Dulaney thinks about it for a moment.

                              DULANEY
                    Alright, I'll talk to her

                              SATTLER
                    She's waiting in the conference room.

          Dulaney stands and walks towards the door.

                              SATTLER
                         (continuing)
                    You know, I knew Andrew Marsh for
                    almost twenty years -- or thought I
                    did.  What do you think would make a
                    man in his condition do the things he
                    did?

          Dulaney stops at the door and looks back.

                              DULANEY
                    I think the question is:  What is it
                    about her that made him want to do
                    it?



                                                                      12

          INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Rebecca is seated at the end of the conference table smoking a
          CIGARETTE.  Sunlight flows through a window and highlights her
          hair.  She is dressed in a fashionable business suit that
          clings to every curve of her body.

          Dulaney enters the room.  When he sees her he can't help but
          stare.  Rebecca notes his gaze.

                              DULANEY
                    Miss Lawson, I'm Frank Dulaney.

          She raises the cigarette to her lips.  Dulaney notices despite
          her outward composure her hand is shaking.

                              REBECCA
                         (nervously)
                    Are you going to represent me?

                              DULANEY
                    There are no charges against you. I'm
                    here to decide if I'm going to
                    represent you should that occur.
                         (beat)
                    Did you kill him?

          Rebecca appears hurt by the question.

                              REBECCA
                    You don't waste any time, do you?

          Dulaney doesn't answer.  He studies her -- his eyes probing
          hers.

                              REBECCA
                         (continuing)
                    Do you think I did it?

                              DULANEY
                    I don't know.  That's why I'm asking
                    you.

                              REBECCA
                    You must have some feeling.  Some
                    immediate impression.  A young,
                    attractive woman, involved with an
                    older man who leaves her everything
                    in his will.  And the things that
                    went on in that house.  Such wild
                    sex.  What kind of picture does that
                    paint?

                              DULANEY
                    Not a very good one I'm afraid.

                                                                      13


                              REBECCA
                    And that's exactly what the jury will
                    see when they look at me.  That's why
                    I need a very good lawyer, Mr.
                    Dulaney.

                              DULANEY
                    You're assuming the District Attorney
                    is going to file charges.

          Rebecca's anxiety begins to surface.  She feigns a weak smile.

                              REBECCA
                    He'll file.  He's an ambitious man.
                    Ambitious men build their careers on
                    the bodies of others.

                              DULANEY
                    You still haven't answered my
                    question.

          She takes a long drag of her cigarette before answering.  She
          looks at Dulaney.  Displaying emotions is not something that
          comes easily.  Tears well up in her eyes.

                              REBECCA
                         (emotionally)
                    I loved him.  A big part of my life
                    has been torn away from me, Mr.
                    Dulaney.  A part I can never get back
                    -- and on top of that people are
                    saying that I am somehow responsible
                    for it.  They've taken everything
                    that is good and caring about two
                    people in love and made it dirty.

          A single tear streams down her check.  She knows what he wants
          to hear her say -- and she resents having to say it.

                              REBECCA
                    No -- I didn't kill him.


          INT.  HALLWAY, D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY

          Cardenas walks down the hall, sipping a cup of coffee.  Troxell
          walks towards him excitedly.  They walk together.

                              TROXELL
                    I think I'm going to make your day.

                              CARDENAS
                    How?


                                                                      14

          Troxell points to an Office.  Through the glass partition we
          can see a MAN sitting at a table.  ALAN PALEY is a well-groomed
          man in his thirties who makes every effort to look good.

                              TROXELL
                    I've got this guy in my office.
                    Doctor Alan Paley.  Wait until you
                    hear what he has to say.

          Cardenas and Troxell enters the room.  Cardenas shakes hands
          with Paley and listens with great interest as he starts to
          talk.


          INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney and Sharon are in bed.  Dulaney reads some PAPERS.
          Sharon finishes reading her MAGAZINE.  She puts it on the
          nightstand and looks at Dulaney.

                              SHARON
                    How can Cardenas possibly think he
                    can build a case against two
                    consenting adults?

                              DULANEY
                    He must have something or he wouldn't
                    be pressing so hard.

                              SHARON
                    If he files are you going to take the
                    case?

                              DULANEY
                    I don't know yet.  I want to hear
                    what she says at her statement
                    tomorrow.

                              SHARON
                    What's she like?

                              DULANEY
                    Attractive.  Bright.  Distant.
                    Charming when she wants to be.

          Dulaney's description seems to bother her.

                              SHARON
                    She sounds like quite a woman.

                              DULANEY
                         (joking)
                    Yeah -- but can she cook?

          Sharon hits him on the arm playfully.

                                                                      15


                              SHARON
                    The whole thing gives me the creeps.
                    I mean -- what if she really humped
                    him to death?

          Dulaney grins at her choice of words.

                              DULANEY
                    Humped

                              SHARON
                         (grinning)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    I can think of worse ways to go--

          Dulaney rolls over, gathering her up in his arms.

                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    --and speaking of humping.

          He reaches over to the nightstand and turns off the LIGHTS.


          EXT.  CITY HALL BUILDING MORNING

          As Dulaney and Rebecca walks up the steps they are engulfed by
          a CROWD of REPORTERS.  Dulaney puts his arm around Rebecca and
          ushers her through the crowd.


          INT.  CARDENAS' OFFICE - MORNING

          Dulaney and Rebecca sit on one side of a table.  Reese stands.
          Cardenas sits at his desk.

                              REBECCA
                    I didn't know that Andrew was dead
                    until Mr. Sattler called me at home
                    that night.

                              REESE
                    We have a witness who saw you go into
                    the house at four thirty.

                              DULANEY
                    She's not denying she was there.

                              REESE
                    Did you have sex?


                                                                      16

                              REBECCA
                    Yes.

                              REESE
                    What time did you leave?

                              REBECCA
                    Six thirty -- and he was very much
                    alive.

                              CARDENAS
                    Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?

                              REBECCA
                    I have.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you use it the night Marsh died?

                              REBECCA
                    No.  I haven't done it in years.

                              REESE
                    Did Marsh use it?

                              REBECCA
                    No -- never.

                              REESE
                    It had to get there somehow.

                              REBECCA
                    It didn't get there from me.

                              CARDENAS
                    Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart
                    condition?

                              REBECCA
                    No.

                              CARDENAS
                    Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his
                    nurse have told us that you
                    accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office
                    on at least two occasions.

                              REBECCA
                    That's correct -- but Andrew never
                    told me he had a heart condition.  He
                    said he had a heart arrhythmia and it
                    was nothing serious.

                              REESE
                    He never mentioned his heart disease?

                                                                      17


                              DULANEY
                    She just said that.

                              REESE
                    Why do you think he lied to you?

                              DULANEY
                    That's something only Marsh would
                    know.

                              REESE
                    I think Miss Lawson knew it too.  I
                    think she slipped him the coke and he
                    popped his cork giving her the high-
                    hard-one.

          Dulaney's anger shows.  He stands.

                              DULANEY
                    That's it.  My client doesn't have to
                    take this crap from you.

                              CARDENAS
                    Sit down, Frank.

                              DULANEY
                    No.  Miss Lawson came in here
                    voluntarily to answer your questions.
                    She doesn't have to sit here and be
                    insulted.  So, either you charge her
                    now or we're leaving.

          A beat.  Dulaney and Cardenas lock eyes.  Cardenas shrugs his
          shoulders.

                              CARDENAS
                    Fine.

          Dulaney motions for Rebecca to get up.  She stands and they
          walk to the door.  Reese looks at Cardenas.  Cardenas nods.

                              REESE
                    Rebecca Lawson, you're under arrest
                    for the murder of Andrew Marsh.

          Rebecca is stunned -- frightened.  She looks at Dulaney in
          disbelief.  Dulaney looks at Cardenas angrily.  Reese removes
          his handcuffs as he moves towards Rebecca.

                              REESE
                    You have the right to remain silent.
                    If you give up--


                                                                      18

                              CARDENAS
                         (to Reese)
                    I don't think the handcuffs will be
                    necessary.  You can finish giving
                    Miss Lawson her rights outside.

          Reese grabs Rebecca by the arm and leads her to the door.  She
          looks back at Frank, her face filled with fear -- her eyes
          welling with tears.

                              REBECCA
                         (frightened)
                    Frank!

                              DULANEY
                    I'll have you out in a few hours.

          Reese ushers her through the door.  A beat.  Dulaney and
          Cardenas are left alone.  Cardenas starts fishing through a can
          of NUTS, carefully extracting the cashews.  Dulaney continues
          to stand.

                              DULANEY
                    Lookin' to make the papers, John?

                              CARDENAS
                    Marsh left her close to three million
                    dollars in his will.  That's motive.
                    She admits to being there the night
                    of his death.  That's opportunity --
                    and her fingerprints are on the nasal
                    spray bottle.

                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    You can't show intent.

          Cardenas looks at Dulaney wryly.  He knows that Dulaney is
          trying to discover his game plan.  Cardenas looks into his can
          of nuts and fishes for another cashew.

                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    Can you?

                              CARDENAS
                    Take your pole out of the water,
                    Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.

                              DULANEY
                    You're bluffing.  John, it's me,
                    remember?  I've known you since your
                    name was Juan Carlos.

          Cardenas doesn't appreciate Dulaney mentioning his real name.

                                                                      19


                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    C'mon -- think about it.  If she was
                    going to kill Marsh why leave the
                    nasal spray bottle there for the
                    police to find?

                              CARDENAS
                    She planned this.  She wanted us to
                    find the nasal spray.

                              DULANEY
                    Why would she want that?

                              CARDENAS
                    Because she's clever.  Because she
                    knows that even if we didn't find it
                    we'd have suspicions as to why a man
                    in Marsh's condition would use
                    cocaine.

                              DULANEY
                    Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions
                    aren't enough for a conviction.

                              CARDENAS
                    The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's
                    nasal membranes showed no sign of
                    prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal
                    spray we would have still treated it
                    as a poisoning.  We would have looked
                    for motive and the trail would have
                    still led back to her.

                              DULANEY
                    I don't buy it and neither will a
                    jury.

                              CARDENAS
                    We're going all the way on this one,
                    Frank.  Tell your client she has
                    until the prelim to cop a plea for
                    murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.

                              DULANEY
                    I'll tell her but she won't take it.

                              CARDENAS
                    Then she's not as smart as I thought
                    she was.  You've seen her in the
                    depositions.  Tell me you don't have
                    any doubts?


                                                                      20

                              DULANEY
                    She's innocent.

                              CARDENAS
                    Aren't they all?

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the
                    blindfolded lady with the scales
                    decide that.

          Dulaney gets up slowly and leaves.


          INT.  CITY JAIL, BOOKING COUNTER - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney waits at the counter.  A barred door slides open and
          Rebecca is led out by a WOMAN JAILER.  Even in these
          surroundings she maintains her composure.  She walks to the
          counter and waits silently.


          EXT.  CITY HALL BUILDING - AFTERNOON

          As Dulaney and Rebecca leave they are once again encircled by
          REPORTERS, screaming questions, asking them to verify Rebecca's
          arrest.  Dulaney plows through the crowd with Rebecca in tow.


          EXT.  RIVER - AFTERNOON

          Gray clouds hang overhead, threatening rain.  Tall birch trees
          line the river, the color of their leaves hinting that autumn
          is approaching.  Dulaney and Rebecca walk along a jogging path
          cut along the bank.

                              DULANEY
                    I want you to know right now that the
                    trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex
                    life is going to be dragged through
                    the mud.  They're going to say that
                    you enticed Marsh -- led him down a
                    dark path.

                              REBECCA
                    Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was
                    a very passionate man.  He was eager
                    to explore.  I gave him what he
                    wanted.  We fulfilled each others
                    needs.

                              DULANEY
                    This is a very small town -- people
                    here have very straight views on sex.


                                                                      21

                              REBECCA
                    I'm used to being on the outside
                    looking in.  The same men who will
                    publicly profess their moral outrage
                    for my sexual tastes are the same
                    ones who privately rest their sweaty
                    little hands on my legs and talk
                    about weekend trips together.

                              DULANEY
                    Those same men will be sitting on the
                    jury.

                              REBECCA
                    I am who I am.  I can't deny it,
                    anymore than you can deny who you
                    are.  I like sex different -- I like
                    it wild.  That's not a crime.
                         (emotional)
                    I loved Andrew.  We made love
                    together.  We made it differently,
                    but we still made love.  It was our
                    way.  It was private -- and now the
                    whole world wants to look in through
                    the pretense of justice.  If I was
                    some middle-aged divorcee who screwed
                    him once a week do you think this
                    would be happening to me?

          She stops walking and stares out over the River.

                              REBECCA
                    Have you ever seen animals make love,
                    Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion
                    -- such savage emotion.  They
                    struggle, and snarl, and claw, but
                    neither hurts the other.  Not really.

                              DULANEY
                    No pain, no gain?

                              REBECCA
                    Something like that.

                              DULANEY
                    We're not animals.

          As Rebecca speaks, Dulaney seems captivated.


                                                                      22

                              REBECCA
                    Of course we are.  Our primal urges
                    are still there -- but we've taken
                    sex and intellectualized it, refined
                    it down to its most essential
                    components.  It's bland, easy,
                    mechanical.  There's great passion in
                    the struggle -- such craving in
                    denial.  Do you know what it's like
                    to yearn for something?  I'm not
                    talking about wanting, or needing.
                    I'm talking about an urge so deep
                    that your skin burns and every cell
                    in your body pulses with desire?

          Dulaney appears moved by the passion of her words -- but he's
          uncomfortable by it and quickly pushes it aside.

                              DULANEY
                         (awkwardly)
                    I think we're getting a little off
                    the subject here.

                              REBECCA
                    I thought the subject was sex?

                              DULANEY
                    As it pertains to you -- not me.
                         (beat)
                    Did you always know you had
                    different... tastes?

                              REBECCA
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    How?

                              REBECCA
                    I don't know if it's something I can
                    explain to you.

                              DULANEY
                    Why not?

                              REBECCA
                    Because -- it's beyond intellect.
                    It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has
                    to be experienced -- it can't be
                    imagined.

                              DULANEY
                    Try.

          Rebecca thinks for a moment.

                                                                      23


                              REBECCA
                    When I was growing up we had a
                    strawberry patch in our backyard. So
                    did this family down the road.  I
                    used to sneak in their yard and steal
                    their strawberries.  It wasn't easy.
                    The stone walls were high and I'd
                    scrape my knees as I climbed over.
                    On the other side were wild rose
                    bushes.  The thorns would dig into my
                    legs and cut my thighs as I lowered
                    myself down.

                              DULANEY
                    If you had what you wanted at home
                    why did you sneak into their yard?

                              REBECCA
                    Because -- somehow the fruit always
                    tasted that much sweeter because of
                    the pain it took to get to it.

          Dulaney appears lost in her words.  This isn't lost on Rebecca.
          She walks off.  Dulaney stares after her intrigued.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - EVENING

          A light rain falls outside.  Dulaney picks at his food.  He
          stares out the window.  He seems oblivious to the conversation
          between Sharon and Michael.

                              MICHAEL
                    Albert's got the stomach flu.

                              SHARON
                    That's too bad.

                              MICHAEL
                    No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.

                              SHARON
                    Michael, you shouldn't be happy when
                    someone else isn't feeling well.

                              MICHAEL
                    Not even if they're a dork?

                              SHARON
                    Not even if they're a dork.  You
                    should go by and see how he's
                    feeling.


                                                                      24

                              MICHAEL
                    No way.  Jerry Milner stopped by and
                    Albert puked right in front of him.

          Sharon tries to suppress a grin.

                              SHARON
                    Don't use language like that at the
                    dinner table.

                              MICHAEL
                    Sorry.

          Sharon looks at Dulaney.  He is still staring out the window,
          deep in thought.


          INT.  DEN - EVENING

          Dulaney is at his desk, looking at PHOTOGRAPHS of Marsh and the
          bedroom.  Sharon enters.

                              SHARON
                    Frank -- I know you're busy, but
                    Michael asked me after dinner if you
                    were angry with him.  He wanted to
                    know why you weren't talking to him.

                              DULANEY
                    I'll talk to him later.

                              SHARON
                    Why don't you talk to him now?

                              DULANEY
                    Because I go to trial in seven weeks.
                    I've got a lot of preparing to do.

                              SHARON
                         (angry)
                    No one's asking you not to work.  I
                    just think you could make some time
                    for your son.


          INT.  MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - EVENING

          Michael lies on his bed, doing his homework.  The door opens
          and Dulaney enters and sits beside him.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm sorry if it looks like I'm not
                    paying attention to you lately.


                                                                      25

          Michael looks at Dulaney somewhat confused.  Dulaney tries to
          explain it another way.

                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    You know how it is sometimes when
                    you're out playing ball with your
                    friends?  How you're really
                    concentrating on what you're doing --
                    and you lose track of time and you
                    come home late and Mom yells at you?

                              MICHAEL
                    Yeah.

                              DULANEY
                    Well, that's kind of how I am right
                    now.

                              MICHAEL
                    Is Mom yelling at you too?

          Dulaney grins.

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah -- a little.

          Dulaney leans over and hugs Michael.

                              DULANEY
                    I love you.

                              MICHAEL
                    I love you too, Dad.


          INT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - MORNING

          CHARLIE BIGGS is a tall, wiry black man.  Street-wise, but
          basically good humored.  He is tossing a NERF BALL through a
          basketball hoop mounted on the wall as Dulaney enters.

                              BIGGS
                    How you doin' Mister D?

                              DULANEY
                    Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the
                    Marsh case?


                                                                      26

                              BIGGS
                    Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real
                    dog and pony show going on up there -
                    -  I'll tell you, sometimes white
                    people are a real puzzle to me.  I
                    mean, did this old guy really think
                    he was gonna be able to keep up with
                    a sweet little number like that?

                              DULANEY
                    It could've happened to anyone.

                              BIGGS
                         (ghetto accent)
                    I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever
                    heard of no brother dying from
                    gettin' too much pussy.

          Dulaney grins in spite of himself.

                              DULANEY
                    We have to find out who else would
                    profit from Marsh's death -- and who
                    knew enough about his personal life
                    to know that putting cocaine in the
                    nasal spray would be fatal.

                              BIGGS
                    So -- where do we start?

                              DULANEY
                    I want you to hit all the dealers in
                    town.  Give them a list of people
                    close to Marsh and see if any of them
                    use.  Then I want you to check out a
                    Doctor Alan Paley.  He lives up in
                    Roseburg.

          Dulaney's SECRETARY'S VOICE crackles over the intercom.

                              SECRETARY (VO)
                    Mister Dulaney, I have Rebecca Lawson
                    on one.

          Dulaney picks up the phone.

                              DULANEY
                         (on the phone)
                    Hi... No, I don't... One o'clock is
                    fine... Alright La Brasa... Bye.

          Dulaney hangs up.  Biggs is staring at him with a grin.

                              BIGGS
                    La Brasa?

                                                                      27


                              DULANEY
                         (defensive)
                    I'm taking a client to lunch.  Where
                    should I go, Taco Bell?

          Biggs tosses the ball to Dulaney, then raises his hands
          indicating he is backing off.  He leaves.  Dulaney shoots from
          his desk.  SWOOSH!


          INT.  RESTAURANT - DAY

          Dimly lit.  Dark wood and leather.  Dulaney sits at a table
          with Rebecca.  She removes a CIGARETTE and holds it, waiting
          for Dulaney to light it.  Dulaney fumbles through his pockets
          and removes a book of MATCHES.  He lights one.  Rebecca doesn't
          lean forward to meet him.  He must go to her.  She looks into
          his eyes as she cups her hand over his.  A beat.  She lights
          the cigarette and takes a drag, then arches her neck back and
          blows a stream of smoke towards the ceiling.  SHE DOES NOT BLOW
          OUT THE MATCH OR REMOVE HER HAND FROM DULANEY'S.  She watches
          him as it burns down towards his fingers.  After a long moment
          she leans in and sensually blows out the match and releases his
          hand.

                              DULANEY
                    How'd you meet Marsh?

                              REBECCA
                    I was at a cocktail party.  Very
                    trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on
                    business.  He had broken his wrist
                    the week before and was wearing it in
                    a sling.  He looked so helpless.

          A FOURSOME a few tables away are staring at her.  Rebecca sees
          them.

                              DULANEY
                    -- And then?

                              REBECCA
                    We started talking.  In fact, we
                    talked until four in the morning.  We
                    discovered we shared a lot of the
                    same interests.  After that we were
                    together all the time until he left.
                    He used to call me every night after
                    he came back.  Then after a few weeks
                    he invited me to come visit him.
                    I've never left.

                              DULANEY
                    Why didn't you live together?

                                                                      28


                              REBECCA
                    Andrew was worried about how it would
                    look.

          A COUPLE in a booth are looking at Rebecca and whispering.
          Rebecca and Dulaney notice them.

                              REBECCA
                    Can we get out of here?

                              DULANEY
                    Sure.  Where to?

          Rebecca stands up.  She doesn't answer.  She just walks off.


          EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney pulls up in his car behind Rebecca's.  They get out.
          Dulaney follows her as she walks to the door.

                              DULANEY
                    This is your house.

                              REBECCA
                         (walking towards the
                          door)
                    I know.

          Dulaney stops.

                              DULANEY
                    I don't think this is a good idea.

          Rebecca stops and turns towards him.

                              REBECCA
                    Why not?

                              DULANEY
                    Because, I'm your attorney.  I
                    shouldn't be going to your house.

                              REBECCA
                    Is it against the law?

                              DULANEY
                    No -- it just doesn't look right.

          Rebecca stares at him for a moment, then looks down the street
          to her left and back to her right, then back at Dulaney.

                              REBECCA
                    No one's looking.

                                                                      29


          She walks to her front door and opens it.  She enters, leaving
          the door open.  Dulaney waits for a moment, then follows.


          INT.  REBECCA'S, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney enters.  Rebecca is standing in the middle of the room.
          Her back is to Dulaney, but she knows he is there.  Dulaney
          looks around the room.  He stares at a group of PHOTOGRAPHS on
          the wall.  On the other WALL is a GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN.

          DULANEY'S POV - OF THE WALL

          filled with EROTIC PAINTINGS AND PHOTOGRAPHS -- sensual but not
          vulgar.

          Rebecca walks over and stands very close to him as he studies
          the artwork.

                              REBECCA
                    What do you think?

                              DULANEY
                    I think the photographer's probably a
                    voyeur.

                              REBECCA
                    I'm the photographer.

                              DULANEY
                    Oh -- Well, they're different.

                              REBECCA
                    That's not an answer.

                              DULANEY
                    It's not my taste.

                              REBECCA
                         (seductively)
                    Tastes can change.

          Rebecca looks up to the top of a high cabinet.  Sitting on top
          of the cabinet is a WHITE PERSIAN CAT.

                              REBECCA
                    There you are.

          She stands on her tip toes as she reaches up.  Dulaney watches
          her -- the arch of her back -- the hem of her skirt rising up
          her legs.  She lowers the cat down and walks to a chair and
          sits down.  The slit of her dress opens revealing her thighs.
          Dulaney's eyes trace along them.  Rebecca notes his gaze.


                                                                      30

                              REBECCA
                    What are you thinking?

          Dulaney looks up quickly.

                              DULANEY
                    Nothing.

                              REBECCA
                    Not true.  Shall I tell you what you
                    were thinking?  You were wondering if
                    I was wearing anything under my
                    skirt.

          The fact that he doesn't protest confirms that she is right.
          She runs her finger lightly along her thighs.

                              REBECCA
                    I am.

          Dulaney walks to the window and stares out.  Rebecca seems
          amused.  She puts the cat down and walks over to him.

                              REBECCA
                    Sorry.  I wasn't trying to embarrass
                    you.

          He slowly turns towards her.

                              DULANEY
                    Yes you were.

          Dulaney stares at her for a moment, then places his briefcase
          on the table and opens it.


          INT.  RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON STRAWBERRIES - NIGHT

          A fork digs into a large strawberry.  PULL BACK as we follow
          the strawberry into Sharon's mouth.

          Dulaney sits across from Sharon.  His eyes are on the
          strawberries.  His mind is someplace else -- and it isn't hard
          to guess where.

                              SHARON
                    --he said it might be too expensive
                    to add another room.  He suggested we
                    might convert the garage into a guest
                    room.  He's going to check with the
                    contractor and let me know.  I'll let
                    you know how much and we can decide.
                    Alright?


                                                                      31

          Dulaney looks up slowly.  It is not so much that he has heard
          the question -- it is more that he is aware that Sharon has
          stopped talking.  A beat.  Sharon isn't sure he has heard her.

                              SHARON
                    Is that alright, Frank?

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be
                    right back.

          He stands and leaves the table.


          INT.  RESTAURANT, HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Dulaney walks to a PAY PHONE near the bathrooms.  He thinks for
          a moment, then dials a number.  Rebecca answers.

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    Hello?

                              DULANEY
                    Hi.  It's Frank.

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    Hi, Frank.

                              DULANEY
                         (awkwardly)
                    I just wanted to see if my secretary
                    called to confirm your appointment
                    tomorrow.

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    Yes -- she did.

                              DULANEY
                    Great.  I'll see you at the office at
                    nine.

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    No -- not at the office.  I've got a
                    better idea.


          EXT.  CABIN, KLAMATH LAKE - AFTERNOON

          An old wood cabin set on the shore of the lake.  Dulaney and
          Rebecca get out of the car and walk towards it.

                              REBECCA
                    I figured if we have to talk all day
                    we might as well do it someplace
                    nice.

                                                                      32

                         (looks at the cabin)
                    Isn't it beautiful?

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah.

                              REBECCA
                         (sadly)
                    Andrew loved this old cabin.
                         (fondly remembering)
                    He always dreamed about moving to
                    Tahiti -- living in a hut and
                    becoming a beach-bum.
                         (a sad smile)
                    I could never imagine myself doing
                    that -- but somehow when he talked
                    about it, he made it sound so alive -
                    - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes
                    and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the
                    world and it's problems behind.  I
                    wish he'd had a chance to do it.

          Her mind drifts away for a moment, locked on some distant
          memory.

                              REBECCA
                         (snapping out of it)
                    Sorry.

                              DULANEY
                    It's okay.


          EXT.  LAKE, FURTHER - DUSK

          Dulaney and Rebecca walk along the shore.  A soft wind blows
          through her hair.

                              DULANEY
                    Tell me about Doctor Paley?

                              REBECCA
                    I hardly know him.  He wanted me and
                    he couldn't have me.

                              DULANEY
                    It's going to be hard to convince a
                    jury that he's testifying against you
                    in a murder trial because you blew
                    him off.

                              REBECCA
                         (confidently)
                    It won't be that hard.


                                                                      33

          She walks off.


          EXT.  CABIN - DUSK

          Dulaney and Rebecca sit on an old porch swing.

                              REBECCA
                    Did you always want to be a lawyer?

                              DULANEY
                    No -- I wanted to be a professional
                    hockey player.

                              REBECCA
                    Really?

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah.

                              REBECCA
                    That seems so far away from who you
                    are now.  What happened?

                              DULANEY
                    I broke my ankle skating.  That ended
                    that dream.

                              REBECCA
                    It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't
                    it?  To let go of what you want?

          Dulaney stares at her -- she looks beautiful in the warm light
          of the setting sun.  Their eyes meet.  He starts to lean in
          towards her -- then stops.  He gets up and walks away.


          EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - EVENING

          Rebecca's car pulls up in front.  Dulaney gets out.

                              REBECCA
                    I'm going to put the car away.  You
                    can let yourself in.  There's a key
                    under the flower pot.

          Rebecca drives to the rear of the building.  Dulaney walks to
          the door.  He lifts the FLOWER POT -- removes a KEY -- opens
          the door and goes inside.

          ANGLE - DOWN THE STREET

          Detective Reese is parked in his car, watching the house.  He
          glances at his watch, then makes a note in his note pad.


                                                                      34


          INT.  REBECCA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

          Rebecca walks over to the STEREO and turns on the CASSETTE
          PLAYER.  The room fills with soft, sexy MUSIC.  Dulaney stands
          in the middle of the room -- his eyes following her every move.

                              REBECCA
                    Yes -- it would be nice.

                              DULANEY
                    What would?

                              REBECCA
                    You and me -- making love.

                              DULANEY
                    Is that what you think I was
                    thinking?

                              REBECCA
                    No -- that's what I know you were
                    thinking.

          Before Dulaney can start to protest she continues.  She slowly
          walks behind him.  Dulaney stares straight ahead.

                              REBECCA
                    How often do you make love to your
                    wife, Frank?  Once a week?  Sometimes
                    twice?  There once was passion,
                    wasn't there?  But now it's bland,
                    predictable.  Tell me, when you do it
                    -- do you always think of her?  Or do
                    you wonder what it would be like to
                    be with someone else?  Someone wild.
                    Someone who would force you to lose
                    control.

          Her words strip his thoughts bare.  He is vulnerable.

                              REBECCA
                         (continuing)
                    There's nothing wrong in admitting
                    that you want me, Frank.

                              DULANEY
                    You take a lot for granted.

          Dulaney starts for the door.  Rebecca's cool exterior fades,
          giving way to her vulnerable side.


                                                                      35

                              REBECCA
                    Please stay, Frank.  I don't want to
                    be alone.  I don't expect anything
                    from you -- no demands -- no
                    complications.  I just need to feel
                    close to someone.

          Dulaney turns back towards her.  A beat.  He thinks for a
          moment, then walks back into the room.  Rebecca smiles warmly,
          invitingly.

                              REBECCA
                    I'll be back in a minute.  Help
                    yourself to a drink.

          She disappears down the hall.  Dulaney stands were he is,
          wondering what he is doing there.  He walks over to the BAR and
          pours a SCOTCH.  He looks down the hall.

          HIS POV - REBECCA'S BEDROOM

          The bedroom door is open.  The room is DARK -- Lit only by the
          moon.  Rebecca slowly pulls her sweater off over her head.
          MOONLIGHT washes over her body, SILHOUETTING her.  She runs her
          hands lightly over her stomach -- working her way up to her
          round, full breasts.  She stops for a moment -- and we sense
          she knows Dulaney is watching her.

          Dulaney stares at her -- mesmerized.  He knows he should turn
          away, but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look.

          One by one Rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans, revealing
          her sheer, white panties.  She bends forward slightly and
          slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles -- then steps out of
          them.

          We can see the desire on Dulaney's face.  He looks away.  The
          conflict inside him grows.  He looks back.

          Rebecca walks into the hall.  She is barefoot --  wearing a
          long, slinky dress -- her eyes catch Dulaney's.  If she wasn't
          aware he was watching her before -- she is now.  It doesn't
          seem to bother her.  She moves towards him slowly -- her eyes
          inviting his.

          Dulaney moves towards her.  They meet in the middle of the
          room.  She waits -- he moves closer -- so close that he can
          smell her.  She cranes her neck back, subtly tempting him to
          bring his lips to hers.  The longing overcomes him.  He kisses
          her lightly -- the kiss lingers for a moment, then she grabs
          him forcefully by the hair, arching his head back.  She bites
          his lip.


                                                                      36

                              REBECCA
                         (whispering)
                    My way.

          Dulaney ignores her.  He tries to kiss her again.  She turns
          her head away.

          She walks down the hall into the bedroom and closes the door.
          Dulaney follows.  He tries the door -- it's locked.  He starts
          to knock -- stops -- turns and walks back into the living room.
          He starts to leave -- stops.  He looks at the bedroom door.
          His passion builds -- his hunger for her devours him.  He moves
          quickly down the hall -- eyes filled with determination.  He
          breaks the door open with his shoulder.

          Rebecca is standing in the center of the room -- as if waiting
          for him.  He moves to her.  She can see the fire in his eyes.
          He takes her in his arms -- kisses her neck feverishly --
          feeding his craving for her.

                              REBECCA
                    My way.

          He is lost within her now and doesn't hear her.  She pulls his
          hair, jerking his head back.  Her eyes command him to follow
          her demand.

          Something in him snaps -- a new door opens.  He pushes her back
          onto the DRESSING CABINET.  He kisses her, running his hand up
          her thighs, hiking up her dress.  She wraps her legs around his
          waist.  They move along the cabinet -- knocking jars and
          bottles to the floor.  He lifts her -- carries her to the bed -
          - lays her down and rips her dress from her body.  Their
          passion is unleased.  They grope and claw for one another
          hungrily.  She pulls his shirt off and bites him on the
          shoulder.  His face tenses from the pain, but he MOANS with
          pleasure.


          INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dark.  Sharon is asleep.  The door opens and Dulaney enters
          quietly.  He walks towards the bathroom.


          INT.  DULANEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney splashes a handful of water across his face.  He
          unbuttons his shirt and takes it off -- wincing as he does.  He
          turns his back to the mirror.  Several deep FINGERNAIL SCRAPES
          are dug into his back.  He looks at himself in the mirror.



                                                                      37

          INT.  HALLWAY, LAW OFFICES - MORNING

          Dulaney and Biggs walk down the hall to a water cooler.  Biggs
          pours himself a glass.

                              BIGGS
                    Before you ask there's nothing new on
                    the coke.

                              DULANEY
                    You've got to get me something I can
                    use, Charlie.

                              BIGGS
                    I'm trying.

          Sattler walks over with another MAN.  He ignores Biggs.

                              SATTLER
                    Frank -- this is Harvey Willows from
                    the L.A. Times.  He'd like to ask you
                    a few questions.

                              MAN
                    It's an incredible story going on
                    here.
                         (as if quoting a
                          headline)
                    Woman accused of using sex to kill
                    lover.

                              BIGGS
                    I'll say -- it's gonna give a whole
                    new meaning to the state nickname.

          Biggs LAUGHS and walks off.  Sattler glares at him.  Dulaney
          smirks.

                              MAN
                         (confused)
                    What's the state nickname?

                              DULANEY
                         (dryly)
                    The Beaver State.


          EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

          Rows of new Town Houses line the street.  Dulaney drives up and
          walks towards the front door of one of them.  He KNOCKS.
          JOANNE BRASLOW answers.  She stares at Dulaney innocently.



                                                                      38

          INT.  JOANNE'S TOWN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Sparsely decorated.  Very trendy.  High tech furniture and
          designer lights.  Joanne sits on the couch -- Dulaney on one of
          the chairs.  There is COFFEE on the table.

                              JOANNE
                    I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years.
                    He was a good man -- until she came
                    along.

                              DULANEY
                    What changed?

                              JOANNE
                    He did.  Look, I know you can lead a
                    horse to water but you can't make him
                    drink -- but you hold a pail of water
                    in front of an old horse for long
                    enough  -- and well...

          Joanne stops as emotion fills her.  Her eyes well with tears.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't really believe what the
                    district attorney is saying about
                    Miss Lawson, do you?

                              JOANNE
                    I don't know.  It's incredible to
                    think that anyone could be capable of
                    doing that -- but if anyone could it
                    would be Rebecca.

                              DULANEY
                    I take it you don't like Miss Lawson
                    very much?

                              JOANNE
                    I really don't know her that well.
                    We would say hello to each other when
                    I would come to the house, but that
                    was about it.

                              DULANEY
                    If you don't know her that well what
                    makes you think she's capable of
                    murder?

                              JOANNE
                    Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but
                    he was thirty years older than her.
                    Where's the attraction to sleep with
                    someone like that -- to have the kind
                    of sex they had.

                                                                      39


                              DULANEY
                    How do you know what kind of sex they
                    had?

                              JOANNE
                    I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole
                    if that's what you're thinking.  I'd
                    come to house sometimes to pick up
                    papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find
                    their little toys all over the place.

                              DULANEY
                    Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?

                              JOANNE
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    What about Miss Lawson?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes -- cocaine.

          Dulaney is shocked by this.

                              DULANEY
                    How do you know that?

                              JOANNE
                    I was at the house one morning -- I
                    thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with
                    Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the
                    guest bathroom she was standing in
                    front of the mirror pouring this
                    white powder out of a vial.

          Dulaney looks like he's been kicked in the stomach.

                              JOANNE
                    Is something wrong.

          A beat.  Dulaney looks at her slowly.
                              DULANEY
                    What?  No -- nothing.  Thank you for
                    your time.

          He gets up and walks to the door.  Joanne stands and stares
          after him with a trace of a grin.


          INT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - DAY

          Rebecca opens the front door and Dulaney barges into the room.

                                                                      40


                              DULANEY
                    You lied to me!

                              REBECCA
                    What?

                              DULANEY
                    I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told
                    me she saw you doing cocaine at
                    Marsh's house!

                              REBECCA
                    She's mistaken.

                              DULANEY
                         (Yelling)
                    That's not good enough, Goddamit!

                              REBECCA
                    It isn't true.  You have to believe
                    me.

                              DULANEY
                    No, I don't have to believe you.  The
                    jury has to believe you and answers
                    like he's lying or she's mistaken
                    aren't going to convince them.

                              REBECCA
                    I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she
                    says she saw me doing it she's lying.

                              DULANEY
                    Why would she lie?

                              REBECCA
                    I don't know, Frank -- but don't you
                    think that's something we should find
                    out?

          Dulaney is confused, struggling to decide if he believes her.


          INT.  LAUNDRY ROOM, DULANEY HOUSE - DAY

          Sharon is getting a load of washing ready.  She picks up one of
          Dulaney's tee shirts and notices several thin stripes of BLOOD
          near the shoulder.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

          RAIN falls.  Dulaney enters the room to find Michael on the
          PHONE.  Dulaney appears nervous -- anxious.

                                                                      41


                              DULANEY
                    Michael -- get off the phone.

                              MICHAEL
                    Why?

                              DULANEY
                         (impatiently)
                    Because I'm expecting a call.

                              MICHAEL
                    -- But it's Sunday.

                              DULANEY
                         (snapping)
                    I know what day it is!  Get off the
                    phone.

                              MICHAEL
                         (hurt; into phone)
                    I gotta go.  I'll call you later.

          Michael hangs up and leaves the room.  Dulaney stares at the
          phone -- struggling against himself.  He picks it up and dials.

                              REBECCA'S VOICE
                    This is Rebecca Lawson.  I'm not in
                    right now.  So if you please leave a
                    message--

          Dulaney slams down the phone.  He checks his watch.


          INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney wears another tee shirt as he sleeps.  Sharon is awake,
          staring up at the ceiling.  A beat.  She rolls over and
          carefully lifts up Dulaney's tee shirt.  She sees the scratches
          on his back.  She does not wake him.  She just lays there, deep
          in thought.


          INT.  HALLWAY, COURTHOUSE - MORNING

          Rebecca walks down the hall.  In the b.g. we see Dulaney
          walking quickly to join her.

                              DULANEY
                    I called you all weekend.  Where were
                    you?

                              REBECCA
                    I went out on the boat.


                                                                      42

                              DULANEY
                         (concerned)
                    Alone?

                              REBECCA
                    Of course.


          INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING

          The gallery is crowded with REPORTERS and SPECTATORS.  Dulaney
          sits beside Rebecca at the defense table.  Cardenas stands
          before the jury.

          Dulaney and Cardenas are seated at their respective tables.
          Rebecca sits beside Dulaney.  She is wearing a beautiful, well
          tailored dress.  She looks beautiful and has surprisingly made
          no attempt to down-play her looks.

          JUDGE BURNHAM, a confident BLACK MAN in his fifties sits behind
          the bench.  He is strong-willed -- tough but fair.  There is a
          rough edge to him from his childhood on the streets.


                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    This trial by its very nature is
                    explosive.  The press is going to
                    have a field day and I will not
                    tolerate any activity in my courtroom
                    that will fuel it.
                         (to Dulaney and
                          Cardenas)
                    Both of you are going to be delving
                    into very personal aspects of peoples
                    lives.  I warn you now.  When you do
                    so -- if you cannot establish a clear
                    line of relevancy early on in your
                    examinations I will stop you.  Is
                    that clear?

          Dulaney and Cardenas both nod.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Cardenas.

          Cardenas stands and walks towards the JURY.

                              CARDENAS
                         (points to Rebecca)
                    You all can see the defendant,
                    Rebecca Lawson.  But as this trial
                    proceeds you will see that she is not
                    only the defendant -- she is the
                    murder weapon itself.

                                                                      43

                         (stops and thinks for
                          a moment)
                    Is that possible?  Can a person
                    actually be a weapon?  The answer is
                    yes.  If I hit you and you die -- I
                    am the cause of your death.  But can
                    sex be called a weapon?  Yes.  And
                    what a deadly weapon Rebecca Lawson
                    made of it.  The State will prove
                    that Miss Lawson seduced Andrew Marsh
                    -- that she put increasing sexual
                    demands on him while she secretly
                    administered cocaine.  All the while
                    knowing that he had a severe heart
                    condition.
                         (beat)
                    She is a beautiful woman -- but when
                    this trial is over you will see her
                    no differently than a gun, or a knife
                    or any other instrument used as a
                    weapon.  She is a killer.  And the
                    worst kind -- one who disguised
                    herself as a loving partner.

          Cardenas walks back to the prosecution table and sits down.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney?

          Dulaney stands up and approaches the jury.

                              DULANEY
                    I know what you're thinking -- and
                    it's a mistake.  You look at Miss
                    Lawson and you see a beautiful woman
                    who was involved with an older man --
                    and you think she looks like the
                    type.  She could've done it.  And
                    that's exactly what the District
                    Attorney wants you to think.  Yes,
                    she is beautiful.  So what?  Does
                    that make her a killer?  Of course
                    not.  This case is not about
                    appearances.  It's about facts.
                         (beat)
                    As Mr. Cardenas presents his case you
                    will see that there are very few
                    facts -- that the bulk of the States
                    evidence is circumstantial.  I'm
                    confident that by the conclusion of
                    this trial you will not just have a
                    reasonable doubt.  You will have no
                    doubt at all --  that Rebecca Lawson
                    is innocent of the charges against
                    her.

                                                                      44



          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER - DAY

          McCurdy is on the witness stand.  Cardenas stands before him.

                              CARDENAS
                    Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of
                    death?

                              MCCURDY
                    A massive cardiac arrest.

                              CARDENAS
                    What was Mr. Marsh's physical
                    condition prior to his death?

                              MCCURDY
                    Very poor.  He was suffering from
                    severe arterial disease.

                              CARDENAS
                    Was the heart attack the result of
                    natural causes?

                              MCCURDY
                    No.

                              CARDENAS
                    What induced it?

                              MCCURDY
                    We found a high concentration of
                    cocaine in his blood.

                              CARDENAS
                    So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?

                              MCCURDY
                    I don't think so.  The membrane in
                    his nasal passage didn't show any
                    sign of long time usage.

                              CARDENAS
                    Then how did it get into his body?

                              MCCURDY
                    We found a bottle of Dristan nasal
                    spray on the nightstand.  It was
                    filled with water and cocaine.  Mr.
                    Marsh had a head cold at the time of
                    his death.  I believe he wasn't aware
                    that he was ingesting cocaine.


                                                                      45

          Cardenas holds up a bottle of NASAL SPRAY in a PLASTIC BAG.  He
          brings it over to McCurdy.

                              CARDENAS
                    Is this the bottle that was found on
                    the nightstand?

                              MCCURDY
                         (examines it)
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor, the State enters this
                    evidence as exhibit A.
                         (to McCurdy)
                    Were any fingerprints found on the
                    bottle?

                              MCCURDY
                    Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb
                    print of Miss Lawson's.

                              CARDENAS
                    Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to
                    someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?

                              MCCURDY
                    Increase his heart rate.

                              CARDENAS
                    -- And if he were in the midst of
                    making love while under the influence
                    of cocaine?

                              MCCURDY
                    It would be an added stress to his
                    heart.

                              CARDENAS
                    What would be the effect if someone
                    secretly administered cocaine to Mr.
                    Marsh and then induced him to make
                    love?

                              MCCURDY
                    It would be the same as shooting a
                    gun at him.

                              CARDENAS
                    Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Your witness.


                                                                      46

          Rebecca looks at Dulaney for his opinion of McCurdy's
          testimony.  Dulaney gives her a reassuring glance before he
          stands up and approaches McCurdy.

                              DULANEY
                    Can you say with any certainty that
                    Mr. Marsh didn't ingest the cocaine
                    himself?

                              MCCURDY
                    No -- but it seems highly unlikely
                    that a man in his condition would use
                    cocaine.

                              DULANEY
                    That's your opinion, Doctor -- but
                    I'm asking you if there is any
                    scientific test that can tell who
                    actually put the cocaine into the
                    Dristan bottle?

                              MCCURDY
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Thank you.


          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER - DAY

          Cardenas stands before DOCTOR TRAMMEL, a thin, pasty-faced man
          in his fifties.

                              CARDENAS
                    Doctor Trammel, when did you first
                    diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart
                    disease?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    About a year and half ago.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle
                    after that?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    Yes -- he stopped smoking and
                    drinking and exercised regularly.

                              CARDENAS
                    He did everything he could to take
                    care of his heart?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    Yes.

                                                                      47


                              CARDENAS
                    Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr.
                    Marsh to your office?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Just one last question.  What does
                    the sign on your office door say?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.

          Cardenas walks back to his seat, signaling his examination of
          the witness is over.  Dulaney stands.

                              DULANEY
                    Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to
                    Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's
                    condition?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he
                    had spoken to Miss Lawson about his
                    illness?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr.
                    Marsh inside during his examinations?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Then you have no way of knowing what
                    Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the
                    reasons for his visits?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    No.  No, I don't.


          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER - DAY

          Joanne Braslow is on the stand.  She is wearing a smart
          business suit and large-framed glasses.  Her hair is pulled
          back tight.  Cardenas stands before her.

                                                                      48


                              CARDENAS
                    How long were you Mr Marsh's personal
                    secretary?

                              JOANNE
                    Six years.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use
                    Cocaine?

                              JOANNE
                    No -- never.

                              CARDENAS
                    What about Miss Lawson?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Tell the court about that, please.

                              JOANNE
                    I opened the bathroom door one day
                    and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine
                    out of a vial.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before
                    his death?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    How did he look?

                              JOANNE
                    Horrible.  He was tired and pale.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you talk about Miss Lawson?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did Mr. Marsh say?


                                                                      49

                              JOANNE
                    He was worried.  He said that she was
                    acting stranger and stranger.  He
                    said that if this kept up she was
                    going to kill him.  That his heart
                    couldn't take it.

          There is an audible BUZZ from the crowd.  For the first time
          Rebecca's confident exterior seems to fade and is replaced with
          genuine concern.

                              CARDENAS
                    Thank you.
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Your witness.

          Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney gets up slowly and walks towards
          Joanne.

                              DULANEY
                    How do you know it was cocaine that
                    Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?

                              JOANNE
                    What other kind of white powder do
                    people keep in a vial?

                              DULANEY
                    Do you remember the date when you saw
                    Miss Lawson in the bathroom?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes--
                         (thinks a moment)
                    It was on a Friday.  I remember
                    because I was going to visit my
                    sister for her birthday.  It would be
                    October twenty-eighth.

                              DULANEY
                    Could you repeat the last part of
                    what Mr. Marsh said to you the day
                    before his death?

                              JOANNE
                    He said that if it kept up she was
                    going to kill him.  That his heart
                    couldn't take it.

                              DULANEY
                    Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that
                    Miss Lawson felt bored here and was
                    thinking about going back to Chicago
                    for awhile?


                                                                      50

                              JOANNE
                    Yes -- he mentioned it.

                              DULANEY
                    So, the woman he loved passionately
                    was thinking about leaving.  That
                    must cause tremendous anxiety.
                    Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.

                              JOANNE
                    I suppose.

                              DULANEY
                    So, isn't it possible that he was
                    confiding in you about the pain he
                    was feeling about losing what might
                    be his last chance for love?  That
                    what he really was saying was that
                    the uncertainty of her leaving was
                    driving him crazy and if it didn't
                    stop it was going to kill him.  That
                    if she did leave his heart couldn't
                    take it.

          THE JURY waits anxiously for her answer.

          Joanne fidgets in his chair as she thinks.  She appears
          confused.

                              JOANNE
                    I don't know.  I'm not sure.

                              DULANEY
                    Well, think about it.  Isn't it
                    possible?

                              JOANNE
                         (begrudgingly)
                    Yes.  I suppose it's possible.

          Cardenas leans back in his seat frustrated.  Rebecca breathes a
          sigh of relief.


          INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

          Quiet and desolate -- most of the city employees have left for
          the day.  Dulaney walks towards the back of the lot with
          Rebecca.

                              REBECCA
                    You were brilliant today.

                              DULANEY
                    It's only the beginning.

                                                                      51


                              REBECCA
                    Strong endings start with strong
                    beginnings.
                         (growing excitement)
                    I love the way you twist what people
                    say around --  manipulating their own
                    words against them.

          They reach Rebecca's car.

                              DULANEY
                    Can I see you later?

                              REBECCA
                    You can see me now.

          Rebecca presses against him, raising her knee gently into his
          groin -- as she kisses him passionately.  Dulaney is lost in
          her kiss for a moment, then breaks it off and looks around.

          Rebecca smiles -- takes off her shoes and stands on the hood of
          her car.  She takes one of the shoes and hits the PARKING LOT
          OVERHEAD LIGHT FIXTURE.  The BULB breaks sending the area in
          darkness.

                              DULANEY
                    What are you doing?

          She steps down and kisses him again.  For a moment he tries to
          resist.

                              REBECCA
                    I want you inside me.

          His desire fills him.  He pushes her back onto the hood of her
          car, hiking up her dress with his hands, as she reaches down
          and unbuttons his pants.


          INT.  REBECCA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The room is dimly lit.  Dulaney is in bed.  He appears to be
          deep in thought.  Rebecca enters wearing a sheer, silk bathrobe
          and carrying a tea service on a tray.  He places it on the bed
          and sits beside him.

                              REBECCA
                    Something wrong?

                              DULANEY
                    Paley could be a problem tomorrow.


                                                                      52

                              REBECCA
                    I'm sure you'll be able to handle
                    him.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm glad you have such confidence in
                    me.

                              REBECCA
                    Don't worry about Paley.  He can't
                    touch me.  No one can.  I've thought
                    it all out.

                              DULANEY
                         (sits up; very
                          concerned)
                    What does that mean?  You've been
                    thinking about the case?  Or you
                    thought everything out before you
                    killed Marsh?

          The question hurts Rebecca -- it shows on her face.  She looks
          away from him.  A beat.  Dulaney thinks.  He feels bad for
          asking such a question.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm sorry.
                         (she doesn't look at
                          him)
                    Rebecca -- I'm sorry.  Really.

          He takes her hand.  She slowly looks at him and smiles.  She
          points to the tea service.

                              REBECCA
                    Sugar or honey?

                              DULANEY
                    Honey.

          She lifts a PLASTIC BOTTLE of HONEY and starts to pour it into
          a cup.  She stops and smiles seductively at Dulaney, then parts
          her bathrobe and slowly draws a liquid line with it along her
          thigh.  She reaches out -- grabs him by the hair and gently
          pulls him forward.  He kisses her knee and slowly runs his
          tongue along her thigh, following the trail upwards.  She
          arches her back -- closes her eyes -- breathes deeply from the
          pleasure of his touch.


          INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dark.  The door opens -- light from the hall streaks into the
          room.  Sharon is asleep.  Dulaney enters quietly.  He watches
          her.  He looks over at the nightstand.

                                                                      53


          HIS POV

          A PHOTOGRAPH of Dulaney and Sharon on vacation.  Dulaney is
          carrying her on a beach.  He is wearing a LARGE SOMBRERO.  They
          are both laughing.
          Dulaney looks back at Sharon.  He is a man lost within himself.
          He walks to the bathroom.  Sharon opens her eyes and stares at
          him.


          INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING

          Court is in session.  Cardenas stands.

                              CARDENAS
                    The State calls Doctor Alan Paley.

          Doctor Paley stands and walks towards the witness stand.

          CARDENAS AND PALEY - MOMENTS LATER

          Paley has been sworn in.  Cardenas examines him.

                              CARDENAS
                    Where did you meet Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    At a dinner party -- about eight
                    months ago.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you ever see her again after
                    that?

                              DR. PALEY
                    Yes -- several times.

                              CARDENAS
                    What eventually happened to your
                    relationship with Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    We stopped seeing each other.

                              CARDENAS
                    Why?

                              DR. PALEY
                    Well -- I realized that she wasn't
                    interested in me.  She was just
                    trying to get information out of me.


                                                                      54

                              CARDENAS
                    What kind of information?

                              DR. PALEY
                    She said that she was working on a
                    novel and she wanted to know what
                    kinds of drugs would be harmful to
                    someone with a bad heart.

          WHISPERS from the crowd fill the room.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you suggest any?

                              DR. PALEY
                    Yes -- Insulin and others.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did she say?

                              DR. PALEY
                    She said that those weren't any good
                    -- because their use would be
                    detected and the police would know
                    the victim had been poisoned.  She
                    wanted to know if there was a drug
                    that would induce a heart attack but
                    could also be used to enhance a
                    sexual high.

                              CARDENAS
                    -- And what did you suggest?

                              DR. PALEY
                    Cocaine.

          More GASPS from the crowd.  Rebecca's remains calm, but her
          eyes glare at Paley hatefully.

                              CARDENAS
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Your witness.

          Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney approaches Paley with a smile.

                              DULANEY
                    Dr. Paley, where were you the last
                    time you saw Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    We had dinner at a restaurant.


                                                                      55

                              DULANEY
                    Isn't it true that later that night
                    you tried to force yourself on Miss
                    Lawson in the parking lot?

                              DR. PALEY
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    You didn't grab her and try to kiss
                    her?

                              DR. PALEY
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    If necessary I can bring in the valet
                    parking attendant and two customers
                    who witnessed the occurrence.

          Paley thinks for a moment.  He is nervous.

                              DR. PALEY
                    Well -- as I remember it, we had an
                    argument.

                              DULANEY
                    And the argument was about the fact
                    that you wanted to be romantically
                    involved and she did not.

                              DR. PALEY
                         (hesitantly)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    And after that didn't you
                    continuously harass Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    No.

          Dulaney walks back to his desk and removes a TAPE PLAYER from a
          cardboard box.

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss
                    Lawson's answering machine.  I would
                    like to play it now.

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know
                    where this tape is from.  Who made it
                    -- or under what circumstances it was
                    made.

                                                                      56


          Dulaney takes out two pieces of PAPER and approaches the bench.

                              DULANEY
                    These are reports from two
                    independent audio labs.  They each
                    state that the voices were recorded
                    over the phone and that no
                    alterations have been made.

          Judge Burnham studies the paper.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    I'll allow it.

          Dulaney walks back to his desk and presses the PLAY BUTTON.  We
          HEAR a BEEP, then...

                              DR. PALEY'S VOICE
                    Rebecca -- I know you're there,
                    Godammit.  Answer the phone, you
                    bitch!  You can't treat me like this!

          We HEAR a PHONE slam down.  Another BEEP.

                              DR. PALEY'S VOICE
                    You want to play games with me?  Who
                    the fuck do you think you are? Okay -
                    - we'll play.  You'll be sorry.

          Dulaney stops the machine.  He takes a dramatic pause, letting
          the words on the tape sink in.

          Cardenas is dismayed and tries to hide his frustration.
          Dulaney approaches Paley who is now very nervous.

                              DULANEY
                         (quoting)
                    You'll be sorry?

                              DR. PALEY
                    I was angry.

                              DULANEY
                    You're still angry, aren't you?
                    Isn't it true that your whole story
                    is nothing more than a vindictive
                    attempt on your behalf to get back at
                    Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    No -- she asked me about cocaine.

                              DULANEY
                    I suggest it never happened.

                                                                      57


                              DR. PALEY
                         (angrily)
                    You can suggest anything you want.
                    It happened.

                              DULANEY
                    No further questions.

          Dr. Paley's temper explodes.  He is a loose cannon.

                              DR. PALEY
                    I may have been infatuated with her -
                    - but I wouldn't perjure myself.

                              DULANEY
                    That's all Dr. Paley.


          INT.  REBECCA'S BEDROOM - EVENING

          RAIN FALLS, streaking along the bedroom windows.  CANDLES light
          the room.  Dulaney and Rebecca are on the bed.  She sits on top
          of him, writhing back and forth -- lost in the rhythm of their
          love making.

          CLOSE ON DULANEY - LATER

          He is asleep, laying on his back -- the sheets pulled up to his
          waist.  LIGHTNING FLASHES outside -- a CLAP of THUNDER follows.
          He stirs and wakes up.

          HIS POV

          Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING illuminates Rebecca, who is standing
          over him in a sexy silk ROBE.  Dulaney starts to sit up but
          something restrains him.  He is HANDCUFFED to the BRASS HEAD
          BOARD.

                              DULANEY
                    What the...  What are you doing?

          She sits next to him -- looks at him fondly -- gently strokes
          his face with her hand.

                              DULANEY
                         (nervously)
                    Rebecca -- take these off.

                              REBECCA
                    Tonight we open new doors.


                                                                      58

          She slowly drags the tip of her finger up his stomach -- to his
          chest.  Dulaney follows it with his eyes.  Rebecca picks up a
          LARGE CANDLE on the nightstand and moves it slowly -- back and
          forth over his chest.

                              DULANEY
                    What are you going you doing?

                              REBECCA
                    Are you scared?

          He doesn't answer.  He doesn't have to.  She can see the fear
          in his eyes.  She tilts the candle -- a stream of WAX pours out
          on his chest.  Dulaney winces with pain, his body arching on
          the bed, his hands straining against his restraints.

          She smiles -- a wicked smile, then pours more wax, making a
          thin trail of LITTLE BEADS that moves down his chest towards
          his stomach.  Dulaney's face cringes.  He stares at her through
          eyes filled with fear.

                              REBECCA
                         (whispering)
                    I love you, Frank.  I love your
                    strength -- be strong for me now.

          She continues to pour the wax in little BEADS, filling his
          navel and working her way towards his groin.

                              DULANEY
                         (pleading)
                    Rebecca -- please.  No more.

          Rebecca stares at him warmly -- fondly.

                              REBECCA
                    I told you in the beginning that it
                    was my way.  My way can be many
                    things -- pleasure or pain.

          She lifts a bottle of white vinegar and holds it over his burn.
          He tenses as she pours it on his chest.  -- then relaxes when
          he realizes it's water.  He breathes a SIGH of relief.

                              REBECCA
                    You see how life is, Frank?  We judge
                    things.  We look at things from the
                    outside and assume we know what's on
                    the inside.

          She takes a sip from the bottle.


                                                                      59

                              REBECCA
                    Water.  But you assumed it was
                    vinegar -- because you were only
                    looking at the outside.

          Her meaning isn't lost on Dulaney.  She watches him -- as if
          studying him -- then slowly -- very slowly,  she pulls on the
          belt of her ROBE.  The robe parts revealing the beauty of her
          body.  She gently lowers herself on top of him -- pressing her
          breasts against him.  Dulaney's breathing quickens in
          excitement.  Rebecca moves her head to his chest -- kissing his
          burns softly while her fingers caress lightly over his stomach.
          She gradually moves her head down -- lower -- and lower.

          CLOSE ON DULANEY

          he stares at the ceiling -- his mind a maze of confusion.  Soon
          the power of her touch fills him -- overpowering him.  His eyes
          close.  The pain that only moments ago filled his body is
          replaced with pleasure.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          It's late.  Dulaney enters quietly and heads for the stairs.  A
          LIGHT comes on.  Sharon is sitting on the couch waiting.

                              SHARON
                    Late night?

          Her voice startles Dulaney.

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah -- what are you doing up?

                              SHARON
                    We have to talk.

                              DULANEY
                    What's wrong?

                              SHARON
                    That's what I was hoping you'd tell
                    me.

          Dulaney enters the living room.

                              DULANEY
                    Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the
                    point?

                              SHARON
                    Where have you been?


                                                                      60

                              DULANEY
                    Working.  Charlie and I were going
                    over some statements.

                              SHARON
                    Charlie called at eleven thirty
                    looking for you.
                         (beat)
                    You were with her, weren't you?

                              DULANEY
                    Yes.

                              SHARON
                    Why did you lie to me?

                              DULANEY
                    Because I knew you'd think exactly
                    what you're thinking.

          Sharon springs off the couch.

                              SHARON
                    This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to
                    turn this around on me.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm not.

                              SHARON
                    You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

                              DULANEY
                    No.

                              SHARON
                    It's bad enough that you are.  It's
                    even worse that you can stand here
                    and lie to me.

          She starts to walks out of the room.  Dulaney grabs her by the
          arm.

                              DULANEY
                    Sharon...

          She swings around and slaps him across the face, then stares at
          him angrily, her eyes filled with tears.

                              SHARON
                    You bastard!  Do you think I'm some
                    kind of idiot?  That I don't have
                    fuckin' eyes.  I see.  I feel.  I
                    hurt.


                                                                      61

          She walks out of the room, leaving Dulaney alone with his
          thoughts.


          INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

          ESTER CRAWFORD is on the stand.  She is a BLACK WOMAN in her
          thirties -- thin and tired-looking, although we get the
          impression she once was pretty.  She is dressed in what is
          obviously her Sunday dress.  Cardenas questions her.

                              CARDENAS
                    Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's
                    maid for nine years?

                              ESTER
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever
                    argue?

                              ESTER
                    Like cats and dogs.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did they argue about?

                              ESTER
                    You name it -- they argued about it.
                    Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her
                    happy -- but it seemed that no matter
                    what he did it was never enough for
                    her.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did they argue the day before he
                    died?

                              ESTER
                    Well -- he died on a Sunday and I
                    have the weekends off -- but they
                    were ripping at each other with both
                    barrels Friday afternoon.

                              CARDENAS
                    What was the nature of the argument?

                              ESTER
                    Sex.

                              CARDENAS
                    Could you be more specific?


                                                                      62

                              ESTER
                    She was calling Mr. Marsh an old man
                    -- making discourteous insinuations
                    about his sexual abilities.  She said
                    that she had needs and that if he
                    couldn't fulfill them she'd find
                    someone who could.

          Dulaney jots down a note.  Cardenas continues.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use
                    cocaine?

                              ESTER
                    No -- never.

                              CARDENAS
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Your witness.

          Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney approaches Ester with a smile.

                              DULANEY
                    Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?

                              ESTER
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    High school?

                              ESTER
                    No.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs
                    Crawford's educational background has
                    to do with this case.

                              DULANEY
                    I was just about to make my point,
                    Your Honor.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.

                              DULANEY
                         (reading from note
                          pad)
                    "Discourteous insinuations about his
                    sexual abilities."  Who told you to
                    say that?


                                                                      63

          Ester doesn't answer, but her eyes drift past Dulaney and focus
          on Troxell.  Dulaney follows her stare.

                              DULANEY
                    Did Mr. Troxell help you with that
                    phrase?

          Troxell and Cardenas squirm a little.

                              ESTER
                    I heard him say it.

                              DULANEY
                    Then -- those are not your own words?

                              ESTER
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    What else did the District Attorney's
                    Office tell you to say?

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that
                    Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell
                    reconstruct her sentence and decided
                    to rephrase her words in a more
                    intelligent manner for the court
                    doesn't mean the incident never
                    happened.

                              DULANEY
                         (to Cardenas)
                    I'm just curious to see if Mr.
                    Troxell reconstructed anything else.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor -- please!

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    I'll see both of you in my chambers.
                    Right now.


          INT.  JUDGE BURNHAM'S CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER

          Judge Burnham lights a cigarette and sits on the edge of his
          desk.  Dulaney and Cardenas stand before him.


                                                                      64

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney, before you cast
                    aspersions on the District Attorney's
                    Office by suggesting they've coaxed
                    this witness to say things that
                    aren't true -- you better have more
                    than a hunch.  Do you?

                              DULANEY
                    No, Your Honor.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Maybe you don't know what it's like
                    where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but
                    I do.  I came from a neighborhood
                    just like hers.  This is a whole
                    other world for her.  She's a poor
                    working woman who has been thrust
                    into a room full of highly educated
                    and mostly unsympathetic people.  So,
                    she puts on her best dress, fixes her
                    hair and tries to present herself as
                    intelligently as possible.
                         (beat)
                    Being poor and having pride is not a
                    crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you
                    attempt to impeach another witness'
                    testimony in my courtroom -- your
                    foundations better be based on
                    something other than semantics.


          EXT.  COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney walks down the steps.  Cardenas joins him.

                              CARDENAS
                    I'm surprised you can walk after the
                    way Burnham chewed your ass out this
                    afternoon.

          Cardenas grins.  His comment was meant as a friendly jab
          between old friends.  Dulaney doesn't see it that way.

                              DULANEY
                         (coldly)
                    I've got work to do.

                              CARDENAS
                    Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's
                    between rounds.

                              DULANEY
                    I didn't hear it.


                                                                      65

                              CARDENAS
                    What's happening to you, Frank?
                    You're acting like you're on trial
                    here.  This has become personal to
                    you.

                              DULANEY
                    Back off, John.

          Cardenas studies him for a moment.

                              CARDENAS
                    You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

          Dulaney forces a laugh.  It's not a very convincing one.

                              DULANEY
                    That's ridiculous.

                              CARDENAS
                    I'm talking to you as a friend now.
                    Don't ruin your life, your career for
                    her.  She'll spit you out when this
                    is over.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't know what you're talking
                    about.

                              CARDENAS
                    Really?  What does an attorney speak
                    to his client about at her house
                    until three o'clock in the morning?

                              DULANEY
                    You've been following me?

                              CARDENAS
                    Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm
                    building a case against her,
                    remember?

          Something in Dulaney snaps.  He grabs Cardenas and pushes him
          up against the wall.  Cardenas pushes back.

                              CARDENAS
                    If your head wasn't up your ass you
                    would have thought of it too.  You're
                    losing perspective.  Get out while
                    you can -- before she takes you down
                    with her.



                                                                      66

          INT.  HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney walks towards his office.  Biggs walks quickly down the
          hall and joins him.

                              BIGGS
                    I've been waiting for you to get
                    back.

                              DULANEY
                    You got something on the coke?

                              BIGGS
                    No -- but I got something.

          Biggs steps into Dulaney's office.  Dulaney follows.


          INT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Biggs picks up a remote control off the desk and sits on the
          couch.  Dulaney sits at his desk.

                              BIGGS
                    During lunch I was watching some of
                    Marsh's home videos.

          Biggs clicks the control.  On the TV we see Rebecca on top of
          Marsh in the bedroom.

                              BIGGS
                    He was really into recording this
                    stuff.  The D.A.'s office found a box
                    full of tapes.

          Watching Rebecca with Marsh bothers Dulaney.

                              BIGGS
                    This girl has really got some moves,
                    huh?

          Dulaney stands up and turns off the television.

                              DULANEY
                    If you want to get your kicks go to a
                    video store and rent a porno movie.

          Biggs studies Dulaney for a moment.  Dulaney's reaction bothers
          him.  He turns the TV back on and fast forwards the tape.  The
          screen turns to SNOW where the tape has been recorded over.

                              BIGGS
                    This tape was recorded over an
                    existing recording.


                                                                      67

                              DULANEY
                    Over what?

          Biggs raises a hand signaling patience.  SNOW still fills the
          TV screen.

                              BIGGS
                    I would have missed it -- but the
                    phone rang and I let it play while I
                    talked.  It looks like blank tape --
                    but it isn't.  It's been erased
                    without any input signal coming in.

                              DULANEY
                    So, what good is it to us if it's
                    been erased?

                              BIGGS
                    It's very good -- because when the
                    D.A's office saw it they assumed it
                    was the end of the tape, otherwise
                    they would have buried it.

                              DULANEY
                    Why?

                              BIGGS
                    Because it hasn't all been erased.

          Biggs looks at the screen.  A beat.  The SNOW dissolves and a
          picture fades in.  The PICTURE LASTS only about five seconds.
          We see Rebecca from the back as she straddles Marsh, grinding
          up and down on the bed -- her hair flowing down her back.
          Marsh raises his hand.  His WRIST IS IN A CAST.  She turns her
          head to the side and as she does we see that it is not Rebecca
          -- but Joanne Braslow.  The Tape clicks off.

          Dulaney stares at the blank screen.

                              DULANEY
                         (quoting Joanne)
                    Where's the attraction to sleep with
                    someone like that.


          EXT.  PARKING LOT - DUSK

          Joanne Braslow walks to her BMW 325i.  She is about to open the
          door when Dulaney approaches her.

                              DULANEY
                    I need to speak with you.


                                                                      68

                              JOANNE
                    I don't think we have anything more
                    to talk about, Mr. Dulaney.

          She starts to get in the car.

                              DULANEY
                    You were sleeping with Marsh.

          She stops -- appears shocked that he knows this.  There is now
          a different quality to her -- an edge.

                              JOANNE
                    Who told you that?

                              DULANEY
                    He video taped you.

                              JOANNE
                    That bastard!

                              DULANEY
                    I thought he was a kind, gentle man?

          Joanne doesn't appreciate Dulaney throwing her words back in
          her face.

                              JOANNE
                    Yes, I slept with him but that was a
                    long time ago.

                              DULANEY
                    You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a
                    cast on the tape.  It was right
                    before he went to Chicago and met
                    Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her,
                    didn't he?

          Joanne can't hold back the emotion that is building.

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    It must have been horrible.  Having
                    to go there -- seeing them together -
                    - knowing he was sleeping with her in
                    the same bed he did with you.

                              JOANNE
                    I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt.
                    He switched me off like a little toy
                    he was finished playing with.  But I
                    didn't kill him.


                                                                      69

          Dulaney studies her.

                              JOANNE
                         (continuing)
                    I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney.
                    Killing Andrew wasn't in my best
                    interest.  As it is I'm out of a job
                    and I'm not in his will.

                              DULANEY
                    Money isn't the only reason people
                    commit murder, Miss Braslow.

          Dulaney walks off.  Joanne stares after him.  Her face is cold,
          showing no sign of emotion.


          INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

          Dulaney sits beside Rebecca, but he seems distant.  Cardenas
          stands up.

                              CARDENAS
                    The State calls Jeffery Roston.

          As soon as she hears the name Rebecca's face becomes tense,
          nervous.  Dulaney notices it.  He checks a list.

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston
                    listed as a prosecution witness.

                              CARDENAS
                    The State's investigation just
                    uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday
                    afternoon in Chicago.

          Judge Burnham motions for Dulaney and Cardenas to approach the
          bench.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover
                    of Miss Lawson's.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Why didn't the State's investigation
                    uncover Mr. Roston earlier?

                              CARDENAS
                    He was away on an extended vacation
                    and just returned two days ago.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Alright -- I'm going to allow his
                    testimony.

                                                                      70


                              DULANEY
                    But Your Honor--

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.

          Dulaney walks back to his chair.  Rebecca appears genuinely
          nervous.


          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER

          Cardenas stands before ROSTON a handsome man with salt and
          pepper hair in his late fifties.

                              CARDENAS
                    Mr. Roston, what was your
                    relationship with Miss Lawson?

                              ROSTON
                    We were lovers.

                              CARDENAS
                    How long were you together?

                              ROSTON
                    For about one year.

                              CARDENAS
                    How would you describe your sex life
                    with Miss Lawson?

                              ROSTON
                    Intense.

                              CARDENAS
                    I know this is a very personal
                    subject, but could you be a little
                    more specific?

                              ROSTON
                    It was wild.  She was constantly
                    trying to get me more and more worked
                    up -- kinky things.  I tried to
                    satisfy her the best I could, but it
                    was difficult in my condition.

                              CARDENAS
                    What kind of condition are you
                    referring to?

                              ROSTON
                    I had a bad heart.


                                                                      71

          There is an AUDIBLE GASP from the crowd.  Cardenas waits,
          giving the jury plenty of time to digest the implications of
          Roston's last statement.

          Dulaney looks at Rebecca dumbfounded.  He tries to control his
          surprise from the eyes of the jury, but he can't.  He stares
          ahead with a blank expression as he listens to the rest of the
          testimony.

                              CARDENAS
                    What happened next?

                              ROSTON
                    I had bypass surgery.

                              CARDENAS
                    And how are you now?

                              ROSTON
                    Fine.  The doctors say if I keep
                    taking care of myself I can live to
                    be a very old man.

                              CARDENAS
                    How did your relationship with Miss
                    Lawson progress after the surgery?

                              ROSTON
                    It didn't.

                              CARDENAS
                    Why not?

                              ROSTON
                    She left me.

          Dulaney slowly turns and looks at Rebecca.  The anger and his
          sense of betrayal show on his face.

                              CARDENAS
                    Why did she say she was leaving?

                              ROSTON
                    She didn't.  She just left.

                              CARDENAS
                    Why do you think she left you?

                              ROSTON
                    Well -- I think that after the
                    operation she realized that...

          It takes Dulaney a few seconds to object to the question.  He
          is clearly preoccupied with the implications of Roston's
          testimony.

                                                                      72


                              DULANEY
                    Objection.  The question calls for a
                    conclusion on the part of the
                    witness.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the
                    defendant for many months.  I feel
                    that his opinion is valid in
                    substantiating the character of the
                    Miss Lawson.

                              DULANEY
                    The opinion of a scorned lover is
                    hardly an objective view.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Objection sustained.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did Miss Lawson ever give you any
                    indication why she was leaving?

                              DULANEY
                    Objection.  The witness has already
                    stated that Miss Lawson left without
                    an explanation.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on
                    to another line of questioning.

                              CARDENAS
                    When you say your sexual relations
                    with Miss Lawson were intense what
                    exactly do you mean?

                              ROSTON
                    It was like she was trying to push me
                    as far as she could.  She called it
                    opening new doors.

                              CARDENAS
                    Can you give the court an example?

                              ROSTON
                    It was like sex was a game to her.
                    She got off on the control.  She
                    always used to tell me it had to be
                    her way.

          This strikes a chord with Dulaney.


                                                                      73

                              ROSTON
                         (continuing)
                    It's hard to resist a woman as
                    beautiful as she is.

                              CARDENAS
                    What would she do that made it hard
                    to resist?

                              ROSTON
                    She's a woman who is very much aware
                    of her own sexuality.  Sometimes I
                    felt she could read my mind.  It was
                    uncanny how she knew exactly what I
                    wanted.  A few nights before my heart
                    surgery Rebecca woke me.  She had
                    handcuffed me to the bed.

          There are a few SNICKERS from the crowd.  Dulaney is thinking
          about the familiarity of Roston's testimony.  Judge Burnham
          BANGS his GAVEL.  The crowd becomes silent.

                              ROSTON
                    She told me that tonight we were
                    going to open new doors.  I asked her
                    to stop -- to take off the handcuffs,
                    but she wouldn't listen.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did she say?

          Roston is clearly uncomfortable having to relate this part of
          his life.

                              CARDENAS
                    Mr. Roston I know this is difficult
                    for you, but it's important you tell
                    the court what she did.

                              ROSTON
                    She said she was going to fuck me
                    like I've never been fucked before.

          More noise from the Crowd.  Judge Burnham is annoyed.  He BANGS
          his gavel again.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Due to the sensitive nature of this
                    witness' testimony and the inability
                    of the spectators to allow him to
                    complete it, I am clearing the
                    courtroom.

          Sounds of protest fill the room as the BAILIFFS start to usher
          out the crowd.

                                                                      74



          INT.  COURTROOM LATER

          The gallery is empty.  Only Dulaney, Rebecca, Cardenas,
          Troxell, Roston, Judge Burnham, The Jury and Court Officials
          remain.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did she do next, Mr. Roston?

                              ROSTON
                    She started touching herself and
                    telling me how much she wanted me.
                    She reached down and put me inside
                    her.  My doctor had warned me about
                    exerting myself -- but you really
                    don't think of those things at a
                    moment like that.  You just think
                    about how beautiful this woman is --
                    how much you want her.  How deeply
                    you want to please her.
                         (beat)
                    At first it started off slowly -- but
                    the rhythm built and built.    Every
                    time I got close to an orgasm she
                    would stop.  Eventually I started to
                    have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just
                    kept going -- faster and faster.  No
                    matter what I said she wouldn't stop.
                    I really thought for a moment I was
                    going to die.

                              CARDENAS
                    If you knew it was bad for you why
                    did you do it?

                              ROSTON
                    I couldn't help myself.  You get lost
                    inside a women like her.  It was like
                    a drug.  It was the best sex I ever
                    had.

                              CARDENAS
                    What happened after that?

                              ROSTON
                    I woke up the next morning and she
                    was gone.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you change your will while you
                    were with Miss Lawson?


                                                                      75

                              ROSTON
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Who was your primary beneficiary?

                              ROSTON
                    She was.

                              CARDENAS
                    Thank you.  The State rests.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mister Dulaney?

          Dulaney is stunned -- deep in thought.  He doesn't appear to
          hear the question.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mister Dulaney?

          Dulaney looks at the jury.  What he sees isn't good.  He thinks
          for a moment.  He leans over and quickly speaks with Rebecca.
          We cannot hear them -- but their conversation is heated.
          Rebecca says something.  Dulaney looks at Roston.  A beat.
          Dulaney stands.

                              DULANEY
                    Mr. Roston, you said it was the best
                    sex you ever had.  Is that the best
                    sex with a woman, or a man?

          Cardenas bolts from his seat.

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection!

                              DULANEY
                    I'll rephrase the question.  Mr.
                    Roston isn't it true you are
                    bisexual?

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual
                    preferences are not at issue in this
                    trial.

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor, I'm trying to establish
                    the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson
                    felt when she discovered the man she
                    lived with was a different person
                    than she thought he was.

          Judge Burnham thinks for a moment.

                                                                      76


                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    The witness will answer the question.

                              DULANEY
                    Mr. Roston?

                              ROSTON
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    And your sexual tastes were something
                    that you hid from Miss Lawson?

                              ROSTON
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    And didn't Miss Lawson come home one
                    day and find you in bed with your
                    male lover?

                              ROSTON
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    And she left shortly after that?

          A pause.  Roston thinks, struggling to make a decision.

                              ROSTON
                    No.  We worked things out.  It was
                    three weeks later when I told her
                    about the heart surgery that she
                    left.

          Roston looks around the court room.  He is embarrassed, filled
          with emotion.

                              DULANEY
                    Would it be fair to say that when she
                    did find out it was a shock to her?

                              ROSTON
                         (very upset)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    No further questions.

          Roston looks at the jury -- their disapproving stares.  He is
          on the verge of tears.



                                                                      77

          INT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

          Rebecca opens the door.  A tired-looking Dulaney enters.  They
          walk to the couch together in silence.  Dulaney sits.  Rebecca
          lifts a BOTTLE of CHAMPAGNE out of an ice bucket.

                              DULANEY
                    What's that for?

                              REBECCA
                    To celebrate how masterfully you
                    destroyed Roston today.

                              DULANEY
                    Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life
                    in open court.

                              REBECCA
                         (suddenly ice cold)
                    Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.

                              DULANEY
                    He was only doing what he thought was
                    right.

                              REBECCA
                    You're too weak, Frank.  When you
                    want something you have to do what-
                    ever it takes to get it.  If
                    something gets in your way you remove
                    it.

          Dulaney stares at her.  The person he sees has no feelings --
          no empathy for anyone.

                              DULANEY
                    You killed him -- didn't you?

                              REBECCA
                    I knew you were thinking that.  I
                    could see it in your eyes today in
                    the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank.
                    I need you to believe that.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't need anybody.

                              REBECCA
                    I do need you.  No matter what you
                    think of me -- I didn't do it.

                                                                      78

                         (beat)
                    I could see the looks on the juror's
                    faces.  To the men I represent what
                    they can never have.  I'm a cold,
                    heartless bitch -- and this is their
                    chance for pay-back for every woman
                    that's ever blown them off in a bar.
                    To the old women I'm a vulgar whore
                    and to the young ones I remind them
                    of what they'll never be.  It doesn't
                    matter to them that I'm innocent.
                    They've already convicted me.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm dropping the case.

                              REBECCA
                         (matter of factly)
                    No -- you're not.

          Rebecca picks up a REMOTE CONTROL from the coffee table and
          pushes a button.

          CLOSE ON TELEVISION

          A TAPE of Dulaney making love to Rebecca fills the screen.  It
          is wild, passionate.

          CLOSE ON DULANEY

          he is dumbfounded as he watches.  The implications of what this
          tape could do to him run through his mind.

          Something in Dulaney snaps.  He grabs Rebecca.  They struggle,
          falling down onto the coffee table.  The CHAMPAGNE bottle
          crashes to the floor.  Rebecca rolls off the table to the
          floor.  She sits up and moves away from Dulaney by pushing
          herself backwards.  Dulaney lunges at her.  His hand grabbing
          her ankle.  Rebecca kicks -- breaks free -- stands up.  Dulaney
          gets to his feet -- runs after her.  He grabs her by the throat
          and smashes her into the wall.  He slaps her across the face.
          A thin stream of blood flows from the corner of her mouth.  She
          smiles.

                              REBECCA
                    It gets easier, doesn't it?  Once you
                    open the door it never closes.

          Dulaney realizes what he is doing.  He stares at her in horror,
          then walks towards the door. He stops.  Goes back to the VHS
          machine.  He pushes the EJECT BUTTON on the VCR, removes the
          tape and destroys it.


                                                                      79

                              REBECCA
                    I've got another copy.  How do you
                    think your wife would feel if she saw
                    this -- not to mention your
                    colleagues?

          Dulaney's temper is near the breaking point again, he strains
          to control himself.

                              REBECCA
                    You can think whatever you want,
                    Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew,
                    and I'm not going to prison for
                    something I didn't do.

                              DULANEY
                    You're a monster.

                              REBECCA
                    No -- I'm a survivor.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, DINNING ROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney, Sharon and Michael sit at the table eating dinner.
          There is a tense silence.  Although Michael does not know what
          is going on he can sense the tension.  The DOORBELL RINGS.

                              DULANEY
                    I'll get it.


          INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney answers the front door and Biggs rushes in excited.

                              BIGGS
                    I'm sorry to barge in -- but I
                    figured after that bombshell that got
                    laid on you today you could use some
                    good news?

                              DULANEY
                    You got something on the Coke?

          Biggs grins.

                              BIGGS
                    Do I?  I talked to one of the dealers
                    I put the word out to.  He's been
                    following the trial pretty closely.
                    He said at one time he wanted to be a
                    lawyer before he became a dealer.


                                                                      80

                              DULANEY
                    Charlie -- are you going to make a
                    point soon?

                              BIGGS
                    Right now.  Guess who's been buying
                    Coke from him for the last five and
                    half years?

          Dulaney shrugs his shoulders indicating he doesn't have a clue.

                              BIGGS
                    Marsh's secretary -- Joanne Braslow.

          Confusion fills Dulaney's face.


          INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING

          Court is in session.  Rebecca looks around the courtroom,
          trying to get a feel of the CROWD'S opinion.  Dulaney is not
          there.  She looks at the door anxiously.  The rooms waits.  A
          beat.  Dulaney enters -- sits beside Rebecca -- but acts as if
          she isn't there.


          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER

          Dulaney stands at the witness stand in front of an ORIENTAL MAN
          in his thirties.

                              DULANEY
                    Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do
                    you practice?

                              DR. WONG
                    Oriental medicine.

                              DULANEY
                    --And is Miss Lawson a patient of
                    yours?

                              DR. WONG
                    Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a
                    year.

                              DULANEY
                    Why does she come to you?

                              DR. WONG
                    She suffers from severe menstrual
                    cramps.


                                                                      81

                              DULANEY
                    Did you ever prescribe any medication
                    for her cramps?

                              DR. WONG
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    What did you prescribe for her?

                              DR. WONG
                    Chinese peony root.

                              DULANEY
                    Would you describe for the court what
                    Chinese peony root looks like?

                              DR. WONG
                    It's a white powder that comes in a
                    vial.

          There is a MOAN from the CROWD.  Cardenas looks at Troxell.

                              DULANEY
                    How do you instruct your patients to
                    take it?

                              DR. WONG
                    I tell them to pour an amount the
                    size of a quarter into the their hand
                    and mix it with water.

                              DULANEY
                    A previous witness stated that she
                    saw Miss Lawson pouring a white
                    powder into her hand on October
                    twenty-eighth.  According to your
                    records when did you prescribe the
                    drug?

          Dr. Wong checks his records.

                              DR. WONG
                    October twenty-seventh.

                              DULANEY
                    One last question, Doctor.  If
                    someone didn't know better, would it
                    be easy to mistake the peony root for
                    cocaine?

                              DR. WONG
                    Yes -- quite easy.


                                                                      82

                              DULANEY
                         (to Cardenas)
                    Your witness.

          Cardenas realizes there is nothing to gain by examining this
          witness.

                              CARDENAS
                    No questions.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    You may call your next witness.

                              DULANEY
                    The defense calls Miss Margaret
                    Sellers.

          Cardenas looks worried as he watches an attractive woman in her
          mid twenties approach the stand.

          DULANEY AND MISS SELLERS

          Miss Sellers appears a little nervous.  Dulaney smiles warmly.

                              DULANEY
                    Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan
                    Paley?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    Where did you meet him?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    I'm a nurse.  I used to work at
                    Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr.
                    Paley's on staff there.

                              DULANEY
                    What was the nature of your
                    relationship with Dr. Paley.

                              MISS SELLERS
                    We dated for about a month last year.

                              DULANEY
                    Then what happened?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    I realized he wasn't serious.  He was
                    seeing other women -- asking other
                    nurses at the hospital out, so I
                    ended it.


                                                                      83

                              DULANEY
                    -- And what did Dr. Paley do after
                    you stopped seeing him?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    He used to call me -- tell me that I
                    couldn't just walk out on him.  He
                    said that if I didn't come back he'd
                    make my life miserable.

                              DULANEY
                    Did he make your life miserable?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    Yes -- he did.

                              DULANEY
                    How?

          Cardenas stands again.

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney
                    that the person on trial here is Miss
                    Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a
                    pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with
                    women.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Objection overruled.  The witness
                    will answer the question.

                              MISS SELLERS
                    He'd call me in the middle of the
                    night.  Show up at my house and bang
                    on the door.  Finally after two weeks
                    I went to his office one day to tell
                    him to stop.

                              DULANEY
                    What did he say?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    He laughed -- and basically said he
                    would decide when it was over.

                              DULANEY
                    Do you remember his exact words?


                                                                      84

                              MISS SELLERS
                    Yes.  He said, "If you want to play
                    games, we'll play -- and you'll be
                    sorry."

          Another BUZZ from the CROWD.   Cardenas inwardly cringes.

                              DULANEY
                    What happened next?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    While I was seeing Dr. Paley I
                    mentioned to him one night that
                    someone was stealing drugs from the
                    third floor dispensary.   Three days
                    after I spoke to him in his office he
                    went to the Head Nurse and told her
                    he had witnessed me stealing drugs.

                              DULANEY
                    What happened?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    There was an inquiry.  It was his
                    word against mine.  They believed
                    him.  I was fired.


          INT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - DUSK

          Dulaney is at his desk.  Biggs enters excited.

                              BIGGS
                    Joanne Braslow is getting more and
                    more interesting.  I followed her
                    today to an attorney's office.
                    Joseph Koehler.

                              DULANEY
                    Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an
                    estate attorney -- and he's very
                    expensive.

                              BIGGS
                    What would Joanne Braslow need with
                    an estate attorney?  She wasn't even
                    mentioned in Marsh's will.

          Dulaney thinks for a moment.  He grins as an idea enters his
          mind.

                              DULANEY
                    Not this will.


                                                                      85

          INT.  FILE ROOM - EVENING

          Dulaney and Biggs sit at a table going through a stack of
          papers.  Dulaney traces his finger along a piece of paper.

                              DULANEY
                    Here it is!  According to the old
                    will Joanne Braslow was to inherit
                    two hundred and fifty thousand
                    dollars.

                              BIGGS
                    What good does that do -- it's the
                    old will?

                              DULANEY
                    Under the law a person cannot profit
                    from their own wrong doing.  Since
                    Rebecca Lawson is the sole
                    beneficiary of the new will, if she
                    is found guilty the will is void and
                    Joanne Braslow could make a very good
                    case to have the old will reinstated.

                              BIGGS
                    She kills the old man and makes it
                    look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty
                    slick.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - EVENING

          Dulaney is washing up for dinner.  He speaks to Sharon who is
          in the bedroom.

                              DULANEY
                    I was thinking that when the trial is
                    over we'd all go skiing for a
                    weekend.

                              SHARON
                    Maybe it would be a good idea if you
                    just took Michael.

          Sharon leaves the room.  Dulaney reaches for his TOOTHBRUSH --
          picks up a TUBE of TOOTH PASTE.  It is empty.  He stares at the
          EMPTY TUBE.

                              DULANEY
                         (to himself)
                    Drug store.


          INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING


                                                                      86

          Dulaney looks worn, tired -- the tension between him and
          Rebecca shows.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney, are you ready to call
                    your next witness?

          Dulaney doesn't seem to hear him.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney, are you with us?

          Dulaney snaps out of it.

                              DULANEY
                    Yes, Your Honor.  The defense recalls
                    Joanne Braslow.

          As Joanne walks towards the stand Dulaney looks over at
          Rebecca.  It's as if he is trying to make up his mind about
          her.  Joanne takes her seat.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you
                    that you are still under oath.

                              DULANEY
                    How often do you use cocaine?

          Cardenas shoots out of his seat.

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection, Your Honor.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                         (impatiently)
                    Counsel approach the bench.

          Dulaney and Cardenas walk over to the bench.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney, I'm getting tired of
                    seeing you this close to me.

          Judge Burnham looks at Cardenas indicating he will hear his
          argument now.

                              CARDENAS
                    Whether or not Miss Braslow uses
                    drugs is not an issue here.


                                                                      87

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor -- the prosecution has
                    introduced cocaine as one of the
                    contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died.
                    How it may have been introduced into
                    the household is of vital importance.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Are you able to back up this
                    allegation -- or are you fishing?

                              DULANEY
                    I can back it up.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    You better.
                         (to Joanne)
                    Please answer the question.

                              JOANNE
                    I've tried it.

                              DULANEY
                    You've tried it?  Isn't it true that
                    you've been in and out of Rehab
                    centers for the last four years?

          This is clearly embarrassing for her.

                              JOANNE
                    I've been to a few -- yes.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't like Miss Lawson much do
                    you?

                              JOANNE
                         (hesitantly)
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't like her because you were
                    involved with Mr. Marsh before she
                    came along.  Isn't that true?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    You resented the fact that she told
                    you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.


                                                                      88

          Dulaney moves the questions along, quickening their pace,
          building a rhythm.

                              DULANEY
                    And you resented that he cared for
                    her in a way he once cared for you?

                              JOANNE
                         (breaking down)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    --And that Mr. Marsh paid less
                    attention to you?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    --and that he changed his will?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

          She has blurted out the answer before the full implications of
          the question has dawned on her.  Her face reveals her mistake.

          Cardenas can only watch uncomfortably from his seat.

                              DULANEY
                    In his previous will Mr. Marsh left
                    you two hundred and fifty thousand
                    dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why
                    do you think he did that?

                              JOANNE
                    She talked him into it.  She wanted
                    everything.

                              DULANEY
                    Two hundred and fifty thousand
                    dollars is a lot of money.  That must
                    have made you pretty angry?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

          Dulaney picks up a small PIECE OF PAPER and walks towards
          Joanne.

                              DULANEY
                    You testified that you returned to
                    Mr. Marsh's house at eleven o'clock
                    the night of his murder.  Is that
                    correct?

                                                                      89


                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    Well - I'm a little confused.
                         (holds up the paper)
                    This is a charge receipt from Rosen's
                    Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an
                    account.  It's dated the day of the
                    murder.
                         (hands it to her)
                    Is this your signature?

                              JOANNE
                         (nervously studies
                          it)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    There's an item you picked up that's
                    marked.  Will you read it?

                              JOANNE
                    Dristan nasal spray.

                              DULANEY
                    Would you read for us the time of the
                    purchase?

                              JOANNE
                    Three fifteen.

                              DULANEY
                    A.M -- or P.M.?

                              JOANNE
                    P.M.

                              DULANEY
                    You see that's what bothers me.  No
                    other bottle of nasal spray was found
                    in the house.  The police looked.
                    There was only the one bottle.  But
                    you say you didn't arrive until after
                    Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he
                    was using the nasal spray prior to
                    his death.  How do you think it got
                    there?

                              JOANNE
                    I don't know.


                                                                      90

                              DULANEY
                    Isn't it true that you stopped by the
                    house after you left the drug store
                    and dropped off the items you bought?

                              JOANNE
                         (nervously)
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Isn't it true that you put the
                    cocaine in the bottle?

                              JOANNE
                    No!  Why would I want to kill him?

                              DULANEY
                    Because you were jealous.  Because he
                    cut you out of the will.  Because you
                    have a cocaine habit to feed --
                    because you know that if Rebecca
                    Lawson is found guilty the new will
                    is void -- and there's a very good
                    chance the old one would be honored.

          SILENCE fills the room.  Members of the JURY look at Rebecca,
          they are confused -- doubt fills their minds.

                              DULANEY
                    The defense rests.


          INT.  DULANEY'S DEN - EVENING

          Dark.  Dulaney is standing by the window, watching the RAIN
          FALL outside.  Sharon enters.

                              SHARON
                    We can't go on like this, Frank.

          Dulaney continues to stare out the window.

                              DULANEY
                    I know.

                              SHARON
                    Talk to me.

          He shakes his NO.

                              SHARON
                    Please -- this is ripping us apart.


                                                                      91

                              DULANEY
                         (emotionally)
                    I can't talk about it now.

          She senses his pain and moves to him, wrapping her arms around
          his shoulders.

                              SHARON
                    Don't shut me out.  Let me in.

          He turns and faces her.  She can see the pain on his face.

                              DULANEY
                    You wouldn't like what you'd see.
                    You don't know me anymore.  I don't
                    know me anymore.

                              SHARON
                    We can't pretend this isn't
                    happening.

                              DULANEY
                    Please -- not now.

                              SHARON
                    Why didn't you come to me?

                              DULANEY
                    I don't know.

                              SHARON
                    You used to like to touch me -- to
                    make love to me.

                              DULANEY
                    It's more involved than that.

                              SHARON
                    It was a place to start.

                              DULANEY
                    You think that's the answer?  Sex?
                    Is that what you want?  You want me
                    to make love to you?

                              SHARON
                    I don't want our lives ruined because
                    of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want
                    this to work -- but you have to help
                    me.  You have to come back from where
                    ever it is you are.


                                                                      92

          Dulaney's confusion and emotion begins to surface.  She kisses
          him, softly, gently.  Dulaney closes his eyes.  He kisses her
          harder - and harder.  His passion builds -- his anger grows.
          He runs his arm over his desk, brushing everything to the
          floor.

          He grabs her and firmly pushes her down on the desk.  He kisses
          her forcefully, his lips pressed hard against hers.  She
          struggles against him.  His hands tear at her blouse.  It is
          rough, angry sex and it frightens Sharon.

                              SHARON
                         (screaming)
                    Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!

                              DULANEY
                    Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?

          She is crying now -- struggling futilely against him.

                              SHARON
                    Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!

                              MICHAEL (OS)
                         (racked with fear)
                    Daddy -- stop it!

          Dulaney stops and looks.

          Michael is standing in the doorway, his face filled with fear
          and incomprehension.  Tears streak down his face.

          Dulaney freezes as the full power of his actions overwhelm him.
          His face floods with anguish as he tries to grasp the total
          effect of his behavior.

                              DULANEY
                         (softly)
                    Oh -- Jesus.

          Filled with pain and embarrassment Dulaney runs from the room.


          EXT.  BAND SHELL, PARK - NIGHT

          RAIN falls in sheets.  Dulaney sits inside the small structure,
          huddled against one of the pillars.  He is a tragic figure,
          desperately trying to claw his way back to the world he once
          knew.



                                                                      93

          EXT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

          RAIN continues to fall.  Dulaney is standing across the street,
          staring at the house.  He crosses over and is half way to the
          door when he stops.  He starts to leave.

          The front door opens and Sharon steps out onto the porch.

                              SHARON
                    Frank?

          He turns around slowly.  He can't bring himself to look at her.
          She walks out into the rain.  He lifts his head.  Tears flow
          down his face and he cries.  When she begins to cry with him
          he breaks down.

                              DULANEY
                         (ashamed)
                    I'm sorry.  God -- I'm so sorry.

          He slowly drops to his knees -- holding on to her as if she
          were a strong tree in a wind-storm.

                              DULANEY
                    Help me.  Please -- help me.


          INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

          Dulaney sits beside Rebecca. There is tension between them.  He
          does not look at her.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney.

          Dulaney stands and walks over to the jury.

                              DULANEY
                    The Prosecution's case is built on
                    theory -- speculation.  Could Rebecca
                    Lawson have done this?  Is it
                    possible that she did that? Where are
                    the facts?  The evidence.  The State
                    has presented two spurned lovers and
                    a jealous secretary.  Hardly what I
                    would call impartial witnesses.
                    Where is one shred of conclusive,
                    irrefutable evidence?  I don't see it
                    -- and I don't think you do either.
                    Do you know why?  Because there isn't
                    any.

                                                                      94

                         (beat)
                    What's the issue here?  That Rebecca
                    Lawson likes wild sex?  No.  But the
                    District Attorney is trying to make
                    you think if Rebecca Lawson could
                    stray from the path of normal,
                    accepted sexual behavior, then she
                    could be capable of murder.  Did she
                    force Andrew Marsh to make love to
                    her?  Did she hold a gun to his head?
                    No.  Andrew Marsh wanted her -- and
                    why wouldn't he?  She's beautiful,
                    alluring -- the type of woman men
                    dream about.

          As Dulaney continues we sense he is applying his closing
          arguments to himself.

                              DULANEY
                    It's human nature.  We want what we
                    want -- when we want it.  We don't
                    think about the consequences of our
                    actions.  When desire fills us we all
                    do things that we know are bad for
                    us.  We live for the moment.
                         (beat)
                    Here was an exciting young woman who
                    unlocked doors.  Doors that led into
                    a new world.  A world he entered
                    willingly -- eagerly.  He wanted to
                    please her -- and so, he did not tell
                    her of his illness.  I know it might
                    be difficult for you to understand
                    wanting something so badly that you
                    are willing to risk everything -- but
                    that's what passion does to you.
                    It's a fire -- uncontrollable.  It
                    consumes you -- and the only thing
                    you can do is let it burn.  Andrew
                    Marsh let it burn.  It was his life -
                    - his choice -- and maybe his mistake
                    -- but making love is not a crime.
                         (beat)
                    We all have fires inside us -- secret
                    desires.  We guard them --hold them
                    in the cages that we've built.  When
                    someone comes along and opens the
                    gate, they rush out and feed blindly
                    on their pleasure.  Rebecca Lawson
                    loved Andrew Marsh.  She didn't kill
                    him -- if anything did, it was his
                    own passion.


                                                                      95

          Dulaney walks back to his table and sits down.  Rebecca looks
          at him warmly.  Dulaney does not look at her.  Cardenas stands
          to address the jury.

                              CARDENAS
                    It's true -- we all have fires
                    burning inside us.  Rebecca Lawson
                    was very aware of the fire burning
                    inside Andrew Marsh -- and she stoked
                    those flames -- fanning them until
                    they burned so hot that reason and
                    judgement left him.  Is making love a
                    crime?  Of course not -- but the
                    question isn't as simple as that.
                    Rebecca Lawson used her seductive
                    qualities to entice Andrew Marsh.
                    She used sex as a catalyst and
                    cocaine as the terminus.  The
                    combination of the two provided the
                    conclusion of a premeditated act.
                         (beat)
                    She asked Dr. Paley about cocaine.
                    Her fingerprints were found on the
                    nasal spray bottle that contained the
                    cocaine -- and she was the sole
                    beneficiary of Andrew Marsh's will.
                    She planned it from beginning to end.
                    She knew about his heart.  She
                    secretly administered cocaine, then
                    used wild and physically demanding
                    sex to induce a heart attack.
                         (beat)
                    Making love is an act of passion
                    between two people to affirm their
                    vows of love.  This was not an act of
                    love -- this was an act of greed.
                    This was betrayal.  Rebecca Lawson
                    killed Andrew Marsh -- and I'm
                    counting on you to punish her for
                    that crime.


          INT.  WAITING ROOM, COURTHOUSE - DAY

          Dulaney sits on one side of the room -- Rebecca on the other.
          The room is quiet -- tense.  A MAN enters and nods to him.

                              DULANEY
                         (to man)
                    They're back already?  It's only been
                    three hours.



                                                                      96

          INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

          Dulaney sits beside Rebecca.  In the row behind them is Sattler
          and Biggs.

          The JURY enters.  Their faces betray nothing.  One by one they
          file into their seats.

          Cardenas sits with Troxell -- both of them watching anxiously.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
                    have you reached a verdict?

          The JURY FOREMAN stands.

                              JURY FOREMAN
                    We have, Your Honor.

          The BAILIFF walks over and takes the VERDICT SLIP from the
          FOREMAN, then walks over to Judge Burnham and hands it to him.
          Judge Burnham reads the decision.  He hands it back to the
          Bailiff who takes it to the COURT CLERK.

          ON REBECCA

          She waits nervously for the Court Clerk to read the verdict.

          ON CARDENAS

          he taps his pen against the desk anxiously.

          ON THE COURT CLERK

          He opens the verdict slip and looks at it.  He stands slowly.

                              COURT CLERK
                    The jury finds the defendant -- not
                    guilty.

          Relief floods Rebecca's face.  Dulaney shows no emotion.
          Sattler and Biggs shakes hands, then lean forward to
          congratulate Dulaney.

          Rebecca turns to Dulaney to hug him -- before she can, Dulaney
          has picked up his briefcase and is leaving the courtroom.


          INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney walks towards his car with Biggs.  There is no sense of
          victory or elation.

                              BIGGS
                    What are you gonna do now?

                                                                      97


                              DULANEY
                    Take some time off.

                              BIGGS
                    You think the D.A.'s gonna file on
                    Joanne?

                              DULANEY
                    I don't know.

          Dulaney reaches his car.

                              DULANEY
                    You did a good job, Charlie.

                              BIGGS
                    Thanks, Mister D.

          Biggs walks away.  Dulaney takes out his keys, opens the door
          to his car.  He is about to get in when he senses someone
          behind him.  He turns around.

          Joanne steps out from behind a pillar.  She stares at Dulaney
          hatefully.  Her hand is inside her purse.

                              JOANNE
                    That bastard should have left me
                    something.  I worked for him for six
                    years -- and he goes and gives it all
                    to her.

          Dulaney looks around the parking lot.  He is alone.  Joanne is
          obviously very high on something.  Her mind seems to wander,
          her eyes drift.

                              JOANNE
                    You take what people say and make it
                    ugly.  You make others believe what
                    you want them to.  She should have
                    been found guilty.  She shouldn't
                    have gotten off.

                              DULANEY
                    Then you would have gotten your
                    money?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?


                                                                      98

                              JOANNE
                    Do you think if I did I'd be stupid
                    enough to tell you?

          Dulaney looks her hand fidgeting in her purse.

                              DULANEY
                    What do you have in your purse?

                              JOANNE
                    What do you think I've got?  A gun?
                    Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe
                    I'll blow your head off right now.

          Her hand starts to come out of the purse.  Suddenly, Biggs
          appears, rushing her from behind a pillar.  He grabs her hand
          and pushes her against a car.

          He pulls her hand from the purse.  She is holding a piece of
          paper.

                              JOANNE
                         (crying)
                    I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're
                    gonna make it look like I did it.
                    They gotta put it on someone.

                              DULANEY
                    Why'd you come here?

                              JOANNE
                         (holds up the letter)
                    To show you this.  It's a letter from
                    that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to
                    me the day after I saw him.  He's the
                    one who told me I could get the money
                    if Miss Lawson went to jail.

                              DULANEY
                    You didn't know about it before that?

                              JOANNE
                    No.

          Dulaney is suddenly very confused.

                              DULANEY
                    Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler
                    in the first place?

                              JOANNE
                    Because he called me.

          Dulaney is stunned.  He looks at Biggs with a knowing stare.


                                                                      99


          EXT.  HOUSE - EVENING

          It is RAINING lightly.  Dulaney waits at the door of a nice two
          story home.  It is answered by a heavy-set man in his fifties,
          JOSEPH KOEHLER.

                              DULANEY
                    Hi, Joe.

                              KOEHLER
                    Frank -- what are you doing here?

                              DULANEY
                    I need to ask you a question.  What
                    made you get in touch with Joanne
                    Braslow?

                              KOEHLER
                    You know I can't talk about that.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm not asking for names or
                    specifics.  I just want to know what
                    prompted you to make the call?

                              KOEHLER
                    Sorry.

          Koehler starts to close the door, Dulaney sticks his foot
          inside, blocking it.  His face is filled with determination.
          Koehler sees it.

                              DULANEY
                    Please -- I need your help.

          Koehler thinks for a moment.  He can sense Dulaney's need.

                              KOEHLER
                    All I can tell you is I was contacted
                    by an interested party on Miss
                    Braslow's behalf.


          INT.  DULANEY'S CAR - NIGHT

          Dulaney stares through the windshield, straining to see the
          road through the heavy rain.  His CAR PHONE RINGS.

                              DULANEY
                    Hello?

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see
                    you right away.  I've got the tape.

                                                                      100


          A calmness spreads over his face.

                              DULANEY
                    I'll be right there.


          EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          RAIN FALLS.  LIGHTNING fills the sky.  Dulaney drives up --
          finds a PARKING SPOT down the street --  gets out of his car
          and runs to the door.  As he KNOCKS as loud CLAP on THUNDER
          BOOMS overhead.  Dulaney waits impatiently.  He lifts the
          FLOWER POT, removes the key and opens the door.


          INT.  DEN - NIGHT

          The dim glow of a DESK LAMP is the only source of light.
          Dulaney moves through the room slowly.

                              DULANEY
                    Rebecca?

          Two CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES are on the floor by the couch.  Dulaney
          looks on the coffee table.

          HIS POV - COFFEE TABLE

          A VIAL is open and on its side.  A RAZOR BLADE and STRAW lay
          next to it.  A pile of WHITE POWDER has been dumped out.
          Several lines of cocaine have been drawn.

          Dulaney starts to move towards the living room.  He is almost
          at the door when the BIG SCREEN TELEVISION TURNS ON.  We see
          the tape of Dulaney and Rebecca making love.

                              REBECCA (OS)
                    Is this what you're looking for,
                    Frank?

          Dulaney turns around to find Rebecca standing behind him, a
          remote control in her hand.

                              DULANEY
                         (distant)
                    You killed him.  You killed him --
                    and I got you off.

                              REBECCA
                    That's crazy.


                                                                      101

                              DULANEY
                    Is it?  Joanne Braslow was perfect,
                    wasn't she?  You knew we'd see her on
                    the tape and find out about her coke
                    problem.  After that, the digging
                    should have been easy -- but we
                    missed the will.  You knew we were
                    following her, so you called Koehler
                    and had him contact her.  That put us
                    right back on track.  All we needed
                    then was to prove that she had an
                    opportunity.  The drug store took
                    care of that.  She dropped off the
                    stuff and you came back and killed
                    him.  Didn't you?

          She shrugs her shoulders.  His frustration clearly amuses her.
          She grins slightly, almost taunting him.

                              DULANEY
                    I want the tape.

          Dulaney starts into the living room.

                              REBECCA
                    I've been thinking about that.  I've
                    decided to give it to you after I've
                    collected the inheritance.  You can
                    take that one if you want -- but
                    there's another copy.

                              DULANEY
                    That wasn't the deal.

                              REBECCA
                         (provoking him)
                    So, sue me.
                         (as cold as ice)
                    Things have changed.  I think you
                    should go home -- and after you leave
                    I see no reason for us to ever have
                    contact again.

                              DULANEY
                         (growing angrier)
                    I'm not leaving without that tape.

                              REBECCA
                    Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose
                    my temper and send it out just for
                    spite.

          Dulaney loses control.


                                                                      102

                              DULANEY
                    You fuckin' bitch!

          He grabs her by the shoulders and pushes her into the wall.
          Rebecca struggles, but it is little use -- he is a man consumed
          with rage.  Dulaney continues to smash her into the wall.

          Rebecca reaches onto the desk -- lifts up a FOUNTAIN PEN and
          stabs it into Dulaney's shoulder at the base of his neck.
          Dulaney SCREAMS and lets go.  Rebecca starts to runs into the
          living room.  Dulaney follows.


          INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney catches Rebecca -- grabs her -- spins her around --
          then backhands her across the face, knocking her to the ground.
          In the b.g. the VIDEO of them in bed plays on the screen.
          Dulaney sits on top of her and grabs her by the hair.  He
          repeatedly smashes her head onto the floor.

                              MAN'S VOICE
                    Let her go!

          Dulaney stops.  He looks behind him.

          HIS POV

          Standing in the bedroom doorway is Dr. Paley.  He is holding a
          GUN at Dulaney.

          Dulaney stares at him with disbelief as he staggers to his
          feet, his hand holding the wound on his shoulder.  A short,
          breathless LAUGH drifts out of Dulaney as he starts to put it
          all together.  Rebecca stands up, holding her head as she tries
          to catch her breath.

                              DR. PALEY
                         (to Rebecca)
                    Are you alright?

          Rebecca NODS.  Her face hardens.

                              REBECCA
                    You've got to kill him, Alan.

                              DR. PALEY
                    What?


                                                                      103

                              DULANEY
                    She's right, Paley.  You've got to
                    kill me.  She doesn't have to --
                    she's free -- she can't be tried
                    again -- but you, you planned it with
                    her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're
                    an accessory to murder.

                              REBECCA
                    Shoot him.

          Paley struggles to make a decision.  The gun shakes in his
          hand.  Suddenly, the whole scheme becomes clear to Dulaney.

                              DULANEY
                    Don't you see what she's doing?  She
                    needs you to kill me.  She's planned
                    it that way from the start.  That's
                    why she phoned me tonight.

                              DR. PALEY
                    You called him?

                              REBECCA
                    No -- he's lying.

                              DULANEY
                    How's it supposed to work Rebecca?
                    You and Paley celebrate your victory.
                    You get me over here and provoke a
                    fight so he has to rush in and save
                    you -- but then he's given himself
                    away as your accomplice -- now he has
                    to kill me.
                         (to Paley)
                    After that I figure she'll tell the
                    Police that you broke in.  That you
                    were crazed because we humiliated you
                    in court?

                              REBECCA
                    Don't listen to him.  Can't you see
                    he's trying to turn you against me.

                                                                      104


                              DULANEY
                         (continuing; to
                          Paley)
                    Here's the good part.  The truth dies
                    with me and she turns State's
                    evidence against you.  It won't
                    matter what you say.  No one will
                    believe your version -- you've
                    already discredited yourself in
                    court.  You'll go away forever and
                    she'll have the money all for
                    herself.  She's played us both
                    perfectly.

          Paley is becoming more and more confused.  Dulaney moves
          towards him.  Paley lowers the gun slightly.

                              REBECCA
                    Alan, listen to me.  If you don't
                    kill him it's over.  Everything we
                    did will be for nothing.

                              DR. PALEY
                    Shut up, Rebecca.

                              DULANEY
                    She's good isn't she?  But maybe with
                    you it's the real thing.
                         (points to the
                          screen)
                    I'm sure all those nights she was
                    fuckin' me she was thinking of you.

          Confusion crowds Paley's mind.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm sure that every orgasm she had
                    with me was faked.

                              DR. PALEY
                    That's enough.

                              DULANEY
                    I mean she only screwed me two or
                    three times a night because she had
                    to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.

                              REBECCA
                         (softly)
                    I love you, Alan.  You have to
                    believe I love you.  Kill him!  Kill
                    him and we can be together forever!


                                                                      105

                              DULANEY
                    That's right, she loves you.  Just
                    like she loved Roston and Marsh and
                    me.  Don't be a fool.  You're nothing
                    to her.  The second you pull that
                    trigger she'll turn on you.

          Betrayal fills Paley's face.  His eyes fill with tears.

                              DR. PALEY
                         (to Rebecca)
                    I loved you.

                              REBECCA
                         (tense)
                    Alan, don't let him do this.  You're
                    everything to me.
                         (she moves closer)
                    Give me the gun.  Give me the gun and
                    I'll do it for you.

          Paley stares at her -- his mind races.  Pain fills his face as
          he fights to make a decision.  Suddenly, his face tenses.  He
          starts to raise the gun at Dulaney -- then just as suddenly he
          turns it on Rebecca and FIRES.

          The bullet hits Rebecca in the chest.  The force blows her off
          her feet.

          Paley stares at her blankly.  He slowly lowers the gun and
          drops it to the floor, then staggers over to Rebecca.

          ON REBECCA

          she stares up through glazed, dead eyes.

          Paley takes her pulse.  He breaks down, weeping over her body,
          his tears signaling to Dulaney that she is dead.


          EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

          Police cars are lined up outside, their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.


          INT.  REBECCA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Members of the POLICE FORCE, along with FORENSIC PEOPLE go over
          the area.  Dulaney sits on the couch.  He looks indifferent --
          as if all emotion has been sucked out of him.  Troxell is
          beside him, taking notes.  Dulaney looks up.

          A BODYBAG on a stretcher is being wheeled out of the room.


                                                                      106

          Dulaney follows it with his eyes.  Cardenas enters from the
          bedroom.  They lock eyes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Paley's confessed to the whole thing.
                    It's like he's got no will to live
                    now that she's gone.
                         (thinks for a moment)
                    She almost got away with it.  Ironic,
                    huh?  Do you believe in karma, Frank?

          Dulaney doesn't answer.

                              CARDENAS
                    Well -- call it what you want.  Fate.
                    Destiny.  We usually get what we
                    deserve in the end.

          A beat.  Dulaney looks at him wearily.

                              DULANEY
                    Can I go?

                              CARDENAS
                         (to Troxell)
                    You get his statement?

                              TROXELL
                    Yeah.

                              CARDENAS
                    Then you can go.

          Dulaney gets up and starts for the door.  Cardenas watches him.

                              CARDENAS
                    Frank?

          Dulaney turns around slowly.  Cardenas reaches into his
          RAINCOAT pocket and take out a VHS TAPE.

                              CARDENAS
                    I found this video in her room.  It
                    has your name on it.

          The two men lock eyes.  There is a long silence between them.
          Dulaney waits for Cardenas' next move.

                              CARDENAS
                         (holding it out)
                    I assume it's yours.

     Dulaney knows that Cardenas has seen it.  A hint of a grateful
     smile shows on his face.  He takes the tape.


                                                                      107

                              DULANEY
                    Thanks.


     EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     A light RAIN falls.  Dulaney walks out and heads towards the
     street.  He stops -- looks back at the condo -- then walks down
     the street towards his car.


     FADE TO BLACK
