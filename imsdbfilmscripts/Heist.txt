         arrogance that hurts, it's the money.

                        BLANE
         Yeah?    What were you gonna do with the money?

                      PINCUS

         know, this's the goddamndest thing I ever saw:
         They got his face on tap, he's got to Steal

         I don't want you to do anything unless and
         until... we hit the City, ditch the car.

                         BELLA
         ...I'll...

                      MOORE
         You do it, you do it.
              (PAUSE)
         You do it, Pinky...

                                                                 40.


HE WIPES HIS HAND OVER HIS MOUSTACHE.    TAKES OFF HIS HARDHAT, AND
WIPES THE SWEAT FROM HIS BROW.

INT BOAT REPAIR SHOP NIGHT

A SPRAY OF SPARKS FROM A WELDING UNIT.

ANGLE

ON MOORE, AS HE PUTS UP THE SHIELD ON A WELDER'S MASK, WIPES HIS
BROW, PUTS THE SHIELD DOWN AGAIN, AND CONTINUES CUTTING WITH AN
ACETYLENE TORCH ON A LARGE, INDUSTRIAL AIR-CONDITIONING UNIT.

ANGLE

IN THE B.G. A RYDER RENTAL TRUCK.

ANGLE.   ON PINCUS AND BLANE, AS A LONG ASSEMBLY TABLE.

BLANE HOLDS A LEGAL PAD, AND IS MAKING NOTATIONS ON IT.

HE SPEAKS TO PINCUS, AS CAMERA PANS OVER THE TABLE, HOLDING ON
BLANE'S HANDS AS HE CHECKS THE VARIOUS PROPS.

WE SEE: A SECURITY GUARD'S UNIFORM. A LEATHER BADGECASE, HOLDING
A GOLD BADGE, SEVERAL SMALL METAL CANNISTERS, A TOOLKIT, A UTILITY
BELT HOLDING TOOLS. SEVERAL WALKIE TALKIES.

PINCUS AND BLANE CONVERSE, V.O.

                       PINCUS
          The thing of it is, the thing of it is, it's
          a question of redistribution...

                        BLANE
          How's that?

                       PINCUS
          The question: how do we get the money from
          there to here... it's just a question in
          logistics.

                       BLANE
          "What is the robbing of a bank, compared with
          the founding of a bank?"

                       PINCUS
          Who said that?

                       BLANE
          Anybody ever applied for a loan.

ANGLE

ON THE TWO, AS BLANE HANDS THE CLIPBOARD TO PINCUS.

                       PINCUS (cont'd)
          ...load it up?

                                                                  41.


BLANE NODS. THEY BEGIN HAULING THESE PROPS AND SUPPLIES INTO THE
TRUCK, AND LOADING THEM INTO THE "FALSE" (HOLLOW) ENGINE.

BLANE LOOKS OUT OF THE BACK OF THE TRUCK.

ANGLE, HIS POV.   A CAR PULLS UP OUTSIDE THE SHED.   BELLA GETS OUT.

ANGLE

ON BELLA, AS HE WALKS INTO THE SHED.   HE TAKES OUT AN ENVELOPE.

ANGLE, ON BLANE, WHO OPENS THE ENVELOPE.    TO REVEAL CASH INSIDE.

                      BELLA
         ...expenses for the truck, and...

                      BLANE
         Yeah, I got it. I got it.     Okay.

BELLA WALKS OFF, AS FRAN ENTERS FROM THE "LIVING" AREA OF THE
BOATSHED, HOLDING TWO CUPS OF COFFEE.

FRAN STARTS TO OPEN HER MOUTH, SMILING, AS HE STARTS TO PUT DOWN
THE CUP OF COFFEE, MOORE GIVES HER AN INFINITESSIMAL SHAKE OF HER
HEAD. AND MOTIONS TOWARD BELLA. FRAN NODS IN AGREEMENT, AND, NOT
BREAKING HER STRIDE, WALKS TOWARD BELLA.

                      BELLA
              (TO FRAN)
         Well, then...

                      FRAN
         ...that's right.
              (PAUSE)

                      BELLA
         ...long time.
              (PAUSE)

                      FRAN
         ...that's right.

ANGLE

ON MOORE, LOOKING AT THEM.

ANGLE, HIS POV:

BELLA AND FRAN, IN THE B.G., BELLA CHATTING FRAN UP.

ANGLE

ON BLANE AS HE WALKS OVER TO MOORE, AT THE WELDING STATION.     HE
HANDS MOORE THE ENVELOPE.

                      BLANE
         The plan gonna work?

                                                               42.


                      MOORE
         It's gonna work if we make it work.   How's
         Fran doing?

                      BLANE
         Looks like he maybe wantsa take her to the
         Prom.

MOORE SMILES, AND NODS.

                      MOORE
         Well, it's always the pretty girl stays
         home, innit?

                      BLANE
         Izzat what they said in the White
         Community...?

                      MOORE
         That's what I hear.

                      BLANE
         And I hear, if you get a goose, it keeps the
         fox off the chickens.
              (LOOKS AT FRAN AND BELLA)
         What does that lady see in you, by the way?

                      MOORE
         I'm very resilient.

                      BLANE
         Yeah, so's Gumby.

                      MOORE
         I got a more striking profile.

PINCUS WALKS UP.   HE AND BLANE WALK ACROSS THE SHOP FLOOR, BLANE
LIMPS SLIGHTLY.

                      BLANE
         They're gonna leave that on the cutting room
         floor, Buenos Aires.

                      MOORE
         I never liked the way I looked anyway...

                      PINCUS
              (AS HE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER AT
               FRAN AND BELLA, SOTTO)
         ...seems to be coming along nicely.

                      BLANE
              (SOTTO)
         My boy there, like to Fertilize the Flowers.

                      PINCUS
         ...how's your leg?

                                                                43.


                      BLANE
         You should see the other guy...

                      PINCUS
              (TO MOORE)
         ...when we do the switch, the Highway...

MOORE SHAKES HIS HEAD, INDICATING BELLA.

                      PINCUS (cont'd)
         ...he can't hear...

                      MOORE
         ...he can't hear what you don't say...

                      PINCUS
         I'm gonna be as quier as an ant pissing on
         cotton.

MOORE FIRES UP THE TORCH, AND BEGINS CUTTING AGAIN.

ANGLE, IN THE B.G. FRAN AND BELLA.

BLANE WALKS PINCUS AWAY FROM MOORE.

                      BLANE
              (SOTTO)
         Don't think it, Baby. Don't think it: Don't
         be as quiet as an ant pissing on cotton, don't be
         quiet as an ant thinking about pissing on
         cotton. You be quiet as an ant not even
         thinking about pissing on cotton.

THEIR WALK TAKES THEM TO BELLA AND FRAN.    FRAN IS LAUGHING.

                      FRAN
         ...our friend was telling me "What Made Him a
         Criminal..."

                      BLANE
         I'll get the beer and pretzels.

                      BELLA
         ...what made you a criminal?

                      BLANE
         Nobody made me a criminal.     I am a Criminal.

MOORE WALKS OVER.

                      MOORE
         How we doing?

HE GATHERS THEM AROUND A TABLE.

                      BLANE
         How you doing?

                                                               44.


                       MOORE
          I'm done.
               (PAUSE)
          Well, that's it them.

MOORE GETS UP, CAMERA TAKES HIM TO THE RYDER TRUCK. HE OPENS THE
BACK, AND WE SEE HIM OPEN WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE SOLID MOTOR, WHICH
IS REVEALED TO BE HINGED AND HOLLOW.

BLANE FOLLOWS HIM, AND HANDS HIM SEVERAL FIREARMS, WHICH HE
SECRETS IN THE HOLLOW SPACE.

                       MOORE (cont'd)
          You got the detonators?

BELLA HOLDS UP SEVERAL PUTTY COLORED PACKAGES OF PLASTIQUE, WHICH HE
TAKES OFF OF THE TABLE, BEARING THE PROPS.

                       BELLA
          ...din we check'em?

                       MOORE
          I know we checked'em. What I'm doing, I'm.
          I'm asking you a question.

                       BELLA
          What happened to Check It an Forget it?

                       MOORE
          Yeah, well, I went to the Other camp, which
          is Fuss it to Death, and Fuck it into a
          Cocked Hat, or do you want to run the
          show...?

PAUSE.   THEY EXCHANGE A LOOK.

BELLA WALKS AWAY SHAKING HIS HEAD.

                       BLANE
          Then we ready to Go Do it?

                       PINCUS
          I'm ready to go do it, you know why? I never
          liked the Swiss in any case. You know
          why? They make those little clocks, two
          cocksuckers come out of them, little
          hammers, hit each other on the head.
               (PAUSE)
          What kind of sick mentality is that?

ANGLE, ON BLANE AND BELLA, AS BELLA LOOKS OVER AT MOORE.

ANGLE.   ON BELLA, AS HE WALKS OVER TO FRAN.

THEY BOTH LOOK BACK AT MOORE, WHO IS LOADING UP THE TRUCK.

                       BELLA
          Z'he gonna hold up?

                                                              45.


                      FRAN
         Why would you put a man in a position, he's
         got no way out?

                      BELLA
         What is that, your philosophy?

                      FRAN
         That's right.

                      BELLA
         ...what is it to you?

                      FRAN
         ...he's my Husband.

                      BELLA
         Whose fault is that, you wanna think about
         it? Listen:...

                        MOORE
                (IN THE B.G.)
         I...

ANGLE, ON BELLA, AS HE TURNS.

                      BELLA
         ...you gonna make an Impassioned Speech?

                        MOORE
         Yeah:    Let's go get the money.

                      BLANE
              (TO BELLA AND PINCUS)
         You clean the place down, n'y'thing'll burn,
         burn it..., nobody's coming back here, nothing
         that we need, don't leave it f'somebody else.

PINCUS LIGHTS A FIRE IN A 55 GALLON DRUM.

ANGLE, ON MOORE, AS HE WALKS TO THE FRONT OF THE SHED, AND LOOKS
OUT AT HIS BOAT.

FRAN COMES UP BEHIND HIM.

                      FRAN
         Z'it gonna work?

                      MOORE
         It's either gonna be a monumental heist, or a
         real amusing anecdote.
              (PAUSE)

                      FRAN
         ...I love you, Joe...

                        MOORE
         Why?

                                                              46.


                      FRAN
         You know why? Because you're thorough.

                      MOORE
         I hope to tell you...

SHE TURNS TO WALK BACK INTO THE SHED. HE TURNS TO LOOK AT HER.
IN THE B.G. WE SEE PINCUS FEEDING PAPERS INTO THE FLAMES.

ANGLE. EXT THE BOATSHED, ON THE GROUP, BLANE MOORE, PINCUS AND
BELLA, AS THEY WALK TOWARD THEIR CARS.

PINCUS IS ON THE PHONE IN THE B.G. (ON A CELLPHONE)

MOORE STOPS TO LOOK AT HIS BOAT.

                      BELLA
         You gonna miss it?

                        MOORE
         What?

                        BELLA
         Your boat?

                      MOORE
         Well, it's a nice boat.

                      BELLA
         Hey, baby, after this job, you're gone have
         enough money, make this look like a Boat inna
         Bathtub.

                      MOORE
         That's right.

PINCUS GOES TOWARD MOORE EXCITEDLY.

                      MOORE (cont'd)
         ...what is it?

                      PINCUS
         ...they found the car.

                        MOORE
         ...what car?

                      PINCUS
         ...the car we used at the Overpass. The cops
         found it, I heard it on the police band.

                      MOORE
         ...they found it, how'd they find it?    I tole
         you to it? I tole

         You sonofabitch, what do you mean, you stopped
         off to see your...

         Man, you din't wipe it down, they're gonna

         ...I'm sorry, Joe.

                      MOORE
         Shut up. The job stands.
              (HE LOOKS AROUND)
         This joint is burnt.

                      BLANE
              (TO BELLA)
         Come with me...

                      MOORE
         Meet at the Overpass.

                      BELLA
         ...the job stands...?

                      MOORE
         The meet at the overpass.   The 14th...

         Joe.   Joey, I...

                      MOORE

                      PINCUS
         ...I don't see how they could of found the
         car...

BLANE STARTS MOVING BELLA OVER TO A CAR.

                                                               48.


                       BELLA
               (AS HE GETS INTO A CAR)
          You go on...

WE SEE BELLA AND BLANE, IN TWO SEPARATE CARS, BEGIN TO DRIVE OFF.
WE SEE MOORE, IN FOREGROUND, BEGIN TO WALK BACK TOWARD THE
BOATSHED, AND PINCUS, IMPLORING, HANGING ON HIS ARM.

ANGLE, TIGHT ON PINCUS AND MOORE.

                       PINCUS
          Joe. Joe, I swear to God.      I swear to God,
          I... are they gone...?

                       MOORE
               (LOOKS OVER PINCUS SHOULDER)
          They're gone.

                       PINCUS
          Well, then, you get gone, too.

                       MOORE
          ...that's right.

BEAT.   THEY EMBRACE.

MOORE TAKES OUT THE MONEY ENVELOPE.

                       PINCUS
          You take care, Pally.

                       MOORE
          You get his cut to Bobby...?
               (PINCUS NODS)

                       PINCUS
          You gonna be Okay?

                       MOORE
          I'm okay now.

                       PINCUS
               (OF THE ENVELOPE)
          Yeah? What do you do for cash?

                       MOORE
          ...we're taking down the Boat guy.

                       PINCUS
          You're taking down the boat guy...

                       MOORE
          That's right.

                       PINCUS
          That's your case money...

                      MOORE
         It's enough, get us away...

                      PINCUS
         And then Aloha.

                      MOORE

      PRODUCES SEVERAL SMALL FOLDERS)
What'm'I, going to go leaving papers in the
hands of some lame? Are you kidding me...?
He said what?

             MOORE
He said that's why he came back.

             FRAN

           Well, no, but as Rational Men, don't we
           have to "doubt" her?

                        BELLA
           She thinks the guy's weak, he's scared, she's
           scared, I think she's sincere.

MOORE FALLS TO THE PIER, GRASPING HIS SHOULDER, HE GETS SLOWLY UP,
AND FACES BERGMAN, AND THE THUGS, WHO STAND ON THE PIER ALONGSIDE
THE SAILBOAT. MOORE LOOKS AROUND.

                        BERGMAN (cont'd)
         And then   where is he now. Your  running buddy?
         No, It's   all over, and I need to know:
         Where Is   The Gold. I hate to do  anything as
         dramatic   as "counting to Three," but... ONE:
                        (MORE)

                                                                  120.


                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
              (HE HOLDS OUT HIS HAND. A
               HENCHMAN PUTS A PISTOL INTO IT.)

AS HE SPEAKS, MOORE KEEPS TURNING, SO THAT THE SUN IS BEHIND
MOORE, AND SHINING INTO THE EYES OF BERGMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES,
WHO NOW STAND WITH THEIR BACKS TO THE BOAT.

                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
         Two... why must you, oh, God, why in the
         world must you, why in the hell, a guy like
         you, would you put me in a position... Aahh,
         the Hell with it, life is too short, you
         know what? Fuck you...

HE RAISES HIS ARM TO FIRE. BEHIND HIM WE SEE BLANE EMERGE FROM THE
SAILLOCKER ON THE BOAT'S DECK, BLANE HOLDS A SHOTGUN. HE SHOOTS
BERGMAN AND THE TWO THUGS, ONE OF THE THUGS TURNS AND FIRES AT
BLANE, WHO IS WOUNDED. BLANE FIRES AGAIN AT THE THUG, AND STUMBLES
ON TO THE PIER, AND FALLS BACKWARD INTO THE WATER BETWEEN THE BOAT
AND THE PIER.

ANGLE

ON MOORE, WHO MOVES JERKILY,     TO THE SIDE OF THE PIER. HE TRIES
TO PUSH THE BOAT AWAY, TO GET     TO BLANE IN THE WATER. HE UNTIES
THE LINE WHICH HOLDS THE BOAT     TO THE PIER, AND PUSHES THE BOAT
AWAY. HE THROWS THE LINE TO      BLANE, WHO USES IT TO LIFT HIMSELF UP
ONTO THE PIER.

THE TWO MEN SIT FOR A MOMENT, CATCHING THEIR BREATH.

                      MOORE
         How you doing?

                         BLANE
         I'm leaking?
              (PAUSE)
         You hurt?

MOORE NODS. HE STANDS, AND HELPS BLANE TO HIS FEET. MOORE PICKS
UP THE SHOTGUN. THEY LOOK AROUND, BEHIND THEM, THE SAILBOAT IS
DRIFTING OUT TO SEA.

THEY START DOWN THE PIER. STEPPING OVER ONE OF THE BODIES OF THE
THUGS. THE SECOND THUG LOOKS UP.

                         THUG
              (WEAKLY)
         I... I...

BLANE KICKS HIS BODY OVER THE SIDE OF THE PIER, INTO THE WATER.

MOORE STEPS OVER THE DYING BERGMAN.

                       BERGMAN
         Cute.   Very cute.

MOORE WALKS OVER HIS BODY, AND HE AND BLANE CONTINUE DOWN THE
PIER.

                                                                  121.


                      BERGMAN (cont'd)
         Don't you want to hear my dying words...?

MOORE TAKES THE SHOTGUN FROM BLANE, AND STEPS BACK TO BERGMAN.

                       MOORE
         I just did.

HE SHOOTS BERGMAN, HANDS THE SHOTGUN BACK TO BLANE, AND THE TWO
HEAD OFF, HELPING EACH OTHER DOWN THE PIER.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT INDUSTRIAL DINER. DAY.

MOORE, HIS ARM IN A SLING, NOW WEARING A BEARD, SITTING IN A BOOTH,
DRINKING COFFEE.

                       BLANE
              (VO)
         I hear...

MOORE LOOKS UP, BLANE, WALKING WITH A CANE, SLIDES INTO THE BOOTH
OPPOSITE HIM.

                      BLANE (cont'd)
         I hear if you put milk into it, it lesses the
         chance of stomach distress.

                      MOORE
         Hey, you can't worry about every little
         thing...

THEY BOTH SIT, LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW.

A WAITRESS COMES BY WITH A COFFEEPOT.

                       WAITRESS
         Heat it up?

                      MOORE
              (AS HE RISES)
         No, I think we gotta be moving on.

ANGLE EXT THE DINER, AS THE TWO WALK ACROSS AN INDUSTRIAL AREA.

                      BLANE
         Too bad about Pinky.

                      MOORE
         Ain't that so.

                      BLANE
         ...always made me laugh.

                                                              122.


                      MOORE
         Well, what more can you say of anyone?

                      BLANE
         Nothing...

BEAT. THEY CONTINUE WALKING ACROSS THE STREET TO REVEAL THEY ARE IN
THE INDUSTRIAL AREA OUTSIDE THE BOXING GYM. THERE ARE MANY KIDS
PLAYING IN THE STREET.

                      BLANE (cont'd)
         Robert the Bruce...

                      MOORE
         Yeah?

                      BLANE
         Why'd they call him Robert "The" Bruce...

                      MOORE
         ...what?

                      BLANE
         Why'd they call him Robert "The" Bruce?
              (PAUSE)

                      MOORE
         Because he asked them to.

BLANE NODS.

                      BLANE
         Y'go to that Plastic Surgeon, don't lettem put
         you all the way under. I knew a guy in
         Statesville, went to get his face fixed, woke
         up, sucker'd given him a pair of tits.

                      MOORE
         Yeah, that's no bargain.

                      BLANE
         Well, he landed back inside, he never had to
         want for Cigarettes...

BLANE TAKES OUT A SLIP OF PAPER, AND HANDS IT TO MOORE.   MOORE LOOKS
AT IT.

                      MOORE
         Send your cut there...?

                      BLANE
         Wire it there, when you get where you're
         going.

                      MOORE
         That I will, Pal.

                                                                123.


                      BLANE
         I hear it's nice down there in the Sun.

                      MOORE
         Zat where I'm going?

                      BLANE
         Wherever it is, Brother, don't come back.
              (BEAT. MOORE NODS.)

BLANE EMBRACES MOORE. BEAT. BLANE HANDS HIM THE KEY TO THE
GARAGE. AND WALKS OFF. WE SEE BLANE WALK ACROSS THE STREET, A
CONVERTIBLE PULLS UP, DRIVEN BY A VERY BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN. BLANE
GETS INTO THE PASSENGER SEAT AND MOTIONS HER TO DRIVE.

ANGLE C.U. MOORE LOOKING ON.

ANGLE: HIS POV, ON BLANE'S CAR, AS IT DRIVES OFF, BLANE TURNS BACK
TO LOOK AT MOORE ONE LAST TIME, THEN SHRUGS AND TURNS FORWARD.

ANGLE, ON MOORE, AS HE WALKS ACROSS THE STREET, TURNS A CORNER AND
STANDS BEFORE A GARAGE DOOR.

MOORE USES THE KEY AND OPENS A SMALL DOOR SET INTO THE OVERHEAD
DOORS OF THE GARAGE. HE ENTERS THE DARK GARAGE.

ANGLE INT THE GARAGE.

A NEWISH TRUCK, WITH A LARGE ENGINE LASHED ONTO ITS BED. THE ENGINE
IS PAINTED IN FRESH BLACK PAINT. BEHIND IT, THE OLD BATTERED PICKUP
TRUCK, UP ON A JACK, ITS BED FULL OF THE RUSTED PIPES OF THE
DISCARDED BOXING EQUIPMENT, AND THE OLD ROTTEN LEATHER "HEAVYBAG."
MOORE TAKES OUT A PACK OF CIGARETTES AND A LIGHTER, HE IS ABOUT TO
LIGHT A CIGARETTE, WHEN HE LOOKS OVER AT THE NEW TRUCK.

HE PUTS THE CIGARETTES DOWN ON THE OLD TRUCK, BENDS   DOWN, AND PICKS
UP A CAN OF BLACK PAINT. HE WALKS TO THE NEW TRUCK    AND APPLIES
TOUCHUP PAINT TO THE ENGINE LASHED IN THE BACK. HE    NODS AT IT,
AND THEN, SATISFIED, HE TAKES A TARP AND COVERS THE   ENGINE.

HE GETS INTO THE NEW PICKUP TRUCK AND STARTS IT.

WHILE IT WARMS UP HE GOES TO THE FRONT OF THE GARAGE, WIPING THE
BLACK PAINT OFF OF HIS HANDS WITH A RAG. HE RAISES THE SHED DOOR,
TO REVEAL FRAN STANDING THERE.

HE SMILES AND KISSES HER AND TAKES HER BACK TOWARD THE NEW PICKUP
TRUCK. HE OPENS THE PASSENGER DOOR.

                      MOORE
         Yeah, I knew you'd show.

                      FRAN
         Good, good plan, baby...

                      MOORE
         Yeah, I wouldn't clear my throat, without a
         backup plan...

                                                              124.


                      FRAN
         That's the right way to do it.

                      MOORE
         End of the day, though, end of the day,
         what's the important thing...?

                      FRAN
         That's right.

                      MOORE
         What's the important thing...?
              (PAUSE)

                      FRAN
         Shame about Pinky...

                      MOORE
         You heard.
              (OF TRUCK)
         Come on, get in.

                      FRAN
         Y'all loaded up?

HE LIFTS THE TARP TO REVEAL THE ENGINE, COATED IN BLACK PAINT,
SITTING THERE. HE RECOVERS IT.

                      MOORE
         C'mon, get in, we'll talk on the road.     You
         heard about Pinky...

                       FRAN
         Yeah.   I heard. I'm sorry about that.

                      MOORE
         Yeah, well, it just went bad there, that
         little bit. Dinnit...?

                        FRAN
         Yes, It did.

MOORE TOUCHES THE BRUISE ON HIS HEAD.

                      MOORE
         ...yes, it did... it got kind of convincing.

                      FRAN
         ...and, so, you got hurt.

                      MOORE
         Well, you can't do it halfway, can you...?

                      FRAN
         No, anything you do, you got to do full-out.
         Don't you?

                                                               125.


                      MOORE
         Indeed you do.

                      FRAN
         And, sometimes...
              (PAUSE)

                      MOORE
              (TOUCHES HIS FOREHEAD, AND THE
               BRUISE, WINCES)
         Then, that's just the Price.

                      FRAN
         That's right. That's what you taught me.
         That's part of it.

                      MOORE
         Well, but didn't you do great. Played it down
         to the last recorded syllable...

                      FRAN
         I went to a good school.

                      MOORE
         Never seen it done n'y better.   You hotwalked
         that dude so good.

                      FRAN
         ...thank you, Joe.

                      MOORE
         Cooled him out the livelong day.   You made it
         look so real.

HE MOVES TO THE FRONT OF THE SHED. AND TURNS OUT THE LIGHTS.    HE
WALKS BACK TOWARD FRAN, WHO IS STANDING AT THE TRUCK.

                      MOORE (cont'd)
              (TO HIMSELF)
         ...yes, you did.

                      FRAN
         Well, you know...
              (PAUSE)

                      MOORE
         ...what d'you mean, "that's part of it?"

                      FRAN
         I don't get you?

                      MOORE
         I was talking about Pinky.

                     FRAN
         Uh huh.

                                                                  126.


                      MOORE
         I said we paid the price.         And you said.   We
         paid part of it.
              (PAUSE)

                        FRAN
         Yes.    That's right.

                      MOORE
         ...what's the rest of it...?
              (PAUSE)
         What's the rest of it...?

ANGLE XCU MOORE.   AS HE LOOKS AT FRAN.

ANGLE

FRAN, AS SHE LOOKS BEYOND MOORE.

ANGLE ON MOORE AS HE TURNS.       BELLA IS STANDING BEHIND HIM.

BELLA HOLDS A PISTOL. HE MOVES TO MOORE, AND HE FRISKS HIM, AND
FINDS NOTHING, AND TAKES A STEP AWAY.

ANGLE, ON MOORE, AS HE LOOKS FROM BELLA TO FRAN.

                          MOORE (cont'd)
         Oh.

         Well. They don't always leave with the Ones
         they came In with.

                (PAUSE)
         Oh.

BELLA LOOKS AT THE TRUCK.     HE LOOKS INQUIRINGLY, AT FRAN.

                      FRAN
              (TO MOORE)
         It was dead, anyway.
              (PAUSE)
         You know it was.

                          MOORE
         Was it...?

              (TO BELLA)
         ...it's in the back.

BELLA WALKS TO THE BACK OF THE TARP, RAISES A CORNER, LOOKS IN.

HE LOOKS AT HIS HANDS, AND TAKES OUT A HANDKERCHIEF, AND WIPES OFF
THE BLACK PAINT. HE LOWERS THE TARP DOWN.

                      MOORE
              (OF BELLA)
         Why dun' he shoot me?

                      FRAN
         Cause it's over. It's all done.    That's the
         deal.

                      MOORE
         He ain't gonna shoot me?

                        FRAN
         No.

                      MOORE
         Then he hadn't aughta point a gun at me.
              (PAUSE)
         It's insincere...

MOORE SITS DOWN ON AN UNOPENED WOODEN BOX, IN THE DOORWAY OF THE
GARAGE.

         I'm sorry, Baby.

         Hmm.

                      MOORE
         It was a pretty plan, though, wunnit...?

                      FRAN
         Cute as a Chinese baby...

                      MOORE
         Thanks for everything.

                      FRAN
         You'll be alright.

         You take care.
              (TO BELLA)
         Alright, let's go.

THE TRUCK DRIVES OFF.

ANGLE

ON MOORE, AS HE SLOWLY SHAKES HIS HEAD.   HE SIGHS.   HE WALKS BACK
INTO THE SHED.

                                                               129.


HE WALKS TO THE OLD ABANDONED PICKUP, WHERE HE LEFT HIS CIGARETTES
AND LIGHTER. HE TAKES OUT A CIGARETTE, AND HOLDS IT TO HIS LIPS.
HE HESITATES. HE CRUMBLES IT, AND THROWS IT TO THE FLOOR. LOWERS
THE PICKUP TO THE GROUND, USING THE HYDRAULIC JACK.

HE SIGHS, AND SLAMS THE TAILGATE ON THE OLD METAL FRAME OF THE
BOXING EQUIPMENT. THE TAILGATE DOES NOT CLOSE. HE SLAMS IT AGAIN.
AND IT CLOSES.

HE WALKS OVER AND GETS IN THE CAB OF THE OLD PICKUP.

ANGLE

THE OLD METAL FRAME IN THE BED OF THE PICKUP TRUCK. WE SEE THAT THE
TAILGATE HAS JAMMED ONTO THE OLD METAL PIPES, AND THE PIPE'S PAINT
HAS CHIPPED TO REVEAL THAT THE PIPE IS GOLD, AND WE SEE, ON
THE BASE OF THE PIPE, WHERE THE PAINT HAS CHIPPED, FAINTLY, THE
LETTERS CREDIT INTERNATIONAL DE GENEVE.

ANGLE

ON MOORE, IN THE TRUCK, AS IT PULLS OUT OF THE GARAGE.

                                                         FADE OUT.
