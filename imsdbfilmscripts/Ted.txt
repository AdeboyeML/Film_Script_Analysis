          As the Universal logo completes itself, we begin to
          slowly push in on the East Coast of the United States.
          The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through
          the clouds, closer and closer, until we begin to see
          large patches of snow covering the upper coastline. It's
          winter. We continue to push in, until we arrive at one
          small suburban neighborhood. Over the push-in, we hear
          the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           It has been said that magic vanished from
           our world a long time ago. And that
           humanity can no longer fulfill its
           desires through the power of wishes.
           To those who have lost the wondrous
           vision of childhood eyes, submitted here
           is the story of a little boy, and a
           magical Christmas wish that changed his
           life forever.

          ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple
          stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's
          evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's
          been around for three decades. He and John, who sits
          next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them.
          John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too-
          worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a
          box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful,
          he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the
          remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity
          Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much,
          though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that
          this is a guy who has never really given up his
          childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. Ted
          passes the bong to John.

          wrapping his whole body around John's face and head, like
          the facehuggers from "Aliens." John stumbles around the
          room, trying to pry Ted off. Eventually, he stumbles
          into the bathroom, and crashes through the shower door,
          shattering it. He and Ted exchange punches to the face.
          John lands a particularly hard one, which sends Ted
          flying across the room, and slamming into the wall. Ted
          hits the floor, and runs out of the bathroom. John
          stumbles to his feet. Ted scrambles across the bed,
          reaches into the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Bible.
          John staggers out of the bathroom, just in time to be

          John charges at Ted, sailing across the bed, and tackling
          him, knocking over the side table and lamp in the

          a realistic-as-possible fistfight. Each one gets a

          with his other hand, grabbing at Ted. Ted dodges again,
          and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the
          chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted
          to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles
          backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing
          lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall,
          and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out
          of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord
          catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from
          John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and
          cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down,
          whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the
          bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach,
          clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He
          jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the
          clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor,
          yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his
          bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks
          blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face,
          and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on.

          EXT. OLD BOSTON CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
                         
          John and Lori come running out of the church, as the
          crowd throws rice at them. They run to a waiting limo
          with a "Just Married" sign on the back. John gets in,
          and Lori turns to throw the bouquet toward Gina,
          Michelle, Tracy, and Tanya. Tanya catches it. She turns
          and smiles at Alix. Then suddenly, Tami-Lynn bursts into
          frame, punching Tanya in the jaw. Tanya goes down as
          Tami-Lynn tackles her, and the crowd tries to pull her
          off. ANGLE ON the limo as it pulls away...
