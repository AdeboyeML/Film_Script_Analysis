          EXT. EARTH - DAY (12,000 B.C.)
                         
          The world turns below us, vast and slow.
                         
          A RUMBLE. A shadow sweeps over the land. We move with the
          shadow. We cast the shadow.
                         
          Landscapes slide by. Reduced by altitude to abstractions:
          river deltas, forests and flood plains. A raw natural world.
          No trace of civilization.
                         
          The shadow glides over mountains and glaciers. Across an
          ocean and a pale beach. Over lowland plain at the foot of a
          VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN it stops.
                         
                         
          EXT. LOWLAND PLAIN - DAY
                         
          THREE FIGURES walk out of the shadow.
                         
          They are men - and yet not men. Their skin is snow-white.
          Their features heavy and classical - as if Rodin's Thinker
          had risen from his seat. Their smooth heads are earless and
          hairless. Their glittering eyes entirely black.
                         
          Against the stark land their height is impossible to judge.
                         
          They are ENGINEERS.
                         
          Two of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design.
                         
          The third is naked.
                         
          One of the cloaked Engineers opens a featureless black box:
          inside lies a cake of dark, sticky material.
                         
          The naked one lifts the dark cake with ceremonial slowness.
          It hums and buzzes. Foams into iridescent spheres. He raises
          the seething cake to his mouth like the sacrament.
                         
          BLACK SCARABS boil out of the dark material. Swarm over his
          lips. Glittering insects that chitter and bite.
                         
          Under the swarm his lips melt away. A horrific vision of
          teeth, black blood, dissolving bone. They are devouring him.

          bleed. Protein chains unfold. A DNA spiral unravels.

          ...spreads his arms. Stands cruciform, nearly headless.
                         
          The scarabs swarm his shoulders, his chest. When they reach
          his hips, he collapses sideways, toppling majestically like a
          felled tree. Engulfed.
                         
          The two cloaked Engineers watch impassively.
                         
          Behind them, a vast black SHIP hangs in the sky.
                         
          As if blown by a great gust of wind, the scarabs disperse in
          their millions in all directions. Living DNA on the wing.
          Where the sacrificial victim fell, nothing remains.

          A pristine wilderness. The VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN in the distance.
                         
          A PRIMITIVE WOMAN stands on a height, staring in amazement:
          far off a great dark ship hovers over the plain.
                         
          A black scarab lands on the back of her neck. Bites deep.
          Injecting its cargo of DNA into her blood.

          strands twining and mating.

          Pupils dilating with shock, breath hissing into her lungs.
                         
          She slaps the back of her neck. Looks at her hand. The scarab
          lies in her palm.
                         
          As she watches, it crumbles to dust and blows away.

          An EXCAVATOR floats into view: a sturdy vehicle equipped with
          robotic arms. Bright floodlights beat at the darkness. Inside
          the cockpit - a bubble of glass - sits a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
                         
          This is DR. JOCELYN WATTS, 32, a precocious scholar of many
          disciplines. A scientist accustomed to field work.
                         
          The cockpit is sweltering: she wears shorts, boots, a T-shirt
          - and still her arms and legs gleam with sweat.
                         
          Watts works the controls. The excavator descends toward a
          rocky surface. Silt billows up as the excavator approaches:
          we're not in space at all, but deep underwater.
                         
          The excavator's thrusters are cowled propellers. The "stars"
          are plankton shining in the floodlights.
                         
                         
          INT. EXCAVATOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Watts steers the excavator to a steeply sloping cliff wall. A
          sea-trench yawns below her, its depths lost in darkness.

          She watches the screen of a ground-penetrating radar system.
          A bright signal return: something hidden in the cliff in
          front of her. Something big.

          EXT. SEA TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Watts carves into the cliff with the excavator's digger arm.
          Silt and boulders fall into the yawning trench below. She
          brings a water cannon to bear: uses its jet to blast away
          loose silt and stones.
                         
          The cliff face collapses: a muddy landslide into the deeps.
                         
          Watts backs away from the collapse, thrusters whirring to
          keep her out of the turbulence. A cloud of silt clears.
                         
          In her floodlight beams, the OBELISK stands revealed - its
          outlines worn by the ages. Easily thirty feet tall.
                         
          Watts stares at the obelisk, stunned. Her voice is husky:

          At the controls: PROFESSOR MARTIN HOLLOWAY, 48, visionary
          genius and archaeologist. Dark-haired and lean, with the
          rangy build of a frontiersman. He's dressed in work trousers
          and a T-shirt. Stubbly chin.
                         
          He plays his floodlights over the obelisk.

          Scanning the alien text. Suddenly she stops. Grips the
          obelisk with her excavator's arms to anchor herself in place.

          Holloway climbs in. Squeezes into her cockpit. A tight fit.
          He's distracted by her body, pressed so close - but she has
          eyes only for the inscrutable writing outside the glass.

          In the distance, a coastline dotted with villas. The horizon

           And that change coincides with a visit
           by the Engineers. They didn't just

          He swivels back to his desk. Rummages in a drawer.

          He pulls a thick contract out. Drops it in front of Holloway.

          Holloway picks up the contract with the cautious joy of a man
          double-checking a lottery ticket. His voice is husky:

           Anything at all. That's mine.
                         
          Holloway reaches out slowly and picks up the contract.
          Riffles the pages of small-print legalese.

          A glittering formation of white crystals. Diamond on diamond.
                         
          The structures grow more complex as the view widens. Leaves
          and branches of crystal. A shimmering field of white jewels.
                         
          A landscape of white crystals, smooth as snow.

          A black void shot with stars, far from any sun.
                         
          A sturdy prospecting ship forges through space, travel-worn
          but built to last. It carries the Weyland Industries logo.
          The name painted on its hull is MAGELLAN.

          The ship's nerve center and control room. Six control
          stations, empty and quiet. Interior lights dimmed to blue.
                         
          The entire forward bulkhead of the Bridge is a window: wall
          to wall, floor to ceiling.
                         
          At the window stands the android DAVID.
                         
          He gazes at the cosmos with an expression of utter serenity.
          After a long moment he turns away. Massive shutters close
          over the window as he walks off.

          DAVID walks the ship's long central corridor. The ship is
          silent. The lights dimmed to blue. He is alone.

          A long steel room containing a dozen plexiglass sarcophagi,
          six on each side. Sleep freezers. Inside each freezer: the
          shadowy shape of a human body rimed with frost.
                         
          DAVID walks through the compartment, surveying the sleepers.

          documents across the surface with waves of his hands.
                         
          His eyes intent on his work. If he is reading, then he`s
          reading at a speed no human could match.

          We pull away from the frosted crystalline horizon, the smooth
          white curves like snowy fields. Form becomes clear.
                         
          It's the body of a woman. It's Watts.
                         
                         
          INT. HYPERSLEEP FREEZER
                         
          Watts lies asleep in her underwear in a plexiglass freezer.
          Pale. Frost on her skin. Venus sculpted in ice. There are IV
          lines in her elbows and ankles.
           15.
                         
                         
          Shapes move into view beyond her, outside the freezer. FACES.

          All of the freezers are open and empty, save two. Holloway
          lies in one. In the next, Watts. Three men in blue coveralls
          crouch beside Watts's freezer, staring inside.
                         
          They are DOWNS, 30, a lean fidgety crewman. STILLWELL, 40, a
          sturdy fellow with the geniality of a labrador. And KAMAROV,
          26, whose dark, brooding air belongs to a man twice his age.
                         
                          DOWNS
           Look at that.
                         
          Kamarov opens the lid of Watt's freezer. Leans over her.
          Watts stirs in her sleep, a drowsy angel.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           She wakes up slow.
                         
          Watts wakes to find three men looming above her. Disoriented,
          she pulls away. Tangles her hands in her IV lines.
                         
           HOLLOWAY (O.S.)
           Get out of there!
                         
          Holloway's voice cracks like a whip. The crewmen jump back.
                         
          Holloway sits up in the next freezer over. He yanks the IV
          lines out of his arms and legs. Climbs out of the freezer.
                         
                          STILLWELL

           Give us a moment, will you?
                         
          The crewmen file out: Stillwell sheepishly, Downs and Kamarov
          surly. Holloway goes to Watts. Gently removes the IV lines
          from her ankles while she plucks the ones from her arms.
                         
                          WATTS

          Holloway and Watts sit at a table, both a bit hung over. They
          wear civilian clothes. Warmly dressed, they still look cold.
                         
          They nurse mugs of coffee and nibble packaged snack bars.
          Watts hunches over, shivering.

          Two ship's officers enter the room wearing blue coveralls
          with rank insignia: GLASSE, 45, a stocky man with thick black
          hair, and BRICK, 50, a bald man with a bristling mustache.

           undeniable: the Holocene Epoch was
           engineered. Dr. Watts, your genetic
           studies are equally conclusive. Pulses

           strong. I believe in your "Engineers."

          MONA RAVEL, 45, a dour, rangy woman with a plain face, her

          The walls are industrial steel - but the floors are lushly

          lays his hand on over a signal plate - and the terminal

          visible light; calibrated readouts are overlaid on the scene.

          She glances left and right. Jumpy now.
                         
          All is silent. She lifts the map unit. A trace leads off into
          the dark. If Holloway's course before was direct and clear,
          now it is a meandering thread. A drunkard's walk.

          A circular chamber of stunning size - a thousand feet across.

          follows her map into the space in awe.
                         
          Dominating the hangar is a ship: the vast horseshoe-shaped
          vessel familiar from the original film. We will come to know
          it as the JUGGERNAUT. It's at rest on its landing gear.
          Skeletal gangways slanting up to its three massive doors.

          waiting for some connection. The chair is empty.
                         
          Above the chair, a massive telescope-like apparatus juts into

          Four immense coffin-like cockpits are built into the console.
          In each of these a NAVIGATOR - an Engineer - lies long dead.
                         
          But the real spectacle is overhead. The ORRERY:
                         
          The barrel-vaulted ceiling is traced with circular arches of
          some exotic alloy, as if to trace celestial courses.
                         
          The air above the console is filled with spheres of light.
          They are nearly still: but close study reveals them all to be
          in motion, drifting with the movements of the cosmos.
                         
          Watts stares at the Orrery in amazement. Somewhere among
          those heavenly spheres is Earth. Somewhere perhaps the
          homeworld of the Engineers themselves.
                         
          A bizarre sound: a section of blank wall suddenly unravels
          itself, becoming an open door. DAVID walks in, his hand

          He scowls at the bloody track on the bed - and then freezes,
          seeing Watts inside the Med Pod, a vivisected woman. The
          autosurgeon hard at work.
                         
          The parasite crawls into view behind Vigoda. It has already
          trebled in size. He does not see it before it leaps at him.
                         
          He dies in seconds. His throat ripped open. Lies staring at
          nothing. His submachine gun lies beside him.
                         
          Watts's body jerks as manipulators tug and sew at her guts.
          She stares at the dead man in a fog of horror.
                         
          The parasite's skin splits, spraying the carpet with acid.
          Limbs erupt from its shoulders and haunches. Spines from its
          back. Metamorphosis.
                         
          With a crack of carapace, its head swings down from its
          serpentine position. It becomes a devil with an lethal,
          elongated skull. An Alien.
                         
          The Alien turns its head. Looks at Watts inside the Med Pod.
                         
          Her breath catches. She passes out.

          Watts wakes as the oxygen line withdraws from her mouth.
                         
          She looks down, bleary and hurting. Her star-shaped wound is
          stitched closed with mechanically precise sutures.
                         
          The pod releases the restraints securing her arms and legs.
                         
          She takes a deep breath. Looks out - and freezes.

          intravenous lines drop out of her arms.
                         
          Watts realizes the pod is about to release her.

          canopy to hold it closed.
                         
          The Med Pod pulls the epidural needle out of her spine.
          Sprays liquid bandage over the puncture. Watts closes her
          eyes. Grits her teeth as her nerves wake up. Jangling pain.
                         
          She opens her eyes.
                         
          The Alien hunches over Vigoda's body, tearing at his flesh.
                         
          The ventilation hum inside the pod goes quiet. The canopy
          pulls free of Watts's weakened grip. Swings quietly open.
                         
          Watts huddles in the open pod. Naked but for her bandages.
                         
          The Alien she gave birth to is ten feet away. Its spiny back
          to her. Vigoda's gun lies on the floor outside the pod.

          Watts reaches out of the pod with exquisite slowness. Lays
          her hand on the gun. Drags it a few inches closer.
                         
          The Alien turns its pale eyeless head. Watts freezes.
                         
          For a moment time stops.
                         
          The Alien lunges. Watts snatches up the gun and FIRES. Holds
          the trigger down. The Alien jerks and staggers - an eye-
          twisting sight in the strobing muzzle flashes - and falls.
                         
          Watts empties the clip into the thing. Acid gouts from its
          wounds and eats into the deck - until a section of decking
          gives way and falls to the deck below, leaving a dark hole.

          Watts collapses on the rug, cradling her stomach in pain.
                         
          She crawls to Vigoda's desecrated body. With her eyes half-
          averted from the sight, she searches the body. Finds a spare
          ammo clip and jacks it into the gun.

          on the wall, her face drawn with pain. One hand laid over the
          fantastic scar on her abdomen. The gun slung on her shoulder.

          Watts rounds a corner. Finds a workstation left in shambles:
          lockers and chairs overturned. A pool of drying blood.
                         
          Wide smears of blood show where something man-sized was
          dragged out of the puddle - across the floor - up the wall.
          Into the darkness of an open vent.

          But a WHITE-GLOVED HAND seizes the Alien by the neck from
          behind. The Alien gives a whistling hiss as its spine cracks
          under a terrific force.
                         
          Rending sounds as the hard-shelled Alien is torn apart.

          Turning a corner, they freeze.
                         
          Ahead of them in their headlamps, a space-suited figure
          crouches in the middle of the passageway. Doing something

          The label stencilled on the space suit reads FIFIELD. But the
          face is of no human shape. A hideous hybrid of the crewman
          and a hard-shelled Alien, pale and horrific.
                         
          Its helmet has been shattered by the growth of its elongate
          skull. Spines have burst through the suit from within, down
          the crewman's spine. Clawed fingers piercing his gloves.
                         
          Shepherd and Vickers scream. Shepherd's rifle comes up. But
          Fifield leaps with inhuman agility, upward into the darkness.
          Shepherd backs away, headlamp and rifle questing upward.
                         
          Fifield comes out of the darkness behind him. Claws tearing
          deep. Shepherd screams and falls, mortally wounded.
                         
          Vickers runs. Pounding through the dark in blind terror.
                         
          Fifield comes out of the shadows and hammers her to the deck.
          She rolls over, gibbering and begging. The Fifield-thing
          leans close to her faceplate. Its voice is a travesty.

          Fifield from forty feet away.
                         
          Acid sluices over Vickers as Fifield collapses on top of her.

          The Sleeper stands at the far end of the room, hands
          gesturing. In Watts's enhanced sight, it's a vision of glory:
          waves of energy dancing under the Sleeper's touch. Rivers of
          information flowing. He finishes his work as they enter.

          revealed, a towering gargoyle in his flight suit.

          The missiles he hurls at them are almost invisible. Neither
          solid projectiles nor directed energy; more like knots tied
          in the fabric of space itself.
                         
          The first missile crushes Ray like an invisible fist. The

          as it crumples and melts.
                         
          She stands bare-headed in the toxic air. Desperate, she looks
          around with tearing eyes.
                         
          In the distance she sees an intact module of the Magellan.
                         
          She runs for it. Slaps the door switch. Incredibly, it opens.

          Watts steps inside. The airlock closes behind her.
                         
          She finds herself staring at a grand piano. She's in
          Vickers's suite. Its amenities intact, through the floor's a
          few degrees off level. She takes a breath. Good air.
                         
          She walks around. Turning things on. Lights. Music. Surreal
          comforts. She drinks water from the tap.
                         
          She opens the door to Vickers's secret room. Military space
          suits. Rifles. Ammunition.
                         
          A crackle from the room's intercom.

                          DAVID

          The storm has passed. The fragments of the Magellan no longer
          burn. The gray world of LV-426 restored.
                         
          The wreck of the Juggernaut looms in the misty distance.
                         
          Watts walks through the wreckage in a military space suit.
          Rifle on her shoulder. Pistol on her hip.
                         
          She pulls a cargo dolly loaded with salvage.

          Watts strips off her space suit. She helps herself to a glass
          of vodka from the bar.
                         
          A chessboard sits atop the grand piano: a game in progress.

          Watts nods. Makes the move on the board. Says nothing.

          Two dozen beams of light rise from the moon, visible even
