          a 1930's musical plays.
                         
          Aaron looks through the security window and sees a DOCTOR
          writing something down and speaking to a PATIENT and a guard,
          KUNEMAN. His ballpoint pen runs out of ink. He shakes it,
          discards it and then reaches into his lab coat pocket for a
          more elegant pen to complete his prescription and signature.
          He glances through the glass at his visitors.

                    clinical psychiatrists. And with
                    each, many different opinions.
                    Loomis reasoned that he was nothing
                    more than pure evil.

                    analysis. Loomis saw Michael as a           
                    beast in the wild. He witnessed
                    human behavior at its most primal,

          Dana takes a paper towel from the dispenser   and walks toward
          the stalls. She uses the tissue to push the   first door open.
          She grimaces and heads to the second stall.   Not much better.
          She continues to the third stall and pushes   the door open.
          It's acceptable.
                         
          She enters the stall, places the paper towel on the bowl,
          pulls down her pants and sits down.
                         
          As Dana sits on the toilet, she sees graffiti scrawled on the
          stalls: "Amazing grace come sit on my face. Don't make me
          cry, I need your... pie"
                         
          She pulls out a pencil, scratches out "pie" and changes it to
          "smile".
                         
          She chuckles to herself as she hears the sound of the

          FOOTSTEPS walk on the tile floor.

          Dana flinches, hears: BREATHING.

          opens.

          "Please pay inside".
                         
          He walks to the check-out and sees that the Mechanic has had
          his jaw broken and his TEETH KNOCKED OUT. His uniform has
          been removed.

          with the hood open and sees the LEGS of the ANOTHER MECHANIC
          protruding out of an office door.
                         
          Aaron grabs a crow bar off the workbench.

          BLOODY, RIPPED OUT TEETH DROP AND SCATTER ONTO THE FLOOR.
                         
          She looks up--
                         
          TWO HANDS grab the top of the stall door. The hands begin
          using force to PULL and PUSH the door.
                         
          She can hear the metal distort under pressure.
                         
          She pulls her pants back on and slides to the ground,
          scrambles to crawl underneath into the succeeding stall...
                         
          Dana crawls on her stomach as the stall door is ripped open
          behind her. As she lies underneath she GETS PULLED BACKWARDS.
                         
          She struggles to hold onto the stall divider.
                         
          TWO HANDS GRIP HER ANKLES.
                         
          She kicks as hard as she can. Her kick frees her. She
          quickly jumps up and shuts the stall door. LOCKS IT.
                         
          The Shape BANGS on THE DOOR.

          in pain.

          Laurie arrives. She uneasily scans the neighborhood;
          surveying the street, the shadows, pumpkins on porches.
                         
          A firecracker POPS and she flinches.
                         
          She turns and sees the silhouette of a small WITCH standing
          way down the street, lighting firecrackers-- POP POP.
                         
          Two more silhouettes join the Witch, a SKULL HEAD and a
          PUMPKIN HEAD, and they turn and run with their candy bags.
                         
          Laurie shifts her eyes... looks upstairs.
                         
          A light turns on in the bedroom window. Hawkins is in the
          window of the crime scene.
                         
          She turns to the window of the next room.
                         
          The Shape stands staring at Laurie. The sight of him makes
          Laurie's heart drop. She GASPS. The look between the two has
          forty years of tension.
                         
          Laurie raises her gun and fires. It's a direct hit at her
          target, but it is revealed that it represents just the           
          reflection of The Shape in a mirror.

          the wall like a ceremonial slaying. The blood from Dave's        
          fresh tattoo oozes from his shoulder.

          They take a beat to find their courage and step to the other

          THE SHAPE IS GONE. Just the gruesome remains of Doctor
          Sartain.
                         
          They don't see The Shape rising from behind them. Behind the
          flashing light of their own squad car. WATCHING.

                    this.

                    spoke about that night... but this
                    is why. We fight to survive. He is
                    a killer. But he will be killed
                    tonight. I've been preparing for
                    this for a long time. And whether
                    you know it or not, so have you.
                         
          Shanah is scared, weeping, but shakes her head `yes'. Laurie
          sees how scared and unprepared her daughter is.

          Shanah sees her mom's eyes welling up. She hugs Laurie.
          Laurie hasn't felt this in years and hugs her as tight as she
          can.

          Allyson moves quickly through the woods. Bloody, tired,
          limping. She grabs a tree to catch her breath.
                         
          She sees the disturbing SILHOUETTES OF MANNEQUINS that Laurie
          used as target practice. Frozen expressions with bullet
          ridden faces all around her.

          Ray plays with the untangled yo-yo that Laurie had at the
          community center. He watches the security camera monitors.
                         
          He sees a police cruiser slowly rolling up to the front of
          the house. It hits a couple of garbage cans and then stops.
                         
          Curious, he gets up and goes to the front door. The door has
          two small windows with color glass. He sees the cruiser with
          lights flashing.

          Ray strains to see Officer Richards in the front seat of the
          cruiser. Ray waves. No response.
                         
          Ray moves toward the car, knocks on the window and then opens    
          the driver's side door.
                         
          What he sees is a mind-blowing moment of horror: Officer
          Richards has his throat slit and Doctor Sartain's pen blade
          jammed through his ear. AND- in his lap sits Officer Francis'
          head...

          Ray loses his balance and takes a step back. He hears the
          familiar wind chimes.
                         
          Ray turns slowly and sees THE SHAPE step up behind him and
          instantly wrap the chain of the wind chime around Ray's neck.
                         
          He chokes and wheezes and swings his arms wildly trying to       
          save himself.

          She steps up to the front door. She looks through the            
          distorted glass of the windows and sees in plain sight...
                         
          THE SHAPE with his back to her, standing perfectly still over
          Ray's body.
                         
          Laurie locks the door, cringes as she registers the scene and
          turns away.
                         
          She sees Shanah walk down the staircase.

          Laurie shakes her head and holds her finger to her lips. She
          meets Shanah in the middle of the room.

          Shanah nods through tears and runs to the kitchen. She spins
          the island counter clock-wise. She shares a look with Laurie
          as her mother takes position. Armed at the front door. Is
          this good-bye?
                                                                   90.
                         
                         
          Shanah disappears into the shelter and the island slides
          back, covering the secret door.
                         
          Laurie turns back toward the window with her shotgun to keep
          an eye along The Shape. Before she gets a glance, the glass
          of one window smashes.
                         
          THE SHAPE'S RIGHT ARM reaches through and grabs her by the
          side and then slides to her throat. Her weapon is useless as
          he pulls her into the door.
                         
          THE OTHER ARM punches through the other window and reaches
          desperately for her.
                         
          She spins around until her back is to the door. Her left hand
          reaches up and grabs hold of The Shape's spastic hand.           
                         
          With her right hand, Laurie PUMPS HER SHOTGUN and points it
          toward The Shape's LEFT HAND. He grabs hold of the barrel and
          she pulls the trigger. HIS LEFT HAND EXPLODES. TWO FINGERS
          disintegrated by the blast. His thumb and two others remain.     
          He lets go and his arms retreat.

          Shanah hears footsteps above her. She looks and considers the
          overwhelming arsenal beside her: A crossbow, a semi-automatic
          rifle, a shotgun and a small handgun, etc.
                         
          She grabs the smallest firearm on the wall and walks to the
          base of the ladder as footsteps pace above her.
                         
          She hears the island move aside and the hinges of the door
          lift open.
                         
          She's nervous, but the gun is ready. She pulls the trigger-
          CLICK.

          her shotgun to join her.
                         
          Laurie walks to the wall and exchanges her pump-action
          shotgun for a rifle.
                         
          She flips a circuit breaker to turn the lights off upstairs
          and then flips a switch to slide the island back into place.
                         
          They listen quietly as Laurie loads rounds into the rifle.

          She comes back out and looks toward a living room closet. She
          shoots a hole in it. Listens. Hears weeping in the distance.

          out of a sheath on her belt. The Shape stands with a kitchen
          knife in his hand. A CLASSIC SHOWDOWN.
                         
          He steps off the porch toward her. Laurie looks back and sees
          Allyson stumbling backwards.
                         
          With the mind-set of a mamma bear, Laurie turns back to The
          Shape and charges him.
                         
          Their blades meet. Limbs entangled. The Shape loses blood        
          from his missing fingers, but his momentum is relentless. He
          drives his knife into Laurie's chest. She swings and slices      
          his arm.
                         
          Allyson screams.
                         
          On THE PORCH: We see Shanah slowly opening the front door
          with the POINT OF A HIGH TECH CROSSBOW.
                         
          After a brief struggle, The Shape twists his knife and forces
          Laurie to the ground. He pulls the blade out.
                                                                   93.
                         
                         
          Shanah's eyes swell with fear. Her jaw shakes as she takes
          aim. She considers the shot but instead lowers the crossbow
          in defeat.
                         
          Then Laurie catches her eye from the ground. A neutral           
          expression of control that says everything.
                         
          The Shape lifts his knife back for the deathblow, and before
          it falls, Shanah raises the crossbow and pulls the trigger,
          RELEASES HER ARROW.
                         
          It penetrates The Shape from behind. Underneath his right
          shoulder. The point and beak jut out by inches.                  
                         
          The Shape DROPS HIS knife and pulls the pointer and slides it
          back and forth. He gets to his feet and struggles to remove
          it.
                         
          Allyson walks toward them and grabs the fallen knife.
                         
          She keeps The Shape at bay as she grabs her grandmother under
          her arms and drags her back through the yard.
                         
          The Shape stumbles forward into the woods.
                         
          Shanah runs to Allyson and Laurie. They help her to her feet
          as she bleeds. Nearly unconscious. They put pressure on the
          wound.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
                         
          In a flurry of motion and panic, Shanah and Allyson run with
          Laurie. As they struggle down the long, dark wooded
          driveway, they breathe heavily, exhausted physically and         
          emotionally. Feet drag, bodies strain. The effort is arduous.
                         
          Laurie looks back at The Shape disappearing into the trees.
          She is in and out of consciousness.
                         
                                             LAURIE
                    Kill it. Kill it. It must die.                         
                         
          Her whispers fall on deaf ears.
                         
          Shanah and Allyson miss it in the strain of their efforts.       
          They reach the gate which has been broken open.
                         
          Shanah holds Laurie while Allyson steps into the road and
          looks both ways.
                         
          Hawkins' abandoned squad car in one direction and a pair of
          headlights in the other direction.
                                                                   94.
                         
                         
          Allyson waves her arms as the headlights approach.
                         
          A PICK-UP TRUCK pulls over.
                         
          Shanah lifts Laurie toward the truck.   Allyson helps.           
                         
          THE DRIVER drops the gate of the bed of the truck.
                         
          The driver helps the severely injured Laurie into the truck.
                         
          Her daughter and granddaughter get in, sit beside her and
          hold her tight.
                         
          The truck ROARS INTO DRIVE and speeds down the road.
                         
          The woman rest, stunned and numb and reflective of the night     
          behind them.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
                         
          The Shape, wounded. He pulls the arrow from his chest and
          moves through the forest.
                         
          SIRENS WAIL in the distance. His WHITE mask catching the
          moonlight.
                         
          The Shape comes to a clearing. He turns and looks back in the
          direction of Laurie's house. He watches, BREATHING...
                         
          He touches his chest. Feels his wounds; his missing fingers.
                         
          We reveal that he is standing among the shattered artificial
          faces of mannequins.
                         
          The Shape walks to a tree and takes a seat. His head tilts
          back as his hand presses into his blood stained clothing. His    
          breathing deepens.
                         
          Exhausted, or possibly his last.
