          A grainy, low-resolution view, seen from sixteen inches above
          street level. And we're moving fast -- nauseatingly fast.
                         
          From this angle close to the ground we FLY down a road strewn
          with war garbage: munitions, trash, rubber, animal shit --
          all of which, from this odd, jarring perspective, looks
          gigantic, monstrous.
                         
          We zoom towards a crumpled COKE CAN, the white `C' growing
          enormous on the screen, filling the screen like a skyscraper.

          BRIGHT SUN, and land hard on a packed road.
                         
          We close in on one particular pile of trash, which is topped
          with a white plastic garbage bag, and stop. Puffs of dust
          and fluttering plastic.

          This is all taking place on a dusty stretch of road in a
          quiet section of Baghdad, barren except for a few shops, some
          cement houses and a couple of parked cars.

          IN RESPONSE, THE ARMY HAS DEPLOYED THE LAST OF ITS ELITE BOMB
          SQUAD UNITS, HOPING THAT THESE THREE MAN TEAMS CAN DISARM THE
          BOMBS BEFORE THEY EXPLODE, AND STEM THE TIDE OF DESTRUCTION.

          SEVERAL U.S. INFANTRY SOLDIERS are moving PEDESTRIANS away
          from the bag. Another group of SOLDIERS is clearing out all
          the shops: bakery, sandwich shop, and a butcher shop.
                         
          Next to a parked Humvee, THREE EOD (Explosive Ordinance
          Disposal, aka Bomb Squad) SOLDIERS are crouched over a laptop
          computer, looking at the screen and the same image of the
          metal artillery shell inside the fluttering plastic.
                         
          SERGEANT MATT THOMPSON wipes at the sweat on his forehead.
          This is summer in the desert and the median temperature on
          this bright clear morning is 110 degrees.

          Thompson   tears open a mushy Snicker's. He is fleshy around
          the arms   and middle, but there's real muscle underneath the
          flab and   truth be told, after so many years in EOD, he's lost
          the need   to have a show-off build.

          SERGEANT J. T. SANBORN works the joystick on the laptop. He
          is a strapping Iowa farm boy, with a thick back from bailing
          hay. In contrast to his bulky frame, his face is soft, open,
          kind. He has a relaxed demeanor. Which might lead you to
          think nothing ever bothers Sanborn. But if you thought that,
          you'd be mistaken. Before joining EOD, Sanborn was in
          Military Intelligence. He quit. Military Intel was too easy.

          SPECIALIST OWEN ELDRIDGE is a tall, lanky young man, the
          youngest of the group. He's a fighter like the others but

                     afraid. When you're in a losing

                     you can do is manage your exit.

                     have room to withdraw.

          The roof of the tall building in the distance bobs in and out

          Sanborn fires once. He turns his head away from the gun and

          James inserts the straw into the juice pack.
                         
          He hesitates, not sure if Sanborn will accept the gesture
          after all the hostility that's passed between them. But he
          brings the straw to Sanborn's lips.
                         
          At first, Sanborn keeps his attention on the rifle scope. But
          then he opens his parched mouth, and sips.

          young. The distinguishing lines of the nose and cheeks are so
          covered by bruises and blood and further obscured by the
          shadows and dappled light, that it could be the face of
          almost any young man.

          The dead young man's chest has been cut open. An artillery
          shell is shoved inside the cavity where the heart used to
          beat. Wires protrude from the shell. It's meant to be a booby
          trap, to be placed on a street and elicit as much damage as
          possible.

                     Every person had a magic box. But
                     you couldn't tell they were magic
                     boxes on the outside. Like this
                     one.
                         
          He brings the box close to the child's eyes. The boy is
          dazzled by the colors. He reaches out to touch it.
                                                                                  126

                    It just looks like a plain old box.
                    Then a new king came along and told
                    all the people, you have to give me
                    all your magic boxes. But the
                    people, instead of giving away
                    their boxes decided to hide them.
                    And they put their boxes in secret
                    places all over the kingdom. They
                    put them in the roads. They put
                    them in cars. They put them in
                    buildings. And the King said, (does
                    a King's gravelly baritone) "Well,
                    how am I going to get my magic
                    boxes now?" And one of the King's
                    men said, "We have a special Knight
                    with special armor, and he can find
                    the boxes. And only he.

                    And this Knight gathered up all the
                    boxes, far and wide. And sometimes -
                    - when he wasn't sure if it was a
                    magic box -- he opened them.
                         
          James slowly opens the box, holding the clown in with his
          hand so it doesn't pop. Releasing it slowly.
                         
          The boy giggles and reaches up.

                    And the King said to the Knight,
                    you have done a wonderful job. I
                    will grant you one wish. What do
