Being There - December 16, 1978 Draft



	FADE IN:

	EXT. TOWNHOUSE GARDEN - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

	An afternoon in late November, the leaves have left the
	trees, and the early darkness of a winter dusk approaches.
	The garden is long and narrow, guarded on either side by a
	high brick wall. At one end stands the rear of a three-story
	brick townhouse; at the other, a one story brick building.
	CLASSICAL MUSIC is heard in the distance. A MAN, handsomely
	dressed in a well-tailored suit of the 1920's, works in the
	garden. A gardener's apron protects his suit from the earth
	as he turns the loam along one of the walkways. He works
	slowly,-precisely, obviously engrossed in his surroundings.
	This man is called CHANCE.

	Chance stops working for a moment, takes a pocket watch from
	inside his coat, checks the time. He looks to the darkening
	skies, returns the watch to his pocket. As Chance starts
	toward the one story brick building, he takes a spotless rag
	from his apron pocket and wipes the dirt from the tines of
	his pitchfork.

	INT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON

	The sound of the music increases as Chance enters the garage
	from the garden. A gleaming 1921 TOURING CAR is revealed as
	he walks through the garage and leans the pitchfork against a
	wall. Chance takes a neatly folded cover from a shelf,
	carefully puts it over the car. When he finishes covering the
	car for the night, Chance picks up the pitchfork, leaves the
	garage through a side entry.

	INT. POTTING ROOM - AFTERNOON

	The Potting Room is filled with the tools of the gardener,
	everything arranged in an orderly fashion. Rows of small pots
	are on tables, young plants sprouting from some of them. A
	small, 1940's table model black-and-white TV rests on a
	shelf. It is playing, tuned to the BOSTON POPS ORCHESTRA.
	Attached to the front of the screen is a wheel containing
	colored gels. The wheels spins, creates an early form of
	color TV. As Chance enters, his attention is on the
	television set. He watches it as he oils the tines of the
	pitchfork and puts it away. Chance turns off the TV and
	leaves the room, but the sound of the Boston Pops continues.

	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

	A room adjacent to the Potting Room. A large screen remote
	control color television set dominates the room. It is on,
	tuned to the Boston Pops. In contrast to the new TV, the rest
	of the room is sparsely but tastefully decorated with
	expensive furniture of the twenties. There are no books,
	magazines, newspapers or reading matter of any kind to be
	seen. Chance comes in, watches the TV with a detached gaze as
	he removes his apron. He changes the channel with the remote
	control as he puts his apron and the pitchfork rag into a
	laundry bag. He takes off his suit jacket, hangs it in the
	closet where it is accompanied by several others, all of like
	quality. Chance changes the channel once again.

	EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT

	Chance, wearing a different suit and carrying the laundry
	bag, crosses from the rear building to the main house.

	INT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - NIGHT

	The interior of the main house has the mustiness of age, the
	warmth of oak. White dropcloths and sheets cover all of the
	furniture. Chance enters, walks through the hallway.

	INT. MAIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	A large dropcloth is over the dining room table and chairs.
	It is neatly folded back at one end, leaving one chair and
	place setting uncovered. A small portable color TV is next to
	the place setting.

	Chance enters, puts his laundry bag on a covered table near
	the doorway. He sits at the dining room table, turns on the
	TV, and carefully unfolds his napkin, puts it on his lap as
	he watches the screen. LOUISE, an elderly black maid, enters
	with a tray of food and Chance's clean laundry.

				LOUISE
			(sets dinner before
				Chance)
		... Evening, Chance.

				CHANCE 
			(slowly, perfect diction,
				no accent of any kind)
		... Good evening, Louise.

	Louise sets Chance's clean clothes on the small table, picks
	up his laundry bag.

				LOUISE 
		... The Old Man is getting weaker,
		Chance.

				CHANCE 
			(begins to eat)
		I see.

				LOUISE 
		I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with
		every hour that goes by...

	Chance, his manners impeccable, concentrates on the TV as he
	eats. A buzzer SOUNDS, Louise looks upstairs.

				LOUISE (CONT'D)
		... Back up those stairs - damn...
		That Man's needin' me more and more
		just before he never needs me
		again...

				CHANCE 
			(still watches TV)
		Is his back feeling better?

	Louise gives Chance a look.

				LOUISE 
		... Gobbledegook... You and your
		gobbledegook. You're gonna be the
		death of me yet, Chance...
			(she turns to leave)
		... Unless those stairs are... The
		Good Lord's liable to snatch up two
		unwillin' souls at the same time if
		I keep on trampin' up those
		stairs... I don't want none of
		that...

	Louise disappears through the doorway. Chance continues to
	eat and watch TV.

	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN

	Chance is asleep, lying on his back. His eyes slowly open,
	and, with no change of expression, he sits up and turns on
	the TV with the remote control. Chance gets out of bed, goes
	to the dresser and takes his pocket watch out of a drawer,
	checks the time. He crosses to the closet, his eyes never
	straying from an early morning show on television. He puts on
	a bathrobe and leaves the room.

	INT. POTTING ROOM - DAWN

	Chance enters, turns on the TV with the spinning color wheel,
	then waters a few of the pots with a sprinkling can. He turns
	off the TV and exits.

	INT. GARAGE - DAWN

	Chance comes into the garage, takes the cover off of the
	touring car, folds it and puts it on a shelf. He leaves the
	garage.

	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN

	Chance returns to his room, changes channels on the
	television, takes off his robe and hangs it back up in the
	closet, then goes into the bathroom.

	EXT. GARDEN - MORNING

	A light snow is falling. The door to the small building
	opens, Chance peeks out, then goes back inside. A few seconds
	pass and Chance reappears, this time with an umbrella.
	Smartly dressed in suit and tie, he crosses to the main
	house.

	INT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - MORNING

	Chance opens the door, shakes off and closes the umbrella
	before entering. He hangs the umbrella on a doorknob, then
	heads for the dining room.

	INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING

	Repeating his ritual, Chance enters the dining room, sits,
	turns on the TV, carefully spreads his napkin on his lap. He
	watches the screen for a moment, then turns, expecting
	Louise. She doesn't appear, so he turns back, watches TV.
	After a few beats, Chance hears Louise's footsteps hurrying
	down the stairs. She comes into the dining room, visibly
	distraught. Chance looks up, smiles.

				CHANCE 
		Good morning, Louise.

				LOUISE 
			(out of breath)
		He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's
		dead!

				CHANCE 
			(flatly, turns back to TV)
		... I see.

				LOUISE 
		Must of happened durin' the night,
		I don't know... Lord, he wasn't
		breathin' and as cold as a fish. I
		touched him, just to see, and you
		believe me, Chance - that's doin'
		more than I get paid to do... Then
		I just covered him up, pulled the
		sheet over his head...

				CHANCE 
			(nodding)
		Yes. I've seen that done.

				LOUISE
		Then I got the hell out of that
		room and called the doctor and I
		think I woke him probably, he
		wasn't any too alert. He just said,
		'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and
		said he'd send somebody over...'
		Lord, what a mornin'!

				CHANCE 
			(watches news, flashes of
				season's first snowfall)
		... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in
		the garden today. Have you looked
		outside and seen the snow? It's
		very white.

	A beat of silence from Louise, then anger.

				LOUISE 
		Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to
		say? More gobbledegook? 
			(Chance smiles, is silent)
		That Old Man's layin' up there dead
		as hell and it just don't make any
		difference to you!

				CHANCE 
			(with a smile, accepting
				death)
		Yes, Louise. I have seen it often.
		It happens to old people.

				LOUISE 
		Well, ain't that the truth...

				CHANCE 
		Yes. It is.

	Louise throws back the cover from a chair next to Chance and
	sits, softening a bit toward him.

				LOUISE 
		Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know
		what I was expectin' from you...
		I'm sorry for yellin' like I did...
		No sir, I just don't know what I
		was expectin' ... 
			(Chance doesn't react,
				watches TV)
		... I 'spose I'd better gather up
		some breakfast for you...

				CHANCE 
			(a turn to her)
		Yes, I'm very hungry.

				LOUISE 
			(rises, looks upstairs)
		Well, no more stewin' those prunes
		every mornin', that's somethin', I
		guess... 
			(she starts out, stops by
				the door)
		... what are you goin' to do now,
		Chance?

				CHANCE
			(gazing at TV)
		I'm going to work in the garden.

	Louise gives Chance a long look, then turns to leave.

				LOUISE
			(as she goes)
		... I'll get you some eggs.

	Chance nods in approval, then changes the channel on the TV.

	INT. MAIN HOUSE - SERVANT'S STAIRWAY - MORNING

	An enclosed stairway. Chance enters, proceeds up the stairs.

	INT. MAIN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING

	Chance comes out of a doorway adjoining the main staircase.
	He moves off down the hall.

	INT. MAIN HOUSE - OLD MAN'S ROOM - MORNING

	The furniture in this room is not covered with sheets but the
	Old Man is. There is a polite knock at the door, then Chance
	enters the room. As Chance moves slowly to the Old Man's bed,
	we sense a feeling of respect from Chance, as well as a bit
	of curiosity. Chance stands by the side of the bed for a
	moment, then he reaches down and gently pulls the sheet back
	from the Old Man's face. He touches the man's forehead,
	lightly, briefly, then replaces the sheet. Chance moves to
	the TV (like the one in his own room) and turns it on. He
	sits in an easy chair next to the Old man's bed and watches a
	movie from the early forties. Chance puts an arm out, rests
	it on the Old Man's covered body. With the other, he changes
	the channels with the remote control.
	He returns to the channel with the forties movie and seems to
	become absorbed in a scene in which a gentleman tips his hat
	to a lady. The scene seems to have 'sunk into' his mind.

	EXT. GARDEN - MORNING

	It has stopped snowing. Chance, wearing a hat, the gardening
	apron over his suit and boots, putters in the garden. Louise
	comes out of the main house. She is dressed warmly, a scarf
	over her head, a heavy coat. Chance sees her, tips his hat to
	Louise exactly like the man he saw on television.

				LOUISE 
		... Well, ain't you the gentleman
		this mornin'...
			(a pause)
		... gotta go now, Chance...

				CHANCE 
			(resumes working)
		Yes.

				LOUISE 
		You're gonna need somebody,
		someone's gotta be around for you,
		boy... 
			(he keeps working)
		... You oughta find yourself a
		lady, Chance... 
			(she smiles slightly, with
				caring)
		But I guess it oughta be an old
		lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a
		young one any good, not with that
		little thing of yours... 
			(she reaches out, puts a
				hand on his shoulder)
		... You're always gonna be a little
		boy, ain't you? 
			(he smiles, keeps working)
		... Goodbye, Chance...

	Louise gives his shoulder a squeeze, turns and moves toward
	the house.

				CHANCE 
			(as she goes)
		Goodbye, Louise.

	Louise waves as she enters the townhouse. Chance tips his hat
	once again as she disappears.

	INT. MAIN HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - MORNING

	Louise enters the hallway, picks up a couple of suit cases
	waiting by the door. She stops as she sees TWO MEN in white
	carrying a stretcher down the main staircase. She notices the
	ease with which they bring the Old Man's body down the
	stairs.

				LOUISE 
		... He used to be a big man...
		'Spose he wasted away to about
		nothin'... 
			(a beat - then she talks
				to the body of the old
				Man)
		... I guess I'll be goin' off to
		find me some folks, Old Man... I'm
		not batty enough to stay around
		this neighborhood any longer...

	The stretcher bearers move to the front door. Louise steps in
	front of them.

				LOUISE (CONT'D)
			(to stretcher bearers)
		Wait up! I'm goin' out that door
		first.

	Louise takes one more look at the covered body, then opens
	the front door, leaves.

	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAY

	The TV plays offstage as Chance washes up in the bathroom. He
	finishes, comes into the bedroom, takes a pair of house
	slippers from his closet, turns off the television and leaves
	the room.

	EXT. GARDEN - DAY

	Chance, carrying his slippers, crosses through the layer of
	fresh snow to the townhouse.

	INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

	Chance, wearing the slippers, enters and sits at his place.
	He turns on the TV, puts the napkin on his lap. He watches TV
	for a moment, then turns, looks for Louise. She does not
	appear so he resumes watching TV. He changes channels, views
	a wildly exciting FOOTBALL game. At a peak in the excitement,
	he again switches channels. Chance watches TV News coverage
	of the PRESIDENT of the United States greeting foreign
	dignitaries at the White House.
	CLOSE SHOTS on television reveal that the President uses a
	two-handed handshake when meeting his guests. Unconsciously,
	Chance grips one hand with the other, the scene on TV seeming
	to have 'sunk into' his mind.

	INT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

	A key is heard in the lock. The door opens and THOMAS
	FRANKLIN and SALLY HAYES enter. Franklin, an attorney, is in
	his late thirties, carries a large briefcase. Hayes is
	younger, attractive, also an attorney. She totes a briefcase,
	has the look of a modern, liberated woman. Hayes appears to
	be surprised at the interior of the house.

				HAYES
			(looks around)
		... This is another world, Tom - I
		never would have believed it...

				FRANKLIN 
		Yeah... He and my father used to
		ride together back in the
		thirties... Fox hunting... Before I
		was born...

				HAYES 
		... Would you take me on a tour?

				FRANKLIN 
		Gladly... 
			(he smiles)
		... The safe is in Mr. Jennings'
		bedroom, that'll be stop number
		one.

	Franklin puts a hand on Hayes' shoulder as they,go off down
	the hall.

	INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

	Chance still watches TV, waits for Louise to serve him.
	Franklin and Hayes appear in the doorway of the dining room.
	They are both surprised to see Chance.

				FRANKLIN 
		... Why... Hello, we thought we
		heard something... 
			(moves to Chance, hand
				outstretched)
		I'm Thomas Franklin.

	Chance remains seated, takes Franklin's hand warmly in both
	of his like the President did on TV.

				CHANCE 
		Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the
		gardener.

				FRANKLIN 
			(a beat)
		... The gardener? 
			(thinks it's a joke,
				laughs)
		... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance,
		this is Ms. Hayes.

	Hayes moves to shake Chance's hand.

				HAYES 
		Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to
		meet you.

				CHANCE 
			(doesn't rise, again
				shakes with both hands)
		Yes.

	Chance turns back to the TV and Hayes and Franklin exchange
	looks.

				FRANKLIN 
			(after an uneasy pause)
		... We're with Franklin, Jennings
		and Roberts, the law firm handling
		the estate.

				CHANCE 
			(a smile, totally at ease)
		Yes, Thomas - I understand.

	Another period of silence. Franklin and Hayes seem perplexed.

				FRANKLIN 
		... Are you waiting for someone? An
		appointment?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.

				FRANKLIN 
		Your lunch? You have a luncheon
		appointment here?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.

				FRANKLIN 
		Louise?... The maid?...
			(a look to Hayes)
		But she should have left earlier
		today...

				CHANCE 
			(smiles at Hayes)
		I see...

				FRANKLIN
			(a beat)
		... You've quite a sense of humor,
		Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside,
		may I ask just what you are doing
		here?

				CHANCE 
		I live here.

				FRANKLIN 
		You live here?
			(a look to Hayes)
		... We don't have any record of
		that.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. It's very cold outside today,
		isn't it, Thomas?

				FRANKLIN 
			(a beat)
		... How long have you been living
		here?

				CHANCE 
		Ever since I can remember, since I
		was a child.

				FRANKLIN 
			(doubting)
		Since you were a child?

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Thomas. I have always been
		here. I have always worked in the
		garden.

				HAYES 
		... Then you really are a gardener?

				CHANCE 
		Yes.

				HAYES 
		Your appearance doesn't suggest
		that at all, Mr. Chance.

				CHANCE
		Oh. Thank you.

				FRANKLIN 
		Do you have any proof of your
		employment, Mr. Chance - any checks
		from the deceased, any contracts or
		documents?

				CHANCE 
		No.

				FRANKLIN 
		How were you compensated for these
		duties you say you performed?

				CHANCE 
		Compensated...?

				FRANKLIN 
		How were you paid?

				CHANCE
		I was given meals, and a home...

				HAYES 
		What about money?

				CHANCE 
		I never needed money.

	Franklin steps to the TV, turns it off.

				FRANKLIN 
		Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show
		us some identification with your
		address -- a Driver's License, a
		credit card, checkbook?

				CHANCE 
		No, I do not have any of those.

				FRANKLIN 
		Then how about medical records?
		Could you give us the name of your
		doctor, or your dentist?

				CHANCE 
		I have no need for a doctor or
		dentist. I have never been ill. I
		have never been allowed outside of
		this house, and, except for Joe, I
		have never had any visitors.

				FRANKLIN 
		... Joe? Who's Joe?

				CHANCE 
			(turns TV back on)
		Joe Saracini. He was a mason that
		did some repairs on the brickwork
		at the rear of the house. That was
		in 1952.

				FRANKLIN 
		1952...?

				CHANCE 
			(changes channels)
		Yes. I remember when he came. He
		was very fat and had short hair and
		showed me some pictures from a
		funny little book.

				HAYES 
		Some pictures...?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. Of men and women.

				HAYES 
		... Oh.

				FRANKLIN 
		Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven
		years ago.

				CHANCE 
		Yes and the Old Man used to come to
		my garden. He would read and rest
		there.

				FRANKLIN 
		Come now, Mr. Jennings had been
		bedridden for thirty-five years,
		since he fractured his spine.

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then
		he stopped visiting my garden.

				FRANKLIN 
			(a beat)
		... We shall need some proof of
		your having resided here, Mr.
		Chance.

				CHANCE 
		You have me, I am here. What more
		proof do you need?

	Franklin and Hayes exchange looks.

	INT. TOWNHOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

	Chance puts on his snow-boots as Franklin and Hayes continue
	their questioning.

				FRANKLIN 
		Have you served in the Army?

				CHANCE 
		No, Thomas. But I have seen the
		Army on television.

				HAYES 
		How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely
		you must have paid taxes?

				CHANCE 
		No.

	Chance picks up his slippers and leads the attorneys outside.

	EXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON

	Chance describes his garden with pride as they walk toward
	the rear building.

				CHANCE
			(points)
		Those trees were very young when I
		first arrived.

				FRANKLIN 
		Are you related to the deceased,
		Mr. Chance?

				CHANCE 
		No, I don't think so. And I have
		planted and shaped all the hedges,
		and in the springtime you will be
		able to see my flowers.

				HAYES 
		Might you have a birth certificate,
		Mr. Chance?

				CHANCE 
		No.
			(points to wall)
		That's where Joe fixed the bricks.

	They arrive at the rear building and Chance opens the door to
	the garage. Franklin and Hayes follow him inside.

	INT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON

	Franklin and Hayes are taken aback by the touring car.

				FRANKLIN
			(admires car)
		... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?

				CHANCE 
		No, Thomas. I have never been in an
		automobile.

				HAYES
			(amazed)
		You never been in a car?

	Chance is silent for a moment, he blushes slightly.

				CHANCE 
		... Well... From time to time I did
		sit in it... Just in here... It
		hasn't been outside since the Old
		Man hurt himself.
			(he turns)
		I live in here.

	Chance moves toward his room, Franklin and Hayes follow.

	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Chance sits on the bed to remove his boots as Hayes and
	Franklin inspect the room.

				CHANCE 
		The Old Man gave me nice television
		sets, this one has remote control.
			(he turns it on with the
				remote)
		He has one just like it.

				FRANKLIN 
		Mr. Chance, the fact remains that
		we have no information of your
		having any connection with the
		deceased.

				CHANCE 
		Yes, I understand.

	Chance puts on his slippers, crosses to the closet, opens the
	door. It is filled with men's wear.

				CHANCE 
		I am allowed to go to the attic and
		select any of the Old Man's suits.
		They all fit me very well. I can
		also take his shirts, shoes and
		coats.

				HAYES 
		It is quite amazing how those
		clothes have come back into style.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I have seen styles on
		television.

				FRANKLIN
			(getting back to business)
		What are your plans now, Mr.
		Chance?

				CHANCE 
		I would like to stay and work in my
		garden.

	Chance turns to watch TV. Franklin takes Hayes to a side of
	the room.

				FRANKLIN 
			(quietly)
		... What do you make of all this?

				HAYES 
		I really don't know, Tom - he seems
		so honest and simple... In a way,
		he's quite charming...

				FRANKLIN 
			(looks at Chance)
		... Yeah...

				HAYES 
		... It's very bizarre - I don't
		know what to think...

				FRANKLIN 
		Well... He's either very, very
		bright or very, very dense - he's
		hard to figure...
			(he unzips briefcase)
		... Let's just keep everything
		legal.

	Franklin takes out some papers, approaches Chance.

				FRANKLIN 
		Mr. Chance, assuming what you say
		is the truth, I would like to know
		what sort of claim you are planning
		to make against the deceased's
		estate.

				CHANCE
			(does not understand)
		I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a
		healthy one. There is no need for a
		claim.

				FRANKLIN 
		Good. That's good. Then if you
		would please sign a paper to that
		effect.

	Franklin hands the release to Chance but Chance does not take
	it.

				CHANCE 
		No, Thomas. I don't know how to
		sign.

				FRANKLIN 
		Come now, Mr. Chance.

				CHANCE 
			(smiles)
		I have no claim, Thomas.

				FRANKLIN 
		But you won't sign, correct?

				CHANCE 
		Correct.

				FRANKLIN 
		Very well, Mr. Chance - if you
		insist on dragging this matter
		on... But I must inform you this
		house will be closed tomorrow at
		noon. If indeed, you do reside
		here, you will have to move out.

				CHANCE 
		Move out? I don't understand,
		Thomas.

				FRANKLIN 
		I think you do, Mr. Chance.
		However, I will reiterate, this
		house is closed and you must
		leave...
			(he gives Chance his
				business card)
		Call me if you change your mind
		about signing.
			(turns to Hayes)
		C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...

				HAYES
			(a smile to Chance)
		Good day, Mr. Chance.

				CHANCE
			(returns smile)
		Good day, Sally.

	Chance watches as they leave, then puts Franklin's card on a
	desk without ever looking at it and turns to stare at
	television.

	INT. TOWNHOUSE - ATTIC - AFTERNOON

	A large attic filled with the Old Man's possessions of the
	past. Chance enters, turns on an old black-and-white TV with
	a magnifying lens attached to the front. As it plays, he
	selects a fine leather suitcase from several, takes a hand
	made suit from a long rack.

	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

	The TV is on as Chance packs his belongings.

	EXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON

	Chance, very nicely dressed, comes out of the rear building
	carrying his suitcase. He stops on occasion to inspect his
	garden as he walks toward the townhouse.

	INT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

	Chance is reluctant to open the front door. After some
	hesitation, he gathers up his courage, opens it and steps
	outside, closing the door behind him.

	EXT. FRONT OF TOWNHOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Chance stops short on the front steps; the townhouse is
	situated in a decaying ghetto.
	The snow is a dirty grey, houses adjoining have their windows
	shattered, are smeared with grafitti. Chance tries to return
	to the safety of the townhouse, but the door is locked. He
	stands on the steps for a moment, then moves to the trash
	laden sidewalk. He stops, ponders which way to go, finally
	makes up his mind and moves off to his left.

	EXT. GHETTO STREET - AFTERNOON

	The buildings are crumbling, rusted out cars line the street.
	A group of Black people huddle together in threadbare stuffed
	furniture on the sidewalk, a fire burning between them for
	warmth. Chance rounds the corner, walks up to them. He stands
	by them, smiles. They stare back, no sign of friendship in
	their faces. Chance nods politely to them, then walks away
	down the sidewalk.

	EXT. GHETTO STREET - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

	A group of eight to ten hard-core ghetto youths hang out on a
	corner. Other passersby give them a wide berth, they are
	unapproachable. Chance nears the group, approaches.

				CHANCE
			(friendly)
		... Excuse me, would you please
		tell me where I could find a garden
		to work in?

	They turn to him as one, silent, amazed that this White
	trespasser would intrude on their jiving.

				CHANCE (CONT'D)
			(after a beat)
		... There is much to be done during
		the winter, I must start the seeds
		for the spring, I must work the
		soil...

	One of the Black youths, LOLO, interrupts Chance.

				LOLO 
		What you growin', man?

	The leader of the gang, ABBAZ, shuts up Lolo with an elbow
	and moves menacingly forward.

				ABBAZ 
			(nose to nose with Chance)
		... What you doin' here, boy?

				CHANCE 
		I had to leave my garden. I want to
		find another.

				ABBAZ 
		Bullshit. Who sent you here, boy?
		Did that chickenshit asshole
		Raphael send you here, boy?

				CHANCE 
		No. Thomas Franklin told me that I
		had to leave the Old Man's house,
		he's dead now, you know...

				ABBAZ 
		Dead, my ass! Now get this, honkie -
		you go tell Raphael that I ain't
		takin' no jive from no Western
		Union messenger! You tell that
		asshole, if he got somethin' to
		tell me to get his ass here
		himself! 
			(edges closer to Chance)
		You got that, boy?

	Chance smiles at Abbaz and reaches into his pocket.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I understand. 
			(he takes out his remote
				control TV changer)
		If I see Raphael I will tell him.

	Chance points the changer at Abbaz and clicks it three times,
	tries to change the picture. Abbaz immediately pulls out a
	switchblade, whips the blade open.

				ABBAZ
			(holds knife at Chance)
		Now, move, honkie! Before I cut
		your white ass!

	Chance, disappointed that the changer did not work, returns
	it to his pocket.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. Of course.
			(as he leaves)
		Good day.

	Abbaz, Lolo and the gang watch him go, then begin to buzz
	with excitement: "Who the fuck died?" "Why'd he pull that
	changer on us, man?" "The Old Man died, must be Papa Joe!"
	"He's some weird honkie, man."

	EXT. CHINATOWN - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

	A Bulletin board affixed to a storefront in Chinatown. Chance
	gazes at the notes pinned to it, written in Chinese. Smiling,
	he turns from it, walks on through the area.

	EXT. PORNO AREA - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

	A street lined with adult book stores, X-rated movies and
	strip joints. An elderly Black woman approaches carrying a
	bag of groceries. Chance steps in front of the woman, stops
	her.

				CHANCE 
		I'm very hungry now. Would you
		please bring me my lunch?

	The woman looks up to Chance, becomes very frightened. She
	turns and half-runs into a sleazy bar for safety. Chance
	watches after her for a moment, then continues along.

	EXT. PARK - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

	Chance stands looking through a chain-link fence watching
	some teenage boys playing basketball. He bangs on the fence,
	calls to them.

				CHANCE 
		I have seen your game! I have
		watched Elvin Hayes play it many
		times! They call him "Big E!"

	The boys ignore him, Chance walks away.

	EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

	Chance walks down the center meridian of a divided street. He
	seems oblivious to the automobiles passing on either side. In
	the background can be seen the Washington Monument.

	EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

	Chance seems stumped on which way to go. He looks up one
	street, then the other, has no idea where they lead. He
	turns, looks behind him and sees a large statue of Benito
	Juarez pointing. Chance smiles and goes off in the direction
	that Benito points.

	EXT. REAR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DUSK

	Tourists are gathered around gaping through the fence at the
	White House.
	Chance is turned the other way, inspecting the branches of a
	dying tree. Chance moves to a POLICEMAN standing nearby.

				CHANCE 
		Excuse me...
			(points to tree)
		... That tree is very sick. It
		should be cared for.

	The Policeman looks at the tree, then at Chance, figures a
	man dressed that well must be important.

				POLICEMAN 
		Yes sir. I'll report it right away.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. That would be a good thing to
		do. Good day.

				POLICEMAN
		Good day.

	The Policeman takes out his walkie-talkie as Chance walks
	away.

	EXT. BUSINESS DISTRICT - EVENING

	A fashionable area. Expensive shops, well-kept streets and
	sidewalks. A television store has caught Chance's eye. He
	stands by the display window, looks in at a dozen or so color
	TVs, all turned on, playing various channels. A video camera
	points outward from a corner of the window and is focused on
	the sidewalk to allow potential customers to see themselves
	live on an Advent TV. Chance is intrigued by his own image.
	He poses, lifts one arm, then the other to make sure that it
	is really him on television. He moves forward, smiles, then
	moves slowly backward, notices himself become smaller on the
	screen. He steps back off the curb, frowns as his likeness
	disappears from frame on the Advent. Standing between two
	parked cars, Chance takes out his remote control, clicks it
	at the Advent. Four or five other sets in the window change
	channels, but he does not reappear on the giant screen. As he
	does this, the car to his,left, a large, American-made
	limousine, backs up. The car bumps Chance, pins him against
	the car to his right. Chance cries out in pain, drops his
	suitcase, his changer, and bangs his hand on the trunk of the
	limo. The chauffeur, DAVID, and the liveryman, JEFFREY,
	immediately jump from the car, run back to Chance.

				DAVID
		I'm very sorry, sir... I...

	David and Jeffrey reach out to help, but Chance is wedged
	solidly between the two cars.

				CHANCE
			(in pain)
		... I can't move... My leg...

				DAVID
			(rushes back to limo)
		... My Lord...

				JEFFREY
		This is terrible, sir -  I hope
		you're not badly injured...

				CHANCE 
		No. I'm not badly injured. But my
		leg is very sore.

	David pulls the car forward, freeing Chance. A few bystanders
	begin to gather as Jeffrey helps Chance to the sidewalk.

				JEFFREY 
		Can you walk? It's not broken, is
		it?

				CHANCE
			(leans against limo, holds
				leg)
		It's very sore.

	David gets out of the car, comes back.

				DAVID 
		Perhaps I should call an ambulance.

	A BYSTANDER interrupts.

				BYSTANDER 
		Somebody ought to call the police!

				CHANCE 
			(looks over, smiles)
		There's no need for police, it's
		just my leg.

	During this, the rear door of the limo opens and EVE RAND
	steps out. Eve is in her late thirties, has the look of a
	traditional New England lady. She watches as Jeffrey tends to
	Chance.

				JEFFREY 
		I don't think we should call anyone
		just yet, it may not even be all
		that serious.

				CHANCE 
			(obviously hurting)
		I agree.

				JEFFREY 
		Let's have a look, do you mind?

				CHANCE 
		Of course. I would like to look.

	Chance bends, raises his trouser leg. A red-bluish swollen
	bruise, three inches in diameter, is forming on his calf.

				JEFFREY 
		It's starting to swell, is it
		painful?

				CHANCE 
		Yes.

	Eve moves closer to Chance, looks at the bruise.

				EVE
			(to Chance)
		... Won't you let us do something
		for you? Your leg should be
		examined, we could take you to a
		hospital.

				CHANCE
			(smiles at Eve)
		There's no need for a hospital.

				EVE 
		Why, there certainly is. You must
		see a doctor, I insist on it.
		Please, let us take you.

	Eve turns to get back into the limo. David goes with her to
	hold the door.

				DAVID 
		I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Rand, I
		never saw the man.

				EVE 
		Oh, I don't think it was anyone's
		fault, David. 

				DAVID
		Thank you, ma'am.

	Chance is hesitant about getting in the car. Jeffrey offers a
	helping hand.

				JEFFREY
		Please, sir.

				CHANCE 
		I've never ridden in an automobile.

				JEFFREY 
			(a beat)
		I assure you, sir, David is a very
		careful driver. Please, won't you
		let us take you?

				CHANCE 
			(looks at the car, then
				decides)
		... Yes. You can take me.

				JEFFREY 
		Very good.

	Jeffrey assists Chance into the rear seat of the limo.

				CHANCE 
			(as he gets in)
		... My suitcase.

				JEFFREY 
		Yes sir. I'll take care of that.

	Jeffrey closes the door, goes back to pick up Chance's
	suitcase, does not notice the remote control. As Jeffrey puts
	Chance's bag into the trunk, we see the personalized license
	plate "RAND l."

	INT. LIMOUSINE - EVENING

	Chance and Eve settle in the back seat. As they talk, David
	starts up the limo, Jeffrey joins him in front and the limo
	pulls out into traffic.

				EVE 
		I hope you're comfortable.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I am.

				EVE 
		These can be such trying situations
		everyone seems to make such a to-do
		over a simple little accident. Of
		course, they can be very
		frightening, and I must apologize
		for David, he's never had an
		accident before.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. He's a very careful driver.

				EVE 
		... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg
		feeling any better?

				CHANCE 
		It's feeling better, but it's still
		very sore.

				EVE 
		I see.
			(a thought)
		... Say, would you mind seeing our
		family doctor?

				CHANCE
			(doesn't understand)
		Your family doctor?

				EVE 
		Yes. My husband has been very ill.
		His doctor and nurses are staying
		with us. Those hospitals can be so
		impersonal - why, it might be hours
		before you are treated...

				CHANCE
		I agree.

				EVE 
		Fine, it will save a lot of
		unnecessary fuss and it will be so
		much more pleasant for you...
			(leans forward)
		David, we'll just go on home.
		Jeffrey, would you call and let
		them know?

				JEFFREY 
		Yes ma'am.

	Eve presses a button, the glass partition closes. As the
	window rolls up behind him, Jeffrey dials the limo telephone.

	There is a moment of silence. Eve, still a bit on edge from
	the accident and feeling a bit uncomfortable with a stranger
	in the car, presses another button. The limo's bar moves out,
	revealing a row of decanters and glasses.

				EVE
		Would you care for a drink?

				CHANCE
		Yes. Thank you.

	As Eve pours cognac into a monogrammed crystal glass, Chance
	notices the limo's TV set.

				CHANCE (CONT'D)
		I would like to watch television.

				EVE
			(a bit surprised)
		Oh? Certainly...

	She hands Chance the cognac, turns on the TV.

				EVE (CONT'D)
		Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.

				CHANCE
		Hello, Eve. 

	Chance takes a sip of the cognac, is not accustomed to
	alcohol, coughs. There is another moment of silence.

				EVE
		May I ask your name?

				CHANCE
			(with a slight cough)
		My name is Chance.

				EVE
		Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?

				CHANCE
			(still indistinct)
		No. I'm a gardener.

				EVE
		Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey
		Gardiner... You're not related to
		Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?

				CHANCE 
		No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil
		and Perdita.

				EVE 
		Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful
		couple, we've been friends for
		years. We visit their island quite
		often.

	Chance reaches out to change the channel on the TV, suddenly
	realizes he doesn't have his remote control. He starts going
	through his pockets, searches for it.

				EVE (CONT'D)
		Did you lose something?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I lost my remote control.

				EVE 
		Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...

	Another pause, Chance reaches out, changes channels on TV.

				EVE (CONT'D)
		... I'll feel so relieved after Dr.
		Allenby examines your leg. After
		that, David can run you on home, or
		to your office or wherever you'd
		prefer... 
			(Chance still watches TV)
		... Is there anything special you
		would like to watch?

				CHANCE 
		I like to watch. This is fine.

	Chance watches the news. Eve sips on her cognac as David
	eases the limo out of the city of Washington.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - WOODED AREA - NIGHT

	The limo approaches, then turns into the entrance-way of the
	Rand Estate. Two guards stand on either side of the open
	gate, salute as the car passes through.

	EXT. RAND DRIVE - NIGHT

	The drive runs alongside a stream, then turns and crosses a
	large meadow. The limousine passes, still no sign of the
	house. It is a very, very long driveway.

	INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

	Chance is glued to the TV, switches channels, again watches
	the news. Eve takes his fascination with television as a sign
	of intelligence.

				EVE 
		I can see that it must be very
		important for you to stay informed
		of all the latest events.

				CHANCE 
		Yes.

				EVE 
		I admire that in a person. As for
		myself, I find there is so much to
		assimilate that it can become quite
		muddling at times...

	Chance nods, changes the channel, watches a Mighty Mouse
	cartoon. Eve looks at him perplexed, then takes it for a joke
	and smiles.

	EXT. RAND MANSION - NIGHT

	Two uniformed valets, WILSON and PERKINS, await the
	limousines by the front door of the Rand mansion. Wilson
	stands behind a wheelchair. As the limo parks, Perkins and
	Jeffrey assist Chance into the chair. Wilson turns to Eve as
	she gets out of the limo.

				WILSON 
		Good evening, Mrs. Rand.

				EVE 
		Good evening, Wilson.

				WILSON 
		I shall take the gentleman to the
		third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr.
		Allenby is standing by.

				EVE 
		Thank you, Wilson. That will be
		fine.

	Perkins and Jeffrey carry Chance in the chair up the steps
	and into the house. Eve and Wilson follow.

	INT. RAND MANSION - FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Once inside the house, Wilson takes over wheeling Chance. A
	lady, GRETA, is waiting to take Eve's coat.

				EVE 
		Thank you, Greta.
			(to Wilson)
		I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm
		needed.

				WILSON 
		Yes, ma'am.

				EVE
			(to Chance)
		I'll see you after the doctor has a
		look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.

				CHANCE
			(looking around mansion)
		Yes, I think he should examine my
		leg.

	Eve watches as Wilson wheels Chance around a corner.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	The doors open, Wilson pushes Chance into the elevator. As
	Wilson pushes a button and the doors close on them, a strange
	look comes over Chance's face.

				CHANCE
			(looks to Wilson)
		... I've never been in one of
		these.

	Wilson thinks that Chance is talking about the wheelchair.

				WILSON
		It's one of Mr. Rand's. Since he's
		been ill...

	Chance looks around the elevator.

				CHANCE 
		Does it have a television?

				WILSON 
			(laughs)
		No - but Mr. Rand does have one
		with an electric motor, that way he
		can get around by himself.

				CHANCE 
		I see.

	Chance again checks out the elevator.

				CHANCE (CONT'D)
		How long do we stay in here?

				WILSON 
		How long? I don't know, see what
		the doctor says ...

	The elevator stops on the third floor.

	INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	A hallway adjoining a large, glass-enclosed room. Eve passes
	through the hall, enters the room.

	INT. BENJAMIN RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

	Eve enters into a hermetically sealed area, set up with all
	the latest hospital emergency gear; oxygen, EKG machine, X
	ray machine, transfusion equipment, sterilizers, etc.
	BENJAMIN RAND, wearing a silk bathrobe, lies in a king-sized
	bed in the center of the room. A nurse, CONSTANCE, is
	attending to her duties in the room, looks up as Eve comes
	in.

				CONSTANCE 
		Good evening, Mrs. Rand.

	EVE 

	Good evening, Constance.

	Ben Rand perks up as he sees Eve crossing to him. He is in
	his sixties, maintains an inner strength and dignity despite
	the sapping effects of his illness.

				RAND
		(with weakness) 
		... Eve...

	Eve kisses him, holds his hand.

				EVE 
		Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm
		out... How are you feeling?

				RAND 
		Tired... And I'm getting tired of
		being so tired. Other than that,
		I'm doing very well.

				EVE 
		No headaches?

				RAND 
		No, it's been a good day - better
		than yours, from what I've been
		told.

				EVE
			(holds his hand against
				her cheek)
		You heard?

				RAND 
		I may be a shut-in, but I do not
		lack for news. I'm sorry you had to
		go through all that.

				EVE 
		Oh, it wasn't all that bad,
		darling. We were fortunate that Mr.
		Gardiner turned out to be so
		reasonable.

				RAND 
		Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet
		a reasonable man. Why don't you ask
		this Gardiner to join us for
		dinner?

				EVE 
			(sits on the side of the
				bed)
		Do you feel well enough for that?

				RAND 
			(smiles)
		Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if
		I wait until I feel better, will I
		ever meet the man?

	There is silence from Eve. Rand squeezes her hand, turns to
	Constance.

				RAND (CONT'D)
		Constance! I want new blood
		tonight, I'm getting up for dinner.

				CONSTANCE 
		But, Mr. Rand...

				RAND 
		Don't argue, tell Robert I want new
		blood!
			(turns to Eve)
		... Ask him to dinner.

	Rand pulls Eve's hand close, kisses it.

	INT. EAST WING GUEST SUITE - NIGHT

	An enormous bedroom, filled with 18th Century antique
	furniture. DR. ROBERT ALLENBY dabs Chance's ass with a piece
	of cotton soaked in alcohol, prior to an injection. Chance
	stands with his pants to the floor, looks to the television
	which is not turned on.

				ALLENBY 
		The injection will ease the pain
		and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.

				CHANCE 
		I understand. I've seen it done
		before.

				ALLENBY 
		Now, you'll barely feel this. It
		won't hurt at all.

	Allenby administers the injection, Chance reacts from the
	pain.

				CHANCE 
		You were wrong, it did hurt.

				ALLENBY 
			(a chuckle)
		But not for long...

	As Allenby puts a band-aid on Chance's ass, Chance spots a
	remote control for the TV on the bedside table. He reaches
	out, picks it up.

				ALLENBY (CONT'D)
		It's good that there was no
		apparent damage to the bone.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I think so, too.

				ALLENBY 
		However, with injuries such as
		this, I have run into minor
		hemorrhaging, which really isn't
		too serious at the time, but can
		cause secondary problems if not
		looked after.

				CHANCE 
		I see.

	Chance turns on the TV.

				ALLENBY 
			(a look to the TV, then to
				Chance)
		You can pull your trousers up, now.

				CHANCE
		Oh, fine. 

				ALLENBY
			(as Chance pulls up pants)
		Just to take the proper
		precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd
		recommend we take you downstairs
		and X-ray your leg.
			(no reaction from Chance,
				Allenby takes a long look
				at him)
		... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I
		would like to ask you something
		straight out.

				CHANCE
			(doesn't understand)
		... Straight out?

				ALLENBY 
		Yes. Are you planning on making any
		sort of claim against the Rand's?

				CHANCE 
			(after a beat)
		Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's
		what Thomas asked me.

				ALLENBY 
		Thomas? Who's Thomas?

				CHANCE 
		Thomas Franklin, an attorney.

				ALLENBY 
		An attorney?

				CHANCE 
			(turns back to TV)
		Yes.

				ALLENBY
			(suddenly very cold)
		Then you wish to handle this matter
		through your attorneys?

				CHANCE 
		There's no need for a claim, the
		garden is a healthy one.

				ALLENBY
			(gives Chance a look)
		Oh, I see...
			(warms up)
		... Well, then... You're a very
		funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught
		me off guard, I must admit...

				CHANCE
			(changes channels, sits on
				bed)
		Thank you.

				ALLENBY 
		Good, keep your weight off that
		leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it
		would be best if you could stay
		here for a day or two, if that
		would be would be possible. Since
		Benjamin became ill we have our own
		hospital downstairs. I can promise
		you the finest in care, unless, of
		course, you would prefer to go
		elsewhere.

				CHANCE 
		Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.

				ALLENBY 
		Fine. Would you like me to speak to
		your personal physician?

				CHANCE 
		No.

	Allenby waits for Chance to say more, he does not. Finally,
	Allenby picks up his bag, heads for the door.

				ALLENBY
			(stops by door)
		I'll send Wilson up to take you for
		X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to
		use the telephone, and please let
		me know if you have any discomfort.

				CHANCE
			(clicking changer)
		Yes, I will.

	Allenby gives him a look, then leaves. Chance watches an old
	movie of a man lighting a cigar. The man enjoys the cigar,
	blows out smoke. The scene seems to 'sink into' Chance's
	mind.

	EXT. MANSION - PATIO - NIGHT

	Eve sits next to a roaring patio fireplace with a steaming
	cup of tea. Allenby comes outside, joins her.

				ALLENBY 
		Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out
		here.

				EVE 
		I wanted some fresh air, Robert.
		How is Mr. Gardiner?

				ALLENBY 
		A rather large contusion, but I
		don't feel there is any serious
		damage. I'd like to keep an eye on
		him, though - I suggested that he
		stay here for a couple of days.

				EVE 
		Stay here? Is that necessary?

				ALLENBY 
		Not necessary, but preferable. I
		don't think he'll be a bother, he
		seems like a most refreshing sort
		of man.

				EVE 
		Yes, he is different... Not the
		kind of person one usually meets in
		Washington.

				ALLENBY 
		How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a
		welcome change of pace.

				EVE 
		He's very intense, and internal,
		don't you think?

				ALLENBY 
		At times, yes. But that's not an
		uncommon reaction to such an
		accident. Actually, I found him to
		have quite a sense of humor.

				EVE 
		Good. It might be pleasant for a
		couple of days. 
			(Eve puts down her tea)
		... Robert... Is there any
		improvement...?

				ALLENBY 
		No, Eve... I'm sorry.

	Eve is silent for a moment, looks out to the darkness.

				EVE 
		... Sometimes when I see Ben I
		could swear that he's getting
		stronger... Something that he might
		say, the way he moves, or a look in
		his eyes - makes me feel that this
		is all a nightmare and that he'll
		be better soon... It's just so hard
		to believe what's really
		happening...

	Allenby reaches out, holds Eve's hand.

	INT. RAND MANSION - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

	The elevator door opens, Wilson guides Chance in the
	wheelchair into the hallway.

				CHANCE 
			(looks back to elevator)
		... That is a very small room.

				WILSON 
			(laughs)
		Yes sir, I guess that's true
		smallest room in the house.

				CHANCE 
			(glancing around)
		Yes. It seems to be.

	Wilson takes this as another joke, chuckles as he wheels
	Chance toward Rand's hospital room.

	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

	CONSTANCE and another nurse, TERESA, stand by as Rand is
	being given a transfusion. Rand lifts his head as Wilson
	wheels Chance into the room.

				RAND
		Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital,
		Mr. Gardiner.

				CHANCE
			(looks around room)
		... I see.

	Wilson pushes Chance to the X-Ray machine, where the
	technician, BILLINGS, a Black man, waits. As Wilson and
	Billings help Chance onto the X-Ray table, Chance's face
	brightens up.

				CHANCE (CONT'D)
		I feel very good in here.

				RAND
		Sure you do. This ward is air
		tight, I have a little extra oxygen
		pumped in, keeps my spirits up.

				CHANCE
		Yes. I like that very much.

				BILLINGS
			(lining up Chance's leg)
		This won't take long, Mr. Gardiner.
		Please hold still when I ask.

	Chance stares at Billings, reacts to him being Black.

				CHANCE
			(to Billings)
		Do you know Raphael?

				BILLINGS
		No sir, I don't believe I do.

				CHANCE 
		Oh. I have a message for him.

				BILLINGS
		Yes, sir.

				CHANCE
		A Black man gave me the message.

				BILLINGS 
		Well, I still don't believe I know
		the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold
		still.

	Rand looks over as Billings takes the X-Ray.

				RAND 
		Aplastic anemia, Mr. Gardiner -
		aplastic anemia.

	Chance smiles to Rand.

				RAND (CONT'D)
		Failure of the bone marrow to
		produce red blood cells... Not a
		damn thing they can do about it.
		Oh, they can make me comfortable,
		prolong my life with steroid
		therapy and transfusions... And
		what makes my blood boil, what
		little I have left, that is, Mr.
		Gardiner - is that it's generally a
		young person's disease... Here I
		am, getting on in years and about
		to die of a young person's
		disease...

				CHANCE 
			(still smiles at Rand)
		Yes. You look very sick.

				BILLINGS 
		Hold still, please, Mr. Gardiner.

				RAND 
			(a laugh)
		I am very sick, and, as you can see
		by all this paraphernalia, I am
		very wealthy. I think I would
		rather be wealthy and sick than
		poor and sick.

				CHANCE 
			(looks around the room)
		I understand. I've never seen
		anything like this on television.

				BILLINGS 
		Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.

				CONSTANCE 
		You too, Mr. Rand, you must stay
		quiet.

	Rand lays his head back.

				RAND 
		... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner -
		we're prisoners of tubes and
		technology.

				CHANCE 
		I agree.

				RAND 
			(flat on his back)
		... You will join us for dinner,
		won't you, Mr. Gardiner?

				CHANCE 
			(also flat on his back)
		Yes. I am very hungry.

				RAND 
		... So am I, my boy - so am I.

	INT. RAND DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	THURMAND, a waiter, and MARIANNE, a waitress, enter into the
	Rand dining room carrying trays of food. The dining room is
	immense, a 70-foot ceiling, huge fireplace. Allenby, Eve,
	Rand, and Chance (both in wheelchairs) sit around the table.
	Rand speaks slowly, with obvious weakness.

				RAND
		I know exactly what you mean. Today
		the businessman is at the mercy of
		kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they
		want to do is regulate our natural
		growth! It's happening across the
		country!

				ALLENBY 
		To everyone, I'm afraid. The
		Government controls are so
		restricting that the Medical
		Profession, as we know it, is being
		legislated out of existence.

				RAND 
		Of course! By kid-lawyers!

	Eve turns to Chance.

				EVE 
		Won't your injury prevent you from
		attending to business, Mr.
		Gardiner?

				CHANCE 
		No. It won't do that.

				EVE 
		... Would you like us to notify
		anyone for you?

				CHANCE 
		No. The Old Man died and Louise
		left.

	There is a moment of silence.

				EVE 
		Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you
		have any need for any of our
		facilities, please do not hesitate
		to ask.

				RAND 
		Do you need a secretary?

				CHANCE 
		No, thank you. My house has been
		closed.

				RAND 
		Oh. When you say 'Your house has
		been closed', you mean to say that
		your business was shut down?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. Shut down and locked by the
		attorneys.

				RAND 
		What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The
		S.E.C.! Damn them!

				EVE 
		I hope that staying here won't be
		an inconvenience for you.

				CHANCE 
		No. I like it here.

				RAND 
		That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I
		call you Chauncey?

				CHANCE 
			(agreeable to being called
				Chauncey)
		Yes. Chauncey is fine.

				RAND 
		And I'm Ben.

				ALLENBY 
			(smiles to Chance)
		... And please call me Robert.

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Robert. I will.

				RAND 
		So tell me, Chauncey, what are your
		plans now?

	Chance looks around the room. 

				CHANCE 
		Does this house have a garden?

	Allenby gives Chance a look.

				RAND 
		Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow,
		Chauncey, you will see our gardens.

				CHANCE 
		I see. I would like to work in your
		garden.

				EVE 
			(laughs)
		Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I
		sometimes enjoy puttering around
		myself, such a pleasant way to
		forget one's troubles.

				CHANCE 
		I am a very good gardener.

				RAND 
		A gardener! Well put, Chauncey
		excellent! Isn't that what a
		businessman is? A gardener? A
		person that makes flinty soil
		productive with the labor of his
		own hands, who waters it with the
		sweat from his own brow, and who
		creates a place of value for his
		family and community? Yes,
		Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor
		-- yes, indeed, a productive
		businessman is a laborer in his own
		vineyard.

				CHANCE 
		Thank you, Ben. The garden that I
		left was such a place. Everything
		which grew there was with the labor
		of my own hands. I planted seeds
		and watered them and watched
		everything grow.

				RAND 
			(weakly)
		Bravo!

				CHANCE 
		But I don't have that any more...
			(points to ceiling)
		... All that's left for me now is
		the room upstairs.

				RAND 
		Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you
		are young, you are healthy, for
		God's sake don't give up on
		yourself! You have to fight! You
		can't let those bastards keep you
		down! I don't want to hear any more
		from you about the 'Room Upstairs'.
		That's where I'm going soon.

	There is a long pause. Chance looks up, then smiles at Rand.

				CHANCE 
		It's a very pleasant room, Ben.

				RAND 
			(laughs)
		Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what
		they say, anyway.

	Another period of silence. The servants bustle around the
	room as Allenby studies Chance.

	INT. RAND'S POOL ROOM - NIGHT

	Allenby opens the door. Rand enters in his electric
	wheelchair followed by Chance being pushed by Wilson.

				RAND 
		... I don't know what you've heard
		about me, Chauncey, but I'm sure
		you know everything there is to
		know. Cigar?

	Rand holds out humidor to Chance.

				CHANCE 
		Yes, thank you.
			(takes cigar)
		No Ben. I don't know everything
		about you.

	Rand smiles as he takes a cigar for himself.

				RAND 
		... No, of course you don't. Excuse
		me for being so presumptuous. No
		man knows everything about another
		man - however, very few are honest
		enough to admit it.

				ALLENBY 
		That is so true. You're different,
		Chauncey... Quite different than
		most men.

				CHANCE 
		Thank you, Robert.

	Rand lights his own cigar, then hands an ornate lighter to
	Chance.

				RAND 
			(picks up pool cue, weakly
				strokes the balls)
		... You know, Chauncey, there are
		thousands of American businessmen,
		large and small, that share your
		plight. I've been concerned with
		the situation for some time now.

	Chance, not knowing to bite off the tip, tries to light the
	cigar like the man on TV. It will not light.

				RAND (CONT'D)
		So I've been thinking about
		beginning a financial assistance
		program, Chauncey, to help out
		American businessmen that have been
		harassed by inflation, excessive
		taxation, unions and other
		indecencies...

	Allenby watches Chance trying to light the cigar as Rand
	speaks on, shooting pool as he talks.

				RAND 
		... I'd like to offer the decent
		'Gardeners' of the business
		community a helping hand. After
		all, they are our strongest defense
		against the pollutants who so
		threaten our basic freedoms and the
		well-being of our middle class.
		Tell me, would you have any
		thoughts on such a program?

	Chance puts the unlit cigar in the ashtray, smiles at
	Allenby, then answers Rand.

				CHANCE 
		No, Ben.

				RAND 
			(a smile)
		Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey?
		Well, I can understand that. When a
		man loses everything, anger has a
		tendency to block out reason for a
		time. Just give it some thought,
		work with the idea, I'm sure you'll
		have plenty to say in a few days.

				CHANCE 
		I could give it some thought, Ben,
		but my leg is very sore.

				RAND 
		... Oh?
			(looks to Allenby)
		Robert, take a look, would you?

				ALLENBY 
		Some pain is to be expected... 
			(bends to Chance, looks at
				leg)
		... And I think what would be best
		for the two of you is a good
		night's rest. 
			(checks watch)
		... It's late, I'm afraid it's time
		for my patients to prepare for bed.

				RAND 
			(puts down pool cue)
		We have common foes, Chauncey - kid
		lawyers and our physician!

				CHANCE 
		I agree.

	Allenby laughs as he takes Rand's cigar from him, snuffs it
	in the ashtray.

	INT. MANSION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Wilson stands behind Chance in the wheelchair. Chance glances
	slowly and inquisitively around the elevator. When his eyes
	meet Wilson's, the valet breaks out in laughter.

				WILSON
			(laughing, trying to
				apologize) 
		... Sorry, sir - I just couldn't
		contain myself... I knew you were
		going to come out with another one
		of your jests about the elevator...
		Excuse me, sir...

	The elevator stops, the door opens.

	INT. MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Wilson wheels Chance out of the elevator.

				CHANCE
			(looks back as the door
				closes)
		... Hmmm... Elevator.

				WILSON
			(laughs again)
		... Yes sir - elevator!

	Wilson stops laughing, becomes the stone-faced servant once
	again as he notices Eve coming out of her bedroom. Wilson
	stops wheeling Chance, stands stiffly at attention as Eve and
	Chance talk.

				EVE 
		Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how
		dreadful I feel about the accident
		today, but that I'm delighted that
		you are staying with us.

				CHANCE 
		Thank you, Eve - I like this house
		very much.

				EVE 
		... And Ben is just mad about you -
		you've lifted his spirits so - it's
		just... Well, it's just a real
		pleasure having you with us.

				CHANCE 
		Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen
		that before.

				EVE 
		Yes... I know, Chauncey.

				CHANCE 
		I like Ben very much... He reminds
		me of the Old Man...

				EVE 
		He does...?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. Are you going to leave and
		close the house when he dies?

	Eve is not prepared for such a question.

				EVE 
		... Why... No, I don't think so...

				CHANCE 
		That's good.

	Chance smiles at Eve and there is a moment of silence before
	Eve steps back into her bedroom.

				EVE
		... Good night, Chauncey.

				CHANCE
		Good night, Eve.

	Eve closes the door. Wilson wheels Chance down the hallway
	toward the guest room.

	EXT. FRONT OF RAND MANSION - MORNING

	Eve comes out of the house, Jeffrey holds the door for her as
	she gets into "RAND l." Jeffrey gets in and the limo pulls
	away. Chance comes out of the front door, walking with a
	limp. His first view of the Rand grounds in the daylight, he
	is taken by the extent of the greenery. An attendant, LEWIS,
	hurries to Chance.

				LEWIS 
		Did you want a car, sir?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I would like a car.

				LEWIS 
		Yes, sir.

	Lewis goes to his post, picks up a phone. As Chance looks at
	the surroundings, Allenby and Wilson, with Chance's
	wheelchair, come out of the house.

				ALLENBY 
			(frowns as he sees Chance
				walking)
		Chauncey, there you are. What are
		you doing on that leg?

				CHANCE 
		It's fine today, Robert.

				ALLENBY 
		Shame on you, Chauncey - you should
		let me be the judge of that.
			(motions to Wilson)
		Please, sit in the chair.

	Wilson pushes the wheelchair to Chance, he sits.

				ALLENBY (CONT'D)
			(checks leg)
		I swear, Chauncey, between you and
		Benjamin, I've got my hands full... 
			(looks at calf)
		... Say, that is coming along, the
		swelling has gone down
		considerably...
			(pokes a spot)
		... Any pain here?

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.

	A limousine pulls up to the front of the mansion, waits for
	Chance.

				ALLENBY 
			(continues examining)
		... Benjamin has been hounding me
		to allow him to address the annual
		meeting of his Financial Institute
		today, but obviously, the strain
		would be impossible... How about
		here, Chauncey, any soreness?

				CHANCE 
		Hardly any, Robert.

	Lewis, the attendant, interrupts.

				LEWIS 
		Your limousine, sir.

				CHANCE 
		Oh, thank you.

				ALLENBY 
			(reacting to limo)
		... Were you going somewhere?

				CHANCE 
		No, Robert.

				ALLENBY 
			(a beat)
		... Oh. 
			(checks leg)
		... My God, I only wish that
		Benjamin had your recuperative
		powers... Anyway, the President
		offered to sit in for Ben at the
		meeting, quite a nice gesture, I
		felt. He's due here soon, I
		believe.

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Robert. I know about the
		President.

				ALLENBY 
			(mildly surprised)
		... Oh? You've heard?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to
		meet the President.

				ALLENBY 
			(stands)
		He does, does he?

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Ben told me to be in his room
		at ten o'clock.

				ALLENBY 
		Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.

				CHANCE 
		How do I know when it's ten
		o'clock?

	A long look from Allenby, then he looks at his watch.

				ALLENBY 
		... It's five of, you'd best get on
		in there.

				CHANCE 
		Thank you, Robert.

	Wilson begins to push Chance.

				CHANCE (CONT'D)
		I would like to walk today.

				ALLENBY
		Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the
		President, aren't you?

				CHANCE
			(gets out of chair)
		Oh, really?

	Allenby, a bit puzzled, watches as Chance goes into the
	house.

	INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - MORNING

	Chance limps aimlessly through a hallway. He stops, admires a
	large tapestry on the wall. A servant, SMYTHE, notices Chance
	appears confused, approaches him.

				SMYTHE
		May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?

				CHANCE
			(with a smile)
		Yes. I would like to go to Rand
		Memorial Hospital.

				SMYTHE
			(a pause)
		... Sir?

				CHANCE
		Yes.

	There is another long pause.

				SMYTHE
		... Did you wish to see someone,
		sir?

				CHANCE
		Yes, I would like to see Ben.

				SMYTHE
		Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this
		way, sir.

	Chance follows Smythe down the hall.

	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

	Rand is in an easy chair, dressed for his meeting with the
	President. The two nurses are working at the disinfecting
	table. Rand smiles as Chance is shown into the room by
	Smythe.

				RAND 
		Chauncey, up and around this
		morning, are you?

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.

				RAND 
		Well, that's good news, my boy.

				CHANCE 
		You're looking much better today,
		Ben.

				RAND 
		Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey...
		I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up,
		I didn't want the President to
		think I was going to die during our
		talk.

				CHANCE 
		I understand.

				RAND 
		No one likes a dying man, my boy -
		because few know what death is. All
		we know is the terror of it. But
		you're an exception, Chauncey -
		that's what I admire in you, your
		marvelous balance. You don't
		stagger back and forth between fear
		and hope - you're a truly peaceful
		man.

				CHANCE 
		Thank you, Ben. 
			(looks at Rand closely)
		... The nurse did a very good job,
		Ben.

	The nurses turn, look at Chance.

	EXT. FRONT RAND MANSION - MORNING

	Wilson is at the head of eight servants lined up on the front
	steps. Two black PLYMOUTH SEDANS pull up and park. EIGHT MEN
	in grey business suits get out. One of them, WOLTZ, goes
	directly to Wilson.

				WOLTZ 
		Good morning, Mr. Wilson.

				WILSON 
		Good morning, Mr. Woltz, nice to
		see you again.

				WOLTZ 
		Thank you. How have you been?

				WILSON 
		Fine, thank you.
			(hands Woltz paper)
		We have an additional guest with us
		today, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

				WOLTZ
			(reads list)
		I see...
			(turns to other men)
		Okay, let's go to work.

	The eight servants pair up with the eight men in suits and go
	into the house.

	INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - MORNING

	Allenby gets off the elevator, stands and thinks for a
	moment, then heads off down the hallway in the direction of
	Chance's room.

	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

	Chance watches television as Rand speaks.

				RAND 
		Yes, when I was younger I had
		thoughts about public office... But
		I found, Chauncey - that I was able
		to contribute more as a private
		citizen... of course, my wealth
		provided me with considerable
		influence, but I've tried, believe
		me, not to misuse that power...
		It's extremely important, Chauncey,
		when one is in a position of
		eminence, that he does not allow
		himself to become blinded to the
		needs of the country... The
		temptations are strong, and I've
		been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many,
		but I have tried to stay open to
		voices of the people... I have
		tried to remain honest to myself...

				CHANCE
			(changing channels)
		I see, Ben.

				RAND 
		... Maybe one day you shall find
		yourself in a similar position,
		Chauncey... Maybe one day...

	EXT. FRONT RAND MANSION - MORNING

	Two black limousines followed by a station wagon with small
	holes in the side pull up in front of the mansion. As men
	from the first limousine and the station wagon jump out and
	take positions around the driveway, Lewis hurries to his
	post, picks up his phone.

	INT. RAND MANSION - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - MORNING

	The nerve center of the Rand Enterprises since he has become
	ill. Four or five desks, all the latest electronic office
	equipment, three TV's with video taping facilities, countless
	telephones. MRS. AUBREY, Rand's senior secretary, is at her
	desk, answers her phone.

				MRS. AUBREY
			(into phone)
		Yes... Oh, very good, Lewis, thank
		you.

	Mrs. Aubrey hangs up, picks up another phone, pushes a
	button.

	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

	Rand smiles at Chance as the phone rings.

				RAND 
		He's here.
			(into phone)
		Yes, Mrs. Aubrey?
			(listens)
		Fine. Show the President to the
		library, we'll be along in a few
		minutes.

	Rand hangs up the phone, turns to Chance with a twinkle in
	his eyes.

				RAND (CONT'D)
		It's an old habit that goes along
		with power -- keep them waiting...

	Teresa brings Rand's wheelchair to him.

				RAND (CONT'D)
			(stands, very weak)
		Not now, Teresa. I'm seeing the
		President on my own two feet.

				TERESA 
		But, Mr. Rand...

				RAND 
			(puts an arm around Chance
				for support)
		Shall we go, Chauncey?

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Ben. That's a good idea.

	Rand walks slowly, clings to the limping Chance tightly as
	they leave the room.

	EXT. HALLWAY - MORNING

	Secret Service Men are seen in the background as Rand stops
	outside Mrs. Aubrey's office, leans in.

				RAND 
		Mrs. Aubrey, have you received the
		papers on the Caracas agreement?

				MRS. AUBREY
		Yes, sir. They're ready for you to
		sign.

				RAND
		Excellent. 
			(turns to Chance)
		A good woman, Mrs. Aubrey.

				CHANCE 
			(seeing her for first
				time)
		I agree, Ben.

	They shuffle off down the hallway. Chance smiles at the
	Secret Service men that they pass.

	INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY BY LIBRARY - MORNING

	Woltz and Wilson wait by the library door. Woltz takes a
	small metal detector from his pocket as Rand and Chance
	approach.

				WOLTZ
		Good morning, Mr. Rand.

				RAND
		Woltz, how have you been?

				WOLTZ 
			(passes detector over
				Rand's body)
		Just fine, thank you, sir. 
			(turns to Chance)
		And you must be Mr. Gardiner.

				CHANCE
		Yes.

				WOLTZ 
			(passes detector over
				Chance)
		Just a formality, Mr. Gardiner.

				CHANCE 
			(as he finishes)
		Thank you very much.

	Wilson knocks lightly, then opens the library door, Rand and
	Chance enter.

	INT. RAND LIBRARY - MORNING

	Rand and Chance come into the Library and the President goes
	to Rand with both hands outstretched.

				PRESIDENT 
		Ben!

				RAND 
			(very weak)
		... Mr. President, how good to see
		you.

				PRESIDENT 
		It's so good to see you too, Ben,
		you look terrific!

				RAND 
			(barely able to stand)
		I'm not convinced of that, Mr.
		President, but your visit has
		raised my spirits...

				PRESIDENT 
		Well, I'm delighted to be here, my
		friend. I've missed you. 
			(guides Rand to chair)
		Here, sit down, get off your feet.

	As Rand sinks into the chair, Chance approaches the President
	with both hands outstretched.

				CHANCE 
		Good morning, Mr. President.

				PRESIDENT 
			(smiling)
		... Hello.

	Chance and the President exchange a two-handed handshake.
	Rand, still weak from standing, catches his breath and
	introduces Chance.

				RAND 
		Mr. President, I'd like you to meet
		my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey
		Gardiner.

				PRESIDENT 
		Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.

				CHANCE 
		You look much taller on television,
		Mr. President.

				PRESIDENT 
			(a beat)
		... Oh, really...

				RAND 
			(smiling)
		You will find that my house guest
		does not bandy words, Mr.
		President.

	The President gives Chance a look, then laughs.

				PRESIDENT 
		Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just
		fine with me - I'm a man that
		appreciates a frank discussion...
		Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...

				CHANCE 
			(sitting)
		Yes, I will.

				PRESIDENT 
			(also sits)
		Now, Ben, did you happen to get a
		chance to...

	Chance perks up at the mention of his name, interrupts.

				CHANCE 
		Yes?

	There is a beat as the President looks at Chance quizzically,
	then he continues.

				PRESIDENT
		I just wondered if you had gone
		over my speech, Ben.

				RAND 
		Yes, I did.

				PRESIDENT 
		... Well?

				RAND 
		Overall - pretty good. But, Mr.
		President, I think it's very
		dangerous to resort to temporary
		measures at this stage of the game.

				PRESIDENT 
		Well, Ben... I...

				RAND 
		I sympathize with your position,
		Mr. President, I know how difficult
		it is to be straightforward, the
		reaction to such a speech could be
		chaos.

				PRESIDENT 
		That's too big a risk, I can't take
		the chance.

				CHANCE
			(again perks up)
		Yes?

	Once again, the President gives Chance a puzzled look.

	INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - MORNING

	Perkins accompanies Secret Service Agent RIFF as he checks
	out the third floor. Riff knocks on each door, looks inside,
	then moves in.

	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - MORNING

	Allenby is searching through Chancels clothes looking for
	some sort of identification. There is a knock at the door,
	Allenby pulls back from the closet as Riff opens the door,
	looks inside.

				ALLENBY 
		Oh... Hello.

				RIFF 
			(entering)
		Good morning. I'm Riff, Secret
		Service.

				ALLENBY 
		... Yes. Of course.

	Perkins watches curiously as Riff passes the metal detector
	over Allenby's clothing.

	INT. LIBRARY - MORNING

	The President is worried about what Rand is telling him. He
	paces, smokes a cigarette. Chance smiles through it all.

				RAND 
		... There is no longer any margin
		for inflation, it has gone as far
		as it can, you've reached your
		limits on taxation, dependence on
		foreign energy has reached a
		crisis, and, from where I see it,
		Mr. President, the Free Enterprise
		System has reached the breaking
		point. We are on the brink of
		another crash from which recovery
		might not be possible.

				PRESIDENT 
		It's that serious, huh?

				RAND 
		I'm afraid so.

	The President now looks nearly as bad as Rand. He sits, turns
	to Chance.

				PRESIDENT 
		Do you agree with Ben, Mr.
		Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do
		you think we can stimulate growth
		through temporary incentives?

				CHANCE 
			(a beat)
		As long as the roots are not
		severed, all is well and all will
		be well in the garden.

				PRESIDENT
			(a pause)
		... In the garden?

				CHANCE 
		That is correct. In a garden,
		growth has its season. There is
		spring and summer, but there is
		also fall and winter. And then
		spring and summer again...

				PRESIDENT 
			(staring at Chance)
		... Spring and summer...
			(confused)
		Yes, I see... Fall and winter.
			(smiles at Chance)
		Yes, indeed...
			(a beat)
		Could you go through that one more
		time, please, Mr. Gardiner?

				RAND 
		I think what my most insightful
		friend is saying, Mr. President, is
		that we welcome the inevitable
		seasons of nature, yet we are upset
		by the seasons of our economy.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. That is correct.

				PRESIDENT 
			(pleased)
		...Well, Mr. Gardiner, I must
		admit, that is one of the most
		refreshing and optimistic
		statements I've heard in a very,
		very long time.

	The President puts out his cigarette, rises.

				PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
		... Many of us forget that nature
		and society are one! Yes, though we
		have tried to cut ourselves off
		from nature, we are still a part of
		it! Like nature, our economic
		system remains, in the long run,
		stable and rational. And that is
		why we must not fear to be at its
		mercy! 
			(he smiles at Chance, who
				is absorbed in looking
				around the room at the
				books)
		... I envy your good, solid sense,
		Mr. Gardiner - that is precisely
		what we lack on Capitol Hill. 
			(glances at watch)
		I must be going. 
			(holds out hand to Chance)
		Mr. Gardiner, this visit has been
		enlightening...

	Chance rises and shakes the President's hand.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. It has.

				PRESIDENT 
		... You will honor me and my family
		with a visit, won't you?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I will.

				PRESIDENT 
		Wonderful, we'll all look forward
		to seeing you. 
			(turns to Rand)
		Is Eve around? I'd like to say
		hello.

				RAND 
		No, she flew up to Boston for
		another charity event. She'll be
		sorry to have missed you.

				PRESIDENT 
		I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted
		me to send along her best to the
		two of you - and, Ben, I want to
		thank you for your time and
		thoughts.

				RAND 
		Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank
		you for coming to spend time with a
		dying man.

				PRESIDENT 
		Now, Ben, I won't have any of that.
		Why don't you listen to your good
		friend Chauncey this is a time to
		think of life!

	The President clasps Rand's hand.

				RAND 
		You're right, Mr. President I don't
		like feeling sorry for myself.

				PRESIDENT 
		Take care of yourself, Ben.

				RAND 
		You take care too, Bobby.

				PRESIDENT 
			(as he turns to go, a
				smile to Chance)
		Mr. Gardiner...

	The President leaves the library and Chance sits back down.

				RAND 
			(as the door closes)
		He's a decent fellow, the
		President, isn't he?

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Ben - he is.

				RAND 
		He was quite impressed with your
		comments, Chauncey - he hears my
		sort of analysis from everyone, but
		yours, unfortunately - seldom if
		ever at all.

				CHANCE 
		I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice
		talking to the President.

	EXT. RAND MANSION - MORNING

	An aide, KAUFMAN, waits by the front door of the Rand
	mansion. As the President comes out, he speaks quietly to
	Kaufman.

				PRESIDENT 
		Kaufman, I'm going to need
		information on Mr. Chauncey
		Gardiner's background.

				KAUFMAN
			(makes note of name)
		Gardiner, yes, sir.

				PRESIDENT 
		And put it through on a Code Red -
		I want it as soon as possible.

				KAUFMAN 
		No problem, Chief.

	They head toward the waiting limousines.

	INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - MORNING

	Rand has an arm around Chance, hangs on for dear life as the
	two of them walk through the hall. Behind them, Wilson and
	Perkins push empty wheelchairs.

				RAND
			(very weak)
		... You know, Chauncey, there's
		something about you... You're
		direct, you grasp things quickly
		and you state them plainly. You
		don't play games with words to
		protect yourself. I feel I can
		speak to you frankly... You know
		what I was talking to you about
		last night?

				CHANCE
			(blankly)
		No, Ben.

				RAND 
		Oh, sure you do, the financial
		assistance program. I think you
		might be just the man to take
		charge of such an undertaking. I'd
		like you to meet with the members
		of the Board, we'll be able to
		discuss the matter at greater
		length at that time.

				CHANCE 
		I understand.

				RAND 
			(stops outside his door)
		And, please, Chauncey - don't rush
		your decision. I know you're not a
		man to act on the spur of the
		moment.

				CHANCE 
		Thank you, Ben.

				RAND 
		And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you
		must excuse me - I'm very tired all
		of a sudden.

	Wilson and Perkins leave the wheelchairs, assist Rand into
	his hospital room.

				CHANCE 
			(as they go in)
		I'm sorry that you are so sick,
		Ben.

	The door closes, Chance limps off down the hall.

	EXT. RAND MANSION - GARDEN - DAY

	Chance, with a limp, walks down a pathway in the garden,
	admires the greenery. In the background, coming from the
	house, we see Eve.

				EVE 
			(approaches Chance, calls)
		Chauncey!

				CHANCE 
			(stops, turns)
		Hello, Eve.

				EVE 
		Your leg must be getting better.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. It's feeling much better now.

				EVE 
		Good. I'm glad to hear that.
			(they walk together)
		... How did you like meeting the
		President?

				CHANCE 
		Fine. He's very nice.

				EVE 
		Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get
		to see him.

	They walk along in silence for a moment. Chance sees a huge
	greenhouse not far from them, heads toward it. Eve turns to
	him, hesitates, then questions.

				EVE (CONT'D)
		... Chauncey... Last night you
		mentioned an old man, that died.

				CHANCE 
		Yes.

				EVE 
		Was he a relative? Or an intimate
		friend?

				CHANCE 
			(looking at greenhouse)
		He was a very wealthy man, he
		looked after me since I was young.

				EVE 
		Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?

				CHANCE 
			(quizzically)
		... Mentor...?

	Eve takes his uncertainty as a reluctance to discuss the Old
	Man.

				EVE 
		Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't
		mean to pry. You must have been
		very close to him.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I was.

				EVE 
		I'm sorry... 
			(getting more to the
				point)
		... And what about Louise? YOU
		mentioned that she had gone, were
		you close to her also?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I liked Louise very much. She
		was his maid.

				EVE 
			(relieved)
		Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I
		thought perhaps she was someone
		that you may have been romantically
		involved with.

				CHANCE 
		Oh, no. She brought me my meals.

				EVE 
			(pleased)
		Of course.

	Eve edges slightly closer to Chance. Chance edges slightly
	closer to the greenhouse, is fascinated by it.

				CHANCE 
		What is that?

				EVE 
		Our greenhouse.

				CHANCE 
			(pleased)
		Oh, I like that very much.

				EVE 
		Yes, so do we.

	Chance peeks through one of the windows.

	INT. RAND'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Rand is in bed. Eve, Chance and Allenby are seated around
	him, the two nurses standing to one side. They all watch the
	President's address to the Financial Institute on TV. Chance
	inhales deeply, enjoys the oxygen in the room. Rand is
	looking weaker. Every so often, Allenby casts a concerned
	glance his way.

				PRESIDENT'S VOICE 
		... And there are so many of you
		that have proclaimed that we are on
		the brink of the worst financial
		crisis in this nation's history.
		And there are so many of you
		demanding that we put into effect
		drastic measures to alter its
		course. Well, let me tell you,
		gentlemen, I have been conducting
		multiple-level consultations with
		members of the Cabinet, House and
		Senate. I have conducted meetings
		with prominent business leaders
		throughout the country. And this
		very morning I had an in-depth
		discussion with your founder and
		Chairman-Of-The-Board, Mr. Benjamin
		Turnbull Rand and his close friend
		and advisor Mr. Chauncey
		Gardiner...

	Rand perks up a bit at this mention. Allenby manages a smile,
	once again looks at Rand, checking his condition. Eve looks
	proudly at Chance, who continues to enjoy the oxygen.

				PRESIDENT'S VOICE (CONT'D)
		... Well, gentlemen, I found this
		to be a most rewarding
		conference... To quote Mr.
		Gardiner, a most intuitive man, 'As
		long as the roots of industry
		remain firmly planted in the
		national soil, the economic
		prospects are undoubtedly sunny.'

	Rand starts coughing, breathing heavily. Allenby and the
	nurses rush to his bedside. Allenby shoots a quick look to
	Eve and Chance.

				ALLENBY
			(motioning toward door)
		Excuse us, please. 

	Eve and Chance leave the room as Allenby administers aid to
	Rand.

				PRESIDENT'S VOICE 
		Gentlemen, let us not fear the
		inevitable chill and storms of
		autumn and winter, instead, let us
		anticipate the rapid growth of
		springtime, let us await the
		rewards of summer. As in a garden
		of the earth, let us learn to
		accept and appreciate the times
		when the trees are bare as well as
		the times when we pick the fruit.

	EXT. RAND MANSION - PATIO - DAY

	Eve and Chance sit in silence on the patio. Eve's eyes are
	swollen, red, she has been crying. She turns to Chance,
	reaches out, touches his hand.

				EVE
			(hesitates)
		... I'm...
			(pause)
		... I'm very grateful that you're
		here, Chauncey...
			(pause)
		... With us ...

				CHANCE 
		So am I, Eve.

	Allenby comes out the door, his mood is serious,
	professional. Eve turns quickly, awaits his news.

				ALLENBY
			(sits alongside Eve)
		... Eve - this has been an
		exhausting day for Ben...

				EVE
			(anxious)
		... But he's...?

				ALLENBY 
		He's resting comfortably now.
		There's no cause for alarm, yet...

	Mrs. Aubrey comes out of the house.

				MRS. AUBREY 
		Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone
		call for you. Sidney Courtney, the
		financial editor of the Washington
		Post.

				CHANCE 
			(not moving)
		Thank you.

				MRS. AUBREY 
		Would you care to take it, sir?

				CHANCE 
		Yes.

	Chance still does not move. Eve mistakes Chance's not moving
	for concern for herself. She puts a hand on his shoulder.

				EVE 
		I'll be all right, Chauncey you go
		ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...

				CHANCE 
			(rising)
		Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.

	Chance follows Mrs. Aubrey into the house. Eve watches him
	go, then turns to Allenby.

				EVE 
		... He's such a sensitive man, so
		considerate...

	INT. RAND MANSION - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - DAY

	Mrs. Aubrey leads Chance to a phone at one of the desks. The
	three television sets are on, attract Chance's attention.

				CHANCE 
			(picks up phone, looks at
				TVs)
		Hello.

	INT. WASHINGTON POST - COURTNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

	SID COURTNEY, a Black man in his fifties, wears a rumpled
	wool jacket, smokes a pipe.

				COURTNEY 
		Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid
		Courtney, Washington Post.

	INTERCUT - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE / COURTNEY'S OFFICE

				CHANCE 
		Hello, Sid.

				COURTNEY 
		I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr.
		Gardiner, I know you must be very
		busy.

				CHANCE 
			(looking from one TV to
				the other)
		No. I'm not busy.

				COURTNEY 
		Then, I'll be brief. I covered the
		President's speech at the Financial
		Institute today, and since the Post
		would like to be as exact as
		possible, we would appreciate your
		comments on the meeting that took
		place between Mr. Rand, the
		President and yourself.

				CHANCE 
		The President is a nice person. I
		enjoyed it very much.

				COURTNEY 
		Good, sir. And so, it seems, did
		the President - but we would like
		to have some facts; such as, uh...
		What exactly is the relationship
		between yourself and that of the
		First American Financial
		Corporation?

				CHANCE 
		I think you should ask Mr. Rand
		that.

				COURTNEY 
		Of course. But since he is ill I'm
		taking the liberty of asking you.

				CHANCE 
		Yes, that is correct. I think you
		should ask Mr. Rand that.

	Courtney doesn't understand but continues his questioning.

				COURTNEY 
		I see. Then one more quick
		question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at
		the Post would like to, uh - update
		our profile on you - what exactly
		is your business?

				CHANCE 
		I have nothing more to say.

	Chance hangs up the phone, watches the TVs.

	Courtney listens to the dial tone, then puts the receiver
	down.

				COURTNEY 
			(to himself)
		Typical - no wonder he's so close
		to Rand...

	INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - DAY

	Chance comes out of Mrs. Aubrey's office, notices the service
	elevator.

				CHANCE 
		Hmmm. Elevator.

	He gets in the elevator.

	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

	Chance looks at the row of buttons, presses one. He smiles as
	he feels the elevator move.

	INT. RAND MANSION - BASEMENT - DAY

	One of Mrs. Aubrey's secretaries, JENNIFER, waits with an arm
	load of paperwork for the elevator. The door opens, Chance
	smiles at her as he steps out.

				JENNIFER 
			(surprised to see him)
		Why, hello, Mr. Gardiner - are you
		looking for someone?

				CHANCE
		No.

	Jennifer gets in the elevator, the doors Close. Chance looks
	around the basement, puzzled. He had expected to be on the
	third floor.

	INT. MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - DAY

	Mrs. Aubrey is at her desk, buzzing her inter-house phone. As
	Jennifer enters, Mrs. Aubrey hangs up in frustration.

				MRS. AUBREY
		I can't find Mr. Gardiner anywhere.

				JENNIFER
		He's in the basement.

				MRS. AUBREY
		What's he doing in the basement?

				JENNIFER
		I don't know, Mrs. Aubrey.

	Mrs. Aubrey grabs a notepad, leaves the office.

	INT. RAND MANSION - BASEMENT - DAY

	Mrs. Aubrey comes out of the service elevator, hurries
	through the basement. She checks:
	The boiler room.
	The electrical room.
	The photographer's studio (Eve is sitting for a portrait)
	The gym (Allenby is working out)

	INT. RAND MANSION - BASEMENT BOWLING ALLEY - DAY

	Chance stands in the middle of the two-lane bowling alley,
	totally confused. Mrs. Aubrey enters, he smiles at her.

				MRS. AUBREY 
		Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking
		all over.

				CHANCE
		Oh, yes.

				MRS. AUBREY 
		Morton Hull, the producer of 'This
		Evening' just called.

				CHANCE 
		Yes, I have seen that show on
		television.

				MRS. AUBREY 
		Of course. They would like you to
		appear on the show tonight. The
		Vice President was scheduled, but
		he had to cancel, and they asked if
		you would be interested.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I would like to be on that
		show.

				MRS. AUBREY 
		Fine. They felt that since you had
		such close ties with the President,
		you would be a splendid choice. 
			(Chance nods, there is a
				pause)
		... Can I help you? Are you looking
		for something?

				CHANCE 
		No. I like this attic very much.

	Mrs. Aubrey gives him a look, leaves.

	EXT. SKY - DUSK

	AIR FORCE 1 passes through the clouds.

	INT. AIR FORCE 1 - DUSK

	The President sits on a couch in one of the compartments on
	the jet. Before him, stand six of his STAFF, Kaufman
	included.

				PRESIDENT 
		... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on
		national television today he is
		obviously a financial sophisticate
		of some reknown.

				KAUFMAN 
		Yes, sir - we are aware of all
		that, but still, we haven't been
		able to...

				PRESIDENT 
			(interrupts)
		He's an advisor and close personal
		friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes,
		they have volumes of data on
		Benjamin!

				KAUFMAN 
		Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to
		contact Mr. Rand, but he was too
		ill to...

				PRESIDENT 
			(again interrupts)
		I do not want Benjamin Rand
		disturbed! You have other ways of
		gathering information than to
		trouble a dying man. Use whatever
		agencies are necessary to put
		together a detailed history of
		Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into
		problems, alert Honeycutt.
			(he stands)
		I'll be in the office at seven in
		the morning and I would like to
		have it at that time.
			(he starts for door)
		I've got to take a leak.

				KAUFMAN 
		Right, Chief.

	As the President goes to the Men's Room, two of the aides
	reach for telephones.

	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - EVENING

	Chance wears a velvet bathrobe, watches TV. Perkins lays out
	a suit, shirt, tie, etc. on the bed.

				PERKINS 
		I believe these garments will be
		quite appropriate, Mr. Gardiner.

				CHANCE 
			(eyes on TV)
		Yes. They are fine.

	There is a knock at the door.

				PERKINS 
		Excuse me, sir.

	Perkins answers the door, it is Eve.

				EVE 
			(entering)
		Chauncey...

				CHANCE 
			(rises)
		Hello, Eve.

				EVE 
		Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you
		well. I know you'll be smashing.

				CHANCE 
		Thank you, Eve.

				EVE 
		And Benjamin sends along his best
		wishes.

				CHANCE 
		How is Ben feeling?

				EVE 
		He's tired, Chauncey - but he's
		going to watch you tonight. We'll
		both be watching.

				CHANCE 
		That's good. I like to watch, too.

				EVE 
		I know you do - you and your
		television...
			(a pause)
		... Good luck, Chauncey. 

	Eve impulsively steps forward, kisses Chance on the cheek.
	Chance smiles at her, and Eve, slightly embarrassed, turns
	and leaves the room. Chance sits back down, watches TV as
	Perkins attends to his clothes with a whisk broom.

	INT. WASHINGTON POST - STAFF ROOM - NIGHT

	Courtney heads a meeting of his four staffers. One man,
	KINNEY, a research assistant, sits behind a stack of
	paperwork, has a downcast expression as he listens to
	Courtney.

				COURTNEY 
		... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of
		fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's
		a strong candidate for one of the
		vacant seats on the board of First
		American. But before we can do any
		sort of a piece on the man, we're
		going to need facts on his
		background...
			(turns to Kinney)
		... Kinney, what did you come up
		with?

				KINNEY
			(after a pause)
		... Nothing.

				COURTNEY
			(sighs, taps pencil on
				table)
		... Skip the levity, Kinney - what
		have you got?

				KINNEY
			(another pause)
		... I realize this sounds banal but
		there is no information of any sort
		on Gardiner. We have no material on
		him - zilch...

	The room is quiet except for the tapping of Courtney's
	pencil.

	EXT. TELEVISION STATION - NIGHT

	The RAND 1 limousine parks in front of the station. As
	Jeffrey opens the door for Chance, MORTON HULL steps to the
	limo.

				HULL
		Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the
		producer of 'This Evening.'

				CHANCE
			(as they shake hands)
		Hello, Morton.

	Hull takes Chance into the station.

	INT. RAND MANSION - CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Constance, Rand's nurse, enters Chance's room, goes to the
	closet.

	INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Chance is intrigued by the surroundings as Hull guides him
	through the corridor.

				HULL 
		Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact
		that you occupy such a position in
		the world of finance makes you
		ideally suited to provide our
		millions of viewers with an
		explanation of this nation's
		economic crisis.

				CHANCE 
		I see.

				HULL 
		Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that
		more people will be watching you
		tonight than all those who have
		seen theater plays in the last
		forty years?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. It's a very good show.

				HULL 
		I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.

	Hull takes Chance into the MAKE-UP room.

	INT. RAND MANSION - CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Constance is in the closet, searching through Chance's
	pockets, finding nothing. She takes out a small knife, cuts a
	label from one of the jackets. Quickly, she examines one of
	Chance's shoes, copies the name of the shoemaker in a
	notebook. Constance hurries to the dresser, continues her
	search.

	INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR/MAKEUP ROOM  NIGHT

	COLSON, the makeup man, comes through the corridor carrying a
	glass of water. He turns into the makeup room, goes to Chance
	who sits in front of the lights. Hull sits next to Chance,
	briefs him on the show. Chance has his eyes on a TV monitor,
	watches the guest preceding him on "This Evening."

				COLSON
			(gives Chance water)
		Here you go, Mr. Gardiner.

				CHANCE 
		Thank you. I'm very thirsty.

				COLSON 
		Yes, sir - it's hot under those
		lights.

	Colson applies finishing touches to Chance.

				HULL 
		Now, if the host wants to ask you a
		question, he'll raise his left
		forefinger to his left eyebrow.
			(Chance watches TV)
		Then you'll stop, and he'll say
		something, and then you'll answer.

	On the TV, WILLIAM DUPONT, the host, wraps up his talk with
	his guest.

				COLSON 
			(a last-minute dab)
		Okay, Mr. Gardiner, you're all set.

	Hull leads Chance out of the makeup room. Colson closes the
	door, then carefully picks up Chance's water glass, wraps it
	in Kleenex, puts it in his overcoat pocket.

	INT. TV STATION - "THIS EVENING" STUDIO - NIGHT

	William Dupont introduces Chance.

				DUPONT 
		Ladies and gentlemen, our very
		distinguished quest, Mr. Chauncey
		Gardiner!

	The BAND plays as Chance comes onto the stage. An audience of
	about three hundred applauds Chance as he appears. Two TV
	cameras move with him as he walks, with a smile and a limp,
	to center stage. Dupont shakes Chance's hand, Chance holds
	Dupont's hand with both of his own.

				DUPONT (CONT'D)
		Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have
		you with us this evening.

				CHANCE 
		Yes.

				DUPONT 
			(showing Chance to chair)
		I'd like to thank you for filling
		in on such short notice for the
		Vice President.

				CHANCE 
			(sits)
		You're welcome.

				DUPONT 
			(also sitting)
		I always find it surprising, Mr.
		Gardiner, to find men like
		yourself, who are working so
		intimately with the President, yet
		manage to remain relatively
		unknown.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. That is surprising.

				DUPONT 
			(a beat)
		... Well, your anonymity will be a
		thing of the past from now on.

				CHANCE
			(doesn't understand)
		I hope so.

				DUPONT 
		Yes... Of course, you know, Mr.
		Gardiner, that I always prefer an
		open and frank conversation with my
		guests, I hope you don't object to
		that.

				CHANCE 
		No. I don't object.

				DUPONT 
		Fine, then let's get started. The
		current state of our country is of
		vital interest to us all, and I
		would like to know if you agree
		with the President's view of the
		economy?

				CHANCE 
		Which view?

	Applause and laughter from the audience. Dupont accustomed to
	parrying with his guests, asks again.

				DUPONT 
		Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his
		speech at the Financial Institute
		the President consulted with you
		and Benjamin Rand, did he not?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I was there with Ben.

				DUPONT 
		I know that, Mr. Gardiner.

				CHANCE 
		Yes.

				DUPONT
			(a beat)
		Well, let me rephrase the question;
		the President compared the economy
		of this country to a garden, and
		stated that after a period of
		decline a time of growth would
		naturally follow. Do you go along
		with this belief?

				CHANCE 
		Yes, I know the garden very well. I
		have worked in it all my life. It
		is a good garden and a healthy one;
		its trees are healthy and so are
		its shrubs and flowers, as long as
		they are trimmed and watered in the
		right seasons. The garden needs a
		lot of care. I do agree with the
		President; everything in it will
		grow strong, and there is plenty of
		room in it for new trees and new
		flowers of all kinds.

	The audience applauds Chance's apparent metaphor. Dupont
	waits for it all to subside, then asks another question.

	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

	Rand is in bed. Eve sits in a chair next to the bed, squeezes
	Rand's hand in excitement as they both watch Chance on
	television. Teresa, the nurse, watches in the background.

				DUPONT 
			(over TV)
		...Well, Mr. Gardiner, that was
		very well put indeed, and I feel it
		was a booster for all of us who do
		not like to wallow in complaints or
		take delight in gloomy predictions.

	INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The President and First Lady are in bed together watching the
	show.

				PRESIDENT 
		Gloomy predictions? That insolent
		son of a bitch!

				DUPONT 
			(over TV)
		Let's make it clear, Mr. Gardiner,
		it's your view that the collapse of
		the Stock Market, the dramatic
		increase in unemployment, you feel
		that this is just another season,
		so to speak, in the garden?

	The First Lady cuddles close the President, ruffles his hair,
	tries to cheer him up.

	INT. TV STUDIO - "THIS EVENING SHOW" - NIGHT

	Chance answers.

				CHANCE
		In a garden, things grow - but
		first some things must wither; some
		trees lose their leaves before they
		grow new leaves...

	INT. CIA ROOM - NIGHT

	A small, dark room. A videotape machine is running. Also, a
	machine is turning that records the harmonics of Chance's
	voice. TWO CIA MEN run the equipment, watch as a needle
	charts Chance's voice onto paper.

				CHANCE
			(over TV)
		... Then they grow thicker and
		stronger and taller. Some trees
		die, but fresh saplings replace
		them. Gardens need a lot of care
		and a lot of love.

	INT. THOMAS FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Franklin, the attorney that evicted Chance, comes out of the
	bathroom brushing his teeth. His wife, JOHANNA, is in bed
	absorbed in "This Evening." Franklin sits on the end of the
	bed, watches the show.

				CHANCE 
			(over TV)
		... And if you give your garden a
		lot of love, and if you work very
		hard and have a lot of patience, in
		the proper season you will see it
		grow to be very beautiful...

	More applause from the TV. Franklin leans closer to the set.

				FRANKLIN 
			(puzzled)
		It's that gardener!

				JOHANNA 
		Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.

				FRANKLIN 
		No! He's a real gardener!

				JOHANNA 
			(laughs)
		He does talk like one, but I think
		he's brilliant.

				DUPONT
			(over TV)
		I think your metaphors are quite
		interesting, Mr. Gardiner, but,
		haven't we seen seasons that have
		been devastating to certain
		countries?

	INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The President and First Lady continue to watch.

				DUPONT
			(over TV)
		Such as disasterous winters,
		prolonged droughts that have wiped
		out crops, hurricanes that have all
		but swept away island communities?
		Doesn't a country need to have
		someone in charge that can see it
		through such crises?

				PRESIDENT
		... That bastard...

	The First Lady moves closer to him.

	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	The TV, its volume low, plays in the background as Constance,
	with a pair of tweezers, plucks a hair from Chance's pillow,
	puts it into a small vial.

				DUPONT
			(over TV)
		Don't we need a leader capable of
		guiding us through the seasons? The
		bad as well as the good?

				CHANCE
			(over TV)
		Yes. We need a very good gardener.

	INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT

	Dupont continues his questions.

				DUPONT 
		Do you feel that we have a 'Very
		good gardener' in office at this
		time, Mr. Gardiner?

	At the end of the question, Dupont glances over Chance's
	shoulder to look at the monitor.

				CHANCE 
			(a beat)
		I understand.

	Chance turns to see what Dupont is looking at, sees the back
	of his own head on the TV screen.

				DUPONT 
		I realize that might be a difficult
		question for you, Mr. Gardiner -
		but there are a lot of us around
		the country that would like to hear
		your thoughts on the matter.

	Chance is still turned to the monitor.

				CHANCE
		Oh, yes. It is possible for one
		side of the garden to be flooded,
		and the other side to be dry...

	INT. RAND MANSION - ALLENBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Allenby watches Chance on television. The camera that covered
	Dupont in close-up has now pulled back, includes Dupont and
	Chance, both looking into camera. Allenby is concerned, he is
	unsure of Chance.

				CHANCE
			(over TV)
		... Some plants do well in the sun,
		and others grow better in the cool
		of the shade.

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	A group of ELDERLY BLACK PEOPLE sit in the lobby, watch "This
	Evening" on an old black-and-white TV.

				CHANCE
			(over TV)
		... It is the gardener's
		responsibility to take water from
		the flooded area and run it to the
		area that is dry. It is the
		gardener's responsibility not to
		plant a sun-loving flower in the
		shade of a high wall...

	During the preceding speech, Louise, the maid from the Old
	Man's house, chatters.

				LOUISE 
		Gobbledegook! All the time he
		talked gobbledegook! An' it's for
		sure a White man's world in
		America, hell, I raised that boy
		since he was the size of a pissant
		an' I'll say right now he never
		learned to read an' write - no sir!
		Had no brains at all, was stuffed
		with rice puddin' between the ears!
		Shortchanged by the Lord and dumb
		as a jackass an' look at him now!
		Yes, sir - all you gotta be is
		white in America an' you get
		whatever you want! Just listen to
		that boy - gobbledegook!

	There is a chorus of "Amens" as she finishes.

	INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT

	Chance continues.

				CHANCE 
		... It is the responsibility of the
		gardener to adjust to the bad
		seasons as well as enjoy the good
		ones. If the gardener does his job,
		everything will be fine.

	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

	Audience applause is heard over TV. Rand claps weakly along
	with the TV sound. Eve and Teresa also clap.

				RAND
			(smiling)
		Splendid. Just splendid...

	Rand looks up as Constance comes into the room.

				RAND (CONT'D)
		Damn, Constance, get in here! You
		shouldn't miss any of this!

	Constance hurries to Teresa's side. Rand turns to Eve.

				RAND (CONT'D)
		I'm becoming quite attached to
		Chauncey - quite attached... 
			(Eve smiles)
		... And so are you, aren't you,
		Eve.

				EVE 
			(a beat)
		... Yes, I am, Ben.

				RAND 
			(reaches out, takes her
				hand)
		That's good... That's good.

				DUPONT 
			(over TV)
		Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound
		of our audience, I'd say that your
		words are a most welcome respite
		from what we've been hearing from
		others...

				CHANCE 
			(over TV)
		Thank you.

	INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT

	Dupont asks another question.

				DUPONT 
		I'm sorry to say that our time is
		running short, but before we close,
		I'd like to ask one final question.
		What sort of gardener, sir, would
		you be?

				CHANCE 
			(with confidence)
		I am a very serious gardener.

	INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	More applause over the TV. The President pales.

				PRESIDENT 
		Oh, Jesus...

	He rolls over in bed. The First Lady reaches out, puts a
	comforting hand on his shoulder.

	INT. FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Franklin holds a phone to his ear with one hand, shuts off
	the TV with the other.

				FRANKLIN 
		Okay, I'll see you in twenty
		minutes.

	Franklin hangs up the phone, scurries around getting dressed.
	His wife, Johanna, sits grimly in bed.

				JOHANNA
			(coldly)
		... Business, bullshit! Going out
		in the middle of the night to meet
		that bitch in a bar...

				FRANKLIN 
		Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's
		a damn fine attorney! I've got to
		talk to her about this Gardiner...

				JOHANNA 
			(turns over in bed)
		Good night.

				FRANKLIN 
		Look, Johanna...

				JOHANNA 
			(cuts him off)
		I said good night!

	Franklin gives up, hurries from the room.

	INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Colson, carefully carrying his overcoat, walks with Chance
	through the corridor. A delighted Hull walks behind them.

				COLSON 
		Marvelous! Just marvelous, Mr.
		Gardiner! What spirit you have,
		what confidence! Exactly what this
		country needs!

	Chance smiles at well-wishers as they continue on through the
	corridor.

	INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The First Lady is snuggled up close to the President,
	caresses his body. After a moment, it becomes clear to her
	that he is not up to the occasion.

				FIRST LADY 
		... Darling... What's wrong?

				PRESIDENT,
		... I can't... I just can't right
		now... I'm sorry, dearest... I just
		can't...

	The First Lady looks at him for a beat, then turns, lies on
	her back and stares at the ceiling.

	INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT

	An 'in' meeting place for the upper-middle Washington, D.C.
	crowd. Thomas Franklin and Sally Hayes sit at a table, drinks
	in front of them.

				FRANKLIN 
		... It didn't make any sense to me
		at all. I didn't know what the hell
		he was talking about...

				SALLY 
		He wasn't making a speech to us,
		Tom - he was talking to the masses.
		He was very clever, keeping it at a
		third grade level - that's what
		they understand...

				FRANKLIN 
		Yeah? Well, I don't understand what
		was up his sleeve when he pulled
		that stunt with us? What was he
		doing? And why?

				SALLY 
		Who knows...? Maybe the government
		had something to do with it.

				FRANKLIN
		You know, Sally - I really feel
		like I've been had, and you know
		what that means, don't you?... It
		means that any political future I
		had is right down the toilet!

	The CAMERA begins to slowly move away from the table, the
	sound of Franklin's voice continues.

				FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
		... Jesus, the thought of spending
		the rest of my life as an attorney,
		that is really a downer... And,
		Christ, Sally, I almost forgot
		Johanna is starting to think
		something's going on between...

	Franklin's voice fades into the background hubbub. The voice
	of Kinney, the research assistant from the Washington Post is
	heard as the camera settles on a table occupied by Sidney
	Courtney and his staff.

				KINNEY 
		... Sid, be reasonable - I've been
		everywhere, there's no place left
		to check!

				COURTNEY 
		Try again.

				KINNEY 
		Sure, try again - where? There's
		nothing, it's like he never
		existed!

				COURTNEY 
		Try again.

				KINNEY 
		Sid, it's useless!

				COURTNEY
		I said - try again.

	Kinney stands, shoves his paperwork across the table.

				KINNEY 
		Up yours, Sid. You try again, I
		quit!

	Kinney takes his drink with him as he leaves the lounge.

	EXT. RAND MANSION - NIGHT

	The household staff is lined up on the front steps,
	applauding Chance as he steps from the limousine. Chance
	accepts the plaudit, though does not understand the reason.
	As he nears the steps, Perkins and Wilson step forward.

				WILSON 
		An outstanding speech, sir.

				PERKINS
		May I take your coat, Mr. Gardiner?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. Thank you, Perkins.

	Perkins nods, takes Chance's overcoat, allows everyone to
	enter the house ahead of him. Alone on the steps, Perkins
	quickly searches through the pockets of the coat, finds
	nothing.

	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

	Rand is in bed. Eve sits on the edge, looks warmly to Chance
	who stands nearby.
	Allenby prepares an injection for Rand, and occasionally
	glances curiously at Chance. Chance breathes deeply, enjoys
	the oxygen.

				RAND
			(with some effort)
		... You possess a great gift,
		Chauncey, of being natural. And
		that, my boy, is a rare talent, the
		true mark of a leader. You were
		strong and brave, yet did not
		moralize. I hope the entire country
		was watching you tonight, the
		entire country...

	Allenby crosses to Rand, needle in hand.

				ALLENBY 
		And you, Benjamin, must be strong
		and brave for me. Turn over,
		please.

				RAND 
			(holds up hand)
		In a minute, Robert - in a
		minute... Chauncey, I would like to
		ask a favor of you...

				CHANCE 
		Certainly, Ben.

				RAND 
		Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is
		hosting an evening reception
		tomorrow evening honoring
		Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet
		Union... I think it's rather
		obvious that Robert won't allow me
		to attend, so - would you go in my
		place, and escort Eve?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I would like to escort Eve.

				RAND 
		Good. Together, the two of you
		should create quite a stir - I can
		already hear the gossip.

				EVE 
			(with a blush)
		... Ben, really...

				RAND 
			(reaches out a tired hand
				to Chance - Chance holds
				it)
		... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank
		you very much. 
			(takes back hand)
		... All right, Robert, I'm all
		yours.

	Eve and Chance quietly leave the room. Allenby watches Chance
	go, then readies Rand for the injection.

	INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

	The elevator door opens, Eve and Chance come into the
	hallway. Chance looks back at the elevator for a beat, then
	the two walk quietly down the hall.

				EVE 
			(stopping by bedroom door)
		... You don't happen to have a
		tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?

				CHANCE 
		No, thank you.

				EVE 
		Oh. Well, we can fix up one of
		Ben's for you tomorrow night.
		Sophie insists an Black Tie.

				CHANCE 
		I see.

				EVE
			(a pause, softly)
		... I have very few friends,
		Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends
		are all quite a bit older...

	Eve gives Chance a long look, then kisses him on the lips.
	She steps back, smiles.

				EVE (CONT'D)
		... Good night, Chauncey.

				CHANCE 
		Good night, Eve.

	Eve goes into her bedroom, closes the door. Chance heads for
	his room as though nothing had happened.

	INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE ANTE ROOM - MORNING

	Kaufman and the five other Aides nervously await the
	President's arrival. The door opens, the President briskly
	enters the room.

				PRESIDENT 
		Good morning, gentlemen.

				AIDES 
			(as one)
		Good morning, sir.

	The President leads the way into the Oval Office.

	INT. OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

	As the President goes to his desk, Kaufman hands him a
	folder. The President sits, reads it quickly, it is very
	brief.

				PRESIDENT 
			(to Kaufman)
		This is not what I requested.

				KAUFMAN 
		No, sir.

				PRESIDENT 
		This information goes back three
		days. I want the standard file, you
		know that.

				KAUFMAN
		Right, Chief.

				PRESIDENT 
		So...? Where the hell is it?

				KAUFMAN 
		We... uh, have been unable to come
		up with any information before the
		man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ...
		and, uh...

				PRESIDENT 
		What the hell are you talking
		about, Kaufman?

				KAUFMAN 
		Well, we do have data from
		Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it
		isn't pertinent.

				PRESIDENT 
		I'd like to hear that data,
		Kaufman.

				KAUFMAN
		Yes, sir.

	Kaufman takes a clipboard from the man at his right.

				KAUFMAN (CONT'D)
			(reading)
		Suits hand-made by a tailor in
		Chicago in 1918. The tailor went
		out of business in 1929, then took
		his own life. 
		... His shoes were hand-made in
		1928. The cobbler has long since
		been dead. Underwear, all of the
		finest cloth, factory destroyed by
		fire in 1938. The man carries no
		identification; no wallet, no
		driver's license, no credit cards.
		... He carries one item along with
		him, a fine Swiss pocket-watch
		crafted at the turn of the century;
		so far they have been unable to
		ascertain where or when purchase
		was made.
		... He has never dyed his hair.
		... Computers have analyzed
		Gardiner's vocal characteristics;
		it is impossible to determine his
		ethnic background, they feel his
		accent may be northeastern, but
		they will not commit to that.
		... Fingerprint check proved
		negative, no identification
		possible.
			(a pause)
		... That's it, Mr. President.

	The President stares at Kaufman for a beat, then speaks into
	his intercom.

				PRESIDENT 
			(into intercom)
		Miss Davis - I'd like my eggs
		poached this morning, please.

	A quick "Yes sir" from Miss Davis over the intercom. The
	President leans back in his swivel chair, looks at Kaufman.

				PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
		... So what does all that add up
		to?

				KAUFMAN 
		Well, sir - it occurred to us that
		he might be an agent of a foreign
		power. But, we ruled that out, as
		they invariably are provided with
		too much documentation, too much
		American identity... We, uh...don't
		quite know what to make of it yet,
		sir... But we'll keep on top of it,
		Mr. President - we'll come up with
		the answer.

				PRESIDENT 
			(with sarcasm)
		I would appreciate that.

	The Aides quickly leave the office.

	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - MORNING

	Chance is in bed, a bed tray on his lap, eating breakfast. A
	pile of the morning's newspapers lies at the foot of the bed,
	untouched. The TV is playing, Chance watches as he eats.
	There is a knock at the door. 

				CHANCE 
			(without turning from TV)
		Come in!

	Eve enters, wearing a robe over her nightgown.

				EVE 
		Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?

				CHANCE 
		No, Eve. I don't read the papers.

				EVE 
			(moving to bed)
		Well, it seems you've been
		described as one of the architects
		of the President's speech. And your
		own comments from the 'This
		Evening' show are quoted side by
		side with the President's.

				CHANCE 
		I like the President. He is a very
		nice man.

				EVE 
			(sits on bed)
		I know...  
			(a moment) 
		... So are you, Chauncey ...  
			(another moment, Chance
				watches TV)
		... Do you mind my being here, like
		this?

				CHANCE
			(a bite of toast)
		No, Eve. I like you to be here.

	Eve smiles, moves a little closer to Chance.

				EVE 
		... You know, Chauncey... I want us
		to be...
			(with difficulty)
		I want us... You and I to become...
		close... I want us to become very
		close, you know...?

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Eve. I know that.

	Eve suddenly begins to cry, sobbing quietly at first, then
	losing control, the tears flowing freely. To comfort her,
	Chance puts his arm around her shoulder, nearly tipping his
	breakfast tray. Eve responds to his touch, draws closer,
	holds Chance tightly. Chance does his best to avoid spilling
	his breakfast, keep an eye on the TV, and to comfort Eve. She
	gives in to her desires, begins to caress Chance, running her
	hand over his body. She kisses him, his eyes, his neck, his
	lips, his ears. Chance does not return the lovemaking, and
	Eve eventually catches hold of herself, stops. She lies
	quietly beside Chance for a time, regains her demeanor, then
	speaks.

				EVE
		... I'm grateful to you,
		Chauncey... I would have opened to
		you with a touch, and you know
		that...
			(Chance,confused, turns to
				her)
		... But you're so strong - I can
		trust myself with you. I'm glad,
		Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed
		so much restraint...

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you
		didn't open.

				EVE 
		I know you are, Chauncey...
			(a pause)
		... You conquer a woman from within
		herself, you infuse in her the need
		and desire and the longing for your
		love.

				CHANCE
			(another bite of toast)
		Yes. That could be true.

				EVE
			(sits up)
		... I guess I may as well be honest
		about my feelings, Chauncey, as I
		know you are I am in love with
		you... I love you and I want you...
		And I know that you know it and I'm
		grateful that you've decided to
		wait until... Until...

	Eve cannot bring herself to finish the sentence. She rises,
	straightens her robe and moves toward the door.

				EVE (CONT'D)
			(stopping by door)
		... I do love you, Chauncey.

	A knock at the door startles Eve. She turns, opens it to
	MAGGIE, the seam tress. Maggie carries one of Rand's tuxedos.

				EVE (CONT'D)
		Oh, come in, Maggie.

				MAGGIE 
			(entering)
		Yes, ma'am.

				EVE 
		Chauncey, Maggie will alter Ben's
		tuxedo for you now.

				CHANCE 
		Fine.

	Eve leaves. Maggie stands by patiently as Chance eats his
	once-warm scrambled eggs and watches"Mr. Rogers Neighborhood"
	on TV.

	INT. RAND MANSION - ALLENBY'S ROOM - DAY

	Allenby is at his desk, searching through the Washington,
	D.C. telephone book. He finds a number, dials.

				ALLENBY
			(into phone)
		Mr. Thomas Franklin, please.
			(a wait)
		Is Thomas Franklin in?
			(a beat)
		Yes, this is Dr. Robert Allenby,
		would you please tell Mr. Franklin
		that I would like to talk to him?
		It concerns Chauncey Gardiner.

	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK

	Teresa and Constance work in a corner of the room. Rand is in
	bed, very still, deep in thought.

	EXT. SOPHIE'S - EVENING

	The RAND 1 limousine pulls up to Sophie's house. Jeffrey
	opens the door for Eve and Chance. He wears Ben's tuxedo, Eve
	is in a formal gown. The press is waiting, a couple of
	reporters, 5 photographers and a mini-cam crew from local TV
	station gather around Eve and Chance.

				REPORTER #1
		Mr. Gardiner, what did you
		think of the Post's editorial on
		the President's speech?

				CHANCE 
			(smiling for photogs)
		I didn't read it.

				REPORTER #2 
			(surprised)
		But air - you must have at least
		glanced at it.

				CHANCE 
		No. I did not glance at it.

				REPORTER #3
		Mr. Gardiner, the New York Times
		spoke of your 'Peculiar brand of
		optimism,' what was your reaction
		to that?

				CHANCE 
			(continues to pose for
				pictures)
		I did not read that either.

				REPORTER #3 
		Well, how do you feel about that
		phrase, 'Peculiar brand of
		optimism?'

				CHANCE 
		I do not know what it means.

				REPORTER #2
		Sorry to persist, air, but it would
		be of great interest to me to know
		what newspapers you do read.

				CHANCE 
		I do not read any newspapers. I
		watch TV.

	There is a moment of silence as the reporters digest this.
	The TV Reporter smiles, questions Chance.

				TV REPORTER
		... Do you mean, Mr. Gardiner, that
		you find television's coverage of
		the news superior to that of the
		newspapers?

				CHANCE 
			(flatly)
		I like to watch TV.

				TV REPORTER 
			(pleased) )
		Thank you, Mr. Gardiner, for what
		is probably the most honest
		admission to come from a public
		figure in years. Few men in public
		life have the courage not to read
		newspapers none have the guts to
		admit it.

				CHANCE 
		You're welcome.

	Eve and Chance walk toward the front door, leaving the
	newsmen to talk among themselves.

				EVE 
		I've never seen anyone handle the
		media as well as you, Chauncey.
		You're so cool and detached -
		almost as if you were born to it.

				CHANCE 
		Thank you, Eve.

	The front door is opened for them by an attendant.

	INT. SOPHIE'S - EVENING

	The Black Tie reception is in progress. The house is crowded,
	possibly a hundred guests, mostly foreign ambassadors and
	other such dignitaries. Eve and Chance enter, are greeted by
	DENNIS WATSON, a State Department official.

				WATSON
		Mrs. Rand, how good to see you.

				EVE 
		Mr. Watson.

				WATSON 
			(looks to Chance)
		And you must be Mr. Gardiner,
		correct?

				CHANCE
		Yes.

				EVE
		Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson
		of the State Department.

				CHANCE
			(they shake)
		Hello, Dennis.

				WATSON
		A pleasure to meet you, sir.

				CHANCE
		Yes. It is.

	SOPHIE, an older woman bedecked with jewelry, approaches,
	embraces Eve.

				SOPHIE
		Eve, child! How nice of you to
		come.

				EVE
		Hello, Sophie.

	Sophie steps back, looks at Chance.

				SOPHIE
		And look who you brought with!

				EVE
		Sophie, this is Chauncey
		Gardiner...

				SOPHIE
			(hugs Chance)
		Oh, I've been just dying to meet
		you, Mr. Gardiner!

				EVE
		Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia
		Rowley.

				CHANCE
			(being hugged)
		Hello, Sophia.

				SOPHIE 
			(steps back, admires
				Chance)
		Sophie, please - call me Sophie!

	Sophie pulls them both into the party, leaving Dennis looking
	after Chance as he walks away.

				SOPHIE (CONT'D)
			(as they go, to Chance)
		You just have to let me introduce
		you to some of the exciting people
		here... Why, Pat Boone and his
		daughter may drop by later!

	They disappear into the crowd.

	INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

	The President is hunched over his desk, absorbed in
	constructing a model airplane, a World War II flying fortress
	bomber. The First Lady sits nearby, plays solitaire on a
	small table. The President glances to her, then back to his
	work.

				PRESIDENT 
			(gluing the wing)
		... How are the kids getting along?

				FIRST LADY 
		Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy
		this morning. She loves California,
		but to quote her, she says, 'The
		Secret Service is getting to be a
		drag.' I guess she wants her
		privacy...

				PRESIDENT 
		Huh... I'm glad they're along with
		her, if you know what I mean... How
		about Jack?

				FIRST LADY 
		Well, I think Jack needs some time
		alone with you, darling... He's
		getting to that age, you know... He
		really misses you...

				PRESIDENT 
		Yeah... I'll have a talk with him
		as soon as...

	A KNOCK at the door interrupts the President.

				PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
			(calls out)
		... Yes, come in!

	Kaufman enters.

				KAUFMAN
		Sorry to disturb you, chief but we
		have new developments.

				PRESIDENT 
		Oh? What?

				KAUFMAN 
		We have word that the Soviets have
		put out a top priority alert for
		information on Gardiner's
		background. So far, they haven't
		come up with a thing - what's more,
		as a result of their eagerness, one
		of their ablest agents blew his
		cover, we have him in custody at
		this time.

				PRESIDENT 
		Good. Anything else?

				KAUFMAN 
		Yes, chief - eight other foreign
		powers have put Gardiner under
		surveillance. We're around-the
		clock now, sir - I'll keep you
		posted.

	The President nods, Kaufman leaves. The President puts some
	more glue on the wing.

	INT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT

	Sophie pulls Eve and Chance to AMBASSADOR SKRAPINOV and his
	WIFE. Skrapinov smiles as he sees Eve.

				SKRAPINOV 
		Mrs. Rand. How delightful.

	Skrapinov kisses Eve's hand.

				EVE 
		It seems like ages, Mr. Ambassador.
			(a nod to his wife)
		Mrs. Skrapinov.

	Mrs. Skrapinov returns the nod as Sophie introduces Chance.

				SOPHIE 
		Mr. Gardiner, let me introduce you
		to our guest of honor, His
		Excellency Vladimar Skrapinov,
		Ambassador of the Soviet Union.

	Chance warmly shakes Skrapinov's hand with both of his own.

				CHANCE
			(stumbles over name)
		Hello... His... His...

				SOPHIE 
		Ambassador Skrapinov, this is Mr.
		Chauncey Gardiner.

				SKRAPINOV 
		Delighted. Delighted.

				SOPHIE 
		And this is Mrs. Skrapinov.

	Chance smiles at Mrs. Skrapinov as The Ambassador puts an arm
	around him.

				SKRAPINOV 
		You must sit with us, my friend, we
		have much to discuss.

				CHANCE 
		I agree.

				SKRAPINOV
			(to Eve)
		How is my dear friend Benjamin
		feeling?

				EVE 
		He's doing as well as could be
		expected, Mr. Ambassador. He still
		speaks of the stimulating
		discussions he's had with you.

				SKRAPINOV 
		Ah, Yes. Please give him my
		regards.

				EVE 
		Of course.

				SOPHIE
			(tugs at Eve)
		Come on, Eve. Let's let the men
		talk, there are so many people that
		have been asking about you.

				EVE
			(to Chance and Skrapinov)
		Would you two excuse me for a
		moment?

				SKRAPINOV 
		Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall
		yield the pleasure of your company
		to others.

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.

				EVE 
			(smiling)
		I'll be back soon...

	Eve and Sophie leave. Skrapinov leads his wife and Chance to
	their table.

				SKRAPINOV
			(as they walk)
		I'm sorry we haven't met sooner,
		Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of
		seeing you on television last night
		and I listened with great interest
		to your down-to-earth philosophy.
		I'm not surprised that it was so
		quickly endorsed by the President. 
			(quietly)
		... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how
		serious is Benjamin's illness? I
		did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by
		discussing it in detail.

				CHANCE 
		Ben is very ill.

				SKRAPINOV 
		Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As
		you know, we in the Soviet Union
		have the keenest interest in
		developments of the First American
		Financial Corporation... We are
		pleased to hear that you may fill
		Benjamin's place should he fail to
		recover. 
			(arrive at table)
		Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.

	Chance sits between Skrapinov and Mrs. Skrapinov.

				SKRAPINOV (CONT'D)
			(moves chair close to
				Chance)
		... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be
		quite candid - considering the
		gravity of your economic situation,
		shouldn't we, the diplomats, and
		you, the businessman - get together
		more often?

				CHANCE 
		Yes, I agree, I think so too.

				SKRAPINOV 
		To exchange our thoughts - what
		does a Russian know about business?
		On the other hand, what does an
		American know about diplomacy?

				CHANCE 
		Yes, I understand.

				SKRAPINOV 
		And I have noticed in you a certain
		reticence regarding political
		issues - so why not a coming
		together? An interchange of
		opinion? We may find, my friend,
		that we are not so far from each
		other, not so far!

				CHANCE 
			(an engaging smile)
		We are not far... 
			(motions at nearness of
				their chairs)
		... our chairs almost touch.

				SKRAPINOV 
			(laughs)
		Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed
		almost touching! And we want to
		remain seated on them, correct? We
		don't want them snatched from under
		us, am I right? Because if one
		goes, the other goes, and then -
		boom! Boom! And we are both down
		before our time, you see? And
		neither of us wants that, do you
		agree? 

				CHANCE
		I certainly do.

				SKRAPINOV
		Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you
		by any chance enjoy Krylov's
		fables? I ask this because there is
		something... there is something
		Krylovian about you.

				CHANCE 
		Do you think so? Do you think so?

				SKRAPINOV 
		So you know Krylov!

	Skrapinov pauses, then leans close to Chance, speaks softly
	in Russian. Chance, having never heard this language, raises
	his eyebrows and laughs. Mrs. Skrapinov remains impassive.

				SKRAPINOV (CONT'D)
			(amazed)
		So you know your Krylov in Russian,
		do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must
		confess I had suspected as much all
		along - I know an educated man when
		I meet one!

				CHANCE 
		Oh, good.

				SKRAPINOV 
		Yes, it is very good!

				CHANCE 
		Yes, it is. 
			(beat)
		Would you tell me your name again,
		please?

				SKRAPINOV 
			(slaps Chance on the back)
		Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor!
		Vladimar Skrapinov!

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I like that name very much.

				SKRAPINOV 
		And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner! 
			(in Russian)
		How poetic! Chauncey, a name of
		uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a
		bit of the French, a suggestion of
		a stroll through the flowers! A
		beautiful name, my friend!

	As he speaks in Russian, Eve comes to the table, taps
	Skrapinov on the shoulder.

				SKRAPINOV (CONT'D)
			(immediately rises)
		Mrs. Rand! You have returned to us!

				EVE 
		Only to steal Mr. Gardiner away, if
		I might. 
			(to Chance)
		Everyone wants to meet you.

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Eve. That would be good.

				SKRAPINOV 
			(shakes Chance's hand)
		We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner,
		many times!

				CHANCE 
		Thank you.

	As Eve and Chance leave, Skrapinov turns and nods to a MAN
	standing a short distance away. The man, KARPATOV, hurries to
	the table.

				SKRAPINOV 
		Yes? What have you found?

				KARPATOV 
			(in Russian)
		We have nothing on him, Ambassador
		Skrapinov.

				SKRAPINOV 
			(holds up hand, looks
				around)
		Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for
		one, understands our language.

				KARPATOV 
			(in English, softly)
		Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.

				SKRAPINOV 
		What do you mean there is nothing?
		That's impossible.

				KARPATOV 
		There is no information available
		on the man before he moved into
		Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to
		be such a difficult task that it
		has resulted in the loss of one of
		our agents to the United States
		Government.

	Mrs. Skrapinov strains to overhear the conversation.

				SKRAPINOV 
		But... Where was this man Gardiner
		before last week?

				KARPATOV 
		Apparently the White House shares
		our curiosity - they have also
		launched an investigation, and,
		according to our sources, neither
		the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met
		with success.

				SKRAPINOV 
		I see. Clearly, such interest on
		their part is of great political
		significance.

				KARPATOV 
		Clearly, yes comrade.

				SKRAPINOV 
		Hmmm... Take this down. 
			(Karpatov takes out
				notepad)
		I want this quote included in the
		Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner,
		in an intimate discussion with
		Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that
		"Unless the leaders of the opposing
		political systems move the chairs
		on which they sit closer to each
		other, all of their seats will be
		pulled from under them by rapid
		social and political changes."'

				KARPATOV 
		Very good, Your Excellency.

	Karpatov leaves the table.

	INT. WASHINGTON, D.C. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT

	The same lounge as before. Sidney Courtney sits at the same
	table as earlier, only this time with the editor of the
	Washington Post, LYMAN STUART. Courtney puffs on his pipe as
	he speaks.

				COURTNEY
		... It's strictly rumor at this
		stage, Lyman - just something in
		the wind... 

				STUART 
		Something rather big in the wind,
		I'd say. So whose files were
		destroyed? The CIA's or the FBI's?

				COURTNEY 
		I don't know. Like I said, it's
		just rumor so far, but we should
		start nosing around, see if we can
		talk to some people...

	The CAMERA begins to slowly MOVE AWAY from their table.

				STUART 
		... But why? The question is why?
		Why would they destroy Gardiner's
		files? What is it about his past
		they are trying to cover up?
			(his voice fades)
		... A criminal record? A membership
		in a subversive organization?
		Homosexual, perhaps?

	The SOUND of Stuart's voice dissolves into Thomas Franklin's
	as the CAMERA SETTLES on Dr. Allenby and Franklin sitting at
	a table nearby.

				FRANKLIN 
		... And he told us that he had been
		living there since he was a child,
		working as a gardener. He showed us
		a room in the garage, where he said
		he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't
		really believe him, of course - but
		why the act?

				ALLENBY 
		I have no idea...

				FRANKLIN 
		Another thing that baffles me,
		Doctor - what was his connection
		with the deceased? Major financial
		dealings, obviously - but our firm
		has no record of any such
		transactions.

				ALLENBY 
		Hmmm. You say he showed you his
		garden?

				FRANKLIN 
		Well, he said it was his, he walked
		us through it.

				ALLENBY 
		I see. 
			(leans close to Franklin)
		Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and
		Miss Hayes to keep this incident
		with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves.
		There's no telling what he was
		involved in, and the matter may be
		extremely confidential. So please,
		not a word.

				FRANKLIN 
		Of course, Doctor, I understand.

				ALLENBY 
		Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.

				FRANKLIN 
		Certainly, glad to be of help.

	Allenby rises, leaves the bar.

	INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - DINNER PARTY - NIGHT

	Eve and Sophie are talking to a small group. Chance moves
	away to get an hors d'oeuvre and is approached by RONALD
	STIEGLER, a publisher.

				STIEGLER
		Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler,
		of Harvard Books.

				CHANCE 
			(a two-handed handshake)
		Hello, Ronald.

				STIEGLER 
		Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have
		been wondering if you'd consider
		writing a book for us? Something on
		your political philosophy. What do
		you say?

				CHANCE 
		I can't write.

				STIEGLER 
			(smiles)
		Of course, who can nowadays? I have
		trouble writing a post card to my
		children! Look, we could give you a
		six figure advance, provide you
		with the very best ghostwriter,
		research assistants, proof
		readers...

				CHANCE 
		I can't read.

				STIEGLER 
		Of course not! No one has the time
		to read! One glances at things,
		watches television...

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I like to watch.

				STIEGLER 
		Sure you do! No one reads!...
		Listen, book publishing isn't
		exactly a bed of roses these
		days...

				CHANCE 
			(mild interest)
		What sort of bed is it?

	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

	Rand is in bed. Sitting nearby are two attorneys, MONROE and
	TOWNSEND. Mrs. Aubrey stands to one side and Constance and
	Teresa prepare an IV for Rand.

				RAND 
			(speaks slowly, with
				effort)
		Everything. I said everything and
		that's exactly what I mean.

				MONROE 
		But, Mr. Rand, the holdings are so
		extensive, I would like to be more
		precise in...

				RAND
			(interrupts)
		What could be more precise than
		everything...?

	Allenby enters the room, stands by the door, unnoticed.

				MONROE
			(turns to Townsend)
		Everything to Mrs. Rand.

				TOWNSEND
			(drafting a will)
		Right - everything.

				RAND 
		You two don't have to lecture me on
		the complexities of the situation,
		no one knows that better than
		myself... But you must understand
		that I have an endless faith in
		Mrs. Rand's abilities - I know that
		she will select the right person
		for guidance when she has the
		need... She has shared my life,
		gentlemen, she has given me far
		more pleasure than any of my so
		called assets... Life has suddenly
		become very simple for me now - I
		may be older than my years, and you
		might think me to be somewhat
		feeble... But I am still in love,
		gentlemen, thank God for that...

	Allenby silently leaves the room.

	INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - DINNER PARTY - NIGHT

	Dennis Watson, of the State Department, talks with Chance in
	a corner of the living room. Dennis whispers something into
	Chance's ear and Chance gives him an innocent smile. Dennis
	is encouraged by the smile.

				DENNIS 
		We could do it now, we can go
		upstairs.
			(no reaction from Chance)
		... Please, it's time for us. Come
		upstairs.

				CHANCE
			(blankly)
		I like to watch.

				DENNIS 
		Watch? You mean just watch me?
		Doing it alone?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I like to watch very much.

				DENNIS 
		Well, if that's what you want, then
		I want it too.
			(takes Chance's arm)
		We can go this way.

				CHANCE 
		I want to tell Eve.

				DENNIS 
		Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?

				CHANCE 
		Yes.

				DENNIS
			(pulling Chance)
		Oh, you can tell her later. She'll
		never miss you in this crowd.

	Dennis leads Chance out of the crowded room.

	INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A light from the adjoining bathroom filters into the darkened
	bedroom. The President and the First Lady are in bed. They
	each lie on their backs, a distance apart and are silent.

				FIRST LADY 
			(after some time)
		... Maybe you should talk to
		somebody, darling.

				PRESIDENT 
		No, that won't do any good.

				FIRST LADY 
			(another pause)
		... Is it me? Is there something
		I've done?

				PRESIDENT 
		Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not
		you...

				FIRST LADY
			(another pause)
		It's your damn job. It never
		happened when you were a senator...

				PRESIDENT 
		It's not that, I just...

	The inter-White House phone rings, the President reaches for
	it.

				PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
			(into phone)
		Yeah, Kaufman - what is it?

				KAUFMAN'S VOICE 
			(over phone)
		Chief, we have a break in the case.
		Our man at the Washington Post says
		they are working on a story that
		either the CIA or the FBI destroyed
		Gardiner's files before anyone
		could get to them.

				PRESIDENT 
		What? Why?

				KAUFMAN'S VOICE 
			(over phone)
		I can't say at this time - neither
		agency will admit to a thing.

				PRESIDENT 
			(getting out of bed)
		Okay, get both Directors over here,
		I'll be right down.

	The President hangs up the phone as the First Lady stares at
	the ceiling.

	INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS ROOM - NIGHT

	A small room exquisitely decorated in pale lilac tapestry.
	The lights are very dim, and Dennis, who we cannot see, is
	lying on the floor. Dennis' clothes are draped over a chair.
	Chance sees a very small pocket television on a desk. He
	turns the TV on.

				DENNIS' VOICE 
			(softly)
		Can you see well?

				CHANCE 
			(squints at small screen)
		Yes, very well, thank you.

				DENNIS' VOICE
		Do you like it?

				CHANCE
		Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.

				DENNIS' VOICE 
			(disappointed at it being
				'tiny')
		... Are you sure you like it?

				CHANCE 
		Yes, I do, it's very good.

				DENNIS' VOICE 
			(excited)
		Really? Really!!!

	Chance reacts to the change in tone of Dennis' voice, turns
	to look at him on the floor. Hearing the groans and heavy
	breathing, Chance thinks Dennis is ill.

				CHANCE 
		Do you need a doctor? I could call
		Robert...

				DENNIS' VOICE 
		I don't want Robert.

				CHANCE 
		I see.

				DENNIS' VOICE 
			(through the groans)
		Your foot! Give me your foot!!

	Dennis reaches out with his free hand, grabs Chance's foot,
	pulls it to himself.

				CHANCE 
			(some pain)
		Thank you. But my leg is still a
		little sore. 

	Chance watches as Dennis goes through some spasms, then his
	body relaxes. Chance is concerned for Dennis' health.

				CHANCE (CONT'D)
		Are you sure you're not ill?

	We hear a contented sigh from the man on the floor.

	EXT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT

	A long, black limousine with a Red Star on the door pulls
	away from Sophie's house.

	INT. RED STAR LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

	ALEXIS NOVOGROD, a high-ranking KGB officer, and two of his
	underlings are in the limousine, along with Skrapinov, his
	wife and Karpatov. Novogrod and his men wear heavy clothing,
	fresh from Moscow. They all drink vodka.

	(Dialogue in Russian, English subtitles)

				NOVOGROD 
		The rank-and-file in the FBI feel
		he is FBI, but others feel he is a
		CIA man who knows how to destroy
		FBI files.

				SKRAPINOV 
		That could be possible...

				NOVOGROD 
		But we are quite certain, comrade,
		that this man Gardiner is a leading
		member of an American elitist
		faction planning a coup d'etat.

				SKRAPINOV 
		A coup d'etat! Of course, that was
		foreseen by Lenin himself!

				NOVOGROD 
		That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov.
		We have ascertained that Gardiner
		heads a big-business power group
		that will soon be taking over the
		American government.

				SKRAPINOV 
		Big business. I could work with
		that faction quite nicely, Colonel
		Novogrod.

				NOVOGROD 
		You have proven that already,
		Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be
		congratulated for recognizing the
		importance of this man and
		establishing an early friendship.

				SKRAPINOV 
		Thank you, Colonel.

				NOVOGROD 
			(raising his glass)
		Let us toast to the success of the
		coup.

	They all raise their glasses.

				GROUP TOAST 
		Na zdorov'e!

	The men and Mrs. Skrapinov drink their vodkas.

	INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The reception is breaking up. Eve, wearing her coat, searches
	for Chance in the crowd. She sees him, taps him on the
	shoulder from behind.

				EVE
		Chauncey, where have you been? I
		was afraid you got bored and left,
		or that you were with some
		mysterious woman.

				CHANCE 
		No. I was with a man. We went
		upstairs.

				EVE 
		Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always
		involved in some sort of
		discussion...

				CHANCE 
		He was very ill, I stayed with him
		for a while.

				EVE 
		It must be the punch, and it is
		stuffy in here -- I feel it a
		little myself. You're an angel, my
		dear - thank God there are still
		men like you around to give aid and
		comfort.

	Eve and Chance leave the reception.

	INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

	The President sits behind his desk in a bathrobe, his hair
	mussed. Standing before him are GROVER HONEYCUTT, the
	Director of the F.B.I., and CLIFFORD BALDWIN, C.I.A. Chief.
	Kaufman stands to one side. All are red-eyed, tired, and
	frustrated.

				HONEYCUTT 
		I never gave such a directive, Mr.
		President.

				BALDWIN 
		Nor I, sir - it would be out of the
		question.

				PRESIDENT 
		Gentlemen, I didn't call you here
		at such an hour to make
		accusations, I just want to explore
		the possibilities. Now, I have
		three questions; Is the man a
		foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly
		found that our methods of gathering
		data are grossly inefficient? Or,
		thirdly, have the man's files been
		destroyed? Now, I'd like some
		answers.

				BALDWIN 
		Gardiner is not a foreign agent,
		there are now sixteen countries
		investigating the man. We can rule
		that out.

				PRESIDENT 
		Very well... Can we rule out
		inefficiency...?

	There is silence in the room. A couple of looks, but silence.

				PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
		I see. What about question three?
		Is it possible to erase all traces
		of a man?

				HONEYCUTT 
		Highly unlikely, sir... In fact,
		the boys around the Bureau feel
		that the only person capable of
		pulling it off would be an ex
		F.B.I. man.

				BALDWIN 
			(a look to Honeycutt)
		I don't think that's entirely true,
		Grover.

				PRESIDENT
			(to Baldwin)
		And what do the boys around
		Intelligence think?

				BALDWIN 
		Well, Mr. President... They don't
		quite know what to think.

				PRESIDENT 
			(rising)
		Gentlemen, needless to say, there
		is going to be a full Congressional
		investigation of your respective
		operations.
			(goes to door)
		Good night.

	The President leaves the Oval Office.

	INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Eve and Chance walk down the hallway.

				EVE
			(holding his hand)
		I feel so close to you, so safe
		with you, Chauncey...
			(stops at her bedroom
				door)
		... And Benjamin understands that,
		dearest... He understands and
		accepts my feelings for you...

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.

				EVE 
			(opens her door)
		... Come in, Chauncey - please come
		in...

				CHANCE 
		Thank you.

	Chance enters, Eve closes the door behind them.

	INT. EVE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Eve turns on a soft lamp, Chance goes directly to her TV,
	turns it on.

				EVE 
		I can sense that you've been
		through a lot, Chauncey. But one
		day, when you feel like it, you'll
		tell me all about your life...
			(Chance watches an old
				movie)
		... But, even if you tell me
		nothing, even if it's too painful
		for you to reveal your past...

	As she talks, Chance watches a love scene on TV. The hero
	gives his lady a passionate kiss and embrace. The scene seems
	to 'sink into' Chance's mind. He abruptly turns, takes Eve
	into his arms and kisses her full on the mouth. Just as
	abruptly, he turns away and changes channels on TV.

				EVE 
			(breathless)
		Oh, Chauncey... I do love you so
		much!

	She takes Chance in her arms, kisses him wildly. They fall to
	her bed in an embrace. As she holds him, kisses him, runs her
	hands over his body, Chance watches television, neither
	resists nor responds to Eve's caresses. Suddenly she stops,
	lets her head fall on Chance's chest.

				EVE (CONT'D)
		... You don't want me, Chauncey...
		You don't feel anything for me...
		Nothing at all...

	Chance sits up on the bed, then, feeling her sadness, gently
	strokes her hair as he looks at TV.

				EVE (CONT'D)
		I just don't excite you at all... I
		don't know what you want... I don't
		know what you like...

				CHANCE 
		I like to watch.

				EVE  
			(not understanding)
		To watch...? To watch me...?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I like to watch.

				EVE 
			(uncertain)
		... Is that all you want...?
			(a hesitation)
		... To watch me...?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. It's very good, Eve.

				EVE 
		... But I've never done...
			(another hesitation)
		... You mean...? When... When...
		When I do it? ... When I touch
		myself...?

	Eve slowly gets up from the bed, nervously paces the bedroom
	as Chance watches TV. She makes a decision, moves to Chance,
	kisses him.

				EVE (CONT'D)
			(getting aroused)
		Oh, Chauncey...

	She steps back, slips off her dress. She does not undress any
	further, instead, leans close to Chance.

				EVE (CONT'D)
		One of those little things you
		don't know about me yet, darling -
		I'm a little shy.

	She smiles, gets in bed and pulls the covers over herself.
	Chance divides his attention between Eve and the TV, watching
	both with an equal detachment. Eve begins to respond to her
	own touch, finds a heretofore undiscovered pleasure with her
	own body. Chance changes the channel as she reaches orgasm.
	As Eve's body trembles, Chance yawns, gets up from the bed.

				CHANCE
			(going to door)
		Good night, Eve.

	A low purr is heard from Eve as Chance leaves.

	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

	Allenby, Constance and Teresa are readying a transfusion for
	Rand. There is a feeling of urgency as they work.

	Rand, very weak, strains to speak to Allenby.

				RAND 
		No more, Robert... No more
		needles...

				ALLENBY 
			(sits on the side of the
				bed)
		It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you
		can feel it.

				RAND
		I know, Robert... But, strangely
		enough, I don't feel too bad about
		now... I feel all right... I guess
		it's easier... knowing Chauncey is
		here... to take care of things...

	Teresa is about to swab Rand's arm with alcohol but he pulls
	away.

				RAND (CONT'D)
		No, I don't want any of that...
		Please... please, just get me Mr.
		Gardiner, Teresa - please... he'll
		head it up...

	Teresa looks to Allenby, he nods to her. Teresa puts the
	cotton down, leaves the room.

	EXT. RAND MANSION - PATIO - MORNING

	A light snow is failing. Eve is in a fur coat, holds a
	steaming cup of coffee. Chance stands next to her, an
	umbrella in one hand. He holds his other arm out, catching
	the snowflakes as they fall.

				EVE 
		... And I feel so free now,
		Chauncey. Until I met you, I never
		felt acknowledged by a man... 
			(Chance gazes out at the
				falling snow)
		... I always had the feeling that I
		was just a vessel for a man,
		someone that he could take hold of,
		pierce, and pollute. I was merely
		an aspect of somebody's lovemaking.
		Do you know what I mean?

	Chance turns to her, says nothing, presses the cold
	snowflakes to his face.

				EVE (CONT'D)
			(presses close to him)
		Dearest, you uncoil my wants;
		desire flows within me, and when
		you watch me my passion dissolves
		it. You set me free. I reveal
		myself to myself and I am drenched
		and purged.

				CHANCE 
		That's very interesting, Eve.

	Teresa appears in the doorway.

				TERESA 
		Mr. Gardiner. Mr. Rand would like
		to see you.

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I would like to see Ben.

	Chance gives Eve a warm smile, then follows Teresa into the
	house.

	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

	Allenby, with nothing more he can do to prolong Rand's life,
	sits on the bed close to him, grips his hand tightly. Teresa
	shows Chance into the room and Allenby motions to the nurses
	to leave. As they do, Chance, once again breathing the oxygen
	with a smile, goes to Rand's bedside.

				RAND
			(slowly)
		... Chauncey... Chauncey...

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Ben - are you going to die
		now?

	Allenby winces.

				RAND 
			(a weak smile)
		... I'm about to surrender the Horn
		of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel,
		my boy...

				CHANCE 
		Oh, I see.

				RAND 
			(reaches out to him)
		Let me feel the strength in your
		hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your
		strength...
			(holds Chance's hand)
		Yes, that's good... I hope,
		Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay
		with Eve... Take care of her, watch
		over her, she's a delicate flower,
		Chauncey...

				CHANCE
			(smiling)
		A flower...

				RAND 
		She cares for you and she needs
		your help, Chauncey... there's much
		to be looked after...

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I would like to do that.

				RAND 
		... I've worked very hard and
		enjoyed my life... I've known
		success... and I've felt love... My
		associates, Chauncey - I've talked
		with them about you... They're
		eager to meet you... very eager to
		meet you... I'm very fond of you,
		Chauncey... And I understand Eve...
		Tell her that... tell her I'm madly
		in love with her...

	Rand slumps down, dead. Allenby checks his pulse, turns to
	Chance.

				ALLENBY 
		... He's gone, Chauncey.

				CHANCE 
		Yes, Robert. I have seen it before.
		It happens to old people.

				ALLENBY
			(covers Rand's face)
		Yes, I suppose that's true.

	Chance reaches out, uncovers Rand's face, gently touches the
	man's forehead, feels the coldness. Allenby eyes him as
	Chance stays with Rand for a moment, then replaces the sheet.

				CHANCE
			(turns to Allenby)
		Will you be leaving now, Robert?

				ALLENBY 
		In a day or two, yes.

				CHANCE 
		Eve is going to stay. The house
		will not be closed.

				ALLENBY
			(a moment, a look)
		... You've become quite a close
		friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...
			(a beat)
		... Chance...?

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I love Eve very much.

				ALLENBY 
		I see...
			(another beat)
		... And you are really a gardener,
		aren't you?

				CHANCE 
			(brightens)
		Yes, Robert - I am.
			(a smile at Allenby)
		I'll go tell Eve about Ben now,
		Robert.

	Chance leaves the bedroom. Allenby watches him go, then sits
	back in a chair, his head spinning.

	EXT. RAND MANSION - DAY

	A cloudy, cold day patches of snow are on the ground. The
	Rand servants are lined up in front of the mansion, listen to
	funeral services for Rand on a pair of loudspeakers. PAN
	AROUND, reveal the services being held on a hill overlooking
	the mansion. Fifty mourners are gathered around the Rand
	family mausoleum. Chance stands with Eve and Allenby. The
	President of the United States stands before a microphone.

				PRESIDENT 
		... Millions of people across the
		world have heard of the passing of
		Benjamin Rand; but, unfortunately,
		only relatively few will feel the
		pain and sadness at such a loss. To
		most, Benjamin Rand was a legend;
		to those of us gathered here today,
		Benjamin was a beloved friend. My
		personal association with Benjamin
		dates back many years, and my
		memories of our friendship will
		stay with me forever.

	As the President speaks, Chance turns and walks away. Eve and
	Allenby watch as he goes into the trees surrounding the area.

				PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
		I initially came in contact with
		the Rand name in 1943. 1 was a
		young lieutenant in the Air Corps,
		a navigator flying missions over
		Europe. That plane that I learned
		to know so well was manufactured by
		the Rand Aeronautics Corporation.
			(a beat)
		Benjamin Rand was an industrial
		giant, known to be powerful and
		uncompromising, and yet, on a
		personal level, we have all felt
		his warmth and humor...
			(a beat)
		... I would like to share with you
		a few quotes, and a few feelings
		from our dear friend.
			(holds up paper, reads)
		... 'I do not regret having
		political differences with men that
		I respect; I do regret, however,
		that our philosophies kept us
		apart.'
		... 'I have no use for those on
		welfare, no patience whatsoever...
		But, if I am to be honest with
		myself, I must admit that they have
		no use for me, either.'
		... 'I was born into a position of
		extreme wealth, I have spent many
		sleepless nights thinking about
		extreme poverty -  I do not know
		the feelings of being poor, and
		that is not to know the feelings of
		the majority of people in this
		world. For a man in my position,
		that is inexcusable.' 
		'Life is a state of mind.'
		... 'When I was a boy, I was told
		that the Lord fashioned us from his
		own image. That's when I decided to
		manufacture mirrors.'

	INT. LARGE AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Ah auditorium with row upon row of empty seats. Huddled
	together at one end of the hall are six important
	businessmen, speaking in hushed tones. JAMES DUDLEY, a
	powerful industrialist, speaks.

				DUDLEY 
		But what do we know of the man?
		Nothing! We have no inkling of his
		past!

	SEWELL NELSON, a corporation chairman, joins in.

				NELSON 
		Correct, and that is an asset. A
		man's past can cripple him, his
		background turns into a swamp and
		invites scrutiny.

	Another executive, PETER CALDWELL, agrees.

				CALDWELL 
		To this time, he hasn't said
		anything that could be used against
		him.

	CHARLIE BOB BENNET, a Texas oil millionaire;

				BENNET 
		Well, I'm certainly open to the
		thought - it would be sheer lunacy
		to support the President for
		another term.

				NELSON 
		No one will go along with that...
		Look at the facts, gentlemen, the
		response from his appearance on
		'This Evening' was overwhelming; he
		has excited and awakened the people
		of this country at a time of
		despair.

	LYMAN MURRAY, a banker;

				MURRAY 
		He's personable, elusive, yet
		seemingly honest. He's riding a
		crest of popularity that builds
		with every statement. As far as his
		thinking goes, he appears to be one
		of us. I firmly believe, gentlemen,
		that he is our only chance - Mr.
		Chauncey Gardiner!

	EXT. WOODS - DAY

	Chance, his umbrella under his arm, walks through the woods.

	EXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY

	The services are over. Eve, Allenby talk with the President
	and the First Lady.

				EVE
		It was very moving, Bobby - thank
		you so much...

				PRESIDENT
		We're all going to miss him, Eve... 
			(glances around)
		... Where's Mr. Gardiner?

				ALLENBY
		... He walked off...

				EVE
		Chauncey is so sensitive... He was
		overcome with grief...

				PRESIDENT
		I can certainly understand that...

				FIRST LADY
		Of course... I'm so sorry for you,
		Eve...

				EVE
		Thank you, Nancy.

				FIRST LADY
		I'll call you soon.

	The President and First Lady head toward their limousine.

	EXT. WOODS - DAY

	Chance walks deeper into the woods, absorbed in the greenery.
	He stops by a tree, brushes some snow from a branch, moves
	on.

	EXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY

	The majority of mourners have left. Eve and Allenby walk
	slowly to the RAND 1 limousine, look around for Chance.

				EVE 
		... Do you think we should look for
		him?

				ALLENBY 
		I don't think so, he should be
		along soon...

				EVE 
		I wish he were here...

	Eve keeps looking as they walk to the limousine.

	EXT. WOODS - DAY

	Chance happens on a tree with a cracked limb, hanging to the
	ground. He stops, inspects the break, runs his fingers along
	the split in the bark. He looks to the ground, notices that
	an end of the limb has fallen on a seedling, bending it
	double. Chance pulls the limb away, then kneels beside the
	seedling. He removes an expensive paid of suede gloves, and,
	with gentle fingers, brushes the dirt and snow away from the
	seedling. Chance glances up to the remaining limbs of the
	larger tree which could fall and threaten the emerging tree.
	He unfolds his umbrella, places it over the seedling in a way
	to give it protection, yet to still allow it to receive light
	from the winter sun. Chance stands, puts his gloves back on
	and continues his walk, disappearing into a remote section of
	the woods.

	EXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY

	Jeffrey stands holding the door for Eve and Allenby, all the
	other cars have gone. Eve is worried, gets into the car.

	EXT. WOODS - DAY

	Chance walks through the woods, his pace faster than before.

	EXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY

	The limousine still waits for Chance.

	INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

	Eve is deeply concerned for Chance.

				EVE 
		We have to find him, Robert - he
		could be lost, something may have
		happened, we can't leave him!

				ALLENBY 
		You really care for him, don't you,
		Eve?

				EVE 
		I do - we do - both of us, Ben and
		I feel so much for Chauncey...

				ALLENBY 
		I think we'd better go look for
		him. 
			(he taps on the glass
				partition)
		David!

	David starts up the limousine.

	EXT. WOODS - DAY

	Chance walks with determination through the woods.

	INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

	Allenby and Eve search for Chance as David drives along a
	narrow road through the woods. Jeffrey, sitting in front,
	suddenly calls out.

				JEFFREY 
		Look!

	About 100 yards ahead of them, Chance crosses the road,
	continues on down a hill.

				EVE 
		There he is! Chauncey!

	David stops the limousine at the point where Chance crossed.
	Eve hurries out of the car.

	EXT. SIDE OF ROAD - DAY

	Chance is about twenty yards down the side of a hill. Eve
	calls to him.

				EVE 
		Chauncey! Chauncey!

				CHANCE
			(stops, looks up)
		Hello, Eve.

	Eve runs, half falls as she goes down the hill.

				EVE 
		Oh, Chauncey...!

	She gets to him, holds him tightly.

				EVE (CONT'D)
		Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have
		you been? We thought we'd lost you -
		we've been looking all over!

				CHANCE 
		Yes. I've been looking for you,
		too, Eve.

	She hugs him one more time, then she leads him back up the
	hill to the waiting limousine. Allenby gets out of the car,
	greets Chance with a handshake and an arm around the
	shoulder. Then the three get into the limousine.

						  FADE OUT.

					  THE END
