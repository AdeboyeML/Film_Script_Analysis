          The night is stillborn.
                         
          Without sound or movement and nothing is in definition. All we see
          are degrees of blackness in this unlit world. The vague impressions
          of an African village in the void... a ragged line of tukuls (straw
          huts)... a bicycle propped against a mud wall... a soccer ball in
          the dirt...

          And we find a Sudanese family asleep on reed mats. A mother, father
          and their two boys. The younger boy we'll come to know as "WILLIAM"
          (9). His older brother "CHRISTOPHER" (12) curled next to him.
                         
          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT
                         
          And slowly the blackness begins to shift... an otherworldly light
          seeping in from someplace far off... shadows contorting in a ghostly
          orange flicker... images emerging... the silhouettes of men coming
          into this village carrying flaming torches.
                         
          INT. TUKUL - NIGHT

          SCREAMING! -- GUNSHOTS!
                         
          The family bolts awake, moving to their feet as the door to their
          tukul SLAMS open -- THREE soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army
          (LRA) coming in carrying AK47's -- shouting in Arabic -- "Get up!
          Get up!" -- the FATHER stepping forward -- holding up his hands --

          And he's gunned down in cold blood. The soldiers grab the mother and
          boys and begin to drag them out of the tukul -- but WILLIAM breaks
          free -- scrambles deeper into the room --
                         
          THE SOLDIER going after him -- WILLIAM darting behind a stack of
          storage boxes knocking them to the ground -- frantically burrowing
          into the corner -- trying to get away but it's useless -- THE
          SOLDIER grabs his feet and begins to pull him out -- WILLIAM KICKING
          WILDLY -- digging his nails into the dirt -- and as he's dragged out
          of the corner he reaches out... inadvertently grabs a FADED
          PHOTOGRAPH which has fallen on the ground...

          adult males of this village shot dead or bludgeoned to death -- the

          together and weeping --

          jailhouse orange and flanked by a guard. He's stocky, 32 years old,
          with a biker's handlebar moustache. On the surface he appears good-
          looking... even handsome if the light is right... but his face is
          tricky... always changing... behind the quick smile, around his dark
          eyes, in the taut muscles of his neck we see violence.

          An awkward silence as Deng stares out the window. Sam wanting to

          comfortable... and then...

          Sam sits up, looks around the hotel room and we see that it's
          empty... the children vanished... only a small, handmade toy on the
          ground which has been left behind.

          Sam, Deng, and a few other SPLA SOLDIERS jammed into the flatbed of
          this truck, carrying heavy weapons, bouncing fast over this open
          dirt road... featureless savanna FADING into sporadic mud huts...
          the outskirts of a VILLAGE in the distance... and thin columns of
          black smoke twisting into the air...
                         
          ... and as the truck gets closer to the village we begin to pass
          CHILDREN walking along the side of the road... night commuters

          and this is what they see:
                         
          Complete devastation. 30 or 40 bodies mutilated and stacked outside
          smoking tukuls. Some children already here, on their knees, weeping
          next to the corpses of their parents. If you could smell the air it
          would smell of burnt flesh and death.
                         
          Sam silent, aghast, just staring at the horror all around him...

          village... moving to their family's tukul and discovering their
          mother and father piled outside. Naked and burned alive. And the
          sister falls onto her mother's corpse and begins to wail as GREEN
          SHORTS stands there -- frozen -- staring down at his dead parents --
          and suddenly --
                         
          MOVEMENT! -- from inside the tukul... a small dog... a family pet...

          surprise...
                         
          ... and Sam drops to his knees... lifting what's left of the boy
          into his arms and rocking him back and forth... and we watch as a
          terrible sadness overtakes him... something happening here... a
          fierce and overwhelming burden dropping into this man as he holds
          this dead boy... in the dirt... in the middle of this savage
          world...

          it's a promise... to God...

          A bright, fluorescent corridor filled with garish advertising and
          harried travelers rushing to make planes... and we find Sam coming
          down this concourse, carrying his duffle bag, his face
          expressionless. He reaches a revolving door but stops... doesn't
          pass through... sees Lynn, Paige, and his mother waiting for him on
          the other side... their happy, expectant faces...
                         
          But they don't see him yet... and he just stays here... hidden...
          watching them through the glass... and as Sam puts it, at this
          moment he realized he would never look at his own family the same
          way again... in some way lost to them forever after what he saw on
          the side of road in Yei...
                         
          ... and finally he forces a smile, pushes through the revolving door
          and we watch, from this side of the glass, as Paige leaps into his
          arms... Lynn and Daisy moving to him too, embracing him, welcoming
          him home.

          Eight months later and we're looking at a simple, cinder block
          church which is under construction. A scattering of pickup trucks
          parked at the site and a flurry of activity. WORKMEN pouring cement,
          laying sheetrock, etc. And Sam in the middle of this crew, putting
          the finishing touches on a timber frame which is about to be raised.

          with the gun in his hand... and slowly he moves next to him, sitting
          on the cot without saying a word... just the two of them here for a

           My father was big like you. They shot
           him. We were so scared. Then the rebels
           gave me a club and told me if I didn't
           kill my mother they would shoot my
           brother and me.
                         
          And William pauses in his story... lost in this memory... his face
          becoming a mask of pain... but no tears... there are no more tears
          in this young man left to be shed... and so he continues...

          ground... and he reaches out and gently touches Sam's head... a
          moment of tenderness for both of them... an act of love.... these
          two broken souls finding each another here... and William says...

           them take our hearts. This is the most
