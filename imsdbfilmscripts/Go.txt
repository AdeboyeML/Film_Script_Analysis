             EXT. A DITCH - NIGHT

             A light rain and crickets CHIRPING. Somewhere in the night,
             DANCE MUSIC is blaring, but here it's only a whisper with a
             beat.

             Water trickles out of a jagged pipe. Splashing up mud, the
             riverlet weaves through hamburger wrappers and sunbleached
             beer cans, spent condoms and an old Spin magazine.

             The tiny stream ripples past glass and trash and the body of a
             woman. Face up, breathing. Dead grass caught in her braids.
             Her name is RONNA MARTIN. She's eighteen and bleeding.

             Bleeding a lot.

             She tries to         push herself up, but the dirt around her crumbles.
             Her legs are         useless. Despite it all, there's a smile of
             perverse joy         to her face, like she's just remembered the
             punchline to         a favorite joke.

             Pitch black. We hear an ENGINE and ROAD NOISE.

                                          CLAIRE (V.O., CONT'D)
                               It's like, you get this box, and you're
                               sure you know what's in it.

             SPARKS. A cigarette lighter flares.

             We're in the trunk of a car with SIMON BAINES (22), a skinny
             Brit with surfer hair. He looks around, realizes where he is.
             Panicked, he starts POUNDING and KICKING.

                                          CLAIRE (V.O., CONT'D)
                               You shake it, you weigh it, and you're
                               totally convinced you have it pegged. No
                               doubt in your mind.

             The lighter goes out. It's black again.

                                                                             CUT TO:

    We keep tight on CLAIRE MONTGOMERY (19) as she talks to an
    unseen guest. Christmas lights blink behind her.

                          CLAIRE (CONT'd)
               But then you open it up, and it's
               something completely different. Bing!
               Wow! Bang! Surprise! I mean, it's like
               you and me here.

    She takes a sip of coffee, smiles. She has a bewitching smile.

                          CLAIRE
               I'm not saying this is anything it's not.
               But c'mon. This time yesterday, who'dda

    A cash drawer slides shut.

    On the far side of the checkout stand, a STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN
    counts food stamps. Her eyes are sunken, black. She's got a
    screaming BABY on her arm and two rambunctious BOYS in the
    cart. They're wearing pajamas and raincoats.

    It's five a.m. and the store is almost empty.

    Containers of frozen orange juice spin endlessly on the
    conveyor belt. Ronna Martin -- the girl in the ditch -- is
    bagging groceries.

                          RONNA
               Paper or plastic?

    She wears a green apron with a red "Yule Save More" button.

                            RONNA
                 Paper or plastic?

    She's been working for fourteen hours, and it shows. Her
    intonation doesn't change at all.

                            RONNA
                 Paper or plastic?

                           STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN
                 Both.

    Finally satisfied she has all her stamps, the Woman starts
    looking through the receipt. In the cart, the boys knock gum
    from the stand.

                            STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN
                 You didn't double my coupons.

                           RONNA
                 They're at the bottom. In red. Where it
                 says, double coupons.

    She finishes one bag and starts another. The Woman is watching
    her carefully.

                            STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN
                 You can't do that. You can't put bleach
                 in the same bag as food. It's poison.

    Ronna fishes out the bleach and makes a big show of wrapping it
    in a plastic bag.

                            STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN
                 Don't think you're something you're not.
                 I used to have your job.

    Ronna puts the bag in the cart. Looks her dead in the eye.

                            RONNA
                 Look how far it got you.

    Ronna pulls off her apron as she heads for the back. In the
    BACKGROUND, the Stringy Haired Woman is bitching to an
    overweight STORE MANAGER.

6A   INT. SUPERMARKET STOCKROOM - DAY                                        6A

     Dark and dusty, packed floor to ceiling with crates and
     palettes. Offscreen, a SOAP OPERA plays on TV.

     Ronna comes around the corner, a thundercloud of anger and
     frustration. She passes by CLAIRE (19) and the British SIMON
     (21) at the phone, sorting through a crumpled list.

     Simon's eyes track Ronna as she passes.

                           CLAIRE
                   (low)
               Don't.

                           SIMON
               Why not?

                          CLAIRE
               She's been on for fourteen hours.

     At her locker, Ronna misdials the combination. Frustrated,
     she POUNDS the locker, then re-dials.

     Simon approaches Ronna gingerly. Claire gives up on him,
     setting to work opening a box of expired cookies.

                           SIMON
               Ronna?

                           RONNA
               No.

     She trades her apron for her coat.

                          SIMON
               I haven't asked you yet.

                         RONNA
               Answer's still no.

     She slams her locker. She crosses to the time clock.

                          SIMON
               Are you menstrual? Pre-menstrual, post-
               menstrual?

                             RONNA
                  One of the three.
                      (punches out)
                  Okay, Simon. In case you haven't heard
                  the buzz, the scoop, the word on the
                  street, I'm getting evicted. Tomorrow.
                  So pardon me if I'm not in a holly-jolly
                  mood right now.

     Claire looks over, looks away. Ronna heads for the door
     leading outside.

                            SIMON
                  Ronna, they wouldn't evict you at
                  Christmas. You'd be ho-ho-homeless.

     He follows her out the door.

     Ronna forges ahead, ignoring him.

                             SIMON
                  Is that why all the overtime? How much do
                  you owe?

                            RONNA
                  Three eighty.

                            SIMON
                  That's nothing.

                             RONNA
                  More than I got.

                             SIMON
                  I'll give you twenty right now for a
                  blowjob.

     She stops, turns on him. Her look could freeze lava.

                             SIMON
                  Handjob?

     A beat. The start of a smile. Simon's just pushing her
     buttons.

                             SIMON
                  Ronna, do you want my shift?

                      (beat; she's not sold)
                  Cash up front.

     He peels off three twenties from his clip. She looks at the
     money, thinking. Finally, she takes it.

                            RONNA
                  Deal.

     Beyond exhausted, she starts walking back to the store. After
     a beat...

                  Ronna? Are you certain I couldn't have a

     Without turning back, she flips him off.

     Ronna rips off a receipt, handing it to a CLUTCHY OLD WOMAN.
     Starts scanning someone else's groceries. Mannie is digging
     out returns from under Ronna's checkstand. He suddenly looks
     up.

                            VOICE (O.S.)
                 There's an opera about him.

     Ronna looks up at the customer, a handsome college guy (ADAM).
     He's cute in that fresh-scrubbed, Midwestern way.

     Adam's friend ZACK is with him in line, YABBERING on a cellular
     phone. Ronna hits total. $25.12. Adam hands her a credit
     card. She swipes it through the machine and starts bagging
     their groceries.

                            ADAM

     A glance between Adam and Zack, hard to read why. Zack nods
     for Adam to go ahead.

11   INT. MANNIE'S CAR / PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                11

     The Beast is Mannie's pride and joy,    a late-70's Toyota held
     together with duct tape and prayer.     It's outfitted for the
     season with Christmas lights lining    the windshield and back
     window. Santa has replaced Jesus on     the dashboard.

     Ronna climbs in the passenger door, counting a stack of 20's
     fresh from the ATM. Claire's in back.

                          CLAIRE

               You can't do that, can you? I mean, go

               Ok, listen up. If Simon were here --
               which he's not -- he would charge fifteen,

               Ronna, you shouldn't do this.

     Ronna pockets the cash. Mannie's about to say something when
     she stops him.

                          RONNA
               Both of you chill the fuck out. It's just
               once. When Simon gets back, we can still
               overpay for quarters if it makes you feel
               all warm and happy. But this is my deal,
               so just sit back and watch.

     Mannie and Claire remain unconvinced. Ronna reaches for the
     keys, CRANKING the ignition even though Mannie's driving. The
     ENGINE purrs.

     Ronna stands by the intercom of a two-story walkup in
     Hollywood. Waiting, she looks back to the street, where The
     Beast sits idle at the curb.

                          INTERCOM VOICE
               Speak!

                         RONNA
               Todd! It's Ronna Martin. You know me
               through Simon.

     A long pause.

                          INTERCOM VOICE
               Yeah?

                          RONNA
               Can I come up?

     Another long pause. Ronna looks back at The Beast,
     embarrassed. Finally the door BUZZES and a latch CLICKS open.
     Stairs lead up.

     She motions back "five minutes" to The Beast.

                                                                            12.

13   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                                     13

     Three out of four lights are burned out in the hallway.

     A few feet ahead of Ronna, a door stands partly ajar. A weird
     red-and-green light spills out through the crack, along with
     an Alice in Chains SONG.


14   INT. APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                     14

     Ronna pushes the door open from the hallway.

                            RONNA
               Todd?

     Shades drawn, the room is completely insulated from reality.
     The light bulbs have been markered over, casting eerie pools of
     red and green light. Broken CD's dangle off a tiny Christmas
     tree by the stereo. Slacker seasonalism.

                          GAINES (O.S.)
               Don't let the cat out.

     Ronna closes the door behind her.

     TODD GAINES emerges from the darkened bedroom, tying the
     string on a pair of sweat pants. That's all he's wearing.

                          RONNA
               I didn't wake you up, did I?

                            GAINES
               Nah.

     He settles into an overstuffed couch and lights a Marlboro.
     Adjusts himself in the crotch. Motions for her to take a
     chair. She's more nervous than she wants to let on.

                          GAINES
               I thought you were still buying quarters
               off Simon. Least what Simon pretends are
               quarters.

                          RONNA
               I keep him honest.

                          GAINES
               At that level you're supposed to pinch.
               It's the economics of it.

     IN THE BACKGROUND

     A WOMAN with a ballerina's body comes out of the bedroom. She
     tucks an unrealistically large breast down into her tight top.

                            GAINES
                  You leaving?

     She leans over the back of the sofa for quick, tonguey kiss.
     In a sneak attack, she shoves a Santa's hat down to his ears.
     He bats the white pom out of his eyes.

                             GAINES
                  Be good.

     The woman is out the door without a word. Gaines looks back
     over at Ronna, not the least bit self-conscious about the hat.

                             GAINES
                  I take it this is not a social call.

                             RONNA
                  I need a favor.

                             GAINES
                  A favor? Wow. I didn't know we were such
                  good friends, Ronna. Because if we were,
                  you would know I give head before I give
                  favors. I don't even give my best friends
                  head, so the chance of your getting a
                  favor right now are pretty fucking slim.
                      (beat)
                  You might try just telling me what you
                  want to buy.

                            RONNA
                  Twenty hits of ecstacy.

     He takes a deep drag on the cigarette, looking at her. Blows
     the smoke out. He picks up a remote control. Aims it at the
     stereo.

     CLOSE UP

     The volume meter, climbing fast.
     Out of the green, into the red.
     The MUSIC is deafening.

     ON GAINES

     On top of Ronna, face in her ear. His hand wraps around her
     head, holding her tight. We can't HEAR what he's saying.
     Ronna's eyes betray her fear.

                                                                     (CONTINUED)

     He backs off. She looks confused.

     He nods. Do it.

     The MUSIC still BLARING, she stands and slowly unbuttons her
     shirt. Takes it off -- very self-consciously. Pulls her t-
     shirt off over her head. Just her bra underneath. He motions
     for her to turn around. She does, then back.

     Her hands are shaking. She holds them together.

     Gaines aims the remote at the stereo. The MUSIC retreats.

                          GAINES
               You come here out of the blue asking for
               twenty hits. Just so happens twenty is
               the magic number where intent to sell
               becomes trafficking.

                          RONNA
               Todd, I would never fuck you like that.

                          GAINES
               How would you fuck me? Would you strap it
               on?

     He climbs over the sofa to a dresser. In a drawer, he digs
     down through a pile of socks to find a wide-mouthed bottle.
     And an empty Tylenol bottle. Blows out the dust.

                          GAINES
               What's the occasion?

                          RONNA
               There's this big Christmas party thing.
               Warehouse, you know. A bunch of us are
               doing sort of a pre-party thing.

                          GAINES
               Friends of yours. You're not going to go
               and try to sell this on me, are you?

                          RONNA
               No.

                          GAINES
               You're not dealing.

                          RONNA
               Swear to God.

     He transfers pills from the big bottle to the Tylenol bottle.

               This is the real thing. Pharmaceutical
               grade, not that crunchy herbal rave shit.

     He snaps the cap on tight.

                          GAINES
               Twenty at fifteen is 300.

               Fifteen? I was thinking more like ten.

                         GAINES
               You already did strap it on.

                          RONNA
               It's just that I know you charge Simon
               ten.

               Inflation's a bitch.

     He offers it to Ronna, who doesn't reach out for it.

                          RONNA
               Here's the deal. There's 20 of us. I
               need all of this. But I only have two
               hundred. I mean, that's all I have.

     Gaines undoes the cap of the Tylenol bottle, starts pouring the
     pills back out.

                          RONNA (CONT'D)
               No, hear me out. This two-hundred is like
               a downpayment. You give me the stuff, I
               get the extra hundred from them, then I
               come right back and pay you.

                          GAINES
               See, that would be doing you a favor, and
               you know how I feel about favors.

     He gives her a quick look over.

15   EXT. THE BEAST - NIGHT                                                 15

     Ronna kneels down beside the passenger window. Knocks on the
     glass. Claire rolls down the window. MUSIC spills out.

                         RONNA

     The release BUZZER stops as Ronna pulls open the door to the
     stairs. Claire just stands there, disbelieving, making no
     motion to go in.

                          RONNA
               Forty-five minutes. Hour, tops. You just

               is an accessory. You are just some chick
               who's sitting in an apartment. That's it.

     It's not just the matter at hand, but years of minor adjustment
     and one-upsmanship. Ronna finally drops the bravado.

                          RONNA

                  Is this it? Are you sure?

     ENGINE running, The Beast is parked along a residential street
     in Venice. In the driver's seat, Mannie looks for an address.

                  Six-forty-four. Jesus, next time ask for

     He kills the engine. Ronna does a quick face-check in the rear
     view mirror. She's out the door, moving a hundred miles an
     hour.

                            MANNIE
                  Ronna!

     She looks back in. Mannie shakes the Tylenol bottle she
     forgot. Tosses them to her.

     She pockets the bottle. SLAMS the door. Mannie tracks her as
     she circles the car.

     A beefy guy named BURKE HALVERSON reaches out a hand.

                             RONNA
                  That was just a friend.

     Only now do we TURN to see Adam and Zack standing nearby,
     trying to look cool. Their house is spartan even by frat-boy
     standards, just goodwill furniture and as-is Ikea.

                            BURKE (O.S.)
                  Hey. What can I get you to drink?

                             RONNA
                  Some of that orange juice would be great.

     Burke does a hepcat swing through the kitchen door, leaving
     Ronna alone with Adam and Zack.

                             ZACK
                  So this party tonight sounds like it's
                  gonna be huge.



                                                                     (CONTINUED)

                             ADAM
                  Massive.

                            ZACK
                  That would be a synonym for huge.

                            ADAM
                  Just backing you up.

                             ZACK
                  And I appreciate that.

                           BURKE (O.S.)
                 Ronna hun, we are fresh out of o.j...

     Adam looks at Zack. Ronna catches it.

                           BURKE
                     (back thru door)
                 Cerveza?

     He hands her a beer.

                           ADAM
                     (to Burke)
                 Oh yeah. Hey. We bought a whole bunch of
                 orange juice. It's in the car.

     ANGLE ON RONNA

     watching them with a lion tamer's concentration. Burke looks
     back over at her.

                            BURKE
                 Now, Zack tells me you got 20 at 20, is
                 that right?

                            RONNA
                     (suddenly)
                 You got a bathroom?

                            ADAM
                 Down the hall on the right.

                            ZACK
                 Let me show you...

     He moves at Ronna strangely. It freaks her out.

                            BURKE
                 Maybe we could do this first.

     Burke shoots Adam a look. Ronna's already headed down the
     hall. They wait silently until Ronna's out of earshot.

                            ADAM
                 We said Chicago, you said Philadelphia.

                                                                           CUT TO:

     Burke walks off camera, headed for the hall. Zack hangs his
     head. Adam looks up at the camera.


19   INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                                  19

     CLOSE UP: Ronna locks the door.

     She leans back against the frame, panicking.
     She turns on both faucets.
     She checks the window.
     Nailed shut.

     She looks at herself in the spotless mirror.

                         RONNA
               You're fine. You're fine.

21   INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                                  21

     She pulls the Tylenol bottle out of her pocket.
     She looks down at the toilet.
     Hesitating, until...

     A KNOCK on the door.


22   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                                   22

     Ronna's heart is in her throat.

     CU: The handle, rocking back and forth, locked.

                            RONNA
               Fine.

     She struggles with the cap.
     Child safety.

     It finally POPS open.
     A few pills scatter on the carpet.
     She dumps the contents into the toilet.

     FLUSHES.

     Burke hears it. Freaks out. He rifles through the keys on his
     belt.

     Ronna's on all fours, searching for spilled pills. She tosses
     them into the swirling water.


26   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                                     26

     CU: The hole in the center of the door knob. A thin allen
     wrench slips in.

     Burke forces the door open to reveal

     RONNA

     standing with her beer, cool as an Eskimo.

                               RONNA

     She pushes past him into the hall.

     Ronna is headed for the front door. Following behind her,
     Burke waves at Adam -- BLOCK THAT DOOR!

     Adam steps in her way.

                            BURKE
                  Ronna, hun, do we got a deal here or not?

                  No. No, see we don't. That's what I came
                  here to tell you. I couldn't get
                  anything.

     She bumps back into Adam at the door.      Burke is closing in.

                               RONNA
                  It's true.

     swigs her beer like a trucker.

                  Did you know I'm only 17?

                  I probably shouldn't be drinking this
                  beer, should I? Being so underage and
                  all.

     The men just stand there, watching.

     BACK TO COLOR

     CLOSE ON Burke, dumbstruck. He nods at Adam.

     Adam steps away from the door.

     Ronna backs her way out the door, never taking her eyes off
     them. The door CLOSES.

     A BEAT. Adam and Zack await the fury. Burke looks back to the
     hallway.


28   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT (NORMAL)                                             28

29   EXT/INT. THE BEAST ON STREET - NIGHT                                     29

     The car is parked on the side of another residential street.

                             RONNA
                  I think it was Simon they were after. He
                  deals all the time out of the store. I
                  mean, he makes change out of the fucking
                  register.

                             MANNIE
                  They didn't know who was dealing, just
                  that it was someone at the store?

                             RONNA
                  They were fishing. I bit.

     Ronna's PAGER goes off with a shrill BEEPING. She checks the
     number.

                            RONNA
                  It's Claire. She paged me while I was in
                  there.

                             MANNIE
                  We go back to Todd. Tell him they didn't
                  show up, whatever. And then just swap the
                  pills for Claire.

                              RONNA
                  We can't.

                              MANNIE
                  Why not?

                            RONNA
                  They're gone. I flushed them.

                              MANNIE
                  Oh shit.

                             RONNA
                  Think of something. I need a hundred
                  bucks or 20 hits of X.

     A long silent beat as both put on their thinking caps. Mannie
     tries to beat down a smile that curls the edges of his lips.
     He clenches his jaw, trying to keep it in.


                                                                   (CONTINUED)

     She turns his chin to hold his eyes to the light. They're wild
     and dilated. And his smile resurfaces despite his best
     efforts.

                             RONNA

30   INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT                                                 30

     A sign over the entrance reads "Yule Save More." Christmas
     MUSAK blares "Jingle Bell Rock" overhead.

     The automatic doors slide open to reveal Ronna and Mannie, who
     split up. We follow Ronna, who is now wearing Mannie's black
     trench coat. The store is almost empty, with STOCKMEN
     beginning to unload palettes.

     Ronna turns down an aisle marked "Soap/Shampoo/Drugs."


31   INT. AT THE MANAGER'S COUNTER - NIGHT                                    31

     Mannie scans his hand on a UPC register, watching the laser on
     his fingers, listening to it BWOOP. He smiles broadly at an
     idle REGISTER WOMAN, who doesn't even look up. He then ducks
     down behind the counter.

     A CRAPPY CD PLAYER

     spins away. He presses the "| " button, then cranks the

32   INT. AT CHECKSTAND - NIGHT                                              32

     The Register Woman looks up.

     Two STOCKBOYS look up.


34   INT. DRUG AISLE - NIGHT                                                 34

     A COUPON-WIELDING WOMAN looks up, confused, but proceeds to
     push her cart around the end of the row.

     Ronna looks both ways. She's alone.

     She starts grabbing boxes off the shelf and shoving them into
     the pockets of Mannie's coat. Cold medicine. Allergy
     medicine. Every pill she can find.

     SWITTERMAN

     comes ROARING by behind her, heading for the front. She tries
     to duck away, but he's too steamed to even notice her.

     Ronna does a quick check to see if she got everything.
     Hurrying down the aisle, she swipes a bottle of Evian.

     The two stockboys give a wide-eyed, Spielberg           stare...

     We MOVE to the next aisle, where the Coupon Woman is staring at
     the same thing...

     We MOVE again to Ronna at the end of her aisle. She just now
     sees it...


36   INT. FRONT OF THE STORE - NIGHT                                         36

     ANGLE ON Mannie. He sticks his hand out.

     ANGLE ON the Register Woman. She sticks her hand out.

     Their palms meet. Their hips come together. And they dance.

     What starts as a tango, spirals into a STAR SEARCH-y routine of
     dips, spins and Arthur Murray nightmares. Torville and Dean on
     linoleum.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

     The stockboys watch, horrified but transfixed. The Coupon
     Woman taps her shoe against the wheel of her cart.

     ANGLE ON MANNIE

     dancing his heart out. His face is red and dripping sweat.
     He's too out of it to notice.

     HIS POINT OF VIEW

     a JET ENGINE ROAR, swirling light. The MUSIC is stacked up on
     itself, overlapping and bizarre. For just a moment,
     horrifying.

     ANGLE ON MANNIE

     he stops mid-twirl. Holding himself against a magazine rack.
     Ronna takes him by the shoulder.

     MANNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

     Ronna leans into a fish-eye swirl. The ROAR grows louder,
     continuing as we

     Behind the wheel, Ronna's ripping open boxes of medication.
     Cracking open jars, she spills the tablets out on her hand.

                             RONNA
                  Were they round or oval?

                            MANNIE

                  Round. White. Like aspirin. Like baby
                  aspirin.

     She digs through the pockets of the coat, seeing what else she
     grabbed. Her BEEPER goes off. She hits it to make it stop.

     She pops an allergy pill out of its blister pack. Compares it
     to another pill, almost the same.

                            RONNA
                      (holding them up)
                  A or B?

                  I wasn't really looking.

     Making a decision, Ronna starts popping the rest of the pills
     out of the blister pack, dumping them into the Tylenol bottle.

     Her BEEPER goes off again.

                            RONNA
                  Stop fucking paging me, Claire!

     Mannie nurses the Evian bottle.

     A PHONE rings.


38   INT. GAINES' APARTMENT - NIGHT                                              38

     Gaines picks up the receiver, clicking the remote to mute the
     CD player. He's still shirtless and wearing the Santa Claus
     hat.

                      (to Claire)
                  Where's this party at?

     Claire is sitting in the corner, holding herself very still.

     She digs a postcard-ish invite out of her purse. He snaps his
     fingers. She hands it over.

                             GAINES
                      (on phone)
                  It's called "Mary Xmas." Mary like a

     He hangs up. The CD player is still muted. The silence is
     vast. Gaines scratches an armpit. Checks his watch. Claire
     looks away.

                             GAINES

     He gestures like he's going to click on the CD player, but
     instead points it at her.

                          GAINES

               Answer the question, Claire.

                          GAINES
               Look at me. I want to show you something.

     She looks back over at him. He slowly undoes the drawstring to
     his sweat pants. Starts to reach inside. Claire watches,
     revolted and disbelieving. A beat.

                         GAINES
               I'm kidding!

     His hand reaches between the cushions of the couch, where he
     pulls out a 9mm handgun.

                          GAINES
               I'm not kidding. Where the fuck are they,
               Claire?

     The gun pointed at her, Claire is losing her shit. Her face
     squeezes tight, like her head's being sucked through a tiny
     hole. Just when she's about to pop...

     The BUZZER sounds.

     Saved by the bell.

     Gaines pushes the TALK button on the intercom.

               Don't say anything. And try not to look

     warmly.

               That's no problem. These things happen, I
               understand that.

               of miscommunication, I thought...

     A SIAMESE CAT

     lays down on a table in front of him, staring at him.

     wanting to exhale first.

     Hands waving, Claire struggles to keep herself from laughing
     and choking. Finally she gives in, coughing up smoke and snot.
     Ronna blows out a cool ribbon of smoke.

     She hands over a wreath of plastic holly.

                          RONNA
               Pin me.

     She leans down to let Claire pin the holly in a crown around
     and through her hair.

                          CLAIRE
               Okay, at the risk of sounding like. You
               know. Me. What are you going to do about
               getting evicted? You're still short,
               aren't you?

     Mannie's hand flops down to the window. Claire hands him the
     joint.

     From RONNA'S P.O.V., we see the floor is still littered with
     dozens of boxes of medicine.

     A beat. She picks up a box.

     An idea forming, Ronna sits back up. Smiles.

                         CLAIRE
               What? What?


43   EXT. FIELD / PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                       43

     Ronna and Claire weave through the densely packed lot, where
     RAVE-GOERS party in and around their cars, drinking and
     smoking.

     As they walk, Ronna pops allergy medicine out of a blister-foil
     pack. She tosses the box away. Scanning the lot, she points
     to a mini-van.


44   EXT. AT THE MINIVAN - NIGHT                                            44

     Ronna knocks on the window. A NERVOUS TEENAGER rolls it down,
     releasing a cloud of smoke. Ronna smiles.

                         RONNA
               Hi. I'm Kelly, and this is Donna. We
               were wondering if you might want to hang
               out.

     Ronna and Claire are packed in tight with three VALLEY
     HIGHSCHOOL COUPLES. The guys are stoned, the girls uptight.
     They're all breaking curfew.

                          FILA GUY
               I think I feel something.

                         RONNA
               It's really smooth, isn't it? Donna's
               brother is a pharmacist. He got it for
               us.

     A look from Claire -- why are dragging me into this? But she
     goes for it.

                         CLAIRE
               Chip. His name is Chip. My brother.

                          NIKE HAT
               Is it like a wave, or is it like a zoom?

                          FILA GUY
               It's like floating. Like, "Hey down
               there, how's the ground and shit."

                         NIKE HAT
               I got it. Oh, fuck. Yeah, I feel it.

                          ANOREXIC GIRL
               Is it really that cool?

                          FILA GUY
               You gotta try it. Shit, I'll buy for you.

     He pulls out his wallet and hands Ronna a twenty. She gives
     the Anorexic Girl a tablet, who downs the pill with a swig of
     Diet Coke.

                          RONNA
               And you know what makes it even better?
               If you smoke a lot of pot. I mean a lot
               of it.

     Fila Guy nods, firing up the mini-bong again.

46   EXT. LINE OUTSIDE A WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                    46

     Mannie leans against a wall, pale and out of it, a nauseated
     smile on his face.

                          CLAIRE
                   (low)
               I can't believe you are selling allergy
               medicine.

                          RONNA
               We're out of that. We're down to chewable
               aspirin.

     A SKATE-PUNK GUY comes up to them, money in hand.

                         SKATE-PUNK GUY
               Hey. People are saying you have some
               really good stuff.

     Ronna takes the money, looks him over.

                          RONNA
               Show me your tits.

     A beat. He pulls up his shirt to show his skinny white chest.
     Deeming him worthy, Ronna hands him a pill and sends him on his
     way. She adds the twenty to her stack.

                          CLAIRE
               How much have you made?

                         RONNA
               Four hundred.

     The opening RUMBLES of an industrial ANTHEM rise as we cut to:


47   INT. GAINES' APARTMENT - NIGHT                                           47

     MUSIC builds throughout.

     Standing at the dresser, Gaines cracks open Ronna's bottle.
     Pills spill out on a plate.
     He counts them, pushing them aside in groups with a card.
     Stops.
     Picks one up. Looks at it more closely...

     Pulls open a drawer full of socks.
     Digs out the wide-mouthed bottle.
     Shakes out a pill.

     Flicks on a desk lamp.
     Looks at both pills in his hand, comparing...

     Fuck.

     He flips over the card on the dresser.
     Mary Xmas.
     The invite Claire gave him.

     With a sudden RAGE, he WINGS the plate against the far wall.
     It SHATTERS.

     The music EXPLODES and we're...


48   INT. WAREHOUSE / MARY XMAS SUPAFEST - NIGHT                                48

     A grinding, sweating sea of humanity. In the mosh pit,
     SKINHEADS and coked-up POSEURS run in blind circles. A stringy-
     haired EYELINER BOY crashes into

     RONNA

     who had her own groove going. She shoves him back into the
     wheel, a foot on his ass.

     Claire, behind her, YELLS something in her ear. We can't hear
     a thing. Ronna downs the rest of her drink, hands Claire the
     cup. That's not what Claire meant -- she's a little pissed --
     but Ronna is oblivious.

     Both hands free, Ronna pushes her way deeper into the eye of
     the storm. She adjusts her holly crown. She's sky high and
     loving every minute of it.


49   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                                     49

     The line to get in is longer still, snaking down the wall.
     Fila Guy is talking to a friend in a SPIDER MARINE shirt.

                             FILA GUY
                  This girl inside. She and her friend have

     We look past Fila Guy to see Todd Gaines, who's been listening.
     Seething.


50   INT. BY THE ENTRANCE - NIGHT                                             50

     Sweating hard, Mannie is pressed back against a pole, shirt
     over his head. Two nose-ringed RIOT GRRRLS are drawing a
     Christmas tree on his chest and stomach with a fat magic
     marker.

     Looking over at the entrance, he watches some GAPSTERS move
     past the BOUNCERS. And behind them,

     TODD GAINES.

     Mannie's drugged eyes go wide with panic. He hunches down.
     Gaines starts looking around the edge of the crowd.

     Mannie works his way into the mob.

     STROBES fire overhead.

     Ronna dances on, oblivious...
     Gaines circles, searching...
     Mannie fights his way through the outer ring of MOSHERS...

     Through the crowd, we see Gaines looking in...
     Mannie grabs Ronna...
     She smiles, tries to kiss him...

     He YELLS in her ear. He has to repeat himself...
     She looks back over her shoulder...
     A space in the crowd...

     She sees Gaines. He sees her.

     The MUSIC STOPS. Dead silence.

     Ronna and Gaines trade stares for what feels like an eternity,
     until suddenly...

     The MUSIC BLASTS back, harder than ever. Like a shot, Ronna
     and Mannie are out of there. Gaines plows through the crowd,
     coming after them.


51   EXT. WAREHOUSE ALLEY - NIGHT                                             51

     They race down the alley. A burly BOUNCER shouts after them:

     The Bouncer is blindsided by Gaines, who charges after Ronna.


52   EXT. DIFFERENT ALLEY - NIGHT                                              52

     Ronna pulls Mannie into a covered doorway, a niche set off from
     the alley. They hide back in the shadows as

     GAINES

     races past. Ronna kneels down to Mannie, who's hunched over
     his knees sweating and shaking.

                            RONNA
                  What's wrong? Mannie?

     She puts a hand on his sweating forehead.         His cheeks.

                            RONNA
                  Jesus. You're burning up.

                             MANNIE

                             RONNA
                  Listen to me. We're going to find Claire
                  and get out of here.


53   EXT. ALLEY / DUMPSTERS - NIGHT                                            53

     Ronna half-carries Mannie down the alley. He's too heavy to
     lift, and too out of it to go much further. He collapses to
     his knees. She can't get him back up.

     Without warning, he HEAVES. We hear the SPLASH on the asphalt.

     She props his head back against a dumpster. Wipes his face.

                             RONNA
                  Sweetheart. Mannie. I'm going to leave
                  you here. I'm going to get the car and
                  come back for you.

     She fishes the keys out of his pocket. Mannie grabs onto her
     arm, tight.

                  You're going to be fine. Ain't nobody

     She pushes his legs into the shadows. He's crying.


54   EXT. FIELD / EDGE OF PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAIN)                           54

     In the distance, we hear the RUMBLE of the music. Keeping low,
     Ronna works her way down a row, coming to Mannie's car. She
     tries one key, then another.

     We LOOK UP to see Todd Gaines watching her from the hood of a
     nearby car.

                             GAINES
                  How's it going, Ronna? How are sales?

     Her heart skips a beat. She drops the keys.

                             RONNA
                  Todd, I can explain.

                             GAINES
                  I'm not going to ask you to.

     He climbs off the car, approaching.

                             GAINES [CONT'D]
                  The thing is, it's not like I'm in a
                  highly ethical industry. But goddamn,
                  Ronna. You fucked me over for 20 lousy
                  hits.

     He pulls his gun from the back of his jeans. By instinct, she
     starts to move away.

     A red Miata moves down the row behind Ronna. She looks to it
     for help, but it's already passed.

                             RONNA
                  It's not what it looks like. I mean, it
                  sort of is, but it's complicated.

                            GAINES
                  Not really.

     He cocks the gun.

                  I know I fucked up, but I can make it up
                  to you. Please, Todd.

                             GAINES
                  I'm the last fucking person you should be
                  expecting a favor from.

                             RONNA
                  I have the cash. I have more than I owe
                  you.

                             GAINES
                  So now you're an entrepreneur.

     At the last moment, Ronna bolts. She ducks around the corner
     of a van, only to see...

     A RED MIATA

     doing 20 in reverse. It brakes, but there's no time. It hits
     her hard.

     She flies up over the roof of the car, CRASHING down on the
     soft top. Her limp body starts to slip down the windshield,
     but finally sticks.

     PUSH IN ON GAINES

     seeing the hit. HEARING it. Stunned.

     A beat, then we hear the engine REV, pulling back again. That
     shakes Ronna loose, letting her drop over the headlights in
     front.

     Rolling down the slope at the edge of the field, Ronna topples
     ass-first into a drainage ditch. Her body lands with a
     sickening THUD.

     GAINES

     stands where he is, gun still in hand, dumbfounded.

     He looks to the Miata. It suddenly takes off, kicking up dirt
     and grass. For a moment, all is quiet.

     Finally, Gaines tucks the gun into his jeans. One last look
     around, then he starts working his way back across the parking
     lot. Disappears.

                                                                            40.

55   EXT. IN THE DITCH - NIGHT (RAIN)                                         55

     We stay on Ronna's body as we HEAR the Miata suddenly pull
     away. Somewhere in the distance, the Mary Xmas Supafest is
     still RAGING, but here it's only a WHISPER with a beat.

     With a sudden SPASM, Ronna moves. Turns herself over on her
     back. Each breath WHEEZES and GURGLES.

     She pulls the remainder of the holly crown out of her hair and
     tosses it aside. She tries to push herself up. Her legs won't
     move.

     Catching her breath, she looks to the top of the ditch, waiting
     for somebody to look in. No one does. Adjusting herself, she
     slides against a weathered magazine. Spin. Jane's Addiction
     on the cover.

     She collapses back, a new wave of pain.

     After a beat, she suddenly LAUGHS, until gradually it becomes a
     COUGHING. She pushes her hair back, streaking blood across her
     face.

                          RONNA
               Mannie!!

     There's no answer. The YELLING hurts. She won't do that
     again.

                          RONNA
               Mannie, I got it! I remembered who the
               fuck it was! Perry Farrell's dead
               girlfriend. Xiola Blue. X-I-O-L-A.
               Fuck, I knew there was one.

     A sudden spasm of pain. She winces, sobbing. It passes.

                          RONNA
               Don't you get it? I win.

     She COUGHS as she laughs, spitting out some blood. We PULL
     BACK, rising higher until we slowly

                                                                      FADE OUT.

      Offscreen, a SOAP OPERA plays. Simon is on the phone, a well-
      worn employee list in his hands.

                          SIMON (ON PHONE)
                No, no. Donde Miguel?                                             *
      Claire leans against the wall beside him, skeptical but
      amused. She turns a box of cookies over in her hands, reading
      the ingredients.

      Fuck. Simon hangs up the phone without saying goodbye. He
      continues down the list.

                           CLAIRE
                Simon, no one is going to take your shift.

      Ronna comes around the corner, zombie-tired. She heads to her
      locker. Simon watches her, an idea forming.


                                                                 JUMP CUT TO:

      A cigarette lighter. The flame finally catches and we see
      Simon. He feels around, touching the ceiling, the walls, the
      floor. He's locked in the trunk of a car.

                             SIMON
                   Shit. Shit!

      He starts kicking, hyperventilating. The lighter goes out.

     Simon keeps KICKING.

                            SIMON
                  Fucking let me out of here!

     The lighter burns his thumb. He switches hands. Listens for a
     second. The car isn't driving anymore.

     He tries to catch his breath, but keeps getting more panicked.
     A key SCRAPES in the lock.

     The trunk lid opens a crack. Bright daylight spills in.

     Simon KICKS the lid and pops up, ready to swing a tire iron.

     THREE MEN

     back off, laughing. We are...

                  Mo'fuckin Jack-in-the-box.

     TINY (19) is not black, but thinks he is.

     Simon climbs out of the trunk and does a face-plant in the
     gravel. He's shit-faced drunk.

                             MARCUS
                  Dude, you passed out before we left L.A.

     MARCUS (24) was a tailback at UCLA, and still has the build.
     He is black, and has no confusion over this matter.

     Simon is about to reply when he suddenly HEAVES. Everyone
     backs away. Tiny takes the tire iron, puts it to the side of
     the trunk. He starts cranking it while HUMMING "Pop Goes the
     Weasel," ending with...

     A massive land yacht from the pre-Embargo era. SINGH (23) is
     driving, nursing a beer. Marcus reads a magazine. Tiny talks
     from the enormous back seat, where Simon is recuperating.

                          TINY
               So this chick, she's bobbing up and down
               on my dick like she's fucking Marilyn
               Chambers.

                         SINGH
               She actually found your dick?

                          TINY
                   (ignoring)
               Then she starts going around the ouside--
               you know, painting the tree--when WHACK!
               It hits her in the eye. And her contact,
               it's like stuck on my dick.

     The passengers don't seem impressed.

                          TINY
               Her contact lens. It's stuck on the end
               of my dick.

                          MARCUS
               Was it hard or soft?

                          TINY
               What, my dick?

                         SINGH
               The contact lens.

                          MARCUS
               Do you remember if it was a colored lens?
               That she used to have two blue eyes and
               now she had one blue and one brown?

                          TINY
               What the fuck does that matter?

                          MARCUS
                   (leaning over seat)
               It matters because it happened to me. It
               was my story. I told this story about a
               year ago. The difference was, I knew
               those small-but-important details. That,
               and it was true.

     It's a dive, and nearly empty. The guys work their way down
     both sides of a self-service food bar. Simon is mostly
     recovered.

                          SIMON
               So what does Valentina do?

               What class?

                         MARCUS
               Tantric sexuality for couples.

                         SINGH
               She teaches people how to fuck?

                          TINY

               You shouldn't eat shrimp. It's loaded
               with iodine.

                          TINY
               This shit is expensive. You're paying
               five bucks for lettuce and seeds and shit.

     Tiny up-ends the rest of the shrimp cocktail onto his plate.
     Pissed, Singh scoops away a handful for himself.

     AT THE TABLE

     The guys eat. Tiny tries to make a sandwich out of the various
     foods on his plate, but the bread keeps crumbling.

                          MARCUS
               Thing is, most people really don't know
               how to make love. They just put it in and
               move it around until they get off. What
               tantra teaches you is how to prolong and
               deepen the experience, bring it to a
               higher level. If one man in ten were
               having the sex I'm having, there would be
               no war.

                  How long does your orgasm last? A couple
                  seconds? I've had orgasms that lasted an

     We hear slot machines CHIMING in the distance. Marcus picks a
     gold card up from the counter.

               We'll pay cash anyway. This is just to

     The Desk Woman returns with their keys.

               Could you answer a question...

     Doubled over, Tiny BANGS on the bathroom door. Singh emerges,
     pale and sweating. He steps over Tiny, who crawls in. Hanging
     up his clothes, Marcus waves away the smell.

     Singh MOANS, lying down on a bed.

                          MARCUS
               Did I tell you not to eat the shrimp?

               I have something for you. Where did I put
               it? Oh, it's right here.

     He gives him the finger. Simon is on the phone by the window.

                          SIMON

               Todd, it's Simon. What's up?...I'm in

               name of the place you said we should
               go...The Crazy Horse. What are you doing
               tonight?

     Marcus neatly unfolds his clothes, hanging them up in the
     closet.

                         SIMON
                   (on phone)
               You're going to a wedding?...What is it, a
               rave?

     From the wall, KNOCKING. Simon and Marcus look to a door by
     the window.

                          SIMON
                    (on phone)
               No, I know Claire...Are you going to fuck
               her?

     Simon points at the KNOCKING door. Marcus finally opens it to
     reveal a 12 year-old BOY in the adjoining hotel room.

                          BOY
               Who are you?

     shoulders of his bright yellow jacket.

     While Rebecca smokes up, Becky tears a kleenex in half. She
     rolls each piece into a plug, shoving one up each nostril.

                         BECKY
                   (explaining)
               Otherwise, I can't hold it in.

     Simon hands her the pipe and the lighter.

     Rebecca blows a perfect smoke ring at Simon. He smiles, a
     little smoke escaping. She leans close and kisses him. Softly
     at first, then harder. They're a few beats into it when...

                            BECKY
               Oh my God!

     Her kleenex is on fire, flames in each nostril. Hands waving,
     she stands up. Snorts hard. The plugs shoot out, landing on
     the carpet, which begins to smolder. Simon stamps the flames
     out.

                         REBECCA
               You're fine. You're fine.

     Becky is crying.

     clenching and releasing.

     CLOSE ON SIMON

     breathing harder and faster, faster, until he suddenly stops.
     The expression on his face is agonizing, like a tightrope
     walker about to lose his balance. The Beckys stop to watch
     him, worried he might be hurt.

     Finally, he breathes again.

     LATER

     A new position, Rebecca on top and sweating. Next to Simon,
     Becky is passed out and SNORING. It's only as we look over
     Rebecca's back that we see

     THE CURTAINS ARE ON FIRE.

     On the bed, Simon lies motionless in aching nirvana.            His head
     turns. He sees the flames. And does nothing.

     Rebecca reaches climax with an inhuman series of MOANS. It's
     on the third of these that the smoke alarm suddenly BLEATS. It
     settles into a piercing WHINE.

     Becky falls out of bed, disoriented. Sees the fire and
     SCREAMS. Rebecca climbs off Simon to attack the flames with a
     pillow, beating them down. Holding her head together, Becky
     tries to reach the smoke detector itself.

     Amid the chaos, Simon feels for his shoes.


72   INT. HALLWAY / ELEVATOR BAY - NIGHT                                    72

     Gentle Christmas MUZAK.

     At the sinks, Marcus wets his fingers to fix his hair. An OLD
     TEXAN washes his hands at the next sink, looks around for a
     towel. Marcus takes two from the dispenser, hands them over.

     When he's finished, the Texan sets the crumpled towels on the
     counter, along with a dollar bill. He taps his hat and leaves.

     Seething, Marcus joins Simon in line for a cab. A white
     Ferrari pulls up to the curb beside them. The FERRARI MAN
     tosses the keys at Marcus, who can't help but catch them.

                             FERRARI MAN
                  Keep it close and there's an extra ten
                  bucks for you.

     He slips Marcus a five as he rushes into the casino. A beat.
     Simon is cracking up. As we REVERSE, we see the valets are
     wearing the same yellow sportcoat as Marcus.

76   INT. THE FERRARI / DRIVING ON FREEWAY - NIGHT                            76

     Top off, wind whipping. Marcus downshifts, letting the engine
     RACE as he passes another sports car. The STEREO is blasting.

     Pale and dazed, Simon tries to light a cigarette. It blows out
     of his fingers. It was his last. He adjusts himself in his
     seat, uncomfortable.

                             SIMON
                      (shouting over noise)
                  Question. When you're doing tantra, you
                  hold it in at the end, right?

                            MARCUS
                  No. Never. Redirect the energy, but you
                  never hold it in. Haven't you ever gotten
                  blue balls? Hurts like a bitch.

                             SIMON
                      (nodding)
                  Sort of a dull ache.

                               MARCUS
                  Exactly.

     Marcus looks over to Simon, who is trying to get his breath.


77   INT. FERRARI / DRIVING DOWNTOWN - LATER                                  77

     Empty intersections, no traffic to speak of. Marcus is looking
     for a cross-street. They're lost.

                             MARCUS
                  See if there's a map.

     Simon goes through the glove compartment. Amid the condoms and
     parking tickets, he finds one.

                            SIMON
                  Orange County.

     He throws it out. He tries to shut the compartment, but it's
     caught on something. He reaches in...

                               SIMON
                  Holy shit.

     Marcus looks over. Simon gently pulls out a 9mm Baretta.
     Fascinated, he turns it over in his hands. Marcus tries to
     keep an eye on the road.

                            MARCUS
                  Don't point it at me!

                             SIMON
                  How do I know if it's loaded?

                            MARCUS
                  First, you stop pointing it at me.

     Simon aims the other way, out the window. As they drive
     through an intersection, they pass a car full of LOCALS.

                            MARCUS
                  Floor. Floor!

                                                                   (CONTINUED)

     Simon throws the gun to the floor. Marcus flinches, expecting
     it to go off. It doesn't. He checks the rear-view mirror. No
     trouble. Simon picks up the gun again.

                            SIMON
                  I've never held a real gun before. It's
                  heavier than I thought.

                             MARCUS
                  Great, put it back.

                             SIMON
                  I want to know if it's loaded. How do
                  I...

     He starts pulling and pushing on it, trying to get the clip
     out. He's not going to stop until he does it or shoots himself
     trying.

                             MARCUS
                  Hold the wheel.

     Marcus removes the clip, hands it over. Simon counts the
     bullets.

                             SIMON
                  I hold ten men's lives in my hand.

                             MARCUS
                  It's a nine millimeter. It doesn't have
                  stopping power.

                            SIMON
                  Right. For that you'd need Magnum Force.

     At a pull-up payphone, Marcus is looking through the map in the
     phone book. Simon is still fondling the gun.

                             SIMON
                  This is why I came here. This is America.
                  I'm serious. You want to take one symbol

     Tiny lies on the bed, watching a bad hotel porno. Singh comes
     out of the bathroom, pale and shivering.

     KNOCKING at the adjoining room door. They try to ignore it,

               She's not my mom.

     Tiny rummages through the open suitcases, finally finding a

81   EXT. PARKING LOT / CRAZY HORSE - NIGHT                                 81

     Sodium vapor lights BUZZ overhead. Simon adjusts something in
     his coat while Marcus locks the Ferrari.

     APPROACHING THE ENTRANCE...

                          MARCUS
               Listen up. They're going to ask if you
               want buy a bottle of champagne. You
               don't, but don't say that right off.

                           SIMON
               Explain.

                          MARCUS
               Champagne means you want a private dance.
               You can't afford it, neither can I. But
               if they know we're not biting, they don't
               even dangle the bait.

82   INT. THE CRAZY HORSE - NIGHT                                             82

     Pitch black except for tiny Christmas lights. To Simon's left,
     a skanky MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE plays video poker. At the bar,
     Marcus SHOUTS to the BARTENDER -- the MUSIC is deafening.

     Out of the shadows, two dancers approach. They split up,
     blonde HOLLY taking Simon, while brunette NOELLE heads for
     Marcus.

     Holly offers Simon a hand, they shake. She leans close to talk
     into his ear. He smiles.

     Noelle taps Marcus on the shoulder, ducks to the other side
     playfully. Takes a sip of his drink.

     Simon points to Marcus. Holly nods, feeling the fabric of his
     shirt.

     Noelle laughs at something Marcus said.

     Holly measures her hand against Simon's, rubs it against her
     neck. He is staring at her magnificent breasts.

     At Noelle's urging, Marcus flexes his bicep. Noelle flutters.

     We come in CLOSE as Holly leans over to say something. Simon
     speaks first...

                             SIMON

     with a bottle of champagne. Noelle follows with glasses.
     Behind them, the guys.

     Marcus gives Simon a look. Simon shrugs it off.


                                                                   (CONTINUED)

     The curtain parts, letting the women through. From the
     darkened space beyond, a giant BOUNCER steps out -- massive
     even compared to Marcus. He's sucking on a lollipop.

                             VIC JR.
                  I need a major credit card.

     Marcus looks to Simon, who hands over the gold card. Vic Jr.
     reads them the boilerplate...

                             VIC JR.
                  This is a gentlemen's club. You are
                  expected to behave as gentlemen. I will
                  be giving you one rule. If you break this

                  The ladies can touch you. You cannot
                  touch them. At any point, for any reason.
                  Is this clear?

84   INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT                                                84

     A mirrored ball spins overhead, stars racing across the black
     paneling. Holly nudges Simon into his chair. He and Marcus
     sit back to back.

     As the champage POPS, we move into a series of overlapping
     shots:

     Noelle licks the foam from Holly's fingers.
     Holly rubs the bottle against herself, pours.
     Noelle and Holly dance together, a tinsel ribbon around them.

     Simon adjusts himself in the crotch.

     Noelle lights a cigar for Marcus as Holly dances alone.
     Holly lifts her miniskirt to reveal a g-string.
     Simon cranes his neck back, banging heads with Marcus.


                                                                   (CONTINUED)

     Noelle takes a puff off the cigar.
     Holly straddles Simon, rubs against him. He shudders. His
     hands start to rise. She gently pushes them back down.

     Marcus whispers something to Noelle.

     Noelle comes up behind Holly, moving with her as she rubs
     against Simon. Marcus turns to watch.

     Enraptured, Simon watches the four-armed woman on top of him.

     His fingers start to twitch.

     Noelle kisses the edge of Holly's neck.
     Simon's hands rise, reach...
     Holly MOANS...

     And suddenly...

     Simon grabs Noelle's ass.

     It's Heaven.

                            NOELLE
                      (yelling)
                  Hands! Hands!

     Noelle and Holly both get off him. Holly kicks his leg. From
     behind the curtain, Vic Jr. charges in. He heads straight for
     Marcus.

                             NOELLE
                  The other one!

     Simon tumbles off his chair, scrambling.

                             VIC JR.
                  What the fuck did I tell you!

     He kicks Simon in the ass.

                           MARCUS
                  Yo. Yo! He fucked up, he lost control.

                             VIC JR.
                  Am I talking to you? I'm talking to your
                  faggot friend here.

     He kicks Simon again. Holly and Noelle stand in the corner.
     This has happened a hundred times.

                            MARCUS
                  We're leaving.

                                                                   (CONTINUED)

     Vic Jr. kicks Simon again.

                             MARCUS
                  Enough! Stop kicking him.
                      (no effect)
                  I said to fucking stop kicking him.

     Vic Jr. turns on Marcus. A beat. He shoves him, hard.

                             MARCUS
                  I'm not trying to throw down here.

                             VIC JR.
                      (another shove)
                  You think you can kick my ass?

                             MARCUS
                  I don't want to try.

     Vic Jr. WHACKS Marcus, an old-fashioned bitch slap. A beat.
     Marcus tries to keep the rage down. Feels his nose bleeding.

     He backs away, but Vic Jr. keeps coming. Suddenly...

     A GUNSHOT.

     SCREAMS.

     For a beat, no one's sure what happened. We look around to
     Marcus. Vic Jr. Holly. Noelle. Then finally Simon.

     He just fired. The gun is steady in his hand.

     Marcus checks his shirt. A spray of blood.

     Vic Jr. checks his arm. It's bleeding.

     We HOLD for a moment, the mirrored ball still spinning
     overhead.

                            SIMON
                  Everybody back the fuck away.

     They do. Marcus holds his place.

                            MARCUS
                  Oh, man. Fuck.

     Blood is squirting out of Vic Jr.'s arm. He holds it,
     dumbfounded.




                                                                   (CONTINUED)

               Is there another way out?

                         HOLLY
               Behind you.

     A fire escape door. Simon motions for Marcus to come. Pushing
     the bar, no alarm sounds. They back out, into the night. The
     door swings shut.

     A beat.

     Suddenly, an MAN charges in with a silver .45. He is Vic Sr.,
     60, owner and proprietor. You don't fuck with Victor.

                         VICTOR
               What happened!

                          HOLLY
               They shot Vic. They went out the back.

     Victor KICKS the door open, ready to fire. The alley is clear.
     The BARTENDER comes through the curtain.

                          VICTOR
                   (handing off gun)
               Find them.

     The man races out. Victor looks at his son's arm. It's
     bloody, but he'll live. Holly SHOUTS down the hallway.

                           HOLLY
               Call 911.

                         VICTOR
               No! No cops.


85   EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                               85

     The Ferrari SCRAPES as it takes the curb too fast.

     From the alley, the Bartender chases after it, finally
     stopping to squeeze off three SHOTS. None seem to hit. The
     Ferrari tears down the street.

     Taking a left, Marcus slows down a little. We're on an empty
     street well away from the Crazy Horse. He dabs at his bloody
     nose.

                                                                 (CONTINUED)

     In the passenger seat, Simon looks at the gun in the hand. He
     suddenly throws it out.

                             MARCUS
                  What are you doing?

                            SIMON
                  Getting rid of the weapon.

     Marcus slams on the brakes.

                             MARCUS
                  It has your fingerprints on it.

                             SIMON
                  Oh shit.

     Craning around, Simon looks for it in the street. Marcus backs
     the car up. Suddenly, a phone RINGS. Lights flicker on the
     car phone.

                             SIMON
                  Do we answer?

     Marcus brakes again. The phone keeps RINGING.

                             MARCUS
                  It's probably Orange County asking where
                  the hell his car is.

                             SIMON
                  It's a cell phone. They can trace where
                  we are even if we don't answer.

                             MARCUS
                  Get the gun. Go. Find it.

     Simon climbs out and starts looking, crouching to look under
     cars.

     In the Ferrari, Marcus sits back and kicks the phone with his
     boot, over and over until it stops, dead.

     For a moment, silence.

     Then the car's ALARM starts going off.     Marcus SCREAMS with
     frustration. He punches buttons on the     keychain, but nothing
     will quiet it. He tries the key in the     ignition. It won't
     turn over. Climbing out of the car, he     kicks it with all his
     might.

     Simon finds the gun, crawling under a truck to get it.


                                                                   (CONTINUED)

     Using his jacket, Marcus starts frantically wiping off the
     inside and outside of the Ferrari. Simon joins him. The whole
     time, the alarm is still WAILING.

     Satisfied, Marcus motions that they're done. He and Simon take
     off running down the street.


87   INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                           87

     A bent needle pierces two flaps of skin, drawing a line of
     blood with the thread.

     Victor ties another stitch in Vic Jr.'s arm. He's had practice
     at this. In the background, the Bartender and Noelle are
     watching. Victor's tirade is directed at all of them.

                          VICTOR
               Just because a rapper has a white buddy
               doesn't mean he's Sidney Fucking Poitier.

               And you, you were on top of him. You

     She shakes her head, crying.

               This thing. This thing is a wall of shit.
               It is a fucking call from on high that I
               have to leave. I have to get out before
               this all just falls in on me.

     Vic Jr. winces with pain.

     Tiny resumes HUMMING. After a few beats, Singh joins in with

     well. Just into the second chorus, the phone RINGS.

                  Or six. We'll try both.

     She reaches for the panel. Victor grabs her hand. She GASPS,
     startled. Without saying a word, he shoves her off the
     elevator, BANGING on the door close button until it finally
     responds.

     Marcus and Simon burst in like a cyclone. Marcus grabs his
     clothes out of the closet.

                            MARCUS
                  All right, listen up. We're leaving in 30
                  seconds. Grab what you can.

                  What the fuck?

     Simon tosses Singh his wallet, pockets the keys.

                             MARCUS
                  Just do it. Now!

     The panic is contagious. After a stunned beat, Tiny and Singh
     start moving, putting on shoes and restuffing suitcases.

     A KNOCK at the door. Everyone freezes. More KNOCKING.

                                                                     (CONTINUED)

                  Room service.

     Simon steps gingerly to the door, looks out the peephole.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A fleshy hand blocks the fisheye.

     Victor and son smile at a COUPLE walking past. When they're
     gone, a giant orange plumber's wrench drops down from Jr.'s
     jacket sleeve.

     Simon backs away from the door, freaking out. Marcus checks
     the windows. They're eight stories above a parking lot.

     Tiny knocks on the door to the adjoining room

      The door knob jiggles. WHIP back to the guys.

      Tiny finally chips in. Simon shoves the cash in a wad under
      the door. They wait.

      OTHER SIDE

      The Boy counts the money, straightening the bills.

      Fingers reach into the hole, trying to pull back the bolt.

      behind doors and under beds. The suitcases are half-packed.

      Simon peers out the peephole into the hallway. Marcus lifts

      The boy nods. Marcus drops him. Simon opens the hallway door
      a crack. It's clear. On the count of three, they go.

      We stay with the boy, who sits back against the windows,
      excited and rich. There's a KNOCK at the adjoining door. The
      boy tucks the money away.

      With a BOOM, we hear the door being kicked open. It only takes
      four blows.

                              BOY

      Running to the Cadillac, Singh feels for his keys.

                                SIMON
                   I got `em.

      As Simon unlocks the door, the other three look at each other --
      should he really be driving?

      THE TIRES SMOKE

      as Simon backs out. In the distance, Victor and son appear
      around the corner. Victor motions to go for the truck.

      A line of cars wait to pay at the booth. Simon slams on the
      brakes. Looking out the back window, Marcus sees the bright
      lights of the Ram Charger approaching.

                   They're right behind us.

                   Who?

      In answer to his question, the Ram Charger SLAMS into the trunk
      of the Cadillac. Simon cranks the wheel, barely avoiding the
      car ahead of him.

      Not slowing, Simon aims for the entrance lane, where the bar is
      coming down behind a small Nissan. Threading the needle, Simon
      makes it past the car and the gate. The Ram Charger smashes
      through the bar.

      The Cadillac charges out of the parking lot, nearly hitting
      another car as it heads onto the Strip. Looking back, we see
      the Ram Charger following them out.


106   EXT. FLAMINGO ROAD - NIGHT                                              106

      Four a.m., but there's still traffic. The Cadillac slaloms
      between taxis and tourists. Approaching an intersection,
      yellow light...


106A INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT                                                   106A

                   Cop. Cop!

      There's a police car waiting at the stoplight.         Simon hits the
      brakes, just short of a SQUEAL. They stop in a         middle lane,
      next to the cop. Simon and Marcus look over to         the OFFICER,
      trying to be calm. Singh and Tiny peer out the         back.

      The Ram Charger slowly approaches, no hurry. In the squad car,
      the Officer takes a radio call. Drunken TOURISTS walk past.
      The crosswalk switches to a flashing red hand.

                              SIMON
                   How did they find us?

                             MARCUS
                   It's their town. I'm sure they have
                   people.

      The Ram Charger pulls in right behind the Cadillac. It's so
      tall, all we see are the blinding headlights through the back
      window. Singh and Tiny slink down. Marcus checks the gun on
      his lap.


                                                                    (CONTINUED)

    The red hand stops flashing. The opposing light goes from
    green to yellow. Simon gently REVS the engine. Suddenly, a
    WHOOP.

    Lights flashing, the police car makes a right turn from the
    left lane, cutting in front of them. The SIREN is deafening.
    Simon sees his opportunity.

      Gunning the engine, he hangs a hard left, cutting across three
      oncoming lanes. The Ram Charger tries to follow, but the
      traffic is already moving. Over the protest of many HORNS, the
      pickup finally forces its way through.


107   EXT. A SIDE STREET - NIGHT                                            107

      The Cadillac takes a corner hard, fishtailing into oncoming
      traffic. Tiny SCREAMS. Simon pulls it back into the lane. In
      the rear-view mirror, we see the Ram Charger, gaining.

                           MARCUS
                We have to get off the major streets.
                Take a right up here. No, not here!

      It's too late. Simon mistook an alley for an actual road.

                           SIMON
                Hold on.

      Aiming for the alley, Simon hits a curb on the way in. Singh's
      head BANGS against the roof. The passenger-side mirror
      smashes off against the wall.

                           TINY

108   EXT. VERY NARROW ALLEY - NIGHT                                        108

      Just inches of clearance on either side, the alley runs behind
      a series of strip malls and office buildings. There's only one
      way out -- Simon's aiming for the boulevard on the far side.

                           SINGH
                    (looking out back)
                I don't see `em.

      The end of the alley approaches. From the far edge, a flashing
      orange light. A giant street-sweeper is slowly crossing the
      alley. We WHIP BACK to see the Cadillac approaching.

                           MARCUS
                Shit.

      Behind them, the Ram Charger gingerly negotiates a three-point
      turn into the alley. Wider, it scrapes against one side.

      Ahead, the street sweeper is blocking one-quarter of the
      alley. One-third. A moment of hesitation, then Simon floors
      it. The Caddy hits thirty, forty. Engine RACING --

                             MARCUS
                  We can't make it!

      The sweeper is already halfway across the alley. Singh braces
      for impact. Somehow, Simon still thinks he can clear it.

                            MARCUS
                  STOP!

      At the last moment, Simon SLAMS on the brakes. They're
      skidding towards it.

      Marcus grabs the wheel and jerks it. The front bumper catches
      the wall, sending the trunk SLAMMING against the far alley
      wall. A ear-piercing SCREECH.

      A ribbon of sparks shoots off as the front and rear bumpers are
      scraped away. Forward momentum finally stops.

      The abrupt stop sends Tiny flying into the front seat, where
      his head SMACKS against the dash. Marcus's seat breaks,
      PINNING him. He pushes back, but Singh YELPS in protest.

      Simon blinks, trying to figure out if he's alive. With Tiny's
      bleeding head on his lap, he shifts into reverse.

      The tires SPIN in place. The car is wedged in tight sideways.
      Further down the alley, we find the broken-off

      SIDE MIRROR.

      In its cracked face we see five Ram Chargers approaching. A
      giant tire smashes the mirror to bits.

                                                                           74.

      Shifting gears, Simon tries to rock the car back and forth,
      making no progress. Looking over his seat, Marcus sees the
      giant pickup heading right for them. The headlights are bright
      enough to cast shadows.

      Forcing back the seat, Marcus stands up through the open

      On the first shot, Vic Junior ducks down. Two bullets punch
      through the windshield. The third ricochets off the hood.

      Victor keeps the pedal to the floor. He's not stopping.


113   EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                    113

      All four guys duck just before impact. The Ram Charger
      CRUNCHES into the side of the Cadillac, pushing it down the
      alley. More sparks shoot off as it goes.

      Looking ahead, the street sweeper has moved past the end of the
      alley, but the far side of the street beyond is a construction
      area, flashing baricades all around. The Ram Charger will push
      them right into it.


113A INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT                                                 113A

      Clearing the end of the alley, Simon punches the gas.


113B EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                                   113B

      Swinging wide, the Cadillac comes free with another CRUNCH.

      Momentum keeps the Ram Charger heading straight for the
      construction.


113C INT. RAM CHARGER - NIGHT                                              113C

      Victor hooks the wheel hard, trying to avoid it.

                                                                          74A.

      Hitting a parked car, the Ram Charger tips and rolls over,
      landing on its side. It SCRAPES along the asphalt, finally
      coming to rest.


114   INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT                                                 114

      Simon fights to regain control, the    street outside a blur.
      Over his shoulder, an oncoming Yugo    can't stop fast enough.
      The little car hits just in front of    the tire, sending the
      Cadillac spinning back the opposite    direction.

      Tiny's unconscious body flies out the passenger window.
      Marcus and Singh both grab hold. As Simon rights the spin, the
      Cadillac brushes past the green street sweeper, still humming
      along. Marcus and Singh pull Tiny back in, inches away from
      decapitation.

      Simon finally settles into a lane, checking the rear-view
      mirror.

                                                                           75.

115   INT. ROLLED RAM CHARGER - NIGHT                                       115

      We look through the windshield to find Victor piled on top of
      his son. Regaining his wits, the old man steps on Vic Jr.'s
      shoulder. Gets another foot into the steering wheel, climbing
      up to the driver's door window.


116   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                                   116

      Victor looks out to see the Cadillac turning down a side
      street, out of sight.

                          VICTOR
                Sonofabitch!

      The Cadillac, bruised but unbroken, heads west. Las Vegas
      shimmers in the distance.

      In the back seat, Tiny is propped up with a bloody shirt
      pressed to his head. Singh has his feet up to brace the back
      of Marcus's seat.

                           SINGH
                Just so we're clear. You stole a car,
                shot a bouncer, and had sex with two
                women?

                           TINY
                You had sex with two women?

      Simon ignores them, still checking his rear-view mirror.

                           SIMON
                We can be in Mexico by noon. I say we
                split up from there. I'll take Baja.

                              SINGH
                   Simon, think about it. If they were going
                   to call the cops, they would have called
                   them in Las Vegas. They just wanted us
                   gone, and we're gone. It's over.

      Simon checks the mirror, checks the road. With a deep breath,
      he tries to believe. But doesn't.


119   EXT. STREET / CRASH SCENE - DAWN                                        119

      Vic Jr. peels back his bandage to check the bleeding. His
      father is at a payphone. In the background, we see a tow
      truck starting to pull the Ram Charger back upright.

                             VICTOR
                       (on phone)
                   Tommy, it's Vic. I need you to run a
                   credit card for me. You ready?

      He takes the gold card from his pocket.

                   First name `Todd.' Last name `Gaines.'

      Claire leans beside Simon. His eyes track Ronna as she passes.

                  She's been on for fourteen hours.

    At her locker, Ronna misdials the combination. Frustrated,
    she POUNDS the locker, then re-dials.

    Simon approaches Ronna gingerly. We stay back with Claire, who
    sets to work opening a box of expired cookies.

    She half-listens as Ronna and Simon have their discussion at
    the lockers, then at the time clock.

    Simon follows Ronna out into the alley.

    Claire takes a seat atop a crappy console TV, eating an oatmeal
    cookie. The VOICES on the soap opera seem familiar.

                             MALE VOICE #1
                  I'm not the man you're looking for.

      We DROP DOWN to see the TV. Onscreen, a police interrogation
      room. The Cop is played by Adam. The Accused is played by
      Zack.

                          ZACK
                Don't forget, detective. I was cleared of

      As the MUSIC rises, we PUSH IN on Zack. PUSH IN on Adam. The
      TV image FADES OUT.




122   INT. BATHROOM AT FALAFEL HUT - DAY                                      122

      Adam stands mostly naked, his shirt off his shoulders and jeans
      around his ankles.

      Loop -- the white dreadlocked guy -- retapes a transmitter on
      his thigh. A wire runs up to a microphone on his chest.

      Zack and Burke are by the door, watching. The bathroom is
      really cramped.

      Whoever was trying to come in gives up. Burke pulls a college
      sweatshirt out of a shopping bag, hands it to Zack. Motions
      that he's supposed to wear it. As he's putting it on...

                              ZACK
                   Just so we're clear. Whether you get
                   something on this guy or not, Adam and I
                   are done today. Finished. Charges
                   dropped. That's how it works, right?

                   What?

                              BURKE
                   Seems to me, if a guy's so concerned about
                   the legal process, how come he finds
                   himself getting busted for possession?

      Adam and Zack share a look. A beat.

                   Relax. I sign your form and the whole

      A beat.

      destructing. He eats faster, trying to finish before it falls
      apart.

124   EXT. BY A PAYPHONE - DAY                                              124

      Loop stands nearby while Adam talks to no one in particular.

                          ADAM
                Star light, star bright first star that I
                see tonight...

      Burke and Zack listen to a radio recorder.

                           ADAM [CONT'D, FILTERED]
                ...I wish I may, I wish I might...

      Burke turns the volume down, picks up his walkie-talkie.

                          BURKE
                    (on walkie-talkie)
                That's good. I'm getting him.

      Through the windows, we can see Loop and Adam approaching. We
      hear low CHATTER as they talk.

                          BURKE
                So, Zack. What does your girlfriend look
                like?

                          ZACK
                About five-eight, brown hair, blue eyes.

                           BURKE
                Hot.

                           ZACK
                Yeah.

                          BURKE
                She faithful?

                          ZACK
                No. I don't think so.

                          BURKE
                You faithful?

                          ZACK
                Not anymore.

                                                                           81.

126   INT. BURKE'S CAR / DRIVING - DAY                                      126

      Burke drives, with Loop in the passenger seat and Adam and Zack
      in back.

                           BURKE
                     (to Loop)
                Zack's girlfriend is fucking around on
                him.

                           LOOP
                Man, I'm sorry. How did you find out?

      ON ADAM, corner of his eye.

                           ZACK
                It's no big...I don't really want to get
                into it.

                          LOOP
                C'mon, tell us.

                          ADAM
                Absolutely. Tell us.

      There's a palpable tension between Adam and Zack. The others
      don't see it.

                           ZACK
                I found socks.

                           BURKE
                What, red socks, blue socks?

                           ZACK
                White socks. You know how the good kind
                of socks have band around the ankle that
                keeps them from stretching out? When I
                moved in, every one of the socks had that.
                Suddenly, there was one sock that didn't.

                           BURKE
                You hear that? We got John Sherlock
                Holmes in the car here.

      We pull into the parking lot of

      THE GROCERY STORE.

      Adam turns on Zack.

                             ADAM
                   Alright. But you've been fucking around,
                   too.

                              ZACK
                   Only after I found out.

                             ADAM
                   Huh.


127   INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY                                                  127

      At the refrigerator section, both Adam and Zack reach for
      orange juice. Both back off. Adam motions, after you.

                             ADAM
                   So, Zack. Do you know who your
                   girlfriend's fucking?

      He over-articulates, as if speaking for a Learn English Now!
      tape. Zack does likewise. Their animosity is palpable.

                             ZACK
                   No, Adam. I do not. I have suspicions.
                   Mostly former boyfriends who keep
                   calling.

                              ADAM
                   What a coincidence. I have the exact same
                   problem with my girlfriend. In fact, I
                   think she's been sleeping around on me,
                   too.

                              ZACK
                   Isn't it ironic.

                               ADAM
                   Don't you think?
                        (beat)
                   Maybe I should start checking for socks,
                   too.

      Zack's glare could strip paint.

      As Adam and Zack head for the front, we REVERSE to find Mannie
      and Claire, who have been watching the spat while restocking.

                              CLAIRE
                   Gay men are so hot. It's tragic.

128   INT. FRONT OF THE STORE - DAY                                         128

      Zack pushes the cart past the checkstands, looking at each
      CASHIER -- they're all female. Adam is starting to panic. In
      near whispers...

                           ADAM
                He's not here. What are we supposed to
                do? He's not here.

                          ZACK
                We're going to ask. You're going to ask.

                            ADAM
                Why me?

                           ZACK
                You look more wholesome. Just improv.

      He steers the cart into Ronna's checkstand, where she's
      waiting on a Clutchy Old Woman who eyes everything
      suspiciously. Zack pulls out his cell phone, fake dials.

                           ADAM
                Who are you calling?

                          ZACK
                Nobody. I'm giving you an opening.


129   INT. CAR IN PARKING LOT - DAY                                         129

      Adam and Zack approach on either side of the car, get in the
      back. Burke and Loop are waiting.

                           ADAM
                He wasn't there. The British guy, he
                wasn't there.

                           LOOP
                No, we heard. You guys did great.

                          BURKE

                Ronna. You think she can score?

                            ADAM
                Maybe.

                            ZACK
                Probably.

                             BURKE
                   Then that's all we need. It's all

      Burke is watching through binoculars. Adam, Zack and Loop are
      in the car with him.

                             BURKE
                   Now they're both going. What's up with
                   that?


132A INT. VENICE HOUSE / MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                                   132A

      Adam and Zack stand around as Burke gets the house ready,
      moving furniture and poofing pillows, as if it's remotely
      believable.

                              ZACK
                   So if she gets the stuff, what, you arrest
                   her?

                              BURKE
                   We try to bring her over.
                       (beat)
                   See, we arrest her and then what? One
                   crack whore off the street. So we cut her
                   a deal. She helps us get this guy. We
                   cut him a deal. He helps us get the guy
                   above him. It's just like what happened
                   with you.

                              ZACK
                   So, sooner or later, everybody's working
                   for The Man.

                              BURKE
                   Exactly.

                           ZACK
                What if she isn't really a dealer though?
                If you just pulled her into this one
                thing, wouldn't that be entrapment?

                If she's making this deal, she's a dealer.
                Doesn't matter if its her first or her

      We stay on Zack, unconvinced.

                           BURKE
                Cerveza?

      He hands Ronna the beer.

                    (to Burke)
                Oh yeah. Hey. We bought a whole bunch of
                orange juice. It's in the car.

      Ronna has halfway figured out what's going on.

                           BURKE
                Now, Zack tells me you got 20 at 20, is
                that right?

                You got a bathroom?

                           ADAM
                Down the hall on the right.

                           ZACK
                Let me show you...

      SLOW MOTION

      Stepping towards Ronna, his back to Burke.       He very
      deliberately mouths a silent...

                           ZACK
                Go.

      Ronna sees it. Her eyes go wider. Zack nods.

      In the background, Burke is trying to look around. Ronna

      watching.

      For a just a second, Zack smiles.


134   INT. VENICE HOUSE - LATER                                               134

      Burke SLAMS Zack up against the wall, twisting an arm behind
      him. He kicks his feet apart, then starts to cuff him. Zack
      is in considerable pain.

                              BURKE
                       (to Adam)
                   Now watch what I do with his wrist. I
                   twist it away while I put on the second
                   cuff. That way he can't go after me. He
                   doesn't have any leverage.

      He releases his hold on Zack, his hands cuffed behind him.

                   I watch all these cop shows and they never

      Loop emerges from the back room, carrying a big box of

      He rubs Zack's stomach.

      Loop pauses at the door, looking around. He's forgotten
      something.

                             BURKE
                   What?

      A beat. Loop can't remember what it was.

      Adam waves. Zack nods. Loop shuts the door behind himself.
      Now its just the three men. An awkward beat.

                             ZACK
                   We're done, now, right? That's what we
                   talked about. Whether or not the deal
                   went through, we just had to do our part.

                    (relieved)
                Great. Well, hey. A pleasure.

      He turns to the side, offering Burke his handcuffs to undo.
      Burke makes no motion to do so.

                           BURKE
                Now that he's gone, there's something I
                wanted to ask you guys about. Sort of a
                proposition.
                    (beat)
                See, my wife and I -- Irene, she's my wife
                -- we're both working on Christmas so
                we're gonna have Christmas dinner
                tonight. And I was thinking, maybe you
                guys would want to come over, eat some
                dinner with us. My wife is great, you'll
                love her, then I'll sign your form. How
                does that sound?

      A beat.

                          ZACK
                Actually, you know, I had plans.

                           ADAM
                You did?

                           ZACK
                I do.

                           ADAM
                With your girlfriend?

                          ZACK
                Yes, Adam, in fact. With my girlfriend.

                           ADAM
                Huh.
                    (beat; another; then suddenly)
                Wow, I can't believe I forgot this. I saw
                your girlfriend this morning, and she
                asked me to tell you that she couldn't
                make your plans tonight.

      Zack stares at Adam, a "why are you doing this" look.

135   EXT. A TINY HOUSE IN CULVER CITY - NIGHT                                135

      Zack hits the alarm for his red Miata, which BWOOPS. He and
      Adam walk to the door, hostility simmering.

      A prefab Nativity scene glows beside the front door. Adam
      pushes the doorbell, which CHIMES "Hark Ye Herald Angels
      Sing." Horrified, Zack turns to leave. Adam stops him.


136   INT. LIVING / DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                       136

      Too tall for the room, a Christmas tree leans back in a corner.
      The rest of the living room is dominated by a giant leather
      sofa pit.

      Bored, Adam lifts a plate to check the imprint. He sets it
      down, straightening it. Now it's out of alignment with the
      other plates. He looks around casually. No one's watching.

      Circling the table, he fixes all the plates and moves
      silverware to its proper position.

                                                                              88.

      Burke's wife IRENE is mashing potatoes with considerable zeal.
      Adam leans in, sees her dedication and tries to duck out. But
      she saw him.

                             IRENE
                Yes? Hi?

                          ADAM
                Sorry. Phone. Messages. Check?

                             IRENE
                Here.

      She points. He sheepishly crosses to get it. While he's
      dialing, Irene starts in with the electric mixer. Butter.
      Milk. Salt. Adam doesn't know where to look while he's
      listening to his messages.

      He suddenly smiles. Irene notices and stops mixing.

                          ADAM
                    (re: phone)
                They're singing Christmas carols. My
                family. Minnesota, they do that.

      She leans close to listen. Smiles. She continues to lean
      close -- uncomfortably close -- for a long beat.

      We hear a toilet FLUSH. Zack emerges from the bathroom to find
      Burke stark naked, rubbing his hands over his body.

                             ZACK
                Sorry.

                           BURKE
                No, stay for a sec.

      Burke sprays more cologne on his hand.

                          BURKE
                Smell this. What does it smell like?

      Zack shakes his head, doesn't know.

                          BURKE
                CK One. But it's not.

                                ZACK
                   Really.

                   I get this for a quarter what that stuff
                   costs.

                   Here.

      He sprays some on Zack's hands, who didn't want it. While
      Burke turns to get some underwear, Zack tries to rub it off on
      the bedspread.

                             BURKE
                       (re: bedspread)
                   It's down. So is the liner.

                              ZACK
                   It is soft.

                                BURKE

      Burke pushes Zack back flat the bed.

      Burke climbs onto the bed beside him.

                              BURKE
                   I could be doing aerobics over here and
                   you wouldn't feel it.

      Irene is back whipping the potatoes.

                           IRENE
                Of course you like your job. You get to
                kiss all those pretty girls.

                           ADAM
                    (mock bashful)
                It does have perks.

      Irene pops the beaters out of the mixer, hands one to Adam.
      They lick the potatoes off them.

                           IRENE
                Tell me something. When you kiss those
                girls, you're not really kissing them,
                are you?

                           ADAM
                It's a stage kiss. Your lips touch, but
                there's no tongue.

                           IRENE
                There's no feeling. Nobody gets jealous.

                          ADAM
                It's acting. It's not real.

      She takes his cleaned beater from him, dumps it in the sink.
      Turning back, she kisses him. Caught off guard, he backs into
      the refrigerator. It's a good three-second lip lock.

      She backs off. There's an awkward beat.

                           ADAM
                See, now, that. There was a tongue there.

                           BURKE (O.S.)
                Honey, red or white?

      Now dressed, Burke comes in with two bottles of wine. Zack is
      behind him at a distance, still creeped out from the bedroom
      encounter. He and Adam trade panicked stares.

                           IRENE

      Irene slides a plate under the candlestick, where wax is
      dripping onto the tablecloth. Burke tips the bottle at Adam.

                   I'm not. It's true.

                   If you gotta go, then I understand.
                       (awkward beat)
                   But Irene and I sort of had an ulterior
                   motive inviting you here.

      Zack looks to Adam.

                              IRENE
                   He makes it sound sinister. It's not.

                              BURKE
                   She's right. Okay, you've looked around
                   our place. Where do you think we got most
                   of this stuff?

                   Just guess.

                   It's actually from Confederated Products.

                   paper to the mattress to those candles.

                               IRENE
                   The wine.

                              BURKE
                   Even that cologne you liked.
                       (practiced)
                   See, Confederated Products is a multi-
                   level direct wholesaling company. That
                   means we don't just sell the products
                   ourselves, we also recruit and manage
                   teams who work under us. Irene and I
                   started eight months ago and we're
                   already bringing in fifty thousand a year
                   in revenues.

                              IRENE
                   We're the number four distributor in
                   Southern California. By March, we might
                   be number three.

      She crosses her fingers. So does Burke. We look to Zack,
      horrified.

                              BURKE
                   Now, as law enforcement officers, Irene
                   and I can't recruit distributors from
                   inside the force. It's against the rules
                   and we'd get fired. So what we do is look
                   for people in other industries...

                             IRENE
                   ...like the entertainment industry.

                              ZACK
                   Wait.
                       (realizing)
                   You want us to sell Amway.

                             BURKE
                   Confederated Products. It's a different
                   company, different quality of product.

      Zack and Adam share a look of disbelief and wonder.


141   EXT. FRONT OF BURKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    141

      Walking to the Miata, Adam takes the keys. Zack folds a form.

                           ZACK
                I need to do something terrifically
                unwholesome. I need to bathe in sin.

                           ADAM
                With me, or one of your other boyfriends?


142   INT. LIQUOR STORE ON PICO - NIGHT                                      142

      Adam checks a low shelf for the right brand of scotch. Zack
      kneels beside him.

                           ZACK
                I have cheated on you with exactly one
                guy.

                           ADAM
                Ditto.

                           ZACK
                Who?

                           ADAM
                No. See, if I tell you, you will freak
                out and it will be drama. Bad not-funny
                Roseanne kind of drama and I am just not
                up for it.

      He finds the right brand.

      They wait in a short line.

                           ZACK
                I'll tell you mine.

      They both stand for a moment, bewildered. It's their turn at
      the register. Adam sets the bottle down.

      A doorbell RINGS.


143   INT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT                                 143

      An apartment door opens to reveal a chubby girl in sweats
      (SANDRA) with a cordless phone and giant bowl of popcorn. She
      drops the former into the latter.

                              ADAM
                   Is Jimmy here?

                             SANDRA
                   Oh my God. Oh. My God.

      She's thrilled and disbelieving at the same time. She fishes
      the phone out of the bowl.

                   I'll call you back.
                       (to them)
                   Jimmy's not here. He went to this thing.
                   Let me find it.

      She can't decide whether to close the door on them or not, so
      she only shuts it halfway. She pokes her head out the door
      again.

                              SANDRA
                   You do know, don't you?

                              ZACK
                   We know.

                              SANDRA
                   I take no responsibilty. I was only an
                   innocent bystander. But there was once
                   where you missed each other by three
                   minutes. It was so exciting.

      She finds what she was looking for on the back of the door.
      Peels off a printed card.

                              SANDRA
                   It's some sort of rave thing.

                              ZACK

                   Mary Xmas Supafest.

                              SANDRA
                   He left an hour ago.

      Adam and Zack head back down the hall. She calls out after
      them.

                             SANDRA
                   You're not going to kill him, are you?
                   The little shit owes me rent.

      At the doors, BOUNCERS stamp hands. We move down the line of
      people waiting to get in, stopping on Adam and Zack.

                              ZACK

                   Mediocre at best. And the sounds he made,
                   God. It was like having sex with Nell.

      Adam imitates the MOAN.

                             ZACK
                   Somewhere off Greenland, hunchback whales
                   were beaching themselves.

                   And the ear thing. Hello, I have Q-Tips.
                   That's really not necessary.

                   The only thing I will give him credit for
                   is the oral.

                              ADAM
                   What do you mean? He was terrible. At
                   some point I just had to stop him and
                   correct years of bad technique. I had to
                   take him by the ears and retrain him from
                   the throat up.

      A beat.

                   October, maybe?

                             ZACK
                   Early October. And he suddenly got so
                   much better.

      A beat.

                              ADAM
                   That is so disturbing. It's like you were

      A sloe-eyed blonde boy (JIMMY) makes friendly with the
      BARTENDER, who is too busy to flirt. Rebuffed, Jimmy scans the
      crowd.

      Zack comes up behind him, grabs him by the waist. Jimmy
      smiles, kisses him hello.

      Adam comes up from the other side, blows in Jimmy's ear. Jimmy
      is so coked up that it takes him a beat to make the connection.
      Zack plus Adam equals bad.

      He smiles nervously.

      Zack takes a pair of child safety scissors from his jacket.
      Confused, Jimmy tries to back away. Adam holds him tight.
      Grabbing a fistful of hair, Zack cuts it off at the scalp. He
      lets the hair fall to the floor.

      Tucking away the scissors, he and Adam walk off.

      Adam ignores him, convinced he can get out this way. A beat
      later, it dead-ends in a chain link fence.

      Zack points to his lips. He didn't say a word.

      Adam slams it in reverse, backtracking. He's doing about 20
      when suddenly we hear a loud THUMP!

      By instinct, he SLAMS on the brakes.

      Something CRASHES down on the soft roof.

      Ronna's face suddenly slams down on the windshield, bleeding
      already. Both men SCREAM. Her eyes are open, staring at them.
      After a beat, they recognize her.

                   Ronna.

      Her body continues its slide across the windshield, finally
      resting on the hood. In a sort of spasm, Adam REVS back,
      shaking the body off. It drops beyond the headlights.

      Zack looks past Adam to see Gaines standing there, gun drawn.

      Adam steadies his hands on the wheel. Zack passes him the
      scotch. He takes a gulp, passes it back. The energy is still
      revved up to 11 -- we don't let ourselves catch a breath.




                                                                     (CONTINUED)

                              ZACK
                   Let's think about it logically. Either
                   she's alive, or she's dead. If she's
                   dead, then there's nothing we can do. If
                   she's alive, then the guy with the gun,
                   who seemed to want to shoot her, probably
                   did shoot her.

                              ADAM
                   So even if she's alive, she's dead.

                              ZACK
                   Exactly.

      Adam takes another drink.

                              ZACK
                   On the plus side, the only witnesses are
                   you, me and him. And none of us are going
                   to want to be talking about it. So if you
                   really think about it, it didn't turn out
                   as badly as it could have.

                              ADAM
                   A girl is dead.

                              ZACK
                       (snaps)
                   I didn't say it went perfectly.

      Adam gets out of the car, walks away. Zack takes another swig.


151   EXT. SIDE OF THE GAS STATION - NIGHT (RAIN)                             151

      Adam stops at a payphone. A long moment before he reaches for
      the receiver. With a breath, he dials 911.

                             OPERATOR (V.O.)

      He hangs up.

      Zack dunks the squeegee back in the bucket. With a wad of
      paper towels, he cleans the hood of the car.

                                                                          100.

153   INT. GAS STATION BATHROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)                              153

      Washing his face, Adam looks at his reflection in the scratched
      mirror. He steps to the urinal, unbuttons.

      Before he can start to piss, he notices something strange. He
      looks down at his crotch.


154   EXT. GAS STATION ISLAND - NIGHT (RAIN)                                154

      Zack throws away the last of the towels as Adam approaches.

      With a finger to his lips, Adam holds out a mess of tape and
      wires, all connected to a battery pack. It's the microphone he
      was wearing.

                             ZACK
                Holy sh...

      He stops himself. Adam throws the bundle as far as he can.
      They keep their voices low anyway.

                           ZACK
                They wouldn't have been listening all
                this time.

                          ADAM
                Hello, they could have been recording it.
                Everything we said could be on tape
                somewhere. They would know we did it.

      A beat.

                           ZACK
                    (an idea)
                What if we were just running lines? For a
                scene?

      Adam won't even dignify that with an answer. A long moment,
      just the BUZZ of the lights overhead. With an almost eerie
      calm...

                           ZACK
                There's a pretty good chance no one's
                found her yet.

                             ADAM
                They will.

                             ZACK

                   no crime.

      The Supafest is still RAGING in the distance. Adam digs
      through the trunk of the convertible, frantically rearranging
      the junk inside. He keeps looking around the lid, waiting for
      someone to sneak up on them.

      Zack watches Adam's fruitless arranging efforts.

                             ZACK
                   Stop. Okay, stop!

                             ADAM
                   What?

                              ZACK
                   It's a Miata.

      All Adam's effort, he's made enough room for a pizza. Maybe.

                              ZACK
                   We'll put her in the passenger seat.

                              ADAM
                   Where will I...Or you...

                              ZACK
                   In the passenger seat. Holding her up.

      Adam shudders at the thought.

      With a flashlight, Zack jumps down into the ditch. He nudges
      Ronna's body with his foot. She's dead alright.

      He rolls the body over, grabbing under her arms. He tries to
      hoist her up, but she's too heavy and the ditch is too deep.

                             ZACK
                   Little help?

                             ADAM

                              ADAM
                   I can't do this.

      Frustrated, Zack tries again to lug the body out. He can't do
      it by himself. Meanwhile, Adam is starting to hyperventilate,
      tears swelling.

                             ZACK
                   Okay, listen to me...

                             ADAM
                   She's dead.

                   She's not dead.

                             ADAM
                   She's dead. I hit her and I killed her.

      He looks around, expecting someone to walk up and see them.

                              ZACK
                   No you didn't, okay? This is all just
                   make-believe. This is a scene. She's
                   just acting dead. And you're just acting
                   scared.

      Adam laughs to himself, still crying.

                              ZACK
                   See, there's the lights, and there's the

                   There's Michelle in wardrobe, say "Hi,

                             ADAM
                   Hi, Michelle.

                              ZACK
                   The craft service truck is right around
                   the corner, and they have lots of little
                   veggie burgers on the grill. And you can
                   have one if you just help me finish this
                   scene.
                       (sniffing)
                   Can you smell them? Can you smell them on

                           ZACK
                Then take her fucking arms!

      Obeying, Adam grabs Ronna's wrists as Zack pushes from below.
      Together they get the body out of the ditch. Zack climbs up to
      help maneuver her into the car. Just then...

      Ronna MOANS.

      Adam freaks out, dropping his side. Ronna's head hits the
      dirt. Louder MOANING.

                           ADAM
                She's not dead.

                           ZACK
                No shit!

      They stand back, watching Ronna MOAN as she lies half-in, half-
      out of the car.

                           ADAM
                If she's not dead, that means we didn't
                kill her. We can just leave her.

                           ZACK
                She's almost dead. We leave her and she
                dies, why did we bother coming back? I
                mean, you still killed her.

                           ADAM
                What do you mean, I killed her?

                           ZACK
                Christ, I didn't mean it that way. C'mon.
                I would never testify against you.

      Adam is not reassured.

                           ZACK
                We have to stick with Plan A.

                           ADAM
                In Plan A she was dead.

      Zack reaches into the car, pulling out The Club. Trades a look
      with Adam, who finally acquieces. Almost says something,
      doesn't. They both look around, making sure no one's coming.

      Zack grips the bar like a baseball bat. Adam turns his back,
      covering his ears.

      Zack raises the bar. Adam scrunches his face tight.

      Zack takes two quick breaths. And holds.

      And holds. And holds.

      Adam opens his eyes, looks back. Zack isn't swinging. He
      lowers the bar. They both breathe again, relieved.

      A CAR ALARM drones incessantly, the siren interrupted with an
      occasional

                Back away from the vehicle.

      Weaving through some parked cars, we settle on an angry BMW,
      its lights flashing. A small throng of RAVERS have gathered
      around to look, because Ronna's limp body lies on the hood.

      A familiar face pushes through the crowd, just arrived.

                           FILA GUY
                Hey, it's Kelly. Somebody beat the crap
                out of her.

      Moving to find...

                          SKATE-PUNK GUY
                Somebody call an ambulance!

      After a beat, he realizes he should do it himself. He takes
      off running.

      ADAM AND ZACK

      look around from the edge of a van in the distance.

                          ZACK
                Look, she's fine. They're getting an
                ambulance. She's fine.

      Adam keeps watching, not convinced. He turns back, a
      thought...

                          ADAM
                What about that guy? The guy with the
                gun. He could still go after her.

                   Okay, approximately the right thing. In a

      Adam smiles despite himself. Zack points, "See? See?" That

      Too early for the brunch crowd, just a smattering of vampires.
      All around, Christmas lights are strung with mad abandon.

      The lights overhead FLICKER. Everyone looks up. That's when
      we come to find

      TODD GAINES

      sitting alone at a booth by the window, disassembling a
      newspaper. He finds the comics.

      Laying the paper flat, he tears off the bottom corner of the
      page and starts reading like a kid, his whole body leaning over
      the table.

      At the door, Claire comes in, shaking the rain out of her hair.
      After a beat, she does it again, as if she doesn't remember
      doing it the first time. She's tired and wired, all nerves and
      raw edges. There's static only she can feel.

      She looks right past Gaines, out to the rain on the street. He
      watches her, but doesn't try to catch her eye. The Jamaican
      WAITER walks past her with a pot of coffee.

                             WAITER
                   Anywhere you want.

                             CLAIRE
                   I'm meeting people.

      He doesn't care. Claire takes a seat at the table in front of
      her, but it's not to her liking. Then a booth. She plays with
      the salt shakers. Bad.

      It's only now that she sees Gaines watching her. At first she
      doesn't recognize him. Then a light goes on. She climbs over
      the booth and into his, facing him.

                             CLAIRE
                   Hey.

                             GAINES
                   Hey.

                             CLAIRE
                   We're twins.

      She turns over his hand, compares it to hers. They both have
      the same ink stamp on the back. He's busted, no way to talk
      himself out.

      The Waiter comes with coffee, refills Gaines' cup.

      Claire overturns the cup in front of her. The Waiter fills it.
      She overturns a second cup, points to it. A big weird smile.
      Reluctantly, the Waiter fills that too. Then leaves.

                              CLAIRE
                   I'll pay you back for breakfast.
                       (leaning closer)
                   Don't worry. I'm not really that hungry.

      She sheds her coat, having great difficulty with one sleeve.

                It happens more than you'd think. I've
                been paging her, but she hasn't called
                back.

      The lights FLICKER again, storm still raging.

      Halfway into getting her coat off, Claire has second thoughts,
      but continues nonetheless. Gaines is taken off-balance, his
      private space violated.

      Claire finally looks up at Gaines, smiles. A beat.

                           CLAIRE
                Unless you wanted to eat alone.

                          GAINES
                No. It's fine.

      Gaines scrapes the last of his eggs off the plate. Claire sits
      with two pieces of toast, untouched. She takes the scrap of
      the newspaper he tore off, looks at it.

                           CLAIRE
                What do you have against The Family
                Circus?

                             GAINES
                It's evil.

                          CLAIRE
                Besides that.

                           GAINES
                Okay. Location mostly. Bottom right
                corner, just waiting there to suck. It's
                the last thing you read, and it spoils
                everything you read before it.

                           CLAIRE
                You could just not read it.

                           GAINES
                I hate it, yet I'm uncontrollably drawn to
                it. Are you going to...

      He points to her toast. She slides it over. He slathers on a
      thick coat of jelly.

                  first non-fake person I've met here.

                            CLAIRE
                  I'm serious.

                  Professional curiousity. What are you
                  on?

                            CLAIRE
                  Ginseng and lotsa caffeine.

    Gaines leaves money for the check.

    A beat. Claire looks around at the various decorations: a red
    tree by the door, snowflakes on the window, lights blinking on
    the wall.

                You know what I like best about Christmas?
                The surprises. It's like, you get this
                box, and you're sure you know what's in
                it. You shake it, you weigh it, and
                you're totally convinced you have it
                pegged. No doubt in your mind.
                But then you open it up, and it's
                something completely different. Bing!
                Wow! Bang! Surprise! I mean, it's like

158   INT. STAIRWELL TO GAINES' APARTMENT - DAY                             158

      Claire kisses Gaines, pinning him against the wall. Rain BEATS
      against the door.

      She fumbles with his belt. His hand slides under her jacket,
      trying to undo her bra. They take a break from undressing to
      kiss harder.

      Reclining on the steps, Claire tries to push his jeans down
      with her toes. Her foot gets caught in the chain from his
      wallet. Her butt slides down a step. They laugh.

      Her hand hits something hard -- his gun. It's tucked into his
      jacket pocket.

      As they start to work up a rhythm, Huxley the cat comes down
      the steps, curious. He brushes against them, unnoticed.
      Finally, he MEWS.

                           GAINES
                    (stopping)
                How did you get out?

      He looks to the top of the stairs, where a MAN is watching
      them.

      It's Victor.

      He has the silver .45 drawn on them. Gaines looks down to the
      door at the bottom. Vic Jr. is blocking it. They're trapped.
      Claire looks around, trying to figure out what's happening.

167A INT. GAINES' LIVING ROOM - DAY                                             167A

      Gaines draws a map for Victor on the coffee table.

                              GAINES

     INT. APARTMENT - LATER

     Sitting in the green chair, Simon makes an `X' on his bicep
     with a marker. He feels for the bone.

                          SIMON
               It's all flesh here, it should be okay.

     Gaines and the Vics stand around him. In the background,
     Claire is dubious and horrified.

     Vic Jr. puts Todd's gun to the `X.' Gaines hands Simon a shirt
     to mop up the blood.

                         SIMON
               Right, great.

     On some sick level, he's really into this.

     Vic Jr. gets ready to shoot. Everyone subtly backs away,
     bracing for the gunshot. Three. Two. One.

     But there's no bang.                                                         *

INT. HALLWAY - DAY [CONTINUOUS]

Claire shuts the door behind her. As she's headed for the
steps, we hear a GUNSHOT. She flinches but keeps walking.

169   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                               169

      Ronna wakes up, a bit at a time, an IV dripping overhead. We
      hear carolers SINGING in the distance.

      Her nose crinkles, her tongue finds her lips. Finally a
      swollen eye opens, looks around. A MEXICAN FAMILY is gathered
      around the other bed in the room, the father dressed as Santa
      Claus.

      Ronna sees the IV dangling from her arm. She sits up with
      difficulty, a head rush. She tries to get her bearings, but
      genuinely doesn't know how she got here.

      After a beat, she rips off the tape and carefuly pulls the
      needle out of her arm.

      down.


169C INT. SUPERMARKET AISLE - DAY                                           169C

      Ronna ties her apron as she heads to the front, limping a bit.


169D INT. SUPERMARKET / CHECKOUT LANE - DAY                                 169D

      Claire finishes bagging groceries. Looks up to see Ronna
      coming to open the next register.

                           RONNA
                Hey.

      Claire doesn't say anything, a pointed silence.

      Ronna keys in, checks the drawer. Claire returns to her
      register. Ronna tries to make eye contact, but no luck.

                  Okay, real mature.

    Claire continues to ignore her, turning her back. She

                  But it wasn't exactly a banner night for
                  me, either.

    Claire stops, disbelieving -- if Ronna only knew. She turns on
    her, then back to the register, holding it in. But she just has
    to face her to say...

      A stray   black cat scratches through a pile of foam peanuts,
      looking   for bugs. Another cat crawls up the body of Mannie,

                   Kissed. A little. What?

                             RONNA
                   Hello! He's a drug dealer.

      Claire doesn't want this to go any further. Fortunately, just
      then...

                                CLAIRE
                   Found `em.

      She shakes the mud and grime off, then throws them to Ronna.
      Mannie lies back on the trunk, droopy.

      She puts him in the car, holding his head like he's a criminal
      on "Cops."

                  I'll drive.

      Ronna hands her the keys over the roof of the Beast, sunlight

      of them.

                  And twenty left over. Maybe I'll open a

      GETTING IN...

      Claire starts the car. Mannie leans up from the back seat.

                             MANNIE
                  So what are we doing for New Year's?

      Ronna smiles.

                  Merry Christmas, Mannie.

175   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY                                                175

      Simon awakes to POUNDING at the front door. He stands and
      turns, disoriented, no idea when or where he is. He finally
      finds a clock -- it's 4:14 in the afternoon.

      More POUNDING at the door. Simon half-crawls to the window,
      looking out to see who's at the door.

      HIS P.O.V.

      From this angle, all we can see is the sleeve of a man's
      jacket.

                              SIMON
                       (tentatively)
                   Who is it?

      He ducks, expecting a hail of gunfire.

                                MALE VOICE [O.S.]
                   It's Todd.

      A beat, then Simon finally drops his panic. He keeps the gun
      in hand as he pulls the chair away from the doorknob and slowly
      undoes the lock. He leaves the chain on.

      Looking out through the crack, we see Gaines, alone.

                              SIMON
                   Jesus, Todd. Thank God.
                       (undoes chain)
                   You won't believe the shit I've been
                   through...

      Without a word, Gaines grabs him by the collar and SMASHES him,
      one punch to the face. Simon falls in a dazed lump to the
      floor. We stay down with him as we watch Gaines walk away.

      Simon blinks and sniffles as we once again

                                                                           FADE OUT.

176   INT. APARTMENT PARKING GARAGE - DAY                                   176

      Adam and Zack scrub the Miata's upholstery with brushes and
      various cleaners, trying to get the bloodstains out. Zack
      stops for a moment, watching Adam. Adam looks up, what?
      Nothing. A quiet beat, the first moment of genuine affection
      between them.

      Suddenly we hear a BEEPING. We can't tell where it's coming
      from.

      Following the sound, Adam finds a mud-encrusted beeper wedged
      between the seat and the center console. He looks up to Zack,
      then checks the number.



                                                                     FADE OUT.

                Somethin' about it just didn't add up.
                So last night I went back to the pier
                to do some investigating of my own.
                Turns out there are two boats named the
                Princess. Only, one just got back from
                two weeks at sea -- Sal Dominico's
                boat. It got me thinkin' -- if Chase
                really did know Carmen was on to him,
                how come he didn't tell Lucas, or
                Gamble, or Myerson? Why would he drive
                up to Pinecliff by himself? And why
                would you still have his briefcase?
                    (beat)
                Answer me that, Danielle. If you have
                an answer.

      MUSIC rises, a scene cut.

      New MUSIC leads into...

                           ZACK
                I'm not the man you're looking for.

                           ADAM
                We both know you were on the pier. You
                saw what happened to Carmen.

                           ZACK
                Don't forget, detective. I was cleared
                of all charges.

                           ADAM
                I don't care how many high-priced lawyers
                you bring in. Eden Valley will never
                stand for your kind of scum.
