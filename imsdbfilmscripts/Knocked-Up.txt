          BEN STONE, 23, cute in a chunky Jewish guy sort of way, boxes one
          of his roommates, MARTIN. His other roommates, JAY and JASON fight

           We see Ben and Jay fighting. At one point they fight with gloves
          which are on fire, balancing on a plank over a dirty pool.
           Ben now has a fishbowl filled with weed smoke over his head.
          There is a smoking joint in his mouth, making the bowl get
          cloudier and cloudier. He starts coughing hysterically and takes
          it off.

           A boom box is playing. The boys are now free style rapping. It
          is terrible but they are having a blast. Pot is being smoked.
          Beer is around.

          say, "Look, just cut the shit."But
          everybody works for `em. They're all
          on the payroll. They're all sucking
          the teat! Nobody sits `em down, eye-to-
          eye, one-on-one, and says... "Cut the
          shit." And all these stars just to
          fuck it up. That's what they do. They
          fuck my day up! And it pisses me off!
          And now I'm sweating.

           Thanks for coming in, Alison. Well, we
           wanted to talk to you today because we
           had a little debate on the conference
           call with New York about you.

           You were talking about me?

                          JACK
           We were wondering aloud to one another
           whether or not you would be good for
           on-camera.

          Tough job.

                          JACK
          About the work, most immediately,
          there's going to be some things that
          you're going to be able to get that
          other people in the office don't get.

          We can't legally ask you to do that.

          We didn't say lose weight.

          No.

          Just like toned and smaller.

                          JACK
          Don't make everything smaller. I don't
          want to generalize that way. Tighter.

                          JILL
          We don't want you to lose weight. We
          just want you to be healthy.

           You know, by, by eating less. We would
           just like it if you...go home and step
           on the scale and write down how much
           you weigh and subtract it by, like,
           twenty.

          give you a play-by-play of my memory.
          I almost had the condom on my dick. It
          was on the cusp and then you said,
          "Just do it, already."

                          ALISON
          I didn't mean do it without a condom.
          I mean "do it" like "hurry up," like
          "get fucking going!"

                          BEN
          Well, I assumed you were wearing a
          patch, or like a dental dam or one of
          those fuckin' butterfly clips or
          something like that.

          it's the thinnest condom on earth I
          have on? I'm a fuckin' inventor? I
          made a dick-skin condom? He hollowed

           the amniotic sac. And right there, in

           That's the heartbeat. Yeah, it looks

           Look, the real point is not to get
           yourself in this position. That's what
           you have to realize. You gotta know
           all the tricks. Like, for example, if
           a woman's on top, she can't get
           pregnant. It's just gravity.

           Right. If it grows in the ground, it's
           probably okay.

                          BEN
           I guess it worked. You told me not to
           smoke pot all those years. And then I

           whole time.

           Not the whole time. Just in the

           Not that much.

           Alison, I'm sure this isn't how you
           pictured it being exactly and it's not
           how I wanted it. That is why I'm
           presenting you with this empty box.
           It's a promise, Alison. A promise that
           one day I will fill this with a ring
           that you deserve, a beautiful ring. I
           can't afford it yet. I've picked it
           out, though. It's at De Beers and it's
           really nice. So, basically, I'm asking
           you, will you marry me? Because I'm in
           love with you.

           means. It's so new and it's so
           exciting. It's great. I don't know.
           We've only known each other for
           seventeen weeks.

           Look, I thought you felt weird that
           we're having a baby and we're not
           engaged. I'm going to get off my knee.
           It hurts.
          Ben sits next to Alison on the bed.

           I'm okay with that. We're just doing
           what we can. I don't want us to put
           any more pressure on ourselves than we
           have.

           No. I just wanted to do right by you.

           Ben proposed to me. He did. It was
           really sweet. I feel a little bad. He
           was wearing this great button-down. He
           tucked it in. He got down on one knee.
           He didn't have an actual ring, though,
           just an empty box but he had this
           whole spiel about when he has the
           money, he'll buy me the ring I
           deserve.

           so down on themselves they have to

           in good reception areas.

           Maybe he's working late. Maybe he's
           trying to sign a new band. I can't
           imagine Pete doing that.

           I can't.

                          ALISON

           I'm sorry, can we change positions?
           I'm going to crush the baby.

           That's ridiculous!

           No, it's not. It has no shell.

           Millions of people have sex when
           they're pregnant! It just works!

           Just get over it.

                          BEN
           I can't do it. Can you just get on
           top? All I can see if our baby, poked
           in the face by my penis.

                          ALISON
           Trust me, you're not even close. Okay,
           fine.
          Alison moves on top. Alison abruptly stops.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           I can't do this. I can't focus like
           this. I look disgusting from this
           angle. I can feel you looking at my
           chins.

                          BEN

           And my boobs are all like, squishy and
           they're flopping around. I can feel it
           and it's distracting. It's all
           National Geographic.

           No. I do not want you to fuck me like
           a dog.

                          BEN
           I'm not fucking you like a dog. It's
           doggie style. It's just the style.
           I'm, it's not like a dog. We don't
           have to go outside or anything.
          Ben and Alison lie down side by side, Ben is behind.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Here we go. Is it good?

           Should I go slower?

           Harder.

                          BEN
           Just tell me when you're close.

                          ALISON
           Just go harder.

           What happened?

                          BEN
           The baby. It kicked my hand.

                          ALISON
           It always kicks.

                          BEN

           Not like this. No, this was a warning
           kick.

                          ALISON
           Just keep going.

                          BEN
           This was a bad kick.

                          BEN
           Look. My dick must be like an inch
           away from its face and it's coming,
           just coming in at its face. What if it
           kicked because it didn't like it? I
           can't do that to our baby. That's the
           first thing it's going to see.

                          ALISON
           What are you talking about?

                          BEN
           It's having the baby between us, it
           just makes it weird. I'm sorry. It
           just freaks me out a bit. It's a
           little weird.

           That was horrible! That was so
           horrible.

           a pretty incredible person.

                          MARTIN
           Nice to meet you.
          Martin holds out his hand to shake Alex's. She removes one hand
          from covering her breast to shake his hand. Jonah immediately
          covers her breast with his hand.

           I'm sorry okay?

                          ALISON
           Yeah, because you were getting high
           off your huge bong. How am I supposed
           to be comfortable with the idea that
           you can take care of me and the baby
           if you are always getting high?

                          BEN
           You want me to stop smoking pot
           because there's an earthquake once
           every ten years? That makes no sense,
           Alison. You're being irrational. Just
           relax. We're all scared. Oh, shit, the
           cops.
          A cop car rolls by. Ben throws his bong behind him and it SHATTERS
          on the payment.

           You know it's times like this I'm glad
           I don't own nice things. It's a big
           mess, but there's only like fifty
           bucks worth of shit here. That's kind
           of the good thing. You know, my dad
           told me, "Don't move to Northridge."
           But you figure, what are the chances
           of that happening twice, you know?
          Alison picks up a huge sword.

           doesn't get condemned. That would
           suck.
          Alison finds a shopping bag with the baby books they bought. None

          It's a bloody mucusy discharge. But it
          only comes out right before the baby's
          going to come, so if that hasn't
          happened, we have time. We can make it
          to the hospital. It's no problem.

           No, no. I mean, granted, gynecology's
           only a hobby of mine, but it sounds to

           Daddy. So I listened to the most
           literal translation of that and I just
           did it, already. What would you do?
           Don't tell Mommy, but it was the
           smartest thing I ever did, listening
           to her, because now you're here. Isn't
