          At first only darkness, then the rising sun paints in an
          endless savanna from horizon to horizon. We hear savage drums
          beating in the distance coming from some unknown place.
                         
          The sun clears the horizon. Suddenly it changes amazingly:
          the white disc goes through a rapid series of color
          transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible
          BLOOD RED. From it shoots a RED LIGHTNING BOLT.
                         
          The sky echoes with THUNDER.
                         
          We hear a HOWLING ethereal wind, but not a twig of the brush
          stirs as bolt after bolt of RED LIGHTNING rips the sky, with
          each one a TITLE or CREDIT appearing.
                         
          Under FINAL CREDIT snow is beginning to fall on the burning
          blood-red savanna.

          I's a Twin Otter with the logo of some commuter airline. It
          buzzes along over pleasant countryside, through a sky that's
          almost unnaturally serene and filled with fleecy white clouds.

          There are just two passengers in the cabin. One is DALE ARDEN,
          a great looking dark-haired girl sitting by herself and
          reading a book entitled "KARATE FOR THE SINGLE GIRL.... A
          Guide to Survival In The City." A few rows forward, near the
          open door into the pilots' compartment, is FLASH GORDON.
          He's studying a football play-sheet, one of those diagrammed
          things with X's and 0's for the players and dotted-line arrows
          indicating the directions of movement.
                         
          Suddenly the plane makes a violent bump. It almost knocks
          the book from DALE'S hand. She looks out the window with
          sudden fright, tossing hair out of her eyes, in a gesture
          that's habitual to her in moments of stress.
                         
          There's nothing to see outside but the pretty clouds. She
          looks forward again and watches FLASH standing up easily,
          leaning in t..e cockpit doorway to speak to the PILOTS.

          ethereal wind rising which we heard in the opening. Slowly

          race faster, faster, until they are actually streaming past

          high in the air above the structure are several silvery helium-
          filled balloons, secured by wires. As we move closer, we
