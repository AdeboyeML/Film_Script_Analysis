          Did you know there are more people with
          genius IQ's living in China than there
          are people of any kind living in the
          United States?

          it is true.

          What would account for that?

                         MARK (V.0.)
          Well first of all, a lot of people live
          in China. But here's my question:

          INT. CAMPUS BAR - NIGHT

          MARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of
          any physically intimidating attributes masks a very
          complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye
          contact- and sometimes it's hard to tell if he's talking to you
          or to himself.

          ERICA, also 19, is Mark's date. She has a girl-next-door face
          that makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the
          conversation she already knows that she'd rather not be there
          and her politeness is about to be tested.

          The scene is stark and simple.

                         MARK
          How do you distinguish yourself in a
          population of people who all got 1600 on
          their SAT's?

                         ERICA

          Okay, well.. they're bigger than me.
          They're world class athletes. And a
          second ago you said you like guys who row
          crew so I assumed you'd met one.

                         ERICA

          year it's on. I'm not gonna do the farm

          Suppose we're given a computer with a 16-
          bit virtual address and a page size of
          256 bytes.
          A GIRL scribbles something on a piece of paper. Then hands it
          to the student next to her and nods that it should be passed
          over to MARK. While that's happening--

          The system uses one-level page tables,
          which start at address 0x0400. Maybe you
          want to have DMA. on your 16-bit system,
          who knows? The first few pages are
          reserved for hardware flags, etc.
          MARK opens the note., It reads "Asshole".

          In the row behind them and a few seats over are two beautiful
          Asian students.--ALICE and JENNY. They're a little overly made-
          up for a lecture. JENNY, the one sitting closest to EDUARDO,
          is wearing a short skirt with a white shirt: open one button
          too far down the front and we can see a hint of the red bra
          she's wearing underneath.

          CAMERON and TYLER, in dark suits, are waiting to see the
          president of Harvard,
          The President's office is in one of the two oldest university
          buildings in the country, and the SECRETARY sitting at the
          desk i ven older. You get the sense that she thinks Harvard
          would be d -better place if it weren't for all, these students.
          She looks at them and the boys give her a polite smile and a
          small nod before she goes back to her work.

          LARRY SUMMERS, a large man, is on the phone at his desk in his
          well-appointed office. A fire crackles in the sitting area and
          a 40-ish African-American woman, ANNE, in a pants suit is

          SUMMERS reaches to the top of a pile of papers and pulls a ten-

          Okay. For instance, we wanted Baylor in
          Texas but Baylor already had a social
          network on campus so instead of going
          right after them, we made a list of every
          school within a hundred miles and put
          theFacebook on those campuses first.
          Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were
          seeing their friends on our site and we
          were in.

          we're looking at a stone bridge crossing a perfectly straight
          stretch of water against the backdrop of the medieval town of
          Henley, England--founded in 1179.
          And after a moment of placid quiet--

                         ---BOOSHI
          Two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for
          the final, agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and
          prestigious Henley Royal Regatta.
          The two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge. The
          port-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the
          Ilollandia Roeiclub. The starboard boat is being crewed by a
          pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the "H" of
          Harvard.
          We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing
          section. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot
          -- the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men i n
          blazers and brightly colored floral ties.
          But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. Just
          their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural.
          straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half
          torture test against the best competition they've ever faced.
          And they're neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can't shake the
          Dutch.
          The CROWD is going crazy in their own English way as none of
          them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late.
          Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving
          the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of
          Americans.

          we'll be introduced to him as Cameron and Tyler's father, Next
          to him is their mother, who can barely watch.
          Back on the boats it's just the breathing as the skulls slice
          through the water like jet-powered knives. 50 meters now and
          there's still no daylight between them.
          We see a small trickle of blood from CAMERON's left hand begin
          to stream down his arm.
          25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy--
          even the British aristocracy can't help but get caught ups
          the closest race in the history of the competition. The 'ATH_PT'ï¿½
          is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed--
          the MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position.
          The blood that's covering CAMERON's left arm is being diluted
          by the sweat that's pouring down from his triceps as they dig,
          and pull, and pull, and pull, and---

          POP!
          --the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of
          the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over.
          CAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch
          group holding a giant flag and.jumping up and down. The
          Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up.
          The two DUTCH CREW. MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug
          as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop.
          The MOTHER drops her head-and looks down. The FATHER refuses
          to look away.

          Brilliant race. Never seen a race that
          close. Less than one second, the steward
          tells me.

          My grandfather, Jack Kelly, was one of
          the premiere rowers of his day. I've been
          coming to Henley for 30 years. Never seen
          a race that close. Have you? Have you
          seen a race that close?

          two.

          Yes, that's absolutely right. Less than a

          Seriously, why has the music stopped?
          ASHLEIGH has a point. The music stopped in the addle of
          SEAN's speech and the sound outside from the party just
          doesn't sound like a party anymore.

          flow they always checked their friends'
          status updates, checked to see which of
          their friends had changed their profiles,
          changed their photos and mostly...We
          lived on farms, then we lived in cities
          and now we're gonna live on the internet.

          lights flashing parked in front of the house. Then before he
          can react, the front door flies open--
          POLICE with flashlights walk in--the beams of light streaking
          across the darkened party floor and the faces..
          We HEAR muffled murmurs from the cops of "party's over" and

          One of the policemen casually takes SEAN's hand and sees that
          his palm looks like he just used it to erase a blackboard. The
          cop uses his finger to taste what it is.
