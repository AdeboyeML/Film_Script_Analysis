          1 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 1
                         
           Looking incredibly weary, NICK WATERS, 30's, enters his
           apartment in his business suit. He stumbles into --
                         
                         
          2 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 2
                         
           He drops his briefcase, strips off his jacket, loosens
           his tie and collapses onto the bed like a dead man. PAN
           OVER TO the alarm clock which reads "1:23 AM."

          3 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 3
                         
           The alarm clock now reads "4:59 AM." It switches to
           "5:00" and a BLARING BUZZER goes off. Nick sits up in
           bed, shuts off the buzzer and painfully forces himself
           out of bed. He hurries out of the bedroom, passing the
           saddest, deadest houseplant in history.

           Nick opens his fridge to reveal a wasteland of moldy
           leftover containers and crusty condiments. The orange
           juice container he grabs is empty.
                         
                          NICK
           Damn.
                         
           He opens the freezer. It contains nothing but multiple
           boxes of "Jimmy Dean's Breakfast Bowl -- with Bacon!" He
           pops one in the microwave, then glances over at a framed
           photo of a slightly younger Nick kissing a smiling OLD
           WOMAN on the cheek. The frame reads: "I Y Grandma!"
           Nick sighs sadly.

           Nick sits on the toilet eating his breakfast bowl with a
           fork. He takes some toilet paper from the roll and wipes
           his mouth with it.

           Nick showers while simultaneously brushing his teeth and
           shaving. He loses track and brushes his face with the
           toothbrush.

           Nick hastily grabs work clothes from his messy drawers
           and closet. Clearly, no laundry has been done in a
           while.

           We see Nick looking up at the camera and silently
           mouthing the word "Fuck!" The image freezes and we PULL
           BACK to see Harken holding the remote. Nick stands
           across from him.

           Here's my concern, Nick. You're a
           punctual guy. You understand the
           importance of getting to work on
           time. So that leaves me to wonder
           if there isn't something wrong
           with the internal clock in our
           security system. What do you

           either you're a liar -- which I
           know you're not -- or our system

           you is because we don't have the

           Most killers are first-timers.
           Look, the key to a good murder is
           making it look like an accident.
           Gas leak, brakes failing, suicide,
           that sort of thing. If you do it
           right, you won't even have to be
           there when it goes down.
