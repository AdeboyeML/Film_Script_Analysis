          1 OVER BLACK... 1
          A distinctly SOUTHERN VOICE...

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
          There's a moment of orderly silence
          before a football play begins.
          Players are in position, linemen
          are frozen, and anything's
          possible. Then, like a traffic
          accident, stuff begins to randomly
          collide. From the snap of the ball
          to the snap of the first bone is
          closer to four seconds than five.

          2 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD/GAME FOOTAGE - NIGHT 2

           We're watching footage of the 1985 Redskins/Giants Monday
           Night Football game. Lots of angles, faces, knuckles as the
           two teams line up, Redskins on offense, for the snap of the
           ball. As the play begins --

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
          One Mississippi. Joe Theismann, the
          Redskins quarterback, takes the
          snap and hands off to his running
          back.
          JOE THEISMANN hands off to JOHN RIGGINS, who takes two steps
          forward, then turns and tosses the ball back'to Theismann.
          The footage PAUSES AND PLAYS like a coach breaking down film.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Two Mississippi. It's a trick play,
          a flea flicker, and the running
          back tosses the ball back to the
          quarterback.
          HARRY CARSON, the Giants linebacker sees that Theismann has
          the ball back and races toward him. Theismann steps up and
          to the side and Carson flies past.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Three Mississippi. Up to now the
          play's been defined by what the
          quarterback sees. It's about to be
          defined by what he doesn't.
          LAWRENCE TAYLOR carves a wide circle around the Redskins
          lineman trying to block him.

          The blocker dives frantically. at Taylor's ankles, and misses.
          Taylor leaps, arms raised, filling the sky behind Theismann.
          The image FREEZES.

          Four Mississippi. Lawrence Taylor
          is the best defensive player in the
          NFL and has been from the time he
          stepped onto the field as a rookie.
          The frozen image of Taylor comes to life as he jackknifes
          Theismann's body.
          PLAYERS' FACES react to what they're seeing. Devastating.
          TAYLOR pops up from the pile and jumps around like a madman.

          He will also change the game of

          Now, y'all would guess that more
          often than not the highest paid
          player on an NFL team is the
          quarterback.
          The camera finds MATT HASSELBECK, Seattle's quarterback.

          And you'd be right. What you
          probably don't know is that more
          often than not the second highest
          paid player is, thanks to Lawrence
          Taylor, a left tackle.

          the first check you write is for
          the mortgage and the second is for
          the insurance. The left tackle's
          job is to protect the quarterback
          from what he can't see coming. To
          protect his blind side.

          lot of people are big. He is wide
          in the butt and massive in the
          thighs. He has long arms, giant

          is due to lack of records. He has
          a measured IQ of 80. That's 6th

          seven different institutions,

          around the age of ten when he
          apparently didn't attend school at

          eyed, wearing crisply laundered Abercrombie and Fitch, carry
          their backpacks through the school's arch and converse with
          friends they haven't seen over the summer.
          Michael ENTERS FRAME. Fills it up in fact. He stares at the
          arch. Beneath the school name we read "WITH MEN THIS IS.
          POSSIBLE, WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE". Michael takes a
          deep breath and enters. He carries his "school bag" - a

          Just as before, Michael moves at A DIFFERENT SPEED than those
          around him. Makes sense because he is different. Not only
          the color of his skin but his size, his clothes (short pants
          and T-shirt), his eyes taking in the pavement - all point to
          the fact that he doesn't belong here.
          Small children from kindergarten and first grade give him a
          wide, cautious berth. He's noticed and ogled by everyone.

          pauses and all eyes go to him. Mrs. Boswell does her best to
          stifle a gasp as she first lays eyes on him. Then...

          expecting me to do the problems on
          my own. I have never done homework
          in my life. I go to the bathroom,
          look in the mirror and say, "This
          is not Michael Oher."

          He entitled it "White Walls."

          Sean and Coach Cotton sip coffee while all around them
          students eat their lunches. They are looking at Michael, who
          sits by himself without a tray in front of him.

          Cotton is admiring Michael's size but Sean sees something
          else. He stands, walks over to Michael, who barely looks up.

          prepare you, at least most of you,
          for the rigors of college Freshman

          what is due and when. Read the

          choose one of our literature
          assignments and present a written
          dissection of the piece.

           Michael gets in his stance and on the snap of the ball powers
           forward. We've never seen him so quick, neither has 66 who
           dips a hip to keep from being plowed over. The ploy rights
          66 but the damage isn't over as Michael now has him "in the
           fit" grabbing his jersey, "between the tits." --
          Bobby races through the hole and into the secondary --
          Michael keeps pushing 66 back, picking up speed until 66 is
          airborne save every third step of Michael's when he touches a
          toe to the ground like a ballerina --
          Bobby cuts to the sideline --
          Michael is running full speed with 66 now and he keeps going
          past the sideline--
          Past Collins and the rest of the cheerleaders while --
          Bobby makes the opposite corner and heads for the end zone ---

          separating the field from the parking lot --
          Just as Bobby races into the end zone --
          Michael chucks 66 into the air. 66 hits the fence hard and
           lands in a heap. Michael turns and walks back to the field.
          As he passes Collins she gives him a high five.

          A referee signals touchdown then notices Michael walking back
          and 66 lying slumped at the fence.

          The Referee ignores and returns to the field to assess the
          penalty. 66, now on his feet, limps back onto the field.
          Michael looks at him and 66's eyes go straight to the dirt.

          When they find a body the police

          dead. The fine department at
          Tennessee helps them. They have
          lots of body parts - arms, legs,
          hands - from hospitals and medical
          schools. Do you know where they
          store them?

          the bodies you should be worried

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          It all depends on who you are,
          where you come from. Didn't at
          least one of the six hundred guys
          think about giving up and joining
          with the other side? I mean,
          Valley of Death, that's pretty
          salty stuff.

          Michael walks under the arch for the first time.

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          That's why courage is tricky.
          Should you always do what others
          tell you to do? Sometimes you
          might not even know why you're
          doing something. I mean, any fool
          can have courage.

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          But honor, that's the real reason
          you either do something or you
          don't. It's who you are and maybe
          who you want to be. If you die
          trying for something important then
          you have both honor and courage and
          that's pretty good.

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          I think that's what the writer was
          saying. That you should try for
          courage and hope for honor. And
          maybe even pray that the people
          telling you what. to do have some,
          too.

          recruitment a door might be opened
          that boosters from lots of schools
          in the south will become legal

          without means and funnel them to
          their Alma Maters.
