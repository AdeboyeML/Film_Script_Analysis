                         FADE IN:
          A whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning,
          spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst
          white fluffy clouds. A shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella)
          dances amongst the nimbus.

           TRAVERS (V.O.)
           --Like something is brewing,
           about to begin--
          The shadow's direction becomes purposeful - taking us down
          through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small
          town in the distance.

          Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large,
          bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens.
          There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts
          the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large
          park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from
          flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod.
          She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face
          to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her
          concentrated face. This is the young P.L. TRAVERS (whom we
          will also know as GINTY.)

          Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of
          a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind
          becomes real.

          P.L. TRAVERS sits in her rocking chair (in the same position
          as above) arms clasped tightly around her body, face to the
          sky. Older, beautiful; striking blue eyes aid her air of
          stiff and steely determination.
          Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled. Buddha
          smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the
          walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with
          men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit
          on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding.
          Despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful,
          white.
          Downstairs the doorbell rings.
          Pamela closes her eyes, breathes.
          It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts. She stands up,
          smooths down her skirt with flat palms. Breathes.

          switches him off.

          Pamela lies in bed awake, staring at the ceiling, she shakes
          her head - trying to free it of whatever is trapped in there.
          The moonlight casts a shadow of Mickey on the wall beside her
          bed.

          Pamela waits under the hotel awning, dressed immaculately,
          not a hair out of place. The limo pulls up to the curb and
          Pamela groans as she sees Ralph jovially jump out of the car
          and rush round to open the passenger door.

          THREE MEN in suits wave at the limo as it drives through the
          enormous gates of Disney's Burbank Studio and pulls up in a
          very twee forecourt.
          They are: DON DAGRADI (45) and the SHERMAN BROTHERS, ROBERT
          (34), he leans on an old worn cane and RICHARD (31), who has
          a bright, sunny, almost cartoon-ish face.

          her from the vehicle but she pushes it away.

          A couple of Disney characters (Donald and Goofy) bounce up to
          the golf cart, waving brightly. Goofy opens his arms to
          Pamela for a hug and she recoils in horror.

          We hear a man's cough before a beaming Walt Disney, in the

          outstretched.

          Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, and makes her way
          serenely towards the man, who rushes down the corridor to
          greet her.

          Pamela doesn't know what to do with this amount of
          enthusiasm. She extends a formal hand before he manages to
          get her in an embrace.

          seat in front of Walt's desk instead, glancing at the sign
          above it: We Can Make Them Live. Walt perches on the edge of

          spits it back into his cup surreptitiously, then coughs

          perfectly still until the limo pulls up and Ralph gets out,
          patiently waiting beside the car so as not to disturb her.
          Pamela, opens her eyes and Ralph nods hello. He opens the
          back door for her and she climbs in.

          Pamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator. She spies
          the bar again, a few people chatting over cocktails. The
          elevator doors open but she chooses to go and sit at the bar
          instead.

          Pamela looks around at the other women in the bar, all
          glamorous, coiffured, very different to the practical Mrs
          Travers.
          The tea pot arrives.

           Thank you. Tea is a balm for the
           soul don't you agree?
          But the barman has already moved on to another patron.
          Time moves swiftly, the teapot is drained, the customers come
          and go. The barman talks with another customer further along
          the bar. Nobody notices Pamela. In this setting she looks
          like a little old lady, awkwardly perched on a stool, staring
          into her empty cup.

          in front of the huge double doors to the bank. An upright,

          Ginty and RANDOLPH BELHATCHETT are startled for a second by a
          loud crash. Their eyes flit to the glass door of Travers'

          Travers somehow loses his footing before reaching the steps
          and topples off the stage. There's an audible, horrible snap
          as he lands in an undignified pile. But, despite his ugly

          The agony as Ginty watches the shaking hand. Finally, the

          she's held in check. Here are the first signs of the Pamela

           tiara for the premiere?

           Oh, I'm not going.

           Why not?

                          PAMELA

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle her cabin
          baggage into an overhead locker. The same flight attendant
          from the top of the film appears.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
           Can I help you?

                          PAMELA
           I'm perfectly capable thank you.
          The flight attendant recognizes her with something akin to
          horror.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
           Suit yourself-- ma'am.

           CAPTAIN (O.S.)
           Ladies and gentlemen, good
           afternoon and welcome aboard this
           flight to Los Angeles. Just a few
           announcements before we begin our
           taxi for takeoff--
          Pamela takes the seat next to the window, she looks out at
          the tarmac.
          She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes
          again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands
          neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.

          Walt enters the outer office walking briskly towards his own

                         TOMMIE'S DESK
          Tommie sits, arms crossed and stares, half bemused at Walt.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           What?
          Tommie nods toward his office. Pamela is sitting in a chair,
          back to them.

                          PAMELA

                          WALT
           Mrs Travers! How wonderful to see
           you. What brings you to--

                          PAMELA
           I'm here for my premiere.

           I didn't receive my invitation, but
           I just assumed the American postal
           service had fallen down on the job
           as per usual.
          She smiles sweetly.

                          WALT
           I'll have a-- uh, replacement sent
           to your hotel right away.

                          PAMELA
           That's very kind, Mr Disney. I knew
           you wouldn't have forgotten me.

                          WALT
           Pam, how could I?

                          PAMELA
           How indeed? You did, after all,
           assure me that I wouldn't be
           disappointed.

                         

          INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

          The porter lets Pamela into her room, and doesn't even bother
          hovering for a tip.
          Pamela turns and it's like deju vu - the flowers, the
          chocolates, the champagne, a VIP invitation to the premiere
          of Walt Disney's Mary Poppins. And, of course, the ubiquitous
          stuffed Mickey Mouse.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO MICKEY)

          EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - FORECOURT - NIGHT

          Pamela looks wonderful in a long white gown with turquoise
          silk gloves to her elbows and matching wrap falling from her
          shoulders.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO DOORMAN)
           Would you call me a taxi please?

                          DOORMAN
           Absolutely.
          The doorman goes to find her a cab and in his absence a limo
          pulls up to the kerb. Pamela doesn't dare get her hopes up
          but the door swings open and there he is, her favorite person
          in America.

                          RALPH
           Had a feeling a certain friend of
           mine might be needing me tonight.

                          PAMELA
           Ralph!
          She rushes to him and they give each other a friendly hug.

                          RALPH
           You look like a million bucks!
           Let's get you to the ball.
          He opens the back door for her and she climbs in.

                         

          EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

          It's spectacular! Disney's biggest Hollywood opening. Bulbs
          flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red
          carpet. Ushers are dressed as English bobbies. Reporters
          stand on podiums in colourful suits, Penguins dance their
          hearts out in front of the theater. Pearly Kings and Queens
          play for the onlookers. Crowds and crowds of fans scream
          every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and
          posters in the air. Every Disney character imaginable bounces
          up and down the lines of well-wishers, hugging them, dancing
          for them, signing their booklets. Hollywood Blvd is
          completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest
          party you could ever go to.

                         

          INT. LIMO - NIGHT

          Ralph takes the car slowly through the crowds. Onlookers
          press their faces against the windows trying to make out who
          is inside. Pamela is nervous, everyone else has someone with
          them but Pamela must brave the crowd alone.

                         

          EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD -NIGHT

          The limo stops at the edge of the carpet and Ralph jumps out.
          He rushes round to Pamela's side and helps her from the car.
          Immediately a round of flashes go off and Pamela puts her arm
          up to shield her eyes. It's too much.

                          RALPH
           (in her ear)
           This is your night. None of this
           would be possible without you.
          She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks
          into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic
          whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: "Who is
          that?" "Is that anyone?" Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and
          Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead.
          Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and
          Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment. He holds out his gloved
          hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy
          train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds
          of coloured balloons fly out of it's roof and into the air.

                         

          EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - NIGHT

          Pamela moves through the spangling, glittering, perfect
          toothed Hollywood crowd and no-one pays any attention to her.

                         

          INT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

          The auditorium is jam packed. Pamela is seated in front of
          Walt Disney. Don, the Shermans and their families are in the
          same row as her - Bob Sherman next to her. The lights begin
          to dim. The overture begins--
          We stay close on Pamela as the sounds of the overture fade
          and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of Travers
          old melody's rings in her ears.
          We hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain
          with Pamela.
          She looks around at the faces in the audience - laughing,
          humming, sad, happy, joyous.
          Intercut with images from Pamela's childhood and the voices
          of Bert and Jane -
          Ellie's parrot head umbrella--

                          BERT
           You know, begging your pardon, but
           the one my heart goes out to is
           your father.
          The carousel horses at the Allora fair--

                          BERT (CONT'D)
           There he is in that cold, heartless
           bank day after day, hemmed in by
           mounds of cold, heartless
           money.
          The tuppence and rolling pears--

                          BERT (CONT'D)
           I don't like to see any living
           thing caged up.
          Uncle Albert with Ginty on his back, carrying her river
          soaked mother back to the house--

                          JANE
           Father in a cage?
          Ginty pressing the final bottle into her father's hand--

                          BERT
           They makes cages in all sizes and
           shapes, you know.
          The image of the dead Travers in his bloodstained bed--

                          BERT (CONT'D)
           Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets
           and all.

                          DISSOLVE TO:
          Children in the audience, their little faces tilted upwards.
          Rapt.

           You won't ever leave us will you?

                          JANE
           Whatever would we do without you?

                          MARY POPPINS
           I shall stay until the wind
           changes.
          And then an image from the film:
          George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined
          London street, on his way to be fired from the bank.
          Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction.
          Pamela however has tears coursing down her face. Her
          shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud
          but people are noticing, looking at her.
          Disney leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder. She
          reaches up and grips it tightly, unable to speak.

                          WALT
           It's all right, Mrs Travers. It's
           alright. Mr Banks is going to be
           all right. I promise.
          Pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs. It's
          all pouring from her now, in one immense catharsis.

                          PAMELA
           No, no. It's just that-- I can't, I
           can't abide cartoons!
          We stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the
          film: Let's Go Fly A Kite. The audience around her are
          smiling, laughing, singing along. Pamela, the tears, silent
          now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to
          mouth along with the lyrics.
          And in her head one final image appears.
          Travers gaze falls upon Ginty, outside his bedroom window,
          sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken
          understanding of what is to come, before his close with
          tiredness.

           TRAVERS (V.O.)
           Never. I promise. I will never lose
           you.
