          no, you wanted to keep it in the
          neighborhood. I know Swartz costs a
          little more, but at least they know

          Alabama on a farm. He loved to take
          long walks in the woods with his close

          in the lake.

          eulogy is so bad. She looks to Ryan who looks like "what can I

          .He said he was a nice man, and
          surprisingly well dressed. When Dad
          was eighteen, he left home after an
          argument with his father. He never

          but I do know that after leaving South
          Carolina, sadly he and Bob lost touch
          and never saw each other again. Dad
          went to college where he studied
          accounting, a decision which lead to a
          career in corporate finance... But
          his real passion was for the arts,
          with a particular fondness for
          theatre, dance and musicals. He was a
          charter member of the Negro Ensemble
          Company and contributed regularly to
          the Alvin Ailey School of Dance.
          Oscar's protests are getting louder. Duncan looks back at the

          touches some mementoes he clearly remembers.
          Frank takes out his glasses and notices a manuscript on the desk
          with Aaron's name.

          Aaron hugs Michelle.

          I can't believe I still have to do
          this eulogy... with everything I've
          just found out.
          A beat.

          It doesn't change anything, does it?

                         AARON
          Not a thing.
          Reverend Davis approaches Aaron, looking at her watch and
          appearing flustered.

                         REVEREND DAVIS
          We're going to have to fly through
          this now. I already missed a funeral
          and two Christenings.

                         AARON
          Sure. Let's go.

                         REVEREND DAVIS
          Do you want an open casket?

          AARON/RYAN/NORMAN/JEFF
          No!
          The reverend looks shocked at the reaction, but ignores it. She
          stands up at the front and speaks quickly.

          (she snaps her fingers)
          Hey, you, sit down.
          People settle into their seats. Ryan manages to squeeze in next
          to Martina. He smiles at her, flirtatiously. Cynthia throws
          Ryan a look, and he gets up and goes to sit with her.

          REVEREND DAVIS (CONT'D)
          (speaking very quickly)
          I'd like to apologize on behalf of the
          family for all of the distractions. I
          hope that everyone is settled and
          ready to continue with the service.
          Aaron, the oldest son, would like to
          say a few words about his father.
          Michelle gives Aaron an encouraging look as he makes his way to
          the front.
          Aaron clears his throat and prepares to begin. The room is
          absolutely silent. He takes a deep breath.
          ANGLE ON: The reverend nodding for Aaron to hurry up.
          ANGLE ON: Aaron.

          BANG! BANG! BANG!
          Suddenly, a loud banging emanates from the coffin. Everyone
          stares at it in stunned silence. Jeff looks over to Norman
          whose eyes are as wide as saucers. Aaron looks like a deer
          caught in headlights. He looks at Ryan who gestures to him to
          continue. He nervously struggles on.

          Suddenly the coffin lid flips off and everyone stares in wonder
          as Frank sits up, looking like a crazy person, and babbling
          incoherently.
          Several people scream. Frank opens the other end of the coffin
          and looks at his dead lover.

          Edward! Edward! Edward!
          Ryan, Norman and Jeff try to pull Frank out of the coffin, but
          he's holding onto the corpse.

          No! No!
          Finally they get Frank out and carry him from the room. As he
          passes Cynthia, the photos fall out of his pocket at her feet.
          As Duncan closes the coffin again, Cynthia bends down and picks
          up one of the photographs and stares at it. Her face turns to
          horror as she makes out the image. The noise in the room is
          broken by Cynthia's furious cry. She drops the photos and runs
          at Frank.

          Everyone, including Frank and Cynthia, looks at Aaron, stunned.

          He had his... shortcomings, but he
          took care of his family. He loved his
          family. He loved this house. He
          worked hard. All I wanted today was
          to show him how much we all loved and
          admired him. To give him the respect
          that he deserved... Is that really so
          much to ask? We all get so distracted
          by the... little things in life. We
          forget about the important things.
          Like the fact that we lost a great
          man.
          The mourners look up at Aaron with undivided attention.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          So maybe he loved "Dreamgirls" more
          than most men. We don't know why a
          man makes the choices he makes. But I
          do know that my father made the best
          choices he could make. Life is
          complicated. We're just thrown here
          together in a world filled with chaos

          Cynthia, Frank, Jeff, Norman, Duncan as they are moved by
          Aaron's words.

          He taught us to go for what we wanted
          in life, because you never know how
          long you're going to be here... And
          whether you succeed... or you fail...

          So when you all leave here today, I
          want you to remember Dad for who he
          really was... A decent, loving man
          who never condemned anyone for how
          they lived. Who never cast
          disparaging remarks or held prejudices
          against race, gender... height. If
          only we could all be as giving, as
          generous, as understanding as my
          father... Even dead, my father has
          more character than everyone in this
