2   INT. DAY.    FBI HEADQUARTERS

    c arpet-- Fed eral blue .
    CLENDON HOGUE, 40s, barrel chest, shrewd eyes over half-moon glasses,
    PRESIDES behind a vast desk. The impressive mien of earned
    authority. Before him:
    JULES BONOVOLONTA, late 40s, Green Beret veteran, SUPERVISOR, 140
    pounds of pugnacity and gristle. Ex-street agent cramped by
    headquarters.

                           LEBOW
                A reliable wire.
                           JULES
                A fiction writer.
    Hogue peruses SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS of Sonny Red and Sonny Black. Then
    reads the INFORMANT'S REPORT.
                          MARSHALL
                is that the 209, sir?
                          LEBOW
                There's going to be a war between
                Sonny Red and Sonny Black--it's
                all over the streets.
                           JULES
                Clarence, you couldn't find the
                streets with an asphalt detector.

                 That's doesn't mean it's tonight.
                            LEBOW
                 Even if it's not tonight--and I ' m
                 not saying it's not tonight--it
                 could still be tonight because it
                 could be any night.
                        JULES
             Fuck you, Clarence.

             An agent. Undercover.
                        HOGUE
             Then why are you depending on an
             informant? What does the agent
             say?

             When's the last time you spoke to
             him?

             He checks in every three weeks?

             He checks in when he checks in,
             sir.

                  You got two cars. One's longer.
                  All things being equal, the
                  longer car is the one gonna get
                  there first.
                             LEFTY
                  Ain't the question all things
                  being equal. One's a Cadillac
                  and one's a Lincoln.
                             NICKY
                  The one's longer gets there
                  first. That's scientific fact.

                  What's better, a Lincoln or a

                  I asked you already.
                             LEFTY
                  That's right. And I told you
                  there's no comparison.

                enough from the Germans in the

28   INT. THE PAST.      PISTONE HOME
     Donnie SHAVES his moustache in the bathroom. Sounds of the FRONT
     DOOR unlocking and then closing downstairs.

     She enters the bathroom as he wipes the shaving cream off his face.
     He looks up, half his moustache SHAVED OFF. Her face FALLS.

                 I liked your moustache. It's the
                 only thing I liked about this
                 thing of yours.

     Lefty glares at Donnie--ACCUSES him with his eyes: who told you to
     come in here? Donnie sits down--something in the placid atmosphere
     that tells him: this is how it happens. Nicky peers over as Boobie
     writes on the SCOREPAD.

                   The loansharking predicates are
                   very specific. It's really

70   INT. NIGHT.    PISTONE HOME--MINNESOTA
     The door unlocks, and Donnie tiptoes into the house. The middle of
     the night. Goes into the kitchen for a snack. Opens the
     refrigerator.
     A BIRTHDAY CAKE
     half-eaten, with the elided legend, "HAPPY SWEET SIXTEEN, TERRY." He
     missed the party.
                           DONNIE
                Shit.

71   INT. NIGHT.   TERRY'S ROOM
     Terry lies awake. A shaft of light hits her face as Donnie opens the
     door.
                          DONNIE
               Terry ? You awak e?
                           TERRY
               Yeah.

               I ' m sorry I missed your party.
                         TERRY.
               It's okay. Uncle Bob flew in.
                          DONNIE
               I ' m not the kind of guy that
               breaks his promises.
                           TERRY
               That's what Mom said.
                          DONNIE
               I'm sure that's only part of what
               Mom said.
                         TERRY
               That's between you two.

               She was worried something
               happened to you.

                do your best, work hard, never
                quit. That's how I live my life.
                I just had no way of knowing it
                would go this far.

               You're getting grown-up now. I
               want you to understand.
                          TERRY
               Half the kids in school don't

                          DONNIE
               You have a father, Terry.
                          TERRY
               That's not what I meant.
                          DONNIE
               Maybe I'm not there for the good
               times, but I'm there if you need
               me.
                          TERRY
               I know that, Dad.
                         DONNIE
               It's just another six months.
     "Another six months." That phrase. Like a knife in her heart.
                         TERRY
               Whenever. It's no big deal.
                         DONNIE
               Come here. Give me a hug.
     Terry sits up, hugs her f ather. St ruggles ag ainst the tears. An d

     Donnie convenes a FAMILY MEETING over breakfast. Terry, Kerry and
     Maggie sit, sullen, around the kitchen table. Sherry runs down the
     stairs, sits down.
                           SHERRY
               Sorry I ' m late.
                               DONNIE
               Okay. I called this family
               meeting because there's something
               we have to t alk a bout. I kn ow
               what I'm doing involves a lot of
               sacrifice from everyone, but this
               is something patriotic for the
               country that you can all be proud
               of.
                    (beat)
               I called the meeting because
               we're gonna have to move.
                              TERRY
                  I ' m not moving.
                               DONNIE
               This isn't a democracy, Terry.
               This is a dictatorsh ip. And
               that's my decision. It's getting
               too dangerous.
                          MAGGIE
               Well, I don't want to move
               eithe r, Joe. Mo ve where?
                               DONNIE
               There's too many people here who
               know us.
                         MAGGIE
               Those people are known as
               'friends,' Joe. You told me when
               we started this that we'd be
               moving back close to the family.
               That was the deal.

                  Well, Mr. 'Anderson', you've

               Minnesota's great. Lakes and

     pie hat, is helped from the car by his entourage of FLORIDA WISEGUYS.

75       EXT. THE PAST.       BOAT
         Sonny and Donnie stand in the bow, look out over the water.
                                   SONNY
                     You can live your life like a man
                     d own here. I bet if you took m y
                     blood pressure right now it'd be
                     down o ne hundre d per cent . Sonny
                     Red's got Jersey and we got
                     Florida, and Florida's better
                                                            '
                     than Jersey, right?
                                DONNIE
                     He can stick Jersey up his ass.
                                   SONNY
                     This is a great idea I had,
                     Florida.
                                   DONNIE
                     Once Lefty arranged it with
                     Trafficante--
                                   SONNY
                     Fuggedaboudit. What Lefty don't
                     understand is guys like
                     Trafficante, their day is done.

                  A 70 year old brain can't compare
                  with guys like us, because where
                  he's got like 20 more years
                  experience .in his day, we got 50
                  more years in our day. And we're
                  l iving in our day. C apeesh?

                  much money they're making?
                              DONNIE
                  Some young guy.
                            SONNY
                  Lefty's a dynamite-guy, no
                  q uesti on. But y ou kn ow, t he
                  thing with him is. . . he's trying
                  to help you but he hurts you. He
                  gets those two or three wines in
                  him...
                            DONNIE
                  You just gotta take it with a
                  grain of salt.
                         SONNY
               The books open up in December,
               I'm gonna propose you. You know                         <
               what that means?
                            DONNIE
               Fuggedaboudit. Be a made guy?
               That would be unbelievable.
                            SONNY
               What I'm saying is this. You
               don't have to report to Lefty no
               more. From now on you can report
               to me.
     CLOSE ON--DONNIE
     as he calculates the advantages and dangers of his new offer...
     IN THE STERN
     Lefty broods, nurses a spritzer. Watches Donnie with eyes full of
     anger and resentment. Boobie sidles up to him.

                  Can I ask you something? Did you
                  get this boat or did Donnie get
                  this boat?
                            LEFTY
                  Some broad down here he used to
                  know, it belongs to her brother.
                            BOOBIE
                  He knows a lot of broads, Donnie.
                            LEFTY
                  If Donnie had a dollar for every
                  broad of all his broads, he could
                  buy the fucking boat himself.
                            BOOBIE
                  If Donnie's got so many broads,
                  how come we never seen none of
                  them?
                            LEFTY
                  He uses them broads like Kleenex.
                  He won't spend a dollar to take
                  a lady out.
     Boobie drinks, takes a beat.

                  guns from you,    if you're offing
                  guns, but you    never see him be
                  the one offing    guns?
     Lefty thinks a beat.

     Donnie takes off his cowboy boots. Takes the Nagra out of his boot
     Rewinds the tape. Plays it.
                            DONNIE (O.C.)
                  I just got some things I gotta
                  take care of, back in the city.

               When you come back, you represent
               me in Florida.
     He SNAPS it off. Hides it back in his cowboy boot.

77   INT. DAY.     LAGUARDIA AIRPORT
     Donnie and Lefty wait with the crowd at the BAGGAGE CAROUSEL.
                            LEFTY
                 I'm telling you, it's good to be
                 back in New York. That fucking
                 Florida baked everybody's brain.
                 when Sonny gets out of the
                 fucking sun he's gonna realize
                 what a miserable fucking idea you
                 had.
                           DONNIE
                 How long's he gonna stay down
                 there?
                            LEFTY
                 Do I know? (resuming) I never
                 saw so many old people in my
                 life. Who the fuck wants to go
                 to Florida? Sometimes you are
                 one stupid cocksucker, Donnie.
     Donnie FLARES at the word "cocksucker." :

                 You get that fucking bag.
                           DONNIE
                 I'm not getting it.

               its crease. Will you tell your
               kid to stop breathing on me?
                         BRUNO
               I wanna get there in time to set '
               up.

                   waited my whole life, Bruno, you
                   can wait two hours.
      They climb out of the car. Philly Lucky stays put.
                             BIG TRIN
                   What the hell's wrong with you?

      Big Trin flips him the keys.
      TWO WOODEN DOORS

      Philly Lucky starts the oar. Turns on the radio. Frank Sinatra
      sings "Nice Work If You Can Get It." And PULLS AWAY.
      DOWN THE STAIRS
      go Big Trin, Sonny Red and Anthony Bruno, down into the dark, damp
      concrete and sawdust in their nostrils.

      BANG!

      on. Revealing the blasted corpses of Sonny Red and Big Trin...
      BRUNO
      jumps out from behind a cabinet, RUNS out the door. Sonny wheels,
      FIRES. The stairs SPLINTER as the blast lands just under Bruno's

                Those fucking agents could scam
